<i>Tru? </i>
Yes.
<i>It's okay, Tru. </i>
Okay, Mommy.
Before her time, to a person....
- She forgave me.
- What?
- Who?
- Mom.
She forgave me
for not being able to help her...
and she said she's okay.
You have a vivid imagination.
But Mom was murdered, in front of you.
What part of that is okay?
...a wife and mother...
taken before her time.
God, he's so full of crap.
l just wish--
You just wish what?
That l could go back to that day
and help her.
You can't.
None of us can.
"A time to be born,
and a time to die."
Hey, the garbage man says
the elevator's out again.
Elevator's out.
<i>Dominick Barren. </i>
<i>EIizabeth Christianson. </i>
<i>Tru Davies. </i>
Where is she?
<i>Tru Davies. </i>
l've got a drinking game.
lt's called"You graduated from college
and your family didn't show up."
A drinking game, or"Next on Dr. Phil"?
l'm so sorry, Tru. l know
they missed all your track meets, but....
To be expected.
Harrison probably met a girl...
Meredith probably met a client,
and my father....
No acknowledgment of children
from his first marriage.
Thanks, Cameron, but l think l'm out.
- Already? But we just got here.
- What?
lnternship starts tomorrow at the hospital.
l thought l'd make a nice first impression
by not showing up hung over.
Tru? Prof. Evans.
Lindsay, would you stop it already?
She thinks l've got a thing for him.
But l've told her,
professors aren't exactly my type.
Good night, guys.
And congratulations. We made it.
Unbelievable.
Congratulations.
Yesterday, you were an ethics violation...
and today you are a faculty girlfriend.
l meant what l said, Tru. Now that
you graduated, we could go public.
l'm sure the Dean
will be very happy to hear it.
Well, the Dean's opinion
no longer matters.
ln fact, l'm gonna see her tonight
at the faculty banquet.
Maybe it's time l told her about you.
What are you gonna say?
Not a word.
l'm just gonna show her
those Polaroids that l took.
<i>HeIIo, and weIcome to</i>
<i>another</i> Monday Morning Money.
Hello?
<i>Tru, it's your favorite brother. </i>
l'm in a bit of a situation.
What's it this time, Harrison?
Don't tell me you played cards all night.
No, not all night.
Just since 2:00.
Look, whatever you have would help,
$1, 000, $200 even.
<i>It's just a Ioan. </i>
<i>I'm teIIing you, Tru. I am on a streak today. </i>
lf you're on a streak,
why do you need to borrow money?
<i>You know I don't have that kind of cash. </i>
l have to get to the hospital.
But l'll see you tonight, right?
<i>Yeah, right. Sure. </i>
Anyway, l'll go Plan B on this one.
<i>ProbabIy shouId've started there anyway. </i>
<i>And Tru? </i>
l hope it was nice yesterday.
- l would've been there if l could, but--
- l know, Harry.
You lost your funding?
But my internship....What happens now?
l'm sorry, Tru. Really.
l know. You were counting on this job...
for a little cash and credibility
for med school.
There's this other job l heard about.
Now don't get excited,
it may not be the exact right fit.
You were a track star, right?
Well, why don't you run down,
see this guy as soon as you can?
Tell him l sent you.
lt's a good job?
Trust me. People would die for it.
You ever been to a morgue before?
Just once, when l was 12.
Well, that sounds like a story.
Are you sure
you're interested in working here?
Because, l'll be honest, most girls
as pretty as you that come here....
Well, they're dead.
l'll be applying to medical school
in the fall...
and my advisor thought
it might be a good idea.
What?
Your eyeliner. ls that MAC Number 5?
Seven.
Seven. Nice.
The opening is for a forensic
attendant, who retrieves the body...
weighs it, measures it,
attaches the toe tag...
charts the vitals,
and collects the standards.
"Standards"?
Head hair, pubic hair, nail clippings.
And then they prepare the body
for storage.
lt's called the crypt.
lt's where every unnatural death
in the city comes to rest...
waiting for an autopsy.
- You said"unnatural death"?
- Most of them.
Because if there's even a hint
that a death might be unnatural...
murder, suicide, they come here.
- So every crypt....
- Has a body. That's right.
Can you imagine the pain
of losing someone before their time?
Bottom line...
most of these people
shouldn't be dead yet.
Go ahead, you can open one.
<i>I need you to start tonight. </i>
<i>The graveyard shift. </i>
- And you're going to take it?
- l just told you l was.
l mean, if it looks good to medical schools,
who am l to say no?
Look at me. lf l don't get some sleep soon,
l'm gonna get bags under my bags.
You haven't been sleeping again?
Let's not play this game tonight, okay?
l feel good.
Hey, Tru.
Remember when it didn't take her
death anniversary to get us all together?
l'll see you inside.
Mere, you forgot your...
bag.
So, what's Harrison's excuse this time?
A girl? A truckload of DVDs?
A girl with a truckload of DVDs?
Well, l guess we all
deal with the anniversary differently.
- Harrison plays cards.
- You pretend it didn't happen.
And you,
l guess you'd call them old habits.
You went through my bag? Damn it, Tru.
What are you doing?
People like you can't just use once, Mere.
Or didn't they teach you that in rehab?
l'm sorry. Look, l just....
You must be doing something right.
You've got a great career, lots of money--
You know,
maybe Harrison had the right idea.
- He doesn't even pretend anymore.
- Don't walk out, Mere. Please, we can....
Hello.
Harrison? Oh, my God, look at you.
Hospital called and said--
l prayed for a 10 of clubs...
and this is what l get.
A nice reminder
of why l don't believe in God.
Ten of clubs? What happened?
They did this to you?
Those guys you were playing cards with?
l'm coming with you.
No, Tru.
Harrison, look at you.
You had your chance, Tru.
You can't help me now.
Clear.
First one?
Congratulations.
But they're all not as pretty as...
Rebecca Morgan.
What happened to her?
You mean, aside from the cap
in the back of her neck? Nothing.
The neighbors heard a gunshot
around 10:00.
<i>We found her in her apartment. </i>
lt's a nice one- bedroom,
if you know anyone.
Do me a favor.
Hold that bag open, will you?
Do you know who did it?
You're new here,
so maybe nobody told you.
We don't solve the crime.
We just deliver the body.
Anyway, have a good night....
Tru.
Tru? Catchy.
But wait. You're leaving?
<i>Because Davis said</i>
<i>my first night I wouIdn't be aIone. </i>
You won't be.
You'll have 32 friends right next door.
<i>OnIy you can save me. </i>
<i>HeIp. </i>
<i>Tru. </i>
Hello?
Marco?
<i>HeIp. </i>
Very funny, hazing the new girl.
<i>HeIp me. </i>
<i>HeIp me. </i>
<i>Save me. </i>
Help me.
Congratulations.
Yesterday, you were an ethics violation...
and today you are a faculty girlfriend.
But l meant what l said, Tru.
Now that you graduated, we can go public.
What's wrong?
What was l thinking?
l never should have taken that job.
- What job?
- At the morgue.
The graveyard shift.
That place creeps me out.
The morgue? Sweetie, your internship
starts this morning at the hospital.
No, Green's funding was cut.
The job has been eliminated.
l saw him yesterday.
Yesterday was Sunday.
You graduated yesterday.
You had a drink with some friends,
you went to bed with me.
Nobody had to go to work
at a morgue.
lt was just a bad dream,
or one too many margaritas.
Yeah, it just seemed--
By the way...
tonight's the faculty banquet, and
l think it's time the Dean knew about you.
Tonight?
Actually l wasn't gonna say a word.
<i>I was just gonna show her</i>
<i>the PoIaroids that I took. </i>
<i>HeIIo, and weIcome to</i>
<i>another</i> Monday Morning Money.
Hello?
<i>Tru, it's your favorite brother. </i>
l'm in a bit of a situation.
We were through this yesterday, Harrison.
l don't have that kind of money.
What are you talking about?
Look, are you mad
because l didn't go to your graduation?
<i>And your second number...</i>
Four.
<i>Are you Iistening? </i>
<i>...is four. </i>
<i>Tru? </i>
Listen, Harrison,
maybe you shouldn't go back to that table.
Maybe you should walk away now.
Yeah. See you, Tru.
<i>Your third number...</i>
Twenty- nine.
<i>...is 29. </i>
<i>You never met me? </i>
l have never met you.
Then again, l haven't been
going to the gym lately so....
MAC Number 7.
The crypt. This way, right?
You sure you haven't worked
in a morgue before?
So this is the crypt. This is where every....
<i>Is there something I can heIp you with? </i>
Last night,
a woman named Rebecca Morgan died.
She was brought here.
A friend of yours?
Who was on duty last night?
Marco, l think.
<i>No, she never came in. </i>
You said....l mean, someone said...
that the bodies brought here,
they're unnatural deaths.
Some of them, yes.
So those people
shouldn't actually be dead.
Not yet, anyway.
ls it hard to see people dead
before their time? Yes.
<i>But if you're gonna work here...</i>
you've got to accept the fact
that there's nothing you can do about it.
<i>That was a job offer, </i>
<i>in case you missed it. </i>
What happened to her?
The neighbors heard a gunshot at 10:00.
The truth is we're shorthanded...
and you seem
to already know the operation.
l'll take it.
Great.
l'll need you tonight.
Tru?
303 West 23rd Street.
<i>Who is she? </i>
l don't know yet. Hopefully, no one.
<i>Each time I hope</i>
<i>someone is no one...</i>
they always turn out to be someone.
Maybe you'll have better luck.
So anyways, are you really serious
about this job at the morgue?
Because l got to be honest...
l think it's really gonna cut into
our post- college slacking off.
<i>Lindsay, I'II caII you back. </i>
Oh, Tru.
Tru?
She's alive.
For another 10 hours.
<i>HeIIo? </i>
Coffee, please.
You okay?
Yeah.
l'm just having a strange day.
Maybe you'd like something
a little stronger than coffee, then.
Coffee's fine.
The truth is l shouldn't complain.
l have this friend
who's about to have a worse day...
and she doesn't even know it yet.
- This is gonna sound crazy, but--
- Hold on.
Hello? What are you....
Aaron, we've been through all this.
No, l can't do this right now.
<i>Goodbye, Aaron. </i>
Some people just don't know
when it's over.
Rebecca, l'm gonna tell you something.
How do you know my name?
We know each other?
That friend about to have the bad day--
Hey.
You know what, never mind. My bad.
<i>HeIp me. </i>
l don't know how to say this,
so l'm just gonna say it.
- You're gonna die today, Rebecca.
- What did you just say?
You have to trust me.
Maybe we can stop it. We have nine hours.
- You asked for my help. Now l need yours.
- l asked for your help? You're crazy.
Just tell me
why someone would want to hurt you.
Gary?
Why would they want....
Can you come here?
What's up?
There's this girl
saying strange things.
What girl?
The one right at the bar.
Come outside.
What did she say?
She said l was gonna die today.
What? Where?
lt would've been perfect with Rebecca...
if only l could've convinced her
to fall in love with me.
lt's funny. Tru, right?
She never mentioned you before.
Well, l just started there. Weekends.
Gary thought we needed some extra help.
What kind of trouble do you think she's in?
lt's hard to say. l know it's a long shot...
but do you know anyone
who would want to hurt her?
No, although she didn't need any help
in that department.
She beat herself up
over the smallest things.
Bad day, blow an audition.
- Actors, sure.
- Dance. She's a dancer.
Well, thanks.
Like l said,
she'd kill me if she knew l was here so....
lt's funny. A girl's in trouble,
and everybody suspects the ex- boyfriend.
Aaron, no, that's not what--
No, l'm saying lucky for me
l'm not the only one.
His name's Elliot Winters.
Do you have a résumé for me,
or should l just call security?
Actually, l'm not here for an interview.
l'm here about Rebecca.
- Rebecca?
- Rebecca Morgan.
l'm not passing judgment. Obviously--
My daughter's dance teacher.
Why would you....
Okay, l don't understand.
So you two weren't....
Was she interested? Sure.
Was l flattered? Absolutely.
But those pictures over there
aren't for show.
That's my life.
l don't know what she told you...
but sometimes being a good friend
means not listening so closely.
<i>Anyway, Iots to do. </i>
<i>So why are you so worried</i>
<i>about Rebecca? </i>
Because she's gonna die today.
Don't worry about calling security.
l'll show myself out.
Are you sure you're okay?
My God, that actually sounds
like genuine concern.
Wait a second. Who is this,
and what have you done with my sister?
lt's just, l know how stressed you get.
Especially today.
<i>I can't taIk right now, Tru. </i>
<i>I'II see you tonight, okay? </i>
And call me crazy, but l actually think
Harrison's gonna make it this year.
You tell your friend Rebecca
that if this is a threat...
it's not gonna work.
We've been down this road before,
she and l. We're over. Done.
lf she insists on going to my wife,
l'll do everything in my power to stop her.
Everything.
l'll see you.
Can't win them all, right?
Where's the fun of that?
Guys, relax.
She's my sister.
<i>Leave now. </i>
l'm telling you,
cash in and walk away now.
Are you kidding me?
You saw the stack of chips l had in there.
l'm up!
Now, Harry.
You're up now, but it's not gonna last.
l thought you said you were short.
- l took a marker from the house.
- What?
A loan.
Great, so you're playing
with house money.
Are you okay?
ls everything okay?
l'm having a day, Harrison.
A day l'd gladly explain to you if l could...
but l can't, so l'm not even gonna try it.
And l heard another voice.
Wait.
l don't understand. You mean, like Mom?
<i>Okay, Mommy. </i>
No, not her. Someone else.
Dead?
- Oh, boy.
- And that's not even the half of it.
Believe it or not,
that's the half that makes sense.
l don't get it. Me, of all people,
why do they come to me?
Maybe because they know
that you'll listen.
Do you think l'm crazy?
l never thought you were crazy.
l gotta get back, okay?
Just do me a favor. Slow down the betting
to give me more time.
- For what?
- For figuring out a way to save your ass.
<i>Gary, I reaIIy need to taIk to her. </i>
l told you, she wasn't feeling well.
Needed some air.
<i>It seems to be happening a Iot IateIy. </i>
<i>One- one deIivery. </i>
What's the score?
Seven- one, Sox. Top of the ninth.
l'll bet you $100 they lose.
- What, are you crazy?
- Maybe. Don't know yet.
Sorry, Gary. l lost track of time.
This girl says she knows you.
Stay away from me. Don't come near me.
l know you don't understand.
Me, neither, but l wanna help--
You want to help?
Why don't you start by leaving me alone?
You know what,
maybe you'd better listen to her.
Gary, she's in trouble.
And she has no idea how much.
Why should l believe you?
All right. Here's the thing.
lf the Sox win, l'm good for the $100.
But if they lose, you help me.
Got a letter for Meredith Davies.
Tru, this is a surprise.
Guess l thought it was about time
l saw your office.
l see. Trying to make me feel guilty
about missing your graduation?
- l'm sorry, Tru--
- God, what happened to us?
We used to be close, all of us.
Now l find myself doing more for strangers
than l do for my own family.
What are you talking about?
Any second, someone's gonna
hand you an envelope.
An envelope with coke inside.
Just don't touch it, Mere.
Tru, your newfound concern is touching.
lt's psychotic, but touching.
Because no one is bringing me coke.
Much less an envelope full of it
to my office. Really, Tru, trust me.
Boy, you have some imagination,
you know that?
You know, l'm not sure
where you get all your facts but....
ls this how you get your kicks?
By convincing yourself you're not
the most screwed- up one in the family?
You can't fix people, Tru.
You can't save them.
Not Mom 10 years ago, not me.
And at this rate,
probably not even yourself.
- Why do l think you're lying to me?
- l shouldn't have looked through the files.
l just have a few questions.
What about? Unsolved murders?
Exactly.
<i>So Iet me get this straight. </i>
ln the eight hours
since you've been here...
you've decided to solve old cases?
<i>Very ambitious. </i>
You know what l did today?
l bought socks.
l'm just curious.
What can you say about a woman
who comes in with a bullet in her neck?
- That she's dead?
- Davis.
Okay, fine. Bullet in the neck.
l'm guessing
her death was execution style.
Meaning she did something to someone
to make them angry.
Small caliber bullet. Probably a. 22.
How so?
From what you said,
there was no exit wound.
The bullet just lodged itself in her neck.
<i>And I'II be honest with you. </i>
<i>You don't have to go through this troubIe</i>
<i>to impress me. </i>
<i>AII I need is for someone</i>
<i>to show up to work on time. </i>
Davis, thanks. l gotta run.
A pretty girl's nothing but trouble.
Beaten up. What?
- How could you possibly know that?
- Just trust me, okay?
And take this.
Think of it as an answer to a prayer.
There are 52 cards in a deck.
The chances of this saving me
from a beating....
Have a little faith in your sister, okay?
Remember when l said you weren't crazy?
l may have to rethink my position,
you know.
How the hell did you know
the Sox were gonna blow it?
Where is she, Gary?
<i>She went to see Winters. </i>
Charles, hello.
Mrs. Winters: lt's wonderful.
<i>I'm so proud of you. </i>
Want to know what's worse than watching
academics congratulate themselves?
lt's watching them eat.
Are you feeling any better?
This morning you seemed a little--
l can't even begin to describe to you
what this day's been like.
- Don't worry. lt'll be over soon enough.
- Yeah, let's hope so.
Mark, l gotta go.
Don't do it. He'll kill you.
l still don't understand
how could you possibly know...
that Elliot would kill me?
Let's just say
l've seen what he's capable of.
lt's amazing how charming a man can be
when he wants to get in...
and how callous he can be
when he wants to get out.
God, l thought going there
would change his mind.
Rebecca.
- Aaron, what are you doing here?
- l was worried about you.
l thought you said
you couldn't find that key?
She came to see me,
said you might be in some sort of trouble.
l'm fine, Aaron.
Everything's fine. You can go now.
l don't want to leave.
l want to work things out.
You don't have to be alone,
especially now.
l'm not gonna start this again
with you. l want you to go.
Rebecca, l came here to help you.
No, you didn't.
He came here to kill you.
What are you talking about? This is crazy.
Right. About as crazy
as the. 22 caliber in your pocket.
- What, this?
- Oh, my God.
This is for you to protect yourself.
Don't be so blind, Rebecca. You need this.
You know what he's capable of. Elliot.
Why don't you give me the gun, Aaron?
And by the way,
who the hell are you really?
You think you're doing her a favor,
messing with her life?
lf you ask me,
l think it's a really good way to get hurt.
One.
Elliot would never hurt me. lt's you, Aaron.
What are you talking about? What is me?
Why are you defending him?
You're always defending him...
- even after what he did to you!
- Did to me?
- He didn't do anything to me. l'm just--
- Pregnant.
You're pregnant.
Folic acid prescribed for pregnancy.
Aaron, listen to me.
You don't even know it...
but you're getting a second chance
to not kill two people...
so just give me the gun.
Becky, l never wanted to hurt you.
l just wanted to help, you know that.
You need to go, Aaron. Now.
No, just leave him.
Lock the door.
Stay inside and call the police.
He has to go home some time.
What?
l just realized.
l never said"thank you."
Mr. Chiang wants to remind you...
all debts must be settled immediately
following the last hand.
Yeah, l got the memo.
A pleasure, fellows.
<i>How did you know? </i>
l mean, the 10 of clubs. Right there.
Seriously, how did you know?
Let's just say
l've been a step ahead of everyone all day.
Of course, l didn't make a dime.
Every penny l won went back
to the Tram to pay off the marker.
There's a story here, right?
Yeah, there's a story.
l almost didn't recognize you guys.
l said,"That can't be my family.
Too much damn happiness."
- lt was good to see you today, Tru.
- Was it?
Yeah, it was.
See, l told you
Harrison was gonna show this year.
l'll be right back. Order me a club soda.
You and Meredith, getting along?
Just when l thought
things couldn't get any stranger....
Do you ever think
Mom's still watching us?
God, l hope not...
because l'm not sure
she'd like what she sees.
Yeah.
Maybe she's trying to change that.
That's a nice outfit, by the way.
Hello?
Hi, is this a bad time?
Because l can call back.
No, it's fine.
<i>Is everything okay, Davis? </i>
Yeah, l was thinking about that girl,
you know, the dead one?
And l thought of another reason
there might not be an exit wound.
What's that?
Order what you want. l'll split it with you.
You know the entry wound in her neck?
Maybe that wasn't an entry wound.
Maybe that was an exit wound.
That would mean
the bullet went through--
Her mouth. Yes, exactly.
<i>Which, if you ask me, sounds seIf- infIicted. </i>
- Meaning it wasn't a homicide.
- lt was suicide.
The thing is
l always wanted to be a mother.
A house, the kids, all of it.
My only mistake was believing
that he wanted it, too.
Rebecca.
Maybe he did.
Just not with his mistress.
Because when l told him about the baby...
he made it clear that's all l ever was.
But it's not all you're gonna be.
You're gonna be a mom, Rebecca.
Take it from someone
who lost hers way too soon.
You're supposed to live.
<i>There's no better reason to. </i>
Your mother?
Was killed...
ten years ago, in front of me...
by a man they never found.
lt wasn't her time then...
and it's not yours now.
Rebecca, will you give me the gun?
Hey, you new here?
Sort of. Do you mind?
An eager one.
Go ahead. Knock yourself out.
We found her in her apartment.
You should've seen this place.
lt was a nice one- bedroom,
if you know anyone.
<i>Cancer. It's a bitch. </i>
So, first one?
No. Second.
<i>It's sunny and miId on</i>
<i>this beautifuI Tuesday morning, May 27. </i>
<i>Traffic copter reports</i>
<i>no major deIays en route. </i>
<i>It's been the strangest day. </i>
<i>An understatement, I know. </i>
<i>Did you have anything to do with it? </i>
<i>I don't know. </i>
<i>I onIy know I wish this day had come</i>
<i>10 years earIier. </i>
<i>Then maybe I couId've saved you, too. </i>
<i>Instead I'II wait...</i>
<i>for others. </i>
<i>Some who have needed me</i>
<i>Ionger than most. </i>
<i>So maybe I couIdn't save you. </i>
<i>Maybe, just maybe...</i>
<i>this is your way of saving me. </i>
So, Lindsay, this is the sign- in room...
and this is what we call
the standards room.
Nice. Very goth.
So what happens in here?
This is where we measure and weigh
the dead bodies.
Okay, Tru.
Okay, let's be honest here.
You're cute, you're 22 years old.
There are better career opportunities
out there for you.
I told you, working here will help me
get into med school.
Then at least get off the graveyard shift.
I mean...
all the good parties start after midnight,
and who am I gonna go with now?
You'll survive. Besides, I think I might
be able to do some good by working here.
How? Everyone's already dead.
Not everyone.
You're not gonna believe this.
I just fished a tennis ball
out of a guy's large intestine.
Hello.
Remind me to cancel
my tennis club membership.
Lindsay, Davis, my boss.
- Davis, Lindsay, my best friend.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.
I'm good, really.
I was just leaving.
Tru, thank you for the tour.
And we're still on for shopping tomorrow?
Absolutely.
Okay, great.
See you tomorrow.
Look, Tru...
I know that the morgue
is not exactly Party Central...
but don't worry, things will pick up.
Actually, that's what I'm afraid of.
My kid's in that building! He's upstairs!
Someone's gotta get him! Please go!
Yes, ma'am, we'll get him!
Come here. I got you.
How about those Giants today?
That's seven in a row, my man.
Talk about really being on fire.
Go downstairs!
You're stuck!
I'm fine! Go!
No, come on!
Listen to me.
I'll be down in a minute, okay?
Don't worry about me.
Go on.
Go!
Help me.
Hey, gorgeous.
I didn't want to wake you.
Where are you going?
I am having breakfast with Dean Hazelton.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, it looks like a post's
opened up in the psych department...
and if I kiss up to the old windbag...
you will be dating
a fully tenured professor.
Let me ask you.
What do you think of this?
Very suave.
How was work last night?
Pretty dead.
That's funny. That's clever.
Why don't you
get back to sleep, beautiful?
They said five minutes
for a table. It's been 10 minutes already.
You okay?
Yeah. What could be wrong?
Let's see...
last time we talked, you told me
that dead people were talking to you...
so I thought I might be remiss
if I didn't follow up.
I'm fine, Harrison. Everything's fine.
WAITRESS: Two?
WAITRESS: Your table's ready.
Finally.
See, you're a lousy liar, Tru.
I want to know what's going on.
- Trust me, you don't.
- What?
All of a sudden, you can't confide in me?
Your brother?
You really want to know?
So let me get this straight.
You know, to recap.
The dead people,
they ask for your help in the morgue.
Just once.
It happened once. Hopefully, only once.
And then you got propelled.
That's the word you used, right?
Propelled back to yesterday?
I relived the day, yes.
So you were able to save the lady's life
because she wasn't dead yet?
Tru, what can I say?
You're my sister, and I'll always love you.
I know it sounds a little crazy, but....
Smooth move.
A little crazy? No.
The run with the bulls
is a little crazy. Skydiving.
Dating actresses is a little crazy. This?
This is certifiably insane.
Harrison, I'm not lying,
and I don't think I'm nuts, either.
You really relived the day?
Then you tell me this...
who's gonna win the Tigers game today?
What?
Rosemary and 24th.
Great. Traffic's gonna be jammed
clear downtown.
Catch you later.
You dog.
You were dating a professor and,
telling me just what, slipped your mind?
I knew you wouldn't approve.
I'm stunned.
Me, too.
- I thought things were good with him.
- No, I'm talking about us.
We're friends. Best friends.
Okay, now I get why
you've been acting so strange lately.
Okay, you can't keep secrets
from your friends. Especially me.
I just feel so stupid. I mean, you know me.
I don't even fall for guys often.
But when you do fall, you fall hard.
Excuse me?
Very nice. Yeah.
So anyway, what did you do
when you caught him with the bim?
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- I froze.
You caught your boyfriend in the act,
and you froze.
God, do you know what
I would have done to him?
I would have humiliated him.
I would have made him wish
he'd never ever met me.
Tru, you just blew the perfect opportunity
to put that jerk in his place.
I gotta go.
Where?
More abuse. Bye.
- I'm worried about you.
- Me?
Yeah. What's with this morgue thing?
It's my job. And it's a good thing to have
on my résumé for med school.
It's a little odd, don't you think?
To work at the same morgue where
they brought Mom after she was killed?
What?
What are you talking about?
My God, you really don't remember,
do you?
Still, working there's kind of ghoulish,
don't you think?
Tru, whatever you're trying
to accomplish...
Mom's gone.
Nothing can bring her back.
What's so interesting?
Nothing.
Are those intake files from '93?
It's nothing, Davis.
'93 was a very bad year.
Why's that?
The death rate in the city was low,
maybe the lowest in the country...
and then, after '93,
it just went up like a skyrocket.
lncoming.
This is Samantha Block.
My God.
Died of smoke inhalation.
The fire started
on the fourth floor around 5:00.
The firemen thought
they'd cleared the building.
She was hiding under the bed.
What started the fire?
Gas explosion.
This one here is Nick Kelly, a civilian.
He saved a 12- year- old boy,
smoke got him, too.
The victim has a broken ankle.
Probably trying to get out.
Old buildings are death traps.
Discoloration of the cheeks.
From what?
Might indicate inhalation
of a chemical compound.
I'm guessing dimethyl benzene.
Is this guy a genius or what?
Genius, you owe me $20.
The Tigers shut them out tonight.
Patterson threw a two- hitter.
What's dimethyl benzene?
lndustrial uses, mainly.
Her, too. They must have
ingested it from the smoke.
Cotton fibers plastered
on the epidermal layer.
And it's red and something else.
<i>It's hard to teII. </i>
So young.
Damn tragedy is what it is.
I don't know if I can take this.
Believe it or not, it actually gets easier.
Besides, I like to think
they're going to a better place.
You believe that?
Well, if you're gonna work here,
you gotta believe it.
Of course, the dead get off easy.
It's the ones left behind
that gotta deal with all the pain.
Renee says she ain't gonna
hook you up.
No more of her friends.
Why not?
'Cause you're scaring them off, man.
You're a nice guy,
but you come on too strong.
It was only eight e- mails.
<i>HeIp me. </i>
You just gotta play it cool.
Did you guys hear that?
Hear what?
Nothing. Never mind.
Tru, let me ask you.
When you go out with a guy...
you want him to lay back a little, right?
And make you earn it.
<i>HeIp me. </i>
I'll be right back.
She's hot. Weird, but hot.
<i>HeIp me. </i>
Help me.
Hey, gorgeous.
Where are you going?
I've got a breakfast with Dean Hazelton.
Tru!
Sorry, what?
I asked what you thought of this.
How's this look?
Yeah, it looks fine.
Breakfast with the Dean?
That's a surprise.
Yeah, there's a post that's gonna open up
in the psych department.
If I kiss up to the old windbag...
then you will be dating
a fully tenured professor.
That's a good one.
- What?
- Opportunity.
It's a good opportunity.
So you're sure about the jacket?
Yeah, very suave.
So suave, in fact...
that I think you should
stick around for a while.
I can't. I gotta go meet the Dean.
But I will see you tonight.
Um....
You realize you were hired
for the night shift, don't you?
Do you ever actually go home?
I could ask you the same question.
I just thought if I'm gonna do a good job,
I'd better get to know the system.
Diligent.
Enough with the crypt.
Let's check out the database, yeah?
Municipal database.
What are you doing with that?
Just a little research.
Who's Nick Kelly?
What do you know.
He's a fireman.
- Can I help you, miss?
- Yes. I'm looking for Nick Kelly.
Hey, Nick?
Yo.
Somebody to see you.
Hi, I'm Nick.
Hi. Can we talk?
- 84 Hastings?
- Yeah, that's the one.
That's right down the block from me.
What makes you think that
that building's a fire hazard?
No reason in particular.
I'm doing a fire risk assessment
in prewar buildings...
for my architecture class.
- That's a weird assignment.
- Weird professor.
Yeah, I'd be happy to go down
and take a look at that unit for you.
What do you say, about 5:00?
The fire started around 5:00.
5:00 is too late. I'm supposed to be
in my professor's office at 2:00.
And this really can't wait?
Not if I want to pass.
Okay, what the hell.
Things are slow around here,
anyway. Let me ask you something.
- Why me?
- Sorry?
You could've asked any one of these guys
for help, but you asked for me.
I have the calendar.
That was for charity.
It's the Widows and Orphans Fund.
Okay, Mr. September.
I wasn't here for the last
fire inspection. I spent the night in the ER.
Wedding ring dropped down
the garbage disposal.
I put my hand in, almost lost two fingers.
I said to my wife,"If that doesn't
scream commitment, what does?"
- We just want to check the furnace.
- No problem. The basement's down here.
- That shirt was a gift from your father.
- I hate it.
It makes me look like a geek.
It's what a loser would wear.
You're wearing it, and that's final.
What's gotten into you?
<i>Take your sister outside and pIay. </i>
What do you say, Samantha?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
She's a sweetheart.
She is, isn't she?
She turns 7 next week.
Yeah, I hope so.
Creepy.
Come on.
Watch your step.
What are we doing?
First rule of fire risk assessment...
you want to check all mains
and all pipelines for gas leaks.
You might want to take some notes.
For your report.
- It's okay. Photographic memory.
- Really?
What's that?
This is what we call a gas sniffer.
It's used to detect
the source of a leak.
Won't we smell it?
If the concentration's high enough,
we will.
Hold on a sec.
What?
You've got a little bit of soot right there.
Thank you.
I should take you on all my inspections.
Here, come on down.
Careful. You never know
what you might find down here.
Be careful.
Wait a minute. Here we go.
You see that?
What?
Right there.
- It's a leak?
- Yeah.
It sure is. Would you hold that?
Yeah.
Let me see that.
Yeah, see that?
There you go.
You know, it's a good thing
you contacted us.
We wouldn't have found this without you.
You're sure it's patched?
Yeah, it's fine.
Positive? I mean, there's no chance
this thing's gonna explode or anything?
No, it's fine.
Good. No fires here today.
Not in the building, anyway.
Listen, I'm off duty in 10 minutes.
You want to get some coffee?
I could give you the whole sordid history
of fire risk in prewar buildings.
- Actually, I'd like to, but....
- Boyfriend?
You know, let me get back to you
on that one.
My roommate really wants to meet you.
Maybe we could double this weekend.
Gina, I'm an associate professor.
I don't double.
All right. I'd love to meet your friends,
just don't drag me to a pep rally, all right?
I'll be right back.
I just have to use the ladies' room.
Tru?
Hi.
This is a....
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd surprise you.
We haven't had much quality time
on account of my job and all.
What, aren't you glad to see me?
Yeah, of course I am. It's....I'm surprised.
Where's the Dean?
Canceled. Pancreatitis.
Mark?
I'm sorry. I just wanted to come
and say hi to my favorite professor.
Yeah, this is Tru.
She was one of my star pupils.
Are you in his class now?
You'll learn a lot from him.
Things you don't expect.
Things you might not want to learn...
but he has a way of
making things very clear.
You must really miss his class.
I thought I would.
But I know now
that it's gonna miss me much more.
Anyway, I've taken enough
of the professor's time.
Goodbye, Mark. He's all yours.
Wait. Tru.
- You did that?
- It was amazing.
To have the chance to say
everything you want right in the moment.
God.
I could never do something like that.
You're so strong, Tru.
I really admire that about you.
And I'm sorry about Evans.
Not surprised, but sorry.
Cute.
So from now on, no more secrets, okay?
Okay.
Then there's something
I have to tell you, Lindsay.
- I think I met someone new.
- Already?
You little slut.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
Did you know Mom's body
was sent to the morgue where I work?
No. But then again,
I was 10 when she died.
Come on, Tru. You gotta forget
about that stuff. You were a kid.
You gotta cut yourself some slack.
- How did you know that?
- Know what?
You knew that top was loose
before it even came off. Seriously.
Last week you knew about my cards,
and now this.
<i>Are you gonna teII me what's going on? </i>
I can't.
Why not?
- Because you won't understand.
- Me?
- Come on, Tru. How do you know that?
- I just do.
For the same reason I know
it's gonna rain at 3:00...
or that Patterson's gonna throw
a two- hitter for the Tigers.
Talk about answering a question
with a question.
<i>Honest, I just don't</i>
<i>get you sometimes, Tru. </i>
Is Patterson gonna throw a two- hitter?
I love that shirt, by the way.
Love this? I just pulled it out of the closet.
What?
- Nothing.
- No, what?
It's just nice to meet someone
who's not a jerk.
- Well, we're not all jerks.
- No, you're not.
So maybe you don't mind me
asking you how come you lied to me...
about being a student?
What makes you think I lied?
You're supposed to be
in your professor's office at 2:00...
with your report, and it's 2:15.
We did a good thing, right?
Stopping that leak?
Yeah, we did.
So let's just leave it at that.
Okay. Strange, but okay.
Do you like being a firefighter?
Yeah, I like helping people.
Don't you worry
about how dangerous your job is?
You see it on the news all the time.
A firefighter goes into a building and....
I don't really think about it.
Sometimes a job just chooses you.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I do.
I mean you're good at it.
If we hadn't found that leak...
who knows what could've happened
this afternoon.
This afternoon?
You don't know who could've been killed.
Actually, I do.
No one.
What do you mean?
That wasn't anywhere near
the accumulation necessary...
to cause an explosion.
That leak wasn't dangerous?
In time, yeah.
A week,
two weeks down the line, maybe...
but that leak wasn't gonna
cause a fire today. Not a chance.
The type of fire
you're hypothetically describing...
would be caused by dipping a cotton rag
in some sort of accelerant.
Like dimethyl benzene?
Why are you so interested
in discussing arson scenarios?
- Do you have a grudge against someone?
- I'm here to learn.
Dimethyl benzene
is found in cleaning solvents.
You soak a rag with the stuff,
put it next to a fuel source and kaboom.
The fibers you described...
would be seared into the skin of anyone
within proximity of the blast.
So this was arson.
Hypothetically.
Hypothetically, yes.
It's quick to ignite, it's hard to trace.
If you get it on your hands,
watch out, it's nasty burns.
I wasn't here for the last fire inspection.
I spent the night in the ER.
Thanks for your help, Davis.
If you ever need help with
other hypothetical research projects...
I'm always here...
and if I'm not here,
you can call my cell phone.
<i>We couId even maybe discuss it</i>
<i>over drinks or something. </i>
Do you have company?
Someone who's meeting me. A friend.
- His name's Nick Kelly.
- Mr. September?
It's for a good cause.
So you work here?
Sometimes a job chooses you.
Anyway, I'm thinking arson.
You said the gas leak
couldn't have started a fire today.
- That means it happened another way.
- What are you talking about?
- There's no fire at 84 Hastings.
- No.
Not yet.
I don't understand why you suspect
him for a fire that hasn't happened.
He was indicted for insurance fraud.
And you think he's planning
to burn down the building?
What's this about, Tru?
Why did you bring me here?
I believe 84 Hastings
may be a target for arson today.
If you have information
related to an arson...
you need to tell the police,
not run around like Nancy Drew.
- It's just a hunch.
- What kind of a hunch?
Listen, I'll make you a deal.
I'm listening.
Wait till tonight, and I'll tell you
anything you want to know.
And a whole lot more.
You're very lucky I have a soft spot
for strange women.
It's 3:30. I'll meet you back at your place
as soon as I can.
Grab a couple of beers,
order some Chinese...
and do not leave until I get there.
You promise?
Very, very strange.
Hello?
Is anybody down here?
Mr. Ford.
Let me guess. You lost an earring.
No. I'm here to tell you something.
What's that?
This building's being watched
by the police and fire departments.
They suspect a potential arson may occur.
Okay, I'll bite. Why?
You tell me.
Who the hell are you?
You were indicted for insurance fraud
two years ago.
- So what?
- How about taking that bandage off?
What the hell is this?
I'm just giving you a warning.
Don't talk to me like that, okay?
How was school, honey? Was it good?
Fine.
This is Samantha Block.
Died of smoke inhalation.
Come on, Samantha.
We don't talk to strangers.
Excuse me, ma'am?
Harrison, I can't talk right now.
I'm kind of putting out fires.
The Tigers won today, just like you said.
Glad I could help.
<i>I want some answers, Tru. </i>
- How did you know?
- I don't have time....
How much did you win?
<i>A IittIe probIem there. </i>
I would've won if I had the bucks.
So here's the way I see it.
To prevent future mishaps,
every morning...
<i>you and I, we get together, </i>
<i>we go over the game scores. </i>
<i>First we'II start with footbaII-- </i>
I gotta go.
Might indicate inhalation
of a chemical compound.
I'm guessing dimethyl benzene.
lndustrial uses, mainly.
Hi.
I heard a noise.
I'm Tru. I think we met earlier.
Yeah, I remember.
What do you say we get out of here?
Come on, I'll buy you a soda.
That little girl with you upstairs,
was that your sister?
Yeah.
- You don't sound too thrilled.
- She's okay.
This place sucks. My dad blew us off.
He lives in Washington
with some new wife.
Why'd you break into Mr. Ford's office?
It was an accident. I knocked too hard.
You could've just picked the lock.
It's a hundred years old.
Kevin, I need you to do me a favor.
But I need you
to not ask any questions, okay?
- What?
- When 5:00 rolls around...
make sure you, your sister, and your mom
are out of the building...
- and anyone else you can tell.
- Why?
- We said no questions, right?
- Okay. Done.
Cool. I'll be just a second.
Hello?
You're where?
Nick, I asked you to wait for me
at your apartment.
And I asked you for an explanation...
as to why you're trying
to put out nonexistent fires.
I mean, it's a beautiful day,
and I'm sitting in my apartment...
because some girl who works in a morgue
asked me to.
I think it's the super.
I told you...
- prior convictions aren't proof.
- His office was full of accelerants.
For equipment cleaning.
He's a building super.
There's something going on with him.
Even if there is, there is still no fire.
You can't arrest a guy
for thinking about doing something.
Luckily, we can't be arrested
for our thoughts.
You think I'm insane, don't you?
Honestly? It's touch and go.
Look, maybe I'm doing this wrong,
I don't know.
- I just want to stop a fire.
- A fire that hasn't happened.
But it could.
How do you know?
I just do.
lntuition again?
I was right about the gas leak.
Look, you have to trust me.
That's the weird thing.
I do.
It's almost 5:00.
She's beautiful, and she tells time, too.
- No.
- What's wrong?
I can't right now.
Sure you can.
- No, I can't.
- We're here.
If I kiss you, I'll fall for you,
and I can't do that. That would be bad.
Why would that be so bad?
What?
Cotton fibers were plastered
on the epidermal layer.
It's red and something else.
That was a gift from your father.
I hate it.
- I was wrong.
- About what?
How it started. It's the kid.
What kid?
Kevin. The kid from the building.
He's gonna start the fire.
So some kid is gonna start a fire?
<i>A minute ago you said it was the super. </i>
He's angry.
Lonely. Feels invisible.
He could pick the lock
to the super's office.
What better way to get attention?
It makes sense.
To you maybe.
I have to get to that building.
That kid's sister is in trouble.
- Tru, I--
- Promise me you'll go home.
But if there's a fire--
No.
You're right. There's no fire.
<i>I'm wrong. Crazy, even. </i>
So then go home. Wait for me there.
Promise me, Nick.
- I'm tired of this game.
- Nick, please.
I like you.
I really do.
And I think you feel the same way.
- I'm not imagining this, am I?
- No.
- Then I need to know what--
- I told you...
you'll get all the answers tonight.
And before this day ends,
we'll have that kiss. But just go home.
Everybody, out of the building! Come on!
The building's on fire! Everybody, out!
You gotta get out, there's a fire!
Please, let's go!
Get out of the building!
Come on, you gotta get out! Please!
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.
You promised!
I was worried!
You gotta get out of here right now!
Trust me! Come on!
- lntuition again?
- Let's go.
- No, I can't leave.
- Why not?
- I'm a fireman.
- You don't have your gear.
I rang the alarm.
They'll be here any minute.
Great. Traffic's gonna be jammed
clear downtown.
They're gonna be delayed by traffic.
That's why you went in.
You live down the block.
Listen. I want you to get out.
I'm gonna check upstairs.
No, Nick, wait!
Come here. I got you.
How about those Giants today?
That's seven in a row, my man.
Talk about really being on fire.
Nick!
Yeah, coming! Got a rescue!
The victim has a broken ankle.
- Nick, stop!
- What?
The floor's weak! Watch out!
How did you....Never mind.
My God!
See, I knew we'd have the kiss
before the day was over.
But Sam, she's supposed to be at the park.
My God. My daughter's still inside!
She's still in the building!
- Where are you going?
- I'm going after her.
She was hiding under the bed.
She's hiding under her bed.
But send someone else, please.
It's my job, Tru.
And I'm stubborn as you are.
Nick, no!
Listen to me.
I'll be down in a minute, okay?
Get this gear.
No, Nick!
No time, there's a little girl upstairs.
I know where she is.
Tru!
- I can't talk right now.
- You're crying.
Yes.
I know. It's been rough on both of us.
I get it.
No, you don't.
I wish that I could rewind
the day and have it back.
I would do everything differently.
I would show you
how much you mean to me.
You had your day.
You only get one.
I thought when you asked me for help,
it was for you.
Now I know it was for Samantha.
You saved her.
Everyone's calling you a hero.
I don't want to sound selfish...
but I wanted both of you.
You said your job
was a chance to help people.
All they have to do is ask.
So is mine.
So ask me, Nick.
Please?
I'm not leaving till you ask.
So please ask me, Nick.
Please, just ask.
Help me.
There you are, Tru.
<i>Can you do me a favor? </i>
Yeah, sure.
Hand me the other bulb.
Can l ask you a question, Davis?
Absolutely.
Do you like it here?
Been here eight years.
Not sure what else l'd do.
But do you like it here?
ls everything okay?
Doesn't it ever get to you...
seeing all these dead people
day after day?
Yeah.
Sure, l guess some days
l wish l was in Ear, Nose and Throat...
but most of the time, it's okay.
My friend Lindsay works
in public relations.
So do we.
Our public just happens to be dead.
Here's what l think, Tru.
We're all someplace for a reason.
Just sometimes we need to accept
what that reason is.
Damn.
Hello?
<i>Hey, sis. </i>
Sorry. Were you sleeping?
<i>It's fine. </i>
l have to wake up in 12 hours anyways.
l wanted to make sure we were
still on for brunch today at your place.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Great. See you then.
But--
l got to go. Battery's dying.
<i>See you, Tru. </i>
- So, you think she'll like me?
- Listen, l told you, Tru is the best.
But she has been tough
on some of the girls l bring around.
There's been others?
But none that matters.
Sounds like a line.
The same one you used
to get me in bed in the first place.
Serious.
When l think of all the other girls
l wasted time with...
thinking, you know, she's the one, but....
Then l meet you.
You'll jinx it.
Superstitious?
Just about certain things.
Parking, love.
ls that what we're talking about here?
Love?
l'm gonna hit the showers...
make sure l look presentable
for your overprotective sister.
Come here. What is that?
What?
On your back. Let me see that.
lt's nothing, really.
l slipped when l was working out.
- You slipped?
- Yeah.
This had nothing to do with--
No, this had nothing
to do with anything.
Just a...
clumsy girl on a StairMaster.
He tried to pick me up.
- l did not try to pick you up.
- Then what would you call it?
lt was a diner.
You were alone, l was alone.
- l was just trying to make conversation.
- You tried to pick her up.
Anyway, l wouldn't talk to him.
Not some stranger who was
way too cute to be good for me.
But he was persistent.
He got my number, called, called again.
Finally, l agreed to meet him for lunch.
That was three weeks ago.
And the rest is history.
<i>My brother's in Iove. </i>
- Already? l thought he just met her.
- He did.
The boy moves fast.
God, l hate people in love.
They always act so superior.
So they found someone
that will actually put up with them.
Speaking of,
what's happening with James?
Third date tonight,
and you know what that means.
The third- date rule.
One of the great overlooked inventions
of our time.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So, you gonna sleep with him?
lt's the third date, Tru. Fish or cut bait.
You believe in the third- date rule,
don't you?
l believe in you. So if you believe in it....
He's so sweet. A little shy.
My God, you like him.
l liked her.
Sarah. Really?
Yeah, l thought she was great.
But?
There's no buts. She's a keeper, Harrison.
Yeah. That's great, Tru.
l mean, we both know how you can be
a little tough on some of my girls.
Let's be honest. You've had some winners.
l'm not even talking about
the stripper years.
No, but Sarah, she's different, Tru.
l don't know.
l mean, when l'm with her, it's....
l'm better, you know?
Nice.
l'll tell you, her ex- husband's a real fool
to let her get away.
Wow, she's divorced?
Yeah. The guy sounds like
a real piece of work, too.
But she believes in me.
Damn, l don't even
believe in myself half the time.
But here's this girl, this....
No, this woman...
who thinks l'm someone special.
l love this girl!
This is a weird night.
We got to find somebody for you...
because this whole third- wheel stuff?
New.
Hello? Hey, sweetie, how are you?
- What, now?
- ls everything all right?
No, don't worry, Sarah. l'll be right there.
l'm sorry, got to go.
- ls she okay?
- Don't worry. Nothing l can't handle.
But l'll call you later, okay? l promise.
lt was awful. lt was awkward and fast.
And afterwards,
he wouldn't even look at me.
He just made up some excuse...
that he had to get up early
the next morning...
and ran out of my apartment.
What did you do?
<i>What couId I do? </i>
l said goodbye
and ate a tube of cookie dough.
So, not only did l just have the worst
sex of my life with a guy l really liked...
but l also gained two pounds.
Okay, you know what?
l'm officially over the third- date rule.
lt's just another male invention
to get us into the sack.
Honey, l'm home.
- l got to call you back.
- Yeah, okay.
91 1 took the call at 10:30.
The body was found
in his ex- wife's house.
Bullet in the chest.
lt's nice to know some people
got a worse relationship than l do.
Bag that for me?
Yeah.
Andrew Webb, lives at the harbor.
Nice. Should've spent some of that money
on a bullet- proof vest.
Oh, my God.
Sarah.
<i>I'II try pIaying President Truman. </i>
ALE<i>X</i> <i>1979. </i>
<i>Hey, </i>
<i>this is Harrison. Leave me a message. </i>
Hi, it's me again.
l really need to talk to you...
so just call me back
as soon as you get this, all right?
- Are you okay?
- l'm fine.
l mean, these people are such brainiacs.
<i>...tropicaI fIowers. </i>
<i>What are orchids? </i>
<i>Correct. </i>
l mean, the only questions l know
are about <i>GiIIigan's IsIand. </i>
<i>1972. Ken Howard</i>
<i>as this decIaration writer....</i>
Hello?
<i>Tru, it's Meredith. </i>
Listen, l really need to reach Harrison.
<i>You haven't heard from him</i>
<i>by any chance? </i>
Actually, l have.
He's under arrest, Tru.
<i>For what? </i>
They haven't filed yet,
but my guess is murder one.
What?
<i>They're saying that he kiIIed</i>
<i>his girIfriend's ex. </i>
Andrew Webb?
- Yeah, that's the guy. How do you know?
- His body just came in.
But there's no way.
Harrison could never kill someone.
lt doesn't look good.
His blood is in her living room.
- His prints were on the gun.
- Where is he now?
They're taking him downtown.
Listen, l got to run.
- l'll call you when l know more.
- Mere, wait.
Gardez, l'm gonna need you
to cover for me.
Just tell Davis l'll be back as soon as l can.
Are you okay?
<i>This fIower's name</i>
<i>is an aIIusion....</i>
l don't know yet.
Not that l'm not cool
with the whole concept...
of corpses speaking to me...
but if you were going to ask for my help...
now would be the time.
Help me.
Hello?
<i>Hey, sis. </i>
Were you sleeping?
Harrison, l need you to listen to me,
and listen carefully.
l'm going to tell you something.
<i>Can this wait tiII brunch? </i>
Wait, you're still having us
for brunch, right?
Yes, but something's gonna happen today.
Something important.
l know. You're meeting Sarah.
Don't be such a drama queen.
l got to go. Battery's dying.
Harrison, no. Wait.
Help me.
You're here early.
By about...12 hours.
l'm not staying.
For someone who doesn't like it here,
you sure are around a lot.
You ever think that maybe
you just belong here?
l'll let you know in about 12 hours.
lssues.
lt's Harrison. He's in trouble.
<i>Harrison's aIways in troubIe. </i>
You pulled me out of a meeting
to tell me that?
- Today's different.
- Okay, l'll bite. How's today different?
This is gonna sound strange...
but do you think Harrison
could ever kill someone?
- What? What kind of question is that?
- Do you?
<i>He's our brother. </i>
l mean, we haven't been that close
over the years, but....
l just need you to be honest.
Do you think Harrison
could ever kill someone?
Yes.
l don't think he would ever--
<i>What is this about? </i>
<i>Or is this just one of</i>
<i>your crazy hypotheticaIs? </i>
Yeah. That's what it is.
But look, l'm gonna need your help today,
no questions asked.
Okay, fine. But next time,
not during meetings, okay?
Right. l'll be in touch.
You'll be in touch.
You're late.
lt's a good thing l didn't return
that spare key...
or l'd have to shimmy up
that drain pipe again.
- l'm glad to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.
Feel free to let go any time.
l want you to meet....
Sarah.
You must be Tru.
- l've heard so much about you.
- Mutual.
You have a lovely place.
These old buildings are just great.
- Can l talk to you for one sec?
- Come on. We just got here.
Besides, there's nothing you can't say
in front of Sarah.
Okay.
l ran into Andrew yesterday.
Andrew?
My ex- husband.
Tru? Word?
ln the future, two topics that are off-limits
when meeting my new girlfriends:
my exes and their exes.
l need you to stay away from Sarah today.
Man, you never change.
Every girl l bring around,
you find something wrong with.
So, she's divorced. What is the big deal?
Half the country is divorced.
lt's nothing against her.
lt's you that l'm worried about.
l'm a big boy.
lf l get my heart stomped,
l get my heart stomped.
You can't protect me forever.
No, but l can protect you for today.
Look, go to the movies,
go play the horses, whatever.
- But just stay away from her, please.
- l don't get you sometimes.
Which lately, has been most of the time.
Just do this for me, okay? Just for today.
Why do you always have to do things
the hard way?
Because l can.
Can l help you?
l didn't realize anyone was here. l'm sorry.
You're taking pictures of my home.
You'll have to do better than that.
We're putting together
a book on the harbor.
You know, sights and sounds, all that.
A book?
A book proposal, actually.
l won't bore you with the details...
but we wouldn't use any of the pictures
without your permission.
Your boat is just so beautiful.
l'm sorry about the inconvenience.
lt's got an inside, too.
So, tell me about the book.
Beer, wine? Can l get you something?
Why do l think
you're not interested in the book?
Why do l think you're one of the more
perceptive women l've met lately?
She's very pretty.
That's Sarah.
l'm sure we have better things
to talk about than my wife.
<i>- You sure you don't want a drink? </i>
- Sorry. l'm on the clock.
But, it's nice to see divorce
doesn't slow you down at all.
Sarah and l aren't divorced.
We're separated.
- Sarah isn't your ex- wife?
- No, she's my current wife.
Hello?
Where are you?
l've been waiting for half an hour.
l'm sorry. Something's come up.
<i>I'II try</i>
<i>not to take that personaIIy. </i>
Look, l'll just call you tonight, then.
Just remember one thing.
The third- date rule was invented by men
to try and get us into bed.
Whatever you do, don't fall for it.
You take this overprotective- sister
role pretty seriously l see.
Why didn't you tell Harrison
you're still married?
He said you were tough.
But l didn't think your blessing
would require an interview...
and a background check.
l'm sorry. He's my little brother.
Sometimes l get carried away.
Look, just because we don't have
signed divorce papers...
doesn't make it any more of a marriage.
Do you know anyone
who would want to hurt your husband?
People don't hurt Andrew.
Andrew hurts them.
l married him when l was young.
Too young.
Maybe that's why l thought
it was my fault.
That somehow
l had done something wrong.
l deserved it.
Deserved what?
Call it what you want.
Domestic violence, physical abuse.
lt all hurts just the same.
l finally got the courage to leave.
l thought the hard part was over.
lt took me a year to realize
the hard part hadn't yet begun.
He won't divorce you?
No. Giving up control
doesn't really appeal to Andrew.
Which is why these make sense.
l found them in the mailbox this morning.
No name, but it doesn't take
a genius to know who sent them.
Look, should l have told Harrison sooner
that l was still married?
Probably.
l just didn't want to scare him off.
He doesn't scare easy, you know?
l know. That's what l love about him.
Like it or not, l do love him.
So do l.
You tell me to stay away from Sarah,
and you go and hassle her.
You know she called me, near tears.
She thinks you hate her.
l don't hate her, Harrison.
That's not what this is about.
Then what is it about?
You have to trust me, okay?
Trust that l know what l'm doing.
Or maybe l don't. l don't know.
You were making a lot more sense...
when you thought
dead people were talking to you.
Thanks.
And when did you become
such a hypocrite?
You sleep with your college professor...
and you're all over me because
l'm dating a woman who's separated.
No, it's not about that.
The reason she's not divorced, Tru,
is'cause she's scared to file.
Damn it, Tru.
You know what l think?
l think it's'cause l'm happy.
Yeah. 'Cause l met someone,
and it kills you...
that your pathetic little brother's
having a better life than you.
All this time you had me convinced
that Meredith was the selfish one.
But it's been you all along.
Harrison, you're getting it all wrong.
Am l?
lt seems to me for the first time,
l'm getting it right.
Let me guess. There's no book.
l'd like to ask you
a few questions, Mr. Webb.
You better talk fast,
because the police will be here shortly.
You know, l should've known.
- How much is Sarah paying you?
- For what?
To dig up dirt, to force my hand
in granting her a divorce.
Oh, God, you know we've been
playing this game for months.
And frankly, her lack of originality
is beginning to surprise me.
This is Andrew Webb at the harbor.
l don't work for your wife.
l'm here to help you.
l have an intruder onboard.
Help me with what?
Live to see tomorrow.
ls that a threat?
No, it's not.
But if l'm gonna help you,
you must be honest with me.
- Why are you having Sarah followed?
- What?
- Why won't you grant your wife a divorce?
- Because she married me for my money.
lf l give her a divorce,
she gets half.
lf l stay married, she gets what l give her.
Oh, so you're punishing her.
She's making me out to be the bad guy.
That's brilliant.
You know, she's smarter than l thought.
Did she tell you that l beat her?
- Are you saying that you didn't?
- l have never hit Sarah.
And l have never hit a woman.
Now, why don't you just run along
before l have to change my answer.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Just tell me what happened.
He came in here,
and he was out of control.
Did he hit you?
Did he--
No.
Not this time...
but he threatened me.
He threatened to kill me.
What? Why?
Because of you. Because he hates you.
He hates me? What did l do?
You made me fall in love with you.
Maybe it would just be safer for me
if we weren't together right now, okay?
For both of us.
Oh, l don't know, Harrison, you know.
Then l'm just giving in to him.
l'm giving him exactly what he wants.
God, what can l do? He comes over here
and l'm helpless to protect myself.
Maybe you shouldn't be helpless.
What are you saying?
l should take a self- defense class
or go buy a gun?
You wouldn't be helpless.
Look at me.
l know a guy.
You know a guy?
Yeah.
He could set you up today with a gun.
- Do you love me?
- You know l do.
Then trust me.
l know a guy.
<i>911. </i>
<i>Yes, this is Sarah Webb. </i>
<i>Are you okay? </i>
<i>My husband just-- </i>
<i>Speak up, ma'am. </i>
<i>Your husband just what, ma'am? </i>
<i>Hit me. </i>
<i>I'm bIeeding. </i>
<i>Is he there with you now? </i>
<i>No, he drove away. </i>
<i>PIease hurry, if he comes back, </i>
<i>he threatened....</i>
<i>He said he wouId kiII me. </i>
<i>Where are you? </i>
<i>Oh, my God, he's here. </i>
<i>Andrew, stop it. PIease. </i>
A friend of mine in the DA's office tracked
it down from a year ago last December.
He was lying.
- What's that?
- Nothing. Just thinking out loud.
So, Harrison knows
you're investigating his girlfriend?
lt's for his own good, Mere.
You gotta trust me.
So what happened
when the police showed up at her house?
The husband was gone,
the police issued a warrant for him.
- And?
- And nothing.
Sarah went in the next day to make sure
they dropped all the charges.
- Why?
- Classic battered woman syndrome.
l see it all the time.
lf you're done with your research project,
l really have a ton of work to do.
- Thanks, Mere. l owe you.
- Yeah, you do.
Well, if it's home protection
you're looking for...
l would say a semi- automatic,
nine millimeter.
- l sell a lot of those.
- Nine millimeter, what does that mean?
lt's the size of the bullet.
lt's like what cops use.
Of course there's a good argument
to be made to stepping it up a bit...
to 10 millimeter or 45.
Both very good choices.
What about this?
Sure. lf your home's being invaded
by grizzly bears.
The nine millimeter is fine.
Good choice.
Does the little lady want me to wrap it up
or is she gonna wear it home?
l can't do this. Harrison, l'm sorry,
l can't do this.
Whoa, hey.
We talked about this.
You need it.
What does it solve? l mean, do you think
that it gives me my life back?
And besides, l read somewhere,
what was it...
that my own gun is more likely
to be used against me.
- Hey, you want me to hold it?
- No, Harrison, it's--
'Cause l will.
You need it,
but you don't want it in your house.
So l'll keep it. Problem solved.
And if he ever gives you a hard time...
all you got to do is call me.
l don't know. l've already gotten you
so mixed up in all of this.
We're in this together now.
Wrap it up, Serge.
God, l hate this.
l know you don't want to talk to me,
but l need you to listen.
So, you wanted to talk to me?
Please.
Look, l'm sorry.
About Sarah. For doubting her.
l know her husband's a bad guy.
l know everything.
lt's cool.
- That's big of you, Tru. l mean, that's--
- l'm not done.
Because you're still in danger.
Damn it, Tru.
Why can't you leave well enough alone?
You apologized. And now this. You know...
have a great night.
Hey, Harrison, wait.
You're carrying a gun.
Hey, yeah, don't give me any gun- safety
lectures, l know my way around a piece.
Oh, my God.
Do you think Harrison
could ever kill someone?
<i>Yes. </i>
You killed him.
What are you talking about?
You're gonna kill him.
You're gonna kill Andrew tonight.
What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?
Because l know.
You know what?
Every single thing
that's gonna happen today.
What are you, psychic all of a sudden?
lt's not psychic. At least l don't think so.
l mean, l'm not sure
what the name for it is scientifically.
But in layman's terms, l relive days.
You relive days?
People ask for my help. Dead people.
l know, l already told you that.
But then the day restarts...
and l have a chance
to save them from dying.
lt doesn't happen every day.
Not that that makes it
any less strange, but....
How do you think l knew your card?
Take this.
How do you think l knew
who was gonna win the ball game?
- Even you were curious.
- Okay, Tru, l love you, you know that.
But you need help. A lot of it, okay?
You see that waiter?
ln two seconds,
l bet you he drops his tray.
Oh, what are you talking--
And that guy across the room?
Tru--
He's gonna stand up
and profess his love for his girlfriend.
l love this girl!
What's going on?
ls this one of those reality shows
where you try to freak a guy out?
ln one minute, your cell phone's
gonna ring. lt's gonna be Sarah.
Upset and in trouble. Listen to me.
She's gonna ask you to come see her.
You're gonna run out of here,
you're gonna kill her husband.
You're gonna kill her husband
and be arrested for his murder tonight.
Look, you had me with the waiter,
and lover- boy, okay? But this?
This is a little wack, don't you think?
Hello?
lt's Sarah. Says she needs me.
Harrison, wait.
l'm going, Tru.
You can't.
She needs me.
l love her and she needs me.
You can't save her.
lt's not your responsibility.
lf you go there tonight,
you're gonna kill him.
- But he deserves what he gets.
- And then what? You end up where?
ln jail for life, or worse?
What? Do you want me to be like Dad?
Stand by helplessly and watch
the woman l love get murdered?
ls that what you want?
- Don't make her into Mom, either.
- What?
Harrison, she's not Mom.
Don't make this about saving Mom.
Look, l don't even know
what you're talking about.
Harrison.
Look at me.
Would you look at me?
l'm 22 years old.
And one way or another,
l've lost everyone l've ever loved.
Our mother to a bullet,
our father to lack of interest...
Meredith to coke and ambition.
Don't you see?
l can't lose you, too.
Otherwise l'll have no one left.
l'm cursed because l can see the future.
And if you go there right now,
l'll have no one.
Without you, l am all alone.
You will never lose me, Tru.
But l have to go.
l gotta go.
Har...
Taxi.
Hello.
Thought you'd like to know,
Andrew Webb was cited for speeding...
on December 20 of last year.
Actually, l don't think this is the best time.
ln California.
<i>So? </i>
So, that's the same night
that Sarah called 91 1 here.
<i>Remember, who actuaIIy saw Andrew</i>
<i>that night? </i>
Only Sarah.
The cops never found him. Why?
Because he wasn't there.
He won't divorce you?
Oh, my God. She set him up.
She's setting Harrison up.
She married me for my money.
Mere, let me ask you a question
about divorce law.
lf you divorce your husband in this state--
You get half community property.
- And if you kill him?
- You go to jail.
What's this about?
But if you have someone else kill him,
you get it all...
and the poor schmuck goes to jail.
You said it was gonna be unlocked.
l was surprised when you called me.
l thought you couldn't stand
being around me.
Usually l can't.
Except when my electrician is unavailable.
Charming as always, Sarah.
All right, your wiring looks fine.
How can you listen to this music?
l can't even hear myself think.
- Could you hear that?
- No. l didn't hear anything, Andrew.
Okay, l heard that. Andrew, be careful.
- All right, just call the police.
- Okay.
Kill him, Harrison.
Kill him or he'll kill us both.
No.
- l can't.
- You're a coward.
l may be...
but, God, l'm not a killer. l can't do it.
You are now.
Your blood is in my house,
your prints are on the gun.
Luckily, l was able
to wrestle it away from you.
Sarah.
Take my advice and claim self- defense...
although that would be hard to prove
with you breaking in and all.
<i>91 1. </i>
Yes, hi.
l would like to report a murder.
My husband is dead.
What is going on here?
Conspiracy to commit murder, l'd say.
l got the strangest phone call today.
l know you don't want to talk to me,
but l need you to listen.
Some girl begged me
to wear a bullet- proof vest.
l would have protected you.
You know that, right?
Goodbye, Sarah.
You should've taken half.
You know, l'm not sure l can buy
that whole"reliving a day" thing.
Can't say l blame you.
But let's say that l did...
if what you said is true.
Do you think yesterday l killed him?
l don't know. Maybe.
Probably.
How's your head?
lt hurts. Like my pride.
Of course, if you can really do
what you say...
l'll tell you,
we've really turned a nice profit.
l already did.
<i>So, I took your advice. </i>
<i>We came back to my apartment, </i>
<i>James and me. </i>
We just talked.
<i>You just taIked? </i>
Yeah.
Good, Linds. l'm proud.
<i>And you know what I reaIized? </i>
That James is one boring guy.
So l just slept with him.
l figured that was one way to shut him up.
And?
<i>It was nice. </i>
lt was very nice.
We're going for sushi tomorrow night.
Good thing l didn't take your advice, huh?
Yeah. Good thing.
Oh, you made it.
l wasn't sure if you would.
- You were right, Davis.
- l was? About what?
l think there is a reason l'm here.
A good one.
Yeah. l thought you might come around.
<i>Presidents. $1,600. </i>
<i>1979. </i>
- Hey, Tru.
- Hey, yourself.
lt's a slow night.
Not one pickup since lunch.
These guys are such brainiacs.
The only questions l know
are about <i>GiIIigan's IsIand. </i>
What are orchids?
<i>What are orchids? </i>
<i>FIowers. $1,600. </i>
What, a rerun?
<i>...are sometimes known</i>
<i>as crane fIowers. </i>
Not for you.
Actually, it' a summer internship...
but sky's the limit. That would be me,
you know? It's always....
- What's going on?
- Come on. It's time.
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.
She's not gonna call me.
Move. Watch it!
I didn't miss it, did I? Did I miss it?
No, you did not.
- Where the hell is Blake?
- Late.
- Why should tonight be different?
- Because it's our last night together.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
- I ran into my ex.
Which one?
To be honest,
I can't even tell them apart no more.
All right, glasses up.
Gentlemen, it took us four years.
Excuse me, Ethan, five.
But as of tonight, we are free men.
The scenery may change,
but our friendship won't.
To the best night of our lives!
Pretty out here.
I should get outside more often.
Harrison, I came here to talk.
Okay, someone dies, asks for help,
and you repeat a day.
There, we talked.
Not quite what I meant by talking.
We all have our things:
Meredith has her drugs,
I have....
I got everything else.
And you got this:
your strange belief that you go back a day
and save innocent lives.
I know where it comes from.
No one expected you to save her, Tru.
This is not about our mother.
I took a semester of psych
back in high school.
It's always about
someone's mother.
Maybe you should just try
and leave the past alone.
I can't...
because it won't leave me alone.
Help me.
Who would have thought of hiding
the spare under the doormat?
You might consider a lighting fixture.
Both unique and efficient.
Please tell me you brought coffee.
Blueberry Danish,
tuna, dry on whole- wheat...
and a veggie burrito
from that place you like on Larkin.
With your bizarre hours, I couldn't decide
what meal you'd be on by now.
You are a good woman.
So, how are you?
- Pick a subject.
- I'll take"Boys" for $200.
Okay, I know Evans didn't end well,
but you have to get back out there.
I just read
in a very legitimate publication...
that one out of every seven guys
is a keeper.
More like one in a million.
Look, I gotta shower.
Is there anything you want to say to me?
Yes. Thank you for my breakfast goodies.
You're welcome.
That's what friends are for.
Nasty.
Tru.
Gardez?
Oh, my God!
Is everything all right here?
Yeah, Gardez is an ass.
Everything's normal.
- You should've seen the look on her face.
- Hysterical.
Tru, come on. Lighten up.
Looks like I got a pickup. A real one.
- You okay?
- Yeah, whatever.
Davis, do you think he's right?
Do you think
I take everything too seriously?
Gardez sees dead bodies.
You see the people they used to be.
He doesn't understand that.
But you do?
Just don't let him get to you.
Hi, come on in.
I know we're all working late
these days, Meredith...
but the firm's board is insisting...
that we implement a random
drug- testing program for our employees.
Now?
Unbelievable. Can I have my assistant
back when he's done?
Actually, we're all being tested.
Liability issue.
Just check in at the table
in front of the restrooms.
Yeah, sure.
Nice.
Did I do that yesterday?
Harrison.
It's a reasonable question,
for someone like you.
- You gotta admit, it's frigging weird.
- I told you, not every day repeats.
In fact, most of them don't.
That's too bad.
'Cause if your little fantasy was real,
today would be a hell of a day to do over.
- What do you mean?
- You know, the whole Meredith thing.
She didn't tell you?
Drug test at her office today.
She failed it and they fired her.
Oh, my God.
So you see my point?
You could actually go back today,
bail Meredith out...
and we wouldn't be
having this conversation.
Harrison, I can't control when it happens.
So what do we do?
Nothing tonight.
We'll check in with her tomorrow.
See how she's doing.
What if tomorrow is just today
all over again?
Bite me, Harrison.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure, Davis, anything.
Does this lab coat make me look portly?
No, you look fine.
I just overheard you mention
that black was more....
I think you called it"slimming."
I was gonna see
if they came in a different color, maybe.
Gardez must have been driving
all over the city.
Actually, they all came in
on the same pickup.
It's five dead males, mid- to- late- 20s.
Time of death is between 10:30 and 1 1:00.
I lifted the personals,
if you want to start bagging.
Any lDs?
Wallets were missing.
The prelim tox report shows four of them
had pretty high levels of alcohol.
Enough to kill them?
Probably not.
But there is something strange
about this fifth guy.
He had no alcohol in his system...
but he did have a trace
of a chemical called Avlocardyl.
One of them was married.
That's a shame.
What else can you tell me?
And one of them was making friends.
Is there anything you want to say to me?
I suck.
Hello.
- I'm looking for Gardez. Is he....
- Out on a pickup.
Can I take a message?
Sure, yeah.
I'm a friend of a friend.
He hooked me up with a job interview...
and in case I don't get the gig...
I thought I'd thank him
while I was still in town.
Job interview. Those are always fun.
What was it for?
Photographer.
Postmortem?
Crime scene. Upstairs. Sheriff's office.
Right, of course. How'd it go?
I don't know.
I was meeting with the Sheriff
about half an hour.
Then I walked out and realized
I had something stuck in my teeth.
Sexy.
I'm not sure the Sheriff thought so.
I should get your name for the message.
It's Luc, with a"C."
Tru, with a"U."
Is this man bothering you?
Yes, Davis. Please have him escorted
from the building.
Really?
No.
- Davis, this is Luc.
- Yeah, we met earlier.
I got lost on my way to the interview.
Thanks for the directions.
I'm sure Gardez will be back pretty soon,
if you just want to hang out till--
<i>HeIp me. </i>
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just have to--
<i>HeIp me. </i>
Would you mind waiting here
for one second?
I just need to....I'm sorry.
Excuse me, Davis.
She does that a lot.
- Help me.
- Save us.
- We need you.
- Please.
- Help me.
Who would have thought of putting
the spare key under the doormat?
Very clever.
Okay, so I brought you....
Blueberry Danish, tuna on whole- wheat,
and a veggie burrito?
- Okay, how'd you know that?
- The same way I know it's your birthday.
My God, you remembered.
<i>The sad thing is no one eIse did. </i>
- Thank you.
- Of course. How could I forget?
Harrison, I don't need you to believe me.
I just need your help.
This is the first time it wasn't
just one body asking for help. It was five.
I didn't see their faces,
they came with no lDs...
which means it's gonna be
five times harder for me to save them.
I gotta be honest.
It's early in the day
to have this conversation.
I think one of them was poisoned, but
I've no idea what happened to the others.
- And you're telling me this because....
- Because I need info...
and you're more familiar with this world
than I am.
Listen, Starsky,
if you're asking me to be your Hutch...
I'm gonna have to say,
"Thanks, but no, thanks."
Strippers, Harr?
Okay. I'm in.
I was wondering if you could tell me
where I could find a girl named Turquoise?
We don't give that information
to customers.
- I'm not really a customer.
- You here to audition?
- Do I look like a stripper to you?
- A little bit.
I thought you said
bartenders knew everything.
I got nowhere with that guy.
- Did you work it?
- What do you mean"work it"?
You gotta have an angle
to get information, Tru.
By the way,
that Turquoise girl you're looking for?
Her real name is Tara.
She's got a day job doing telemarketing
in the Hancock Building.
No way!
Come on, Tru.
You know I got a way with the ladies.
<i>My friend here toId me everything. </i>
Harrison, thank you. Seriously.
I'll call you later, okay?
Right, yeah. I'm right behind you.
I'm just gonna....
I'm just gonna stay, and check it out here.
What's up?
She's right over there.
I just need to take down
your information.
- Tara?
- Yes.
Hi, I'm putting together a little party...
and was wondering
if you were booked for the night?
- I'm sorry?
- Or are you working at the club?
Why are you coming in here
and asking me questions like that?
I'm sorry, my bad.
I didn't know how--
It's okay.
It's just that no one here
really knows what my other job is.
I can relate.
But anyway, I am booked for the night.
Got an out- call gig.
Some bachelor party at the Pierpont.
A bachelor party.
Would you happen to know
who hired you?
Everything's handled by a booking service.
- Right.
- Look, I gotta get back to work.
Good luck with whatever it is
you're planning.
Can I help you?
I'm here about the bachelor party.
Right, Room 1712. It's called for 7:00...
but the entertainment
doesn't usually get here until after dark.
Why does everyone think
I look like a stripper?
It's a bachelor party.
Who else would you be?
Right, good point.
So help me out, you know,
to know what to expect.
Is there anyone else working the party?
A waiter, bartender?
They've declined those options.
So no one but the guests
will be in the room tonight?
- And you.
- And me.
And one more thing.
I had a question for the groom,
but I can't seem to find his number.
It's not our practice
to give out guests' personal information.
Too bad. He hadn't decided
whether he wants me naughty or nice.
There's no way
I'll cancel my bachelor party.
- It's my last night of freedom.
- No, you don't understand.
No, I think I do.
Robin sent you, didn't she?
No, that's not--
She hates it that I'm having this party...
almost as much as she hates
the guys I invited.
Robin's not a fan of your friends?
Okay, now this is starting to freak me out.
If Robin didn't send you,
then who the hell are you?
I'm with the hotel,
and there's a problem with your room, sir.
So they sent me personally
to explain the situation.
- What's wrong with the room?
- We're overbooked.
It has been way too long
since these guys have gotten together.
There's nothing that's gonna get me
to call this off.
Right, but--
Know what?
I'll just call the hotel manager
and straighten this out.
No need.
I'm sure we can figure something out.
Avlocardyl? This newfound fascination...
- with this obscure drug stems from--
- Homework.
Just studying for the MCATs.
I can save you a lot of time.
This will never be on the test.
- I like to be really prepared.
- Okay.
Avlocardyl is a white, odorless,
crystalline powder that's soluble in water.
- Is that better?
- Much.
So it can be ingested
without the victim's knowledge?
In a liquid, yes. But what victim?
Is there any way to tell if someone
has Avlocardyl in their system?
Not right away.
But after two or three hours, sure.
- How?
- They'd be dead.
I think there's something in the drinks.
Only that makes sense.
I have to replace all the alcohol
in the suite before the boys arrive.
Then I have to find out who put it there.
Yeah, and this involves me how?
I need you to find a girl.
Her name is Robin Wilson.
- Jackpot. That I can do.
<i>I got her name off a bridaI registry. </i>
She's gonna get married in a week--
Rewind. Married?
Look, Tru, I got my hands full, you know?
<i>You've been having fun aII day. </i>
Five guys are gonna be dead by 10:30
if I don't find a way to stop it.
Do I have to list the number of times
I've bailed you out...
- because I'm running out of time here.
- Fine.
But playing the guilt card's
really not like you, Tru.
You're starting to sound
like somebody else.
Who?
<i>Meredith. </i>
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Can't a girl hang out with her sister?
Yeah, as long as her sister's not
in the middle of a huge case, which she is.
Mere, I just....
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, like I said, just busy.
With you, I mean.
Is everything okay with you?
I love you. You know that, right?
So don't take it too hard
when I tell you to kiss my--
Tru, you have three looks:
One is,"Have you heard from Harrison?"
Two is,"I miss Mom."
And three is,"Are you clean, Meredith?"
And judging by the downcast eyes,
I'm gonna go with Number Three.
I'm clean, Tru.
My last slip- up was over a month ago.
It's in the past. God, leave it there.
What if, I don't know...
there were a random drug test today.
It could happen. Would you pass?
This is ridiculous.
I'd pass, Tru.
That's good to hear.
Sorry for doubting you.
She's not with you?
I figured since it was Lindsay's birthday,
she might be with her sister.
All right. Thanks, anyway. Bye.
Hello? Housekeeping.
I have to replace all the alcohol
in the suite.
Here she is.
Sweet.
Yeah, it's nice.
What are you doing?
- I'm the bartender.
Nice.
This room is sick!
Nice to see you again.
I didn't know you were the bartender.
That's funny,
I could've sworn I didn't ask for one.
You didn't.
The hotel threw me in gratis
to make up for the problem with the room.
Nice.
- Anyway, what would you like?
Scotch. Straight.
Gentlemen, a toast.
Yes.
To the best night of our lives.
<i>Cheers. </i>
Sorry I'm late.
You know, as a rule,
the best man should never be late.
No one ever said I was the best.
I'm just better than the rest of you idiots.
Look at this guy.
Come here.
Yeah, what's up?
A sixth guy just showed up.
<i>So? </i>
Only five bodies came into the morgue.
Somebody here doesn't die.
<i>Let's say you're not crazy. </i>
So the sixth guy did it?
No, I never saw any of their faces.
It means any one of them could've done it.
<i>Whoever didn't come in dead, </i>
<i>that's the kiIIer. </i>
That's a hell of a pour, girl.
You do know that Seven and Seven
isn't seven shots of alcohol, right?
Of course. You think this is my first day?
What's going on?
You look rough. Things okay?
I've just been going through some stuff.
A night out with the boys
is probably just what you need. Thank you.
You don't think it's wrong,
all of us being here together?
I think what's wrong
is you bringing that up.
<i>Why don't you just reIax, </i>
<i>have another drink, and just chiII out? </i>
<i>AII that stuff is in the past. </i>
- Can I get you something?
- No, I'll get it myself.
You don't want any of that, trust me.
The hotel always buys the cheap stuff.
We need to teach you to appreciate
a smooth, well- aged scotch.
So, John says you're a gift
from the hotel.
Be sure
to tell your manager thanks.
- No problem.
- Better yet...
why don't you give me his name?
I'd like to do it myself.
Actually, he's probably home
with the wife and kids by now.
But if I do my job right, I'll make sure
he finds you first thing in the morning.
<i>Go! </i>
<i>Now do the other one. </i>
<i>Do the other one. </i>
Hey, who brought this? Ethan? Cordoza?
Hello, boys. Entertainment's here.
I'm gonna go get a little more comfortable.
<i>Why don't you aII do the same thing? </i>
Shake this way.
All right!
Everything okay?
I mean, can I get you a cocktail?
How about a club soda
made to look like a vodka and soda?
Okay. You driving or something?
- No, I'm just sober. Eighteen months.
- Congrats.
I used to drink pretty hardcore
back in the day.
That's how I dealt with things.
But I don't want to bring everybody down,
you know?
I'd rather keep it quiet.
<i>No traces of aIcohoI in his system. </i>
Don't worry. It'll be our little secret.
Thanks. Cheers.
Would carbonation
speed up the effects of Avlocardyl?
I'm doing great, thanks.
Did you know if you squeeze
all the bacteria out of the intestines...
you have enough to fill a coffee mug?
Hello, Davis. Now about my question?
Carbonation. Not that I know of.
<i>I don't think....</i>
Are you at a party?
I'm guessing
this isn't the Sheriff's office, is it?
Hold on a second.
It's down the hall, up the stairs.
<i>Is that Luc? </i>
- Wish him luck on his interview.
- Good luck on your interview.
Thanks.
And tell him to check his teeth.
<i>Is he a friend of yours? </i>
- Could be. Just tell him.
Excuse me.
You may want to check your teeth.
Thanks.
So, what about alcohol?
How does it react with Avlocardyl?
<i>It wouIdn't. </i>
Alcohol acts as a masking agent,
covering all signs of the drug in the body.
So, say I would take a swig,
and then have three or four martinis.
<i>ShouId I be concerned with-- </i>
- It's a simple question.
Avlocardyl plus liquor equals a dead body
with no traceable cause of death.
They were all poisoned.
The alcohol covered it up.
Thanks for the assist.
Go!
Looks like somebody's married.
Yeah, he's got a kid on the way, too.
<i>It means any one of them couId've done it. </i>
You don't look so hot.
If I didn't know you weren't drinking,
I'd cut you off.
I needed some air. It's a tough room.
You guys haven't seen each other
since college, right?
I mean, shouldn't this be
one big, happy reunion?
Right. Everyone says
they're the best years of your life.
It doesn't always work out that way.
Are you okay?
Just some things I wish
I could go back and undo, you know?
<i>Make right. </i>
Do you ever feel that way?
All the time.
Maybe some of these guys
can deal with what happened but....
What? Did something happen
back in college?
- We didn't even know her name.
- Who?
The girl from the video?
Hey, buddy.
Hey, Blake.
Where you been?
I bought you a lap dance.
She's waiting on you. Get in there.
I think your break is over.
Hi, come on in.
I know we're all working late
these days, Meredith...
but the firm's board is insisting...
that we implement a random
drug- testing program for our employees.
Unbelievable.
Anyway, it shouldn't take
more than a few minutes.
If you want to check in at the table
in front of the restrooms.
Yeah, sure.
No, that's fine. Her name's not Lenny.
Don't worry, you've got two hours
to scrape the frosting off and start over.
Hey, we're taking up a collection
to keep the party moving.
- You seen Blake?
- No.
Oh, she's all snuggly.
<i>They aII got girIfriends, sweetheart. </i>
- What are you--
- You want to tell me what this is?
I was trying to keep track of your orders.
I was forgetting--
I checked with the hotel.
No record of them sending a bartender.
- More importantly, no record of you.
- All right. Nice work. I'm busted.
I'm calling security
and having your ass thrown out of here.
Hey, knock it off! I said, stop!
Get your hands off me.
Come on, it's a party.
- You think that's funny? You're sick.
- It's fine. He didn't mean it.
Settle down. I think you're blowing this
out of proportion.
You know what, I'm just gonna
take a couple of minutes. Cool down.
Nice work.
Tara, are you....
Wait, what are you doing?
You ask too many questions.
Get out.
Listen, don't do this.
How did you know?
<i>WaIIets were missing. </i>
- You're just ripping them off?
- What did you think I was doing?
Look, I have never done this before,
I swear.
- Are you gonna call the cops?
No.
- What's that?
- Tequila.
I didn't bring tequila.
I found it behind the bar.
I've been drinking it since I got here.
Wait a second.
If it's not in the alcohol, then what's it in?
Oh, my God.
<i>There's something in the drinks. </i>
<i>A vIocardyI is soIubIe in water. </i>
The ice.
<i>It's in the ice. </i>
- Davis, it's me.
- For information, please dial 41 1.
Just one more question, I promise.
Is there any way to save a person
once Avlocardyl's in their system?
<i>That must be some party. </i>
<i>Let me check. </i>
Yeah, and it looks like
glucagon is the only known antidote.
Do we have it at the morgue?
Glucagon is a substitute for insulin...
<i>in diabetic emergencies, </i>
<i>so we might have it in the med kit. </i>
- I think it's time you left.
- Hello?
Wait, you can't. You don't understand.
- Something is gonna happen.
That's right.
You're gonna be escorted
from the building.
You're making a mistake.
I'm impressed.
You scared the hell out of me.
It took me four months
before I stole anything from the office.
Davis, I'm sorry--
Tru, don't.
I've been listening to
your mildly entertaining stories all day.
Obviously, something's up in your life.
I don't know if you're in trouble.
I just hope that one day you'll realize
you can be honest with me.
- Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
- Maybe I wasn't listening.
I know something happened in college
and what you're willing to do to cover up.
No one knows anything
except the five guys in that room.
What happened to the girl? Who was she?
- You can't hide from the past.
- Don't you think I know that?
Was it Ethan? What did he say?
No, nothing. He just....
lce.
I thought it was you,
but you didn't plan tonight, did you?
No. What does that have to do
with anything?
<i>Don't know</i>
<i>what you're up to...</i>
but I finally found Robin Wilson.
Only she isn't any bride.
- Who's that?
- What?
Get off the phone. Now.
She caught the guy cheating on her,
called the wedding off.
- That was three months ago.
- Right.
You've got 10 seconds to explain yourself.
This isn't a bachelor party, Blake.
The wedding was called off months ago.
That's crazy.
Why else would John want us all here?
Because you share a secret
he doesn't want you to tell.
Whatever happened in college, whatever
happened to that girl, it was John.
John did it.
Let me help you.
What's she still doing here?
I thought I told you to get rid of her.
She's got an interesting story
you all might want to hear.
Not to be a pain in the ass,
but we had her thrown out.
- Now you want us to listen to her?
- I think we've all been silent long enough.
This isn't a bachelor party.
Not anymore.
You scared off the stripper,
we're running out of booze--
John and his fianc嶪 broke up months ago.
Any of you guys know that?
Is that true, John?
Look, I can explain everything.
Come on, guys.
The best night of our lives, remember?
Thanks, guys.
- No, don't.
- Just give me a minute.
Going somewhere?
What's the point in hanging around?
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends.
They can't be that good friends, John.
They still thought
you were getting married.
It's not exactly an easy thing...
to admit that your relationship failed,
you know?
I was gonna tell them all tonight.
I thought everybody
could use a good party.
With plenty of drinks.
On the rocks, right?
God, that's a long way to go
to cover up a murder.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Let me fill you in on a few things.
The first is one of your friends
wasn't drinking alcohol tonight.
So, sure,
he's got the Avlocardyl in his system...
but without the alcohol to hide it...
at some point,
someone's gonna figure out what you did.
And second,
it's a little bartending trick I picked up.
Even if you're drinking it straight,
like you...
if you want to keep the drink cool...
you shake a little crushed ice
in the bottom of the glass.
<i>Yes, every gIass, John. </i>
Of course, if you didn't mess with the ice...
then you won't need the antidote
your best man has in the next room.
- Five years late.
That's what I don't get.
Why now, after all this time?
Three weeks ago, I sent him a letter
saying I was going to the police.
You?
I couldn't take it anymore...
and I tried to make it right.
lnstead, I almost got us all killed.
What happened?
Catherine Hill.
We didn't even know her name
until we read it in the papers.
She was a freshman, made the mistake
of coming to a graduation party.
<i>John got her aIone in a room. </i>
It's a little close, isn't it?
That hurts. Stop it. I told you, no!
- Who said it was up to you?
- Let go of me.
A girlfriend once said he slapped her.
He denied it and we believed him.
When he told us what happened that night
was an accident, we didn't believe him.
<i>We didn't say anything. </i>
<i>To anybody. </i>
And you sent a letter? That's something.
I didn't have the guts to sign it.
He didn't know which one of us
was turning him in.
So he had to kill all of you.
I'm sorry for not trusting you.
But with everything...
I barely trust myself.
You did the right thing.
Five years too late.
Surprise!
Surprise!
Tru.
- You need something?
- How'd you know?
You take the fun out of everything.
It was fun for me.
Hello?
I'm sure you won't be surprised to hear
there was a drug test at my office.
Obviously, you knew something
and opted not to tell me...
so I just called specifically
to not say"thank you."
<i>But in case you're curious, </i>
<i>I passed the test. </i>
Maybe now you'll get off my back
and let my past stay in the past.
Meredith, I wasn't trying to prove a point.
I was just trying to help.
- And I did, didn't I?
- Good night, Tru.
- You wanted to see me?
- Close the door.
Thanks for covering that
for me.
No problem.
I've never been paid
to provide a sample before.
But I gotta ask, how did you know
there was gonna be a drug test today?
I just had a feeling.
I just don't get it.
I went through all this
to save these five guys...
and now there's a chance they'll go to jail.
What's the point?
Look, Tru, this thing you're dealing with....
Maybe for you,
it's about more than just saving people.
See, these guys had a secret,
and they put it to rest.
Maybe, I don't know....
Maybe you can try and do the same.
So Lindsay has this theory.
One out of every seven guys is a good one.
I've spent an entire evening
with six guys that were bad.
So does that make you Number Seven?
I wouldn't bet on it.
Don't worry, Tru.
He's out there.
You know him?
No, not yet.
Daddy, I'm leaving.
But you won't even
let me finish.
Sweetheart, please don't go. Not like this.
Paige, I promise you,
there's nothing wrong with my baby girl.
I'm not a baby. And I'm not your girl.
Paige....
Don't touch me.
God, have you ever considered
that nothing happened?
That this is all just
a figment of your imagination?
I give myself more credit than that.
Because pretty soon,
the truth is gonna come out.
And when it does,
I can promise you one thing.
I'm not the only one
who's gonna have to deal with it.
<i>You are, Daddy. </i>
Paige!
Okay, hotshot. Bonus question.
You ready?
Hit me.
Riddle me this: The odontoid ligaments
serve to limit the extent to which?
The cranium's rotation can be carried...
which is why they're also known as
check ligaments.
- You gonna eat that?
- It's all yours, smarty- pants.
I am finished with
cramming for your MCATs.
Davis, come on.
We haven't even started
on the sympathetic nervous system.
You know the secret for acing the MCATs?
Quit cramming. Get some sleep.
Go home, Tru.
I'm just so excited.
If I ace the MCATs tomorrow,
I get into medical school.
I do that, I become a doctor.
And if I become a doctor,
I can finally say goodbye....
To working here?
Come on, I didn't mean it like that.
Don't worry.
I got a feeling it's not gonna happen.
You think I won't pass?
I nailed every question you asked.
Plus the ones you made up.
No, that's not what I meant.
I'm sure you'll ace them.
I just meant that...
sometimes I get the feeling that
some people don't belong here.
And some people do.
So which am I? I belong here or not?
What do you think?
Help me!
Hello?
Bitch Cakes. Hey, it's Lindsay.
I guessed.
So listen. I found a guy.
I'm shocked.
<i>Not for me. For you. </i>
His name's Jeremy.
I haven't met him, but he's your type.
If you've never met him,
how do you know he's my type?
Tru, it's my gift.
So stop asking questions...
and start looking for that
black Dolce & Gabbana dress...
I got you last Christmas.
Lindsay, we've been through this.
I'm not on the market,
and I'm taking my MCATs this afternoon.
<i>Perfect. You'II meet him after. </i>
And don't worry, I'll be there to chaperone,
so now you're all out of excuses.
<i>Say you'II be there. </i>
I'll be there.
<i>Smart girI. </i>
Good luck on your test.
<i>Thanks. </i>
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look like crap.
Thanks, Harrison. Very sweet.
I told you I've been up studying all night,
because in 45 minutes...
I'm gonna take the biggest test of my life.
- Right. The Top Cats.
- MCATs.
I just want to know you're okay.
Outside the big test jitters,
I'm fine, thanks.
Is everything else copasetic?
Feeling good? Having fun?
Look, you know me.
I'm always looking out for you.
Because I know you'd do
the same thing for me.
- All right, what do you want?
- Nothing, man. What?
A guy can't worry about his own sister...
without being
accused of working an angle?
Jeez. I'm offended.
How could you actually say that to me?
It's about what I told you, isn't it?
About me....You know, what I can do.
Okay. A: I don't even believe you.
And B: Even if I did,
I would still need some cold, hard...
proof.
The racing form?
You want me to believe you, right?
<i>WeII, here's a way. </i>
<i>I go to the track, I see who wins. </i>
I call you up on the phone,
tell you the horses' names...
and tomorrow should you, you know,
do that voodoo you do so well....
- You make money.
- Yeah.
Harrison, I don't think that's how it works.
I'm not even sure it works at all.
But I've heard of weirder systems,
so I say, what the hell, give it a shot.
Are you down with this,
or do I have to go work for a living?
I'll see what I can do. But now I gotta go.
I love my sister.
Go. Go take your MCATs.
Kick much academic ass.
Thanks.
Time.
Time's up, people. Pencils down.
To my best friend, Tru,
who just aced her MCATs...
and who will make
a wonderful doctor someday.
- Cheers.
- I'm not done yet.
And who will always squeeze me in
on short notice...
and accept
whatever health insurance I carry.
- Of course.
- Okay. Cheers.
Is that him?
It's gotta be.
God, can I pick them, or can I pick them?
Hey, Jeremy?
Yes.
Hi.
Jeremy.
That's me.
But you can't be Tru,
you're too good to be true.
Yeah, my name does lend itself
to more obvious puns.
I spent all day thinking that up.
Do you mind?
I don't usually go on blind dates.
Who knows what you're gonna get?
<i>So at first I was aII, Iike, wait, </i>
<i>she works in a morgue? </i>
'Cause I mean, come on,
you're too hot to work in a morgue.
You ought to switch jobs.
You ought to be in, like,
videos or something.
- I have to go.
- Right. Night shift. Creepy.
So, I'll call you.
Wait, you forgot to give me your number.
- Luc. Hi.
- Hi.
- Have we met?
- Yeah.
In the we've- never- actually- met
kind of way.
I heard there might be a new guy.
That would be me. Luc.
Tru.
- Dress code?
- Blind date.
Bad one.
Well, is there any other kind?
My friend, Lindsay,
thinks it's her life's work to fix me up.
She worried you can't meet a nice guy?
Worried I can't meet a living one.
She shouldn't worry.
- I mean....
- Why? Know someone for me?
Give me some time.
Anyway, I gotta run.
My folks are in town,
but it's nice to meet you.
Yeah.
Tru.
Luc.
Hello?
<i>Hey, it's me. </i>
And I hold in my hands
the key to financial freedom.
A job application?
<i>That's very funny. </i>
But no.
What I have are the winning horses
from the last race at Del Mar.
Great.
<i>It's a 40- to- 1 trifecta, Tru. </i>
So write this down.
Today's lucky ponies are...
Cherry Top, Sky Marker, and Whirligig.
You know, I have no idea
why I can do what I do...
but I'm pretty sure
it's not so I can pick the ponies.
<i>TeII me you got them. </i>
I got them, okay, you happy?
No. But I will be tomorrow...
if my big sister's
as lucky as she claims to be.
I gotta go. I love you.
Tru?
I didn't hear you come in.
Hi.
I meant to tell you,
you got a call from County Records today.
Something about
an autopsy report you requested.
Yeah, my mother's.
Stupid.
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry.
Had I known,
I would've authorized delivery.
- But since I didn't know, I just didn't--
- It's okay. I'll get them tomorrow.
No, not likely.
The clerk went on vacation tonight
for a couple of weeks.
<i>With aII the red tape downtown...</i>
you'll probably have to wait
till he gets back.
It's okay. I've waited ten years.
Another few weeks won't kill me, right?
Still, I can't help but wonder...
if those are the answers
you're really looking for.
Why, what are you--
We got a cold one.
The name's Paige Sanders.
Medical student at Hudson.
Well, until 4:31 today.
Hudson? That's the top medical school
in the state.
Didn't do her any good.
How'd she die?
Here's a guess.
Knowing the high- pressure world
of most med students...
I would posit this one worked hard.
But apparently played
a wee bit harder.
Overdose? God, that makes no sense.
<i>Hudson gets their pick of the best</i>
<i>and the brightest. She had it aII. </i>
What can I tell you?
Some students
can hack the pressure.
And some can't.
Yeah, but why would she--
Never met a newbie as curious as you.
Relax. You can't help her now.
Come on, Davis,
what more can you tell me?
It looks like we have
a little petechial imaging in the eye.
<i>UsuaIIy associated</i>
<i>with some sort of trauma. </i>
Could be a side effect of the drug intake.
Coughing, vomiting,
internal pressure of some kind.
Wow. Someone's gonna do well
on their MCATs.
<i>That's good. </i>
Just to be sure, we should prepare
the body for a toxicology report.
I want to know exactly what chemicals
were in the student's body when she died.
Hey, wait up, Davis.
You have no idea how lucky you were.
Save me.
Hello?
Bitch Cakes. Hey, it's Lindsay.
<i>Too tired to taIk? Okay, fine. </i>
<i>'Cause I found a guy. His name's Jeremy. </i>
And he's totally your type.
Good morning.
You ever have, like,
one of the greatest days of your life?
I mean, a really truly great day...
and then just feel like
the whole thing got erased?
You're assuming
I've ever had a great day?
What are you doing?
I'm just checking for something.
Hey, did we get any
medical students last night?
The only medical student here is you
in a couple of hours.
- Aren't you taking the MCATs today?
- I did.
I will. I just have to do one thing first.
You have quite the life, don't you?
Unfortunately, yeah.
And, Davis,
if County Records just happens to call...
go ahead and authorize the delivery.
I want those files.
My God, Luc, I'm sorry.
Here, let me help you.
No, thanks. Really. I got it.
Tell me it's fixable.
Well, I would.
But then I'd probably be lying.
How did you know my name?
What?
You called me Luc just now,
but we've never met before.
I'm a lucky guesser.
Yeah, well...
nice running into you.
Tell me this day gets better.
Check again. My records have to be here.
Are you sure you're using
that thing right?
Hello?
<i>Tru? Where are you? </i>
Oh, God. Harrison, breakfast.
Why did you blow me off?
I've been waiting half an hour.
It's not my fault.
I'm having one of those mornings.
So, you're telling me what?
We already had this conversation?
Do you have the racing form
in front of you?
It proves nothing.
Except that if you're having
one of your so- called lucky days...
you should be telling me
today's winning horses.
I don't remember.
What?
They were horse things.
How am I supposed to remember them?
You know, you talk a good game,
but I knew you couldn't do it, Tru.
<i>I knew it. See you. </i>
It's Hansen. Jessica Hansen.
The transfer should've come in hours ago
from Harvard Medical.
I'll be sure to let you know
the moment they come in.
You do that.
Hi.
Just a thought,
but when her files come in...
you should bounce them back
to Harvard just for laughs.
Don't give me any ideas.
What can I do for you?
My friend, Paige Sanders, is a student.
I want to surprise her.
Do you know where I can find her now?
- I'm not allowed to say.
- I get that.
Too bad, though.
She just got a residency
at the Mayo Clinic...
and I'd love to see the look
on Harvard's face...
when she learns my friend got in
and she didn't.
Goddard Building, Theater C.
- But you didn't hear it from me.
- Didn't hear what from you?
Mr. Taggert, would you tell
your fellow surgeons in training...
what exactly you're doing
to this poor dead man's heart?
Like you taught, sir...
I'm just making a cut
between the inferior vena cava....
And the what? Anyone?
Eustachian valve.
Good.
Taking particular care not to sever....
Miss Sanders?
<i>Name's Paige Sanders. </i>
Save me.
Miss Sanders?
The....
Anterior margin.
The....
The answer I'm looking for
is the anterior margin.
Right. No, and I knew that. I just--
We all knew the answer, Miss Sanders.
The question is time. Time matters.
<i>To us, time is the difference</i>
<i>between Iife and death. </i>
Time has value, Miss Sanders.
And please do not waste our time.
<i>For those of us</i>
<i>who may actuaIIy become doctors...</i>
our minds are the most valuable tools
we possess.
And we must keep them sharp
at all times.
Thank you. See you next week.
Take your notes.
"The mind's the most valuable tool."
He should know.
He's the biggest tool on campus.
He acts like he's Zeus or something.
I hate that.
Well, the least he can do is realize
that he's not a god.
I am.
Hey, Sanders.
Nice work in there. Very impressive.
Give me a break, both of you guys, okay?
I'm not in the mood.
Relax, Sanders, it's us.
Excuse me?
Hi. You guys are second- years, right?
Yeah, that's right. Who's asking?
The name's Hansen. Jessica Hansen.
I just got in from Harvard today.
Jessica Hansen.
- Yeah, I saw you inside.
- You were observing us.
Yeah, what can I say?
I'm just naturally curious.
Good for you. Welcome to Hudson.
But as you've observed,
we are second- years...
which means we're busy.
Hey, is it true what they say
about you guys?
Don't know.
What is it exactly they say about us?
- That you're good.
- They'd be right about that.
What else do they say?
That you throw the best parties,
well- connected...
got some heavy- hitting careers
lined up for yourselves.
But that's not the whole story, is it?
Look, I'm cool with it, you guys.
I came here to hook up
with some color- outside- the- lines types.
Maybe we are. Maybe we aren't.
My question would be, what's it to you?
Like I said, I'm just trying
to make some new friends.
By the way, that professor
had no right to talk to you that way.
The name's Paige,
and I can take care of myself.
I believe it.
Listen, I just got out of
one Alpha Boys' Club.
<i>I'm new in town. </i>
<i>Come on, heIp a sister out. </i>
Just welcome me to campus.
I'll buy you a meal.
- I can't. We....
- We're busy.
- Doing what?
- Nothing that concerns you.
But go ahead, enjoy your meal.
We're not doing anything without you.
Okay.
I can't remember the last time I sat down
and ate a solid meal.
I thought you might need a break.
You got that whole"overachiever"
thing going for you.
Yeah, right. I'm doing everything I can
just to keep up.
You seem to push yourself pretty hard.
Yeah, but I mean, who doesn't?
You, me. I mean,
it's the whole med school thing, right?
You pass your MCATs...
always busting your ass
trying to max out your potential.
It must be nice.
I just, you know, have to stop
and appreciate it sometimes.
Not everyone's so lucky. We got in.
So let me ask you.
Is everyone here
as uptight as your friends?
Those guys, you know, they're all right.
You know what
the competition can do to you.
Sure. But that doesn't mean...
we have to hurt ourselves
just to keep up with them.
What are you talking about?
Sorry.
Hello? Now?
Yeah. No, I'll be right there. All right.
Listen, thanks for lunch,
but I gotta run.
Paige. I know.
You know what?
About the drugs.
I don't know if you do it to keep up,
or to wind down--
Drugs? What are you talking about?
What kind of freak are you?
- Okay, now I'm confused.
- Don't touch me.
Don't come near me.
I don't know what your psycho agenda is,
but screw you.
Stay away from me.
Finally.
Yeah, we are up and running.
Congratulations, Doctor. We did it.
He's dead.
Looking good. Keep him steady.
Time?
Eight seconds.
Death looks good on you, Steve.
Twelve seconds. We're getting close.
All right, 20 seconds.
Time to do your thing.
Clear.
No change.
Now, that was a trip.
Did it work for you, Steven?
I've got a better question.
What the hell is she doing here?
I could ask you the same thing.
I'll bet your answer's a lot more
interesting than mine.
- Guess again.
- I'm guessing what I just saw...
could get you all kicked out of med school
by lunchtime.
Or we could talk.
So let me get this straight.
You got this little hobby.
- You kill yourselves?
- For starters.
And then you resuscitate.
That's the plan.
But what's the point?
The point, Jessica, is that
when you come back, you're not the same.
You know the urban myth about
how the moment you die...
your whole life flashes before your eyes?
It's true.
Memories. You're unlocking
repressed memories.
And what are they, anyway, memories?
Just chemicals locked in the brain...
between your occipital fissure
and the temporal lobe.
And the best part is, they're just
lying there, waiting to be tapped into.
You guys are good.
Too bad your little experiment kills you.
Almost kills you.
I saw my father's face the day he left me.
I was two- and- a- half when it happened,
and now it's as clear as....
Let's just say hi- def video can kiss my ass,
'cause I have clarity.
Crystal clear memory of that day,
and so much more.
I'm next.
No. Paige, you can't.
You want to dig into your past, I get it.
But there's gotta be a better way.
<i>You can deaI with this. </i>
All you have to do is go to the source.
Find out whoever it is
you have unresolved issues with--
And what,
have a good long talk with them?
See their point of view? Reach closure?
You think I haven't already tried that?
You think this isn't my last resort?
Fine, if you know so much,
you go talk to my father.
Because nothing is gonna stop me.
Hi. I need just one more thing.
Mr. Sanders?
Right block. Wrong house.
Mike Sanders lives right there.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
- Who'd you say you were?
- A friend of Paige's.
We go to school together.
Mr. Sanders, I'm really worried about her.
I think Paige is gonna hurt herself.
No. My daughter would never do
anything like that.
I wish you were right,
but I don't think you are.
And you're the only one who can stop her.
Why am I the only one?
You're her father.
You have a history with Paige that--
Look, whatever she told you
about me isn't true.
Touch my own daughter?
It's sickening just thinking about it.
<i>And the craziest part is, </i>
<i>Paige doesn't remember anything. </i>
Just some nonsense about
the moon and the stars.
The moon and the stars,
what's that mean?
You're her friend. You tell me.
Tru Davies?
Is Tru Davies here?
<i>I thought</i>
<i>you were taking your test. </i>
I am. I'm just going a little late.
I have to find someone first.
<i>I'm gIad I caught you. </i>
Look, I need you to concentrate.
And the names of the horses are....
Harrison, I told you,
I can't remember them.
Look, I'm really sorry, but--
Hey, Hansen?
I gotta go.
Tru!
Were you just talking to my father?
What's wrong with you?
First you force your way into my life,
and then my group, and now my home?
How <i>SingIe White FemaIe</i> are you?
I know I'm butting in,
but just give me one minute to explain.
Okay, one minute.
I was 12 when my mom died.
You were just a kid.
I watched it happen, right in front of me.
I have questions about
my mother's murder...
that I may never be able to answer.
As much as I'd like to know the truth,
it's not worth dying over.
- Yeah, but why do you think I would die?
- Because I've done the research.
The heart can't withstand it,
and if the heart does, the brain can't.
Sure, some people get lucky
and come out okay.
But not everyone. Not you.
Look, do yourself a favor. Call it off.
It's suicide.
I mean, it's not like I've never had doubts.
I mean, I just....
I have these feelings about my past...
and I don't know what else to do.
Talk to your father again.
Or a therapist. Anyone.
Just don't go through
with the experiment.
Fine, I'll call it off.
I don't know why I trust you, but I do.
- I'll tell the guys.
- That's great.
You have no idea how relieved I am.
Harvard, how's it going?
Hey, Dan. I'm glad you're here...
because I wanted to talk to you
about something.
Sure, great, love to hear it.
There's just someone I met
at the sign- ups for Molecular Bio.
I really think that you should meet her.
Hi. Jessica Hansen.
<i>Is this the one you toId me about? </i>
And will the real Jessica Hansen
please stand up?
I don't understand.
Paige, I can explain.
Allow me.
I'm Jessica Hansen.
I transferred from Harvard yesterday...
and this woman here
is trying some lame- ass identity scam.
Which, sorry, honey, it won't work.
And now that's over with.
How about you tell us
who the hell you really are?
Paige, I--
Don't.
Because as far as I'm concerned,
everything you've told me is a lie.
I bet you're not even
a real medical student, are you?
Paige, just wait.
Two hours and counting.
- Steven? Steven, wait up.
- What do you want from me?
- You've got to talk her out of it.
- No way.
It's going to kill her.
No, it won't.
Look at me. I've never been better.
Look, we all have questions
we need answered.
But Paige is gonna make
the biggest mistake of her life...
in just a few hours,
unless you talk her out of it.
A little late for that.
Why?
She's doing it right now.
Okay, ready to come back.
Come on.
I can't get her back. She's not responding.
Got dobutamine?
No.
Dopamine?
No, none of that, either.
She's been under too long.
She should've been out by now.
It's amazing, isn't it?
How thin the line between life and death
can be?
<i>The nearIy instant recovery time. </i>
That's why I designed this
the way that I did.
That's great, Dan.
<i>What wouId you have done</i>
<i>if I couIdn't revive her? </i>
Hey, are you okay?
You saved my life.
You feel like telling us who you really are?
Sure. I just gotta do one thing first.
You've over three hours late.
Better get started then?
Thank you.
Thanks.
It looks like we have
a little petechial imaging in the eye...
usually associated with
some sort of trauma.
My God.
She didn't die from the experiment.
- I'll be right back.
- No.
Once you leave, you're done.
You understand?
You, your test, your future.
I'm sorry, I have to go,
but I can reschedule, right?
Sure.
Just be back here bright and early
first thing next year.
Guess I'll see you next year.
She unlocked a memory, didn't she?
Yeah. But it's none of your business.
Besides, Paige is fine,
and you're not even a medical student.
Well, pretty soon you won't be either
unless you tell me where she is.
You want to play chicken?
Because you're right.
I'm not a med student.
I have nothing to lose, but you do.
Especially with those track marks
on your arm.
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
All she remembered is a man.
He hurt her, touched her.
She wasn't that specific.
And then some crap about
the moon and the stars.
I don't know what it means.
I do.
Paige!
- Where is she?
- I told you, she's not here.
- I really have to find her.
- All right, I've warned you once.
I don't know who you are,
or what you think you're doing...
but this is harassment.
She's in trouble.
You don't understand.
Paige did something tonight.
What'd she do?
A really stupid and dangerous experiment,
but now she remembers everything.
And you think this would
bring her back to me?
Her car's parked out front.
You said something about
the moon and the stars.
That has to mean something.
Go. Just get out of here.
That doesn't make sense.
- Hello?
- Did someone forget her blind date?
No, I didn't forget.
I just couldn't make it this time.
This time?
There was a time
when you could make it?
I'm sorry.
Okay, look, I'll cover.
<i>You're the best. </i>
Bye.
Jeremy, hi.
I'm so sorry. I don't think my friend's
gonna be able to make it tonight.
You're not Tru? Of course not.
You're too good to be true.
Oh, my God, did you just make that up
right now?
That's hilarious.
The moon and the stars. It's the neighbor.
You don't know what you're saying.
For the first time in years,
I know exactly what I am saying.
Paige. You've always been a smart girl.
Be smart now.
I was a child, you son of a bitch. I was 9.
All right, this is ridiculous.
I'm calling your father.
Good. Call my father.
Call the police. Call the District Attorney.
I'm pressing charges.
You are gonna pay for what you did to me.
Just hush.
Don't touch me.
Just be quiet.
Quiet, please!
Don't touch me!
I said, quiet!
Get off me!
Be quiet!
No one's gonna believe you anyway.
I'll believe her.
Get out!
There's a statute of limitations, you know.
It's been years.
Go ahead, go tell the whole world!
Who's gonna believe you?
Oh, God! I'm so sorry, Daddy.
So, how are you feeling?
I thought remembering would be the end.
But it isn't.
It's just the first step.
A lot to be said for a good first step.
So who are you, anyway?
And please don't say Jessica Hansen.
I had to take on her name
so I could talk to you.
I mean, if I told you I was really
just some med school wannabe...
who works in a morgue,
would you have listened?
Probably not. So why'd you help me?
I'm still trying
to figure that out for myself.
I guess you could say it's sort of my job.
Well, if you ever figure it out,
you know where to find me.
I'd like that.
Med school gets a little cold sometimes.
I'll take your word for it.
Good luck.
Hey, Tru?
You'll make one hell of a doctor someday.
Someday, yeah.
<i>So, how'd the MCA Ts go? </i>
They didn't. How did my date go?
<i>Not bad. </i>
Until he used the same line
on the waitress that he used on me.
<i>HonestIy, you didn't miss much. </i>
I had a feeling.
But still, Tru, I'm telling you,
the perfect guy is out there somewhere.
<i>You just haven't met him yet. </i>
That, or I've met him too many times.
<i>ExactIy. </i>
Wait, how's that work?
See you, Linds.
- Hello, again.
- Hi.
I'm gonna try and get past you here
without any hard contact.
Don't want to break anything.
I was thinking
about our little accident earlier.
Maybe it wasn't such a bad thing.
Because otherwise,
we never would've met.
And I'm glad we did.
Yeah. Me, too.
At least this time, you won't forget me.
I don't think I could ever forget you.
Anyway, I gotta go.
- To be continued?
- Absolutely.
Say hi to your folks.
Like I said, lucky guesser.
Hello?
<i>Tru. </i>
Harrison, please.
For the last time, I can't remember--
No. Listen.
I didn't go to the track today after all.
And you know what? I had a great day.
Really?
<i>Yeah, I had some fun. </i>
<i>I read a book. </i>
I can't remember the last time I did that.
And, you know, plus other stuff.
The point is,
I had a hell of a day.
And I didn't need a boost
from my big sister to do it this time.
I'm not surprised. You've just gotta
believe in yourself a little.
Kind of like you?
Just like me. Good night, Harrison.
I knew you didn't need this.
Hey, you were right.
County Records called.
It's your mom's file.
Whenever you're ready.
Thanks, Davis.
You gonna open them?
Later.
I was kind of hoping to live
in the present for a little bit.
Sorry about the MCATs.
I guess that means you'll be
sticking around here a little bit longer.
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.
It's funny, I met a girl today.
<i>AII she reaIIy wanted to do</i>
<i>was understand...</i>
why she feels the things she does.
Maybe that's all any of us want.
Just to understand.
And you don't?
Not lately, no.
It's not easy, is it?
Carrying the burden you do.
Excuse me?
Some would call it a blessing.
Others a curse.
I see it more as a calling.
Davis?
I know more than you think I know, Tru...
about what you can do.
About how you help the dead
get another chance at life.
<i>Have a seat, Tru. </i>
It's time I told you what I know.
You can't keep avoiding me.
Really? I thought I was doing a good job.
I know what you can do.
I heard you the first time.
That doesn't make it any funnier.
It's not a coincidence
that there've been fewer deaths...
since you started working here.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tru, I've watched you.
I've seen how you behave.
<i>You can do things. </i>
Things that others can't.
I don't even know how to....
Tru, it's okay.
You can talk to me.
They ask me to help them.
I wake up, the same day starts over and--
You save them.
Try to. Sometimes I can't.
You don't think I'm crazy?
No, do you?
Sometimes.
You're not.
Why isn't this just
completely freaking you out?
I've seen a lot of strange things here.
Very little shocks me.
I can't. I can't live like this.
I keep secrets from people that I love.
I can't have a normal relationship.
You're saving lives.
It's a gift.
No, candles are gifts.
Boots, bath salts maybe, but this is....
I don't know what this is. Do you?
I don't. Not yet. But tell me, Tru.
How does it feel...
to know that somewhere out there...
someone is about to die...
and they're gonna ask you for your help?
Hello?
Yeah, I'm ready.
I know we have to do this.
I love you, too.
Help me.
<i>No, reaIIy, </i>
<i>who do you think I am? </i>
<i>Baby, I think you're my girI. </i>
<i>Anything wrong with that? </i>
<i>You shouIdn't be so certain. </i>
<i>Can't heIp it if I'm certain. </i>
<i>Come on, Iet's take a waIk, huh? </i>
<i>No, I'm not faIIing for that. </i>
<i>You're faIIing for somebody. </i>
Tru, love is never like it is in the movies.
<i>I mean, when was the Iast time you kissed</i>
<i>and music sweIIed? </i>
You're lucky if you can find
a guy that can tell time.
I'm not asking for much, Linds.
Just a solid guy,
some decent conversation.
Maybe when he smiles,
he'll have this little crease above his lip.
Oh, God, who is he?
His name is Luc.
And he's a crime scene photographer.
But what's the point?
With the hours I keep,
we'll never have time together.
That'll lead to issues and....
You're planning the breakup...
and you haven't even
gone out with the guy yet.
Look, I'm just saying,
know what you want, and act accordingly.
For example, what I want
is out of my cube at the office.
So tonight, over drinks...
I am gonna show the big boss man
my take on a new account.
I don't want a promotion.
I just want a first date.
Fine.
<i>But if it's romantic settings...</i>
and movie moments that you're after...
my advice, keep them a mystery.
Because real life is not like the movies.
Sorry.
Okay, I really hope you like my take on this.
Let's take a look.
You've put a lot of work into this, Lindsay.
- Nice job.
- Thank you.
It's exactly this kind of motivation
that moves you forward.
Knowing what you want, and going for it.
That is so funny.
I just said that exact thing
to my friend today.
I just got back from a pickup...
so just make sure there's nothing
left in the truck, okay?
- No problem.
- Good.
Hey.
Hey. What are you doing here?
One: I work here.
Right. And two?
Look, um...
I was thinking how we've been
seeing a lot of each other...
here in the morgue.
I was thinking how maybe it'd be nice
to see each other outside of the morgue.
<i>I know this isn't</i>
<i>the most appropriate pIace to ask...</i>
but would you be interested
in going out sometime?
I know this isn't
the most appropriate place to say yes...
but, yeah, I'd really like that.
How's tomorrow?
Tomorrow might be risky.
I never really know
how my days are gonna go.
Look, you got an hour.
Okay, so take it.
<i>I got it covered. Don't worry about it. </i>
You guys have been doing
the mating dance for weeks now.
Get it over with.
You got an hour?
Yeah.
Thanks.
So....
You grew up wanting
to take pictures of dead people?
I grew up wanting to take pictures.
The dead people...
came later.
- I know the feeling.
- What'd you say?
- I said, I know the feeling.
- What?
I said, I....
Never mind.
How's it possible that you're still single?
My friend Lindsay always says:
"If the wrong guy's in the room,
I'll find him."
I mean, not now. I mean, not you.
I didn't mean....
Just a minute.
Sorry.
That's all right.
What's up?
Total disaster.
Tell me about it.
Okay, I will.
I just got busted down to receptionist.
You're kidding. What for?
<i>My boss made a move, </i>
<i>I said no...</i>
and he said,
"Maybe you'd enjoy answering phones."
Okay, don't worry, we'll fix this.
I'll call you later, okay?
Okay. Bye.
You okay?
Are we having fun yet?
Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
- No, I got it.
Yeah?
Yeah, you've got a pickup on- site.
It's two bodies and Gardez needs help.
No, a pickup?
I didn't know that was part
of the job description.
Great.
Surprise.
This was going so well.
Sorry.
So, how'd it go with photo boy?
You know those nights where things
click and you never want it to end?
That bad, huh?
I'm surprised we didn't get called out
to Lakewood Cliff sooner.
Looks like the guardrail finally gave way.
Hey, you got any advice
for a first- timer?
Thanks. Yeah, don't think so much.
Any theories?
Young love.
<i>How many times have you seen a death...</i>
that doesn't have
something to do with love?
<i>You see that neckIace there? </i>
<i>Not something a high- schooI girI</i>
<i>wouId buy for herseIf. </i>
It probably came from him.
Do we know who they are?
The guy's name's Adam Whitman,
a student at Highland Prep.
<i>The girI's name's Jen DeLuca, </i>
<i>just a Iearner's permit. </i>
<i>See that tattoo? It means"ambition."</i>
Looks like his was cut a little short though.
Damn, the bodies
are all jacked up.
<i>We need a coupIe of stokes. </i>
I'll be right back.
You were in love, weren't you?
Help us.
So you're saying yesterday a guy and a girl
went over a cliff in a car accident?
Yeah.
Was I wearing this shirt?
Unfortunately, yes.
License plate was....
689- TYH.
You memorized the license plate?
I memorize everything I can.
Once they ask for help,
I lose the body, any evidence.
The only thing I can go on
is what I remember.
<i>Okay, the car was Adam's, </i>
<i>so I'II find him first. </i>
I guess I'm going to Highland Prep.
Slow down there.
Yeah, I'm kinda in a rush.
That's funny, I was just thinking...
how we've been seeing a lot of each other
here in the morgue.
Yeah. Funny.
Then I was thinking...
how maybe it'd be nice to see each other
outside of the morgue.
I'm right in the middle of something.
Come on. It'll be fun.
No, I got it.
Yeah?
It could be.
I would love to. I would.
I just....Not right now.
<i>I can't right now. </i>
Let me just get back to you, okay?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Keys?
You be careful with her.
I know. You won her in
the best poker game of your life.
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Hold up. Is this one of your crazy days?
Keys? Yes, or no?
I just want her back, that's all.
Without a scratch.
Not the car. My sister.
Yeah?
Where are you?
Oh, God, Linds, I'm sorry.
I had to bolt. Something came up at work.
lncoming call
from Planet Bitch. Come back now.
Harrison says,"Hi."
Is it visitation day at the penitentiary?
She sends big hugs.
Can we hook up later?
Can't. I have to meet up
with my boss for drinks.
<i>I'm showing him</i>
<i>my take on a new account. </i>
<i>I just got busted</i>
<i>down to receptionist! </i>
You know, Linds, I really think
you should cancel.
<i>You know, </i>
<i>maybe keep work meetings in the office. </i>
Thanks. But I really think
he's gonna be impressed. Trust me.
<i>I'II caII you after? Bye. </i>
Harrison.
I'm gonna need one more favor.
So I'm a mature 17.
Excuse me.
Do you know
where I can find Adam Whitman?
Thanks.
I don't get you.
You're dating the hottest girl in school,
and you're sad.
I don't love her'cause she's hot, Cole.
Come on.
You know what? You don't....
Just forget it.
What?
You don't think I understand
the plight of star- crossed lovers?
I got a C- plus on that paper.
- Ambition.
- Good luck.
Nice ink.
Hardly any bleed- off.
Good work, too.
- Adam.
- Tru.
lmpressive.
What's your deal? You new?
Checking it out for the day.
My family's thinking of moving here.
Run, don't walk.
We're all stuck here,
but you still got an out.
That bad?
Not if you find the right person.
This is my girlfriend Amy.
Your girlfriend?
Young love.
This is Tru.
Prospective student.
Amy. Nice to meet you.
We hitting the cafť or what?
Yeah. Whatever you want.
I couldn't give the okay to a school
without checking out the grub first.
A girl after my own heart. Tag if you want.
Cool.
So where you from, anyway?
Does it matter?
Not to me, but to some.
Most of us pay to go here.
Some of the other kids,
they're here on scholarship...
so they actually have to
work their way through.
What's the big deal?
It's stupid, really.
It's like this decades- old thing.
The two sides of the town just don't mix.
So it seeps into the school.
We avoid them, they avoid us.
Boy, it's fun to grow up
in the middle of a clichť.
Let me get this for you.
First meal's on me.
I'm just gonna get us a table.
Hey.
- Do you know that girl?
- Who?
The one at the register.
Not really.
She's on scholarship.
Like I said, oil and water.
<i>It's</i> Romeo and Juliet.
<i>Kinda. Two worIds. </i>
He's rich, she's poor.
Things wouldn't be kosher
if they were dating.
Are they?
<i>Neither of them are fessing up. </i>
And he's got a very public girlfriend.
This is kinda cool.
We're like a team.
A team?
Yeah, like the Wonder Twins,
except we're not twins...
I don't have any super powers.
Yeah. I should get back.
Romeo's getting me nowhere.
I'll try my luck with Juliet.
Good luck, because you know
how well that turned out.
Yeah.
I was wondering
if you could help me. I'm lost.
Who isn't?
Not a fan of this place?
Of high school?
I see your point.
I saw you in line in the cafeteria.
- Tru.
- Jen.
DeLuca.
I caught your name tag.
Adam was showing me around.
He seems to have a way with the ladies.
Yeah. I wouldn't know.
He's not really my type.
Yeah, not my brother's either.
That's one headache I don't need.
Your brother doesn't like Adam?
No. Derek hates everybody.
You ask a lot of questions
for a prospective.
See you.
Who's your new friend?
Shut up and drive.
Morgue.
<i>Run a DMV check for me. </i>
Someone nicked my brother's car
and didn't leave a note.
The guy's name is Derek DeLuca.
The guy who stole your car gave his name?
Look, not a lot of time here.
<i>AII right. </i>
Bingo. Derek DeLuca.
<i>Looks Iike he's got a coupIe</i>
<i>of outstanding speeding tickets. </i>
You wouldn't
happen to have an address?
Hey.
Hey.
Aren't you the girl from the school?
I was giving myself a tour around town,
and I saw you in the driveway.
What are you working on?
I'm just tweaking the air mixture.
How come you don't go to Highland?
You've seen
those trust- fund casualties.
Why do I want to hang out with them?
What, you don't like chilling with rich boys
and their expensive rides?
Can't say I'm a fan.
Of expensive rides,
or the boys who drive them?
Like Adam Whitman?
Don't tell me you're a friend of Whitman's.
I'm not a friend of anybody's yet.
But why, what's your issue with him?
His dad runs the glass factory out on 22.
He fired about 300 people last month.
My dad was one of them.
You seen Adam's new ride?
Probably bought it with the savings
from the layoffs.
I think you and I both know
it's not about the car.
It's about the driver.
Guess we'll see tonight.
What do you mean?
I'm racing Adam.
You should come see for yourself.
Car race.
Where?
Lakewood Cliff. Two hours.
I've got a where, but not a how.
If it happens at the race,
it'd explain Adam's death but not Jen's.
I don't know how they ended up
in the car together.
Maybe they weren't.
What do you mean?
<i>'Cause it Iooks Iike an accident...</i>
doesn't mean that it is.
You should know, in our business...
<i>things aren't aIways</i>
<i>what they appear to be. </i>
Thanks, Davis.
I've never had anyone help me before.
I've never had anyone to help.
Do you have a booth?
Something quiet? We have work to do.
All right. Right this way.
Lindsay, is that you?
Harrison.
What a surprise.
Tru told me you were gonna be here.
Come here.
It is so great to see you!
It is?
What's up, my man? Harrison Davies.
I'm an old friend of Lindsay's.
You are?
Are you guys eating?
Because I am starving, and they have
this little shrimp thing...
that is just to die for.
So when I finally stopped,
everyone behind me was covered.
I'm talking head to toe.
And everyone was just glaring at me,
like I meant to do it.
So anyway, that's the most I ever puked.
What about you, Greggers?
Excuse me.
What the hell are you doing?
You are deliberately sabotaging drinks
with my boss.
Apparently, I'm doing this
for your own good.
Giving him every reason
to demote me to phones?
No. Preventing it.
At least that's what I'm told.
Not that I know what to believe anymore.
Harrison, I swear to God....
Look, let's just say I have this friend.
Yeah, you got friends?
Okay, more like a friend of a friend.
Anyway, she used to work for Greg
until she found out...
that"after- hour drinks" were a quick way
for him to get into her--
Okay, stop, please.
You're the only one
that would take it there.
Gregory and I are here to work.
Whatever you say.
How much horsepower?
Hitting 425, going for 12 seconds.
108?
You don't have to do this.
It'll be over before you know it.
And then we'll have
the rest of the night for us.
Hey.
Got a minute?
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.
How did you know we were gonna....
You can't do this. This race.
I'll be fine.
No, you won't.
Something's gonna go very wrong.
This thing Derek has against you--
Is that what this is about?
Don't sweat it. I'm way ahead of you.
Yo, Derek.
Ready to go?
Only if I'm riding with insurance.
lnsurance?
Yeah. He takes one of mine,
I take one of his.
<i>Make sure you know</i>
<i>no one's pIaying around. </i>
Fine. I'll take him.
I'll take her.
No, you can't do this. I'm serious.
Just watch. You'll love it.
You look worried.
How should I look when someone I love
is doing something stupid.
I'm sorry, I can't watch this.
You ready for the ride of your life?
Go, Derek. It's your birthday.
Watch out!
What's she doing?
<i>She's crazy! </i>
Come on! You just cut me off!
You jumped out
in the middle of the street.
<i>Are you insane? </i>
There's no way
I was gonna go over the cliff.
Let it go. You're alive, and you won.
I'm happy, you're happy.
Fair enough. Look, have you seen Amy?
I can't believe she just took off like that.
Here's a hint:
Girls in the movies like guys for their cars.
But girls in real life like guys
for who they are.
Thank you.
Hey, where you going?
Back to real life.
Hey. What are you doing right now?
So, nice work. The table.
I usually get stuck by the kitchen.
Yeah, I do what I can.
Since our time always gets cut short...
I want to skip all the work talk...
and move right to anything
other than work.
Good call. But first, no interruptions.
Okay.
All right, I'll start.
What sport did you play growing up?
- Track. You?
- Baseball.
Red Vines or Twizzlers?
Twizzlers, of course.
I'm strictly a Red Vines guy.
It's hopeless.
Tragic. I'm dating a Red Vines guy.
My turn. First kiss?
Mandy Banks. Fifth grade.
Worst gift you ever gave a girl?
To Adrian O'Malley when I was 13.
I didn't realize that a gold necklace
should cost more than $3. 95.
Necklace.
You see that necklace?
She wasn't wearing it.
Not after it turned
her entire neck green, no.
This isn't gonna make any sense at all,
but I have to go.
Are you okay?
No. Really, I'm insane...
because I'm about to walk out
on a date that's working.
But it's just
there's somewhere I have to be.
Right now?
There are times when I do this.
Take off. I really wish I could explain why...
but I guess I'm just not
your average 22- year- old girl.
Whether you believe me or not,
I'll call you...
and if you're willing
to give it another try, that's great.
If not, I'll understand.
No, I won't.
I'll be completely crushed, but I'll get it.
Thanks. Really, I had a good time.
Yeah, right.
Where's Adam?
He's around somewhere.
Where's Adam?
He's around somewhere.
What about Jen?
I saw her over there a few minutes ago.
What the hell is going on?
Amy.
- What are you....
- Adam, I'm so sorry.
I knew things weren't great between us,
but how could you--
- Adam, why don't--
- Okay, shut up.
I wanted to tell you.
I didn't know how.
Looks like you figured it out, huh?
I'm so sorry.
For what?
They're all gonna know.
Everyone's gonna know.
Then we'll deal with it.
Remember what we always said
we'd do if people found out?
I don't know.
I've lived here my whole life.
I mean, it's messed up, but it's home.
How they'll look at us?
It won't work here.
We won't work here.
We have to leave, Jen.
Please.
All right. Go home and pack.
I'll pick you up in half an hour.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Remember how I said
this was <i>Romeo and JuIiet? </i>
I was wrong. It's Juliet and Juliet.
Are you joking?
No. Amy and Jen.
They're the ones in love.
<i>They didn't die during the race. </i>
I don't know what's gonna happen, but....
- Hello?
- I gotta go.
Tru.
Okay.
My round. Lindsay?
Greggers, my man?
No, thanks.
Fine. Keep my seat warm.
I am so sorry.
This is not what I wanted for tonight.
Neither did I.
We have a few minutes.
I could at least go through
some of the proposals that I--
If we've only got a few minutes...
then let's not waste it on work.
He was right?
You should--
You should call it a night.
It's getting late.
You're an important guy.
You want to be fresh
for those morning meetings.
You're probably right.
See you tomorrow.
Gregory.
Don't forget this.
<i>We can discuss it tomorrow at the office? </i>
Right.
Good night.
Wow. This is a first.
Thanks, Harrison.
Hello?
Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
<i>I know we have to do this. </i>
I love you.
I love you, too.
<i>I'II be there in a few. </i>
<i>Meet me out front. </i>
What are you doing?
Who were you talking to?
Nobody.
No? You said,"I love you."
It's none of your business.
Where are you going?
Get out!
It's Adam. I knew when he
picked you there was something.
You have no idea
what you're talking about!
He picked me because I'm your sister.
Just tell me where you're going.
Out of my way!
What are you doing here?
- Please, just, can you get in?
- No way.
Come on, Jen, just get in.
I've chilled. Seriously.
I just want to talk to you.
About what?
Look, I can't find Amy.
<i>So the Ieast you can do</i>
<i>is give me a minute. </i>
You owe me that.
One minute.
Exactly!
Damn it, Harrison!
Change your oil once in a while!
Derek.
Babe, I'm kinda busy!
I know it's none of my business...
but your sister's with Adam,
and we gotta stop them.
You read my mind. Hop in.
He's upset. And with the way he drives,
I think something might happen.
You said you wanted to talk.
You don't have to drive fast.
How long has this been going on?
- A few months.
- A few months?
I wanted her to tell you.
No.
I can't believe he thinks
he can bag my sister.
She's not sleeping with him.
What do you think they're doing?
Playing Candyland?
Adam, can you slow down?
I'd just like a few answers.
I got in the car
because you need to know something.
Talk fast.
It's not your fault.
<i>ReaIIy, Adam. </i>
<i>She didn't know how to teII you. </i>
She loves you.
But she's in love with you.
The necklace.
I was gonna get it for her.
She was looking at it in the window
of this jewelry store forever.
<i>Now I know why. </i>
She wanted to give it to you.
You're her best friend, Adam.
<i>That's why it was so hard. </i>
She didn't want to hurt you.
Thinking he's all hard, huh?
What are you doing?
Trying to tap my sister in daddy's car?
You gotta get out of the car.
I can't! It won't. The door's jammed.
Your sister's in that car! Stop it!
Just shut up!
You're gonna kill her!
I'm not gonna hurt my sister.
She needs a little scare.
Stop, you'll push them over!
There's a guardrail. I'm just bumping them.
It won't hold.
The guardrail gave way.
Stop! It won't hold!
Poor little rich boy!
Derek, your sister's not in love with Adam.
She's in love with Amy.
That's who she's running away with.
What?
I saw Derek's car.
So you're saying that at exactly this time...
you were with those two dead kids
at the crash site?
That's what I'm saying.
So the girls aren't running away?
No. But it's not like it's all wrapped
up in a neat little bow.
They've still gotta deal with life
now that their little secret is out.
If it weren't for you,
they wouldn't even have that.
If it weren't for us.
Sometimes just being able to talk
to someone can make it a lot easier.
Who are those for?
Amy and Jen gave them to me...
for helping them deal with their secret.
And I'm giving them to you...
for helping me deal with mine.
<i>Yo, Bro. </i>
Tru?
How you doing?
<i>Fine. </i>
Aren't you gonna ask me about your baby?
What baby?
<i>Your car. </i>
Thought that'd be
the first thing out of your mouth.
<i>Yeah, right. </i>
Sorry, I'm just a little busy right now.
Just real quick,
tell me how things went with Lindsay.
Great. No worries. Mission accomplished.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Look, where are you?
My apartment.
<i>I gotta change to go meet someone. </i>
I don't know if that's the best...
idea.
Oh, my God.
Harrison.
You know, when most girls get up
and run away during the first date...
it's usually a bad sign.
I said I'd call.
Yeah. I thought you meant, like, Tuesday.
Yeah, my timing's been a little off lately.
Can you handle it?
I think I can.
'Cause maybe I'm not looking
for an average 22- year- old.
So you're free all night?
Not going anywhere?
I'm all yours.
You know, a friend of mine was saying...
that real life can't be like the movies...
that maybe sometimes
things are better left to mystery.
What good is a mystery
if you don't try and figure it out?
So you finally did it.
Thirty- nine straight days at the morgue,
and you finally took one off.
- I had to see it for myself.
- I was this close to the record.
I thought that we could celebrate
over breakfast.
This is pathetic.
50 people coming here tonight...
and all I have in the way of munchies...
is a bottle of olives
and a box of baking soda.
I don't get this. You moved
into this place six months ago...
and you're throwing
a house warming party tonight?
What can I say? I've been busy.
So, are you nervous?
About what?
Tonight. Meeting my friends
for the first time. My brother.
They're going to study my every move
and report back to you.
- Why would that make me nervous?
- You'll be great.
Hello?
<i>Tru? </i>
Hey, it's me. Come on,
it's only been a couple of months...
- don't tell me you've already forgotten?
- Mark.
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>what happened was my fauIt...</i>
<i>and you have every reason to hate me. </i>
But I just can't stop thinking about you,
Tru, and I want you back.
<i>Hey, are you stiII there? </i>
Yeah, but now really isn't a good time.
Maybe I could come by later?
We could talk, face to face.
See, here's the thing.
What you want really doesn't matter.
Know why?
'Cause you're the one who cheated.
And it was the biggest mistake of my life,
Tru, and I know that now.
Yeah, well, you should've known it then.
Besides, I've met someone new.
And he's great.
Please, Tru, it'll never happen again.
You're right, it won't.
<i>I got to go, Mark. </i>
Help me.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. Why?
You looked a little freaked
when you answered the phone.
I thought maybe it was bad news.
Well, the truth is that was my ex.
And he wanted to see me.
I can't say that's the answer
I was expecting, but....
Hey, whatever you need.
You and I have only been out a few times--
I told him no.
Even better.
I'm sorry. It's weird.
I shouldn't have told you.
No, I'm glad you did.
If you and I can't be honest
with each other, what hope do we have?
You're probably wondering
why I asked you to meet me here today.
- I meet you here all the time.
- Whatever.
It's Lindsay.
Ever since we hooked up,
I can't stop thinking about her.
- You're kidding me, right?
- Crazy as it sounds, I'm not.
You know me. I can't stand Lindsay.
I never could.
And, yet, she just keeps
popping into my head.
It's confusing the hell out of me.
And you're telling me this now because....
You're meeting her
to shop for your party, right?
I thought maybe you could feel her out.
See where her head's at. You know?
Vis- á- vis yours truly.
Come on. Help a brother out.
Look, all I'm looking for
is a simple yes or no.
<i>Maybe. </i>
Maybe you're interested
in my brother?
He's cute, don't get me wrong.
He went all weird after we made out,
like he was embarrassed or something.
- Typical guy stuff.
- He was probably just nervous.
Still, post- hookup, you give a girl a call.
You know, maybe some flowers.
Make the girl feel special.
We don't need that.
Got to cut the limes with something.
Besides, it's on sale.
Okay.
Oh, my God, Pez. I forgot Pez.
You and your candy.
I just love those little dispensers.
They're so kitschy.
Hello, Davis.
For the last time, yes.
But what if a dead body comes in
and asks for help? What do I do?
First, they don't talk to you,
they talk to me.
Okay, but--
Also, they don't ask for help
every night. It's not how it works.
Just come in for five minutes.
If no one asks for help,
then you can go home.
<i>Did you hear what I said? </i>
I worked eight days this week, literally.
- But what I'm trying to say is that--
- Davis, I need a break.
Okay. So I'll see you tomorrow?
I'll see you then. Bye.
Chips, dips, a whole lot of beer.
Looks like somebody's having a party.
What's wrong?
Nothing, I'm just surprised
to see you here, is all.
Real coincidence.
I live three blocks from here,
remember that?
This is my market where I shop.
- I'm not following you or anything.
- Okay.
Since I have you here,
I just wanted to apologize...
because I feel like I came on strongly
this morning. It was rude.
That's fine.
Anyway...
it was nice to see you.
Yeah.
I still can't believe
you had a stalker moment and I missed it.
It wasn't a stalker moment.
Mark and I just happened to be
in the same place at the same time.
That's what stalkers do.
They just happen to be in your market...
and then they just happen
to follow you home...
and then they just happen to
chop your head off and seal it in a baggie.
Linds!
I'm just saying.
First the phone call, and now this?
Hello?
<i>What'd she say? </i>
<i>And teII me everything. </i>
<i>ActuaIIy, I'm pretty satisfied</i>
<i>with my Iong- distance pIan. </i>
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means you should maybe
call back another time.
She's right there, isn't she?
Yes, that's right.
Telemarketer.
Just give me a hint.
Tell me something. Anything.
I think if you want your customer
to change plans...
you should show her
some special consideration.
Special. Like a gift or something?
Not bad.
<i>What shouId I get her? </i>
Hey, she's very happy
with the plan she's got now. Thanks.
Only way to handle those guys.
Hey, Tru. Cool party.
It's good to see you again.
Thanks!
Who is that?
Oh, my God,
Marty's actually on time for once.
Marty. That's who that was.
Can you believe
this thing came with instructions?
- For a knife?
- Yeah.
- Apparently you can cut through rebar.
- Good to know.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Hey, Sam.
- Tru, I'm so sorry about the vase.
Don't be. You know what they say:
"Priceless heirlooms
are made to be broken."
So, how are you? How's med school?
You're at Hopkins, right?
No. That kind of fell through.
I missed the final
because of a big family emergency...
and this jerk professor
wouldn't give me a make- up.
Sorry to hear that.
So, now I'm selling shoes with my dad
in his store until I can reapply.
- What about you?
- Tagging toes at the morgue.
Man. And I thought I had it bad.
Harrison, it's beautiful.
That's just a little something
from me to you.
Actually, it's from Bill to Sally.
- What?
- Yeah, there's an inscription on the back.
- "To Sally from Bill."
- That. No, that can be removed.
Where did you get this thing?
A pawn shop?
Is that a problem?
- Happy house warming.
- Thank you.
Come here one second.
Whatever happened to,
what is that saying:
"It's the thought that counts"?
It counts if it's yours.
This thought here happens to be Bill's.
Hi. You must be Luc. I'm Lindsay.
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my brother, Harrison.
How's it going?
A pleasure.
Tru, can you help me
with the punch real quick?
Let me ask you a question, guy to guy.
Wanna buy a watch?
Okay, your brother
is so hopeless.
I mean, a pawned watch? How tacky.
Harrison just has his own way
of doing things.
Right. The cheap way.
- Lindsay.
- Okay, sorry. Change of subject.
Your new boyfriend is hot.
I just hope he's having a good time.
If he isn't, so what.
It's your party, remember?
I've already had a few.
I should probably slow down.
Nights like this do not happen that often,
especially with a job like yours.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Tru, there's an angry guy at the door.
He says he's your neighbor.
Turn the music down,
or else I'm calling the police.
All you had to do was ask, Brian.
No, I'm not asking, I'm telling.
Turn the music down.
Fine.
Yeah.
'Cause me and the landlord,
we're like that.
One call from me,
he's gonna take away your parking spot.
I don't have a car.
In case you get one.
Why didn't you invite
your next- door neighbor?
- Are you kidding me? That guy's a creep.
- All the more reason to invite him.
If he's helping make the noise,
he can't complain about it, right?
Well, it's too late now.
Bye. Bye, you guys.
I'll call you, okay?
I need to talk to you.
I know that I shouldn't be here,
it's inappropriate...
but I cannot stay away, and I am sorry.
You need to go. Now, Mark.
- I need you to talk to me.
- We're through talking.
All I'm asking for
is five minutes of your time.
Five minutes, Tru, and then I will go.
Fine. But not here.
Okay. Then meet me upstairs on the roof.
Promise me.
Just wait for me there.
Hey, what was that about?
That was the guy
who called me this morning.
Your ex?
He just kind of showed up.
He wants to talk to me.
So talk to him.
You're okay with that?
I trust you.
Thanks.
Mark?
What the hell's the matter with you?
The first time I ever kissed you
was on this roof.
- And I thought maybe if--
- Mark.
No. Stay.
Talk to me
about how great we are together.
You need to go home.
Don't come near me again.
Great.
Drive safe.
Call you a cab, Sam?
No, but if you know of a good place
to throw up, that would be great.
Down the steps, hook a right,
anywhere in the alley's fine.
You rock.
- You okay?
- Yeah. Where did everybody go?
Without you here,
no one really felt like partying.
That, and we ran out of booze.
Is everything okay with the party- crasher?
Fine.
You tired?
Lindsay's punch kind of got my head
doing summersaults.
- Go to bed. I'll clean up after you.
- Just leave it till tomorrow.
All right. Let's get you to bed.
Thanks for everything.
I had such a good time tonight.
Me, too.
You want to stay?
I would love to.
But tonight, you need to sleep.
- So I'll see you tomorrow?
- Count on it.
Luc? I thought you said
you were going home.
<i>911 emergency. </i>
<i>May I have your name and Iocation? </i>
Tru Davies, 1723 Oracle.
I'm calling to report a murder.
<i>Can you teII me what happened? </i>
I just woke up and he was here.
I don't know how.
Tru?
<i>Miss, are you stiII there? </i>
<i>Stay on the Iine, pIease. </i>
Tru, I need you.
So you finally did it.
Thirty- nine straight days at the morgue
and you finally took one off.
<i>I had to see it for myseIf. </i>
I don't get this. You moved
into this place six months ago...
and you're throwing
a house warming party tonight?
Tru?
Sorry. What's that?
Hello?
<i>Tru? It's me. </i>
Mark.
<i>Yeah. You haven't forgotten. </i>
<i>I'm gIad. </i>
There's something
that I'd like to talk to you about...
but I don't want to
talk to you over the phone.
Standard Diner. One hour.
Yeah. Okay.
That was Davis.
He needs me to work today.
You're kidding.
Can it wait until after breakfast?
He said it was an emergency.
You're not mad, are you?
No, I just feel bad for you.
It seems like you never catch a break.
I'll see you tonight, right?
Yeah.
I turned him over, there was
a single wound below the heart.
I called 91 1, but then he asked for help,
and the day restarted, and here I am.
So, if I'm to understand you correctly,
you had a party and didn't invite me?
Davis.
- I thought we were friends.
- We are friends.
Sure, when you wake up
next to some dead guy.
I apologize. Can we please focus here?
Okay.
So you have no idea
how Mike ended up in your bed?
Mark. And, no, I don't.
Look, I had a lot to drink last night.
- What about suspects?
- So far, I can only think of one.
- Who?
- Me.
Come on, Tru.
I don't know.
Mark was acting so weird yesterday.
Maybe he got violent,
maybe I fought back.
- There's no way did you kill him.
- How do you know?
Because I know you.
You save lives, you don't take them.
The victim was stabbed once
in the chest.
<i>Was that the onIy wound? </i>
There was a pretty deep cut
in the palm of his right hand.
What else?
There was blood
on the wall behind my bed.
It looked like sort of a half circle.
lnteresting. Any place else?
I just woke up and he was here.
I don't know how.
Yeah, on the doorknob.
And you said
you found the knife on the floor.
Beside the bed.
Only the first couple inches
of the blade were bloody.
That indicates a shallow wound.
You don't think it was suicide?
No. The slash on his palm
sounds like a defense wound...
meaning he was trying to protect himself,
which suggests murder.
Here, let me show you something.
It's a forensic simulator program.
Helps investigators recreate a crime scene
that has been tampered with or destroyed.
So you're gonna recreate
my apartment on the computer?
I put in these variables.
I might be able to extrapolate
some ballpark description of the killer.
- How ballpark?
- Height, weight, sex.
It'll take a few hours.
I'm meeting Mark in 15 minutes.
Aren't you forgetting something?
- The party. I'm invited tonight, right?
- There isn't gonna be a party.
No, there has to be a party.
There has to be a party.
In order to save Mark's life...
you have to recreate the circumstances
that led to his death exactly.
Not only can you not
cancel the party...
you have to make absolutely sure
that he shows up.
Otherwise, the killer
could strike some other place.
Some place where you will not be able
to protect him.
All right.
Sorry, Harrison. We'll do lunch tomorrow.
Actually, there was something
I needed to talk to you about.
- Lindsay, right?
- Yeah. How did you--
If you want her to like you,
you got to make her feel special.
How do I do that?
I don't know. Pick some flowers,
or burn her a CD mix.
Could I just go buy her something?
Fine. Just make sure it's not a watch
with another woman's name on it.
Come on. I would never do that.
Unless I did that. Did I do that?
I thought you don't believe
that I relive days.
I don't. I mean, look, I'd like to. I would.
But don't change the subject.
<i>AII I wanted was advice. </i>
Okay, then just remember.
Think personal, not personalized.
Personal, not personalized.
It's been a while.
You okay? You seem a little....
It's been a while.
You okay? You seem a little....
Yeah, it's nothing. I'm fine.
- It's kind of strange seeing me, isn't it?
- Kind of.
- Anyway, the reason I called--
- Yeah, what's been going on with you?
Me? You know, the usual. Just classes,
grading papers, praying for tenure.
And what else? Personally?
I was seeing somebody.
But I broke it off, if that's what you mean.
- Another student?
- Yeah.
- It's not one of my best qualities, is it?
- Anyone I know?
Got to admit, Tru, this isn't
the conversation I thought we'd be having.
Her name is Julie Spence.
She graduated last spring,
and now she works in the Mayor's office.
How'd she take it?
- Take what?
- The breakup.
Actually, she kind of went psycho on me...
and she even slashed my tires
the night I broke things off with her.
But you don't want to hear about this.
It's really good to see you again, Tru.
Yeah. You, too.
This is great.
It was strange, but it was great.
Yeah, it was good to see you.
You know, we talked so much
during lunch, I never got to...
tell you why I called.
I've been thinking about you
a lot, Tru. About us.
About how great we were together.
And I miss you so much.
And I want you back.
Look, I know we have a lot to work out,
but I will do whatever it takes.
I'm seeing someone.
And I know how this is gonna sound,
but I want us to stay friends.
Friends. Yes, I've heard that one before.
No, really. I'm having a party tonight.
You should come.
We could talk some more,
you know, about everything.
Okay. That sounds great.
I have a late class,
but I'll swing by right after.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
I guess Davis didn't need you after all.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on my way to work.
Which, by the way,
is where you're supposed to be.
Look, the guy you just saw me with
is my ex- boyfriend.
He's the one that called this morning.
That's why you ran out on breakfast?
So you could meet him?
Luc, he's in trouble.
He needed to talk to me.
What kind of trouble?
It's hard to explain.
You just have to trust me.
Like I trusted you when you said
you had to work this morning?
You know what?
Have fun at your party tonight, all right?
Luc, wait.
You called me here
to look at a watermelon?
How's that supposed to
help us solve a murder?
Observe.
Notice there's no leakage.
The knife has sealed the wound.
But when you pull the knife out....
Does that look familiar?
You're saying
Mark pulled the knife out himself?
That's not all.
The blood on the doorknob suggests...
he opened the door
with his wounded hand...
indicating that he was stabbed
outside of your apartment.
Okay, here's the sequence of events
as I see them.
Mark Evans is attacked.
Left there for dead.
He gets to his feet,
he staggers towards your apartment.
With his wounded hand,
he opens the door.
Makes his way
to the foot of the bed...
<i>pIaces his hand on the knife-- </i>
And yanks it out of his own chest.
Precisely.
But how's he supposed to walk around
with a knife in his heart?
Because the knife sealed the wound.
For the first few minutes
there was probably very little blood loss.
- Then why pull it out?
- More than likely, he was in shock.
I know what you're thinking.
None of this proves you're the killer.
Yeah, none of this proves
that I'm not the killer, either.
You know what I was
supposed to be doing right now?
Making bean dip,
decorating for my party, having fun.
Nobody said this job was gonna be easy.
Yeah, no one said
it was gonna suck, either.
Tru, Tru.
You're not alone.
We are gonna crack this together.
Turn the music down,
or else I'm calling the police.
Hey, Brian. I'm having a party tonight
and I'd like you to come.
Seriously?
Yeah. What fun would it be
without my neighbors?
All right.
See you tonight?
Sure. Yeah.
I mean, I'm always up for a party.
Great.
"Julie Spence."
Tru, a little help here.
- Ever heard of two trips?
- If someone hadn't bailed on me.
Sorry about that. How much do I owe you?
$140 plus change.
Don't look at me like that. It was on sale.
You made me come all the way over here
to get rid of a knife?
- A perfectly good knife, I might add.
- Just lose it. I don't care how.
Hey, I still haven't figured out
a gift for Lindsay.
I mean, any other chick,
I'd buy candles or something.
But with Lindsay,
she's got such weird taste.
So get her something weird.
Just make sure--
I know. Get rid of the knife.
Something weird.
Excuse me? Julie?
You don't know me,
but my name's Tru Davies.
I'm a friend of Mark Evans.
Actually, I know exactly who you are.
- Mark used to talk about you all the time.
- He did?
He was obsessed with you,
even when he and I were together.
You here to gloat?
- About what?
- Getting him back.
I always knew he wasn't over you.
I didn't get him back.
I don't even want him back.
- Then what do you want?
- To warn you.
No matter how strong
your feelings are for Mark...
you can't let them get the best of you.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
He said you slashed his tires
the night he called things off.
No, it wasn't me.
But whoever did that terrible thing,
I'm sure Mark deserved it.
- Stay away from him.
- What are you, his bodyguard?
No. I'm just worried about him, that's all.
Whatever happened between us
is our business, not yours.
Whatever happened between us
is our business, not yours.
I'm not so sure about that.
- I'll deal with my exes my way, Tru.
- Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.
I think I finally get why you and Mark
were so perfect together.
You're both psychotic.
Come in.
I thought I might find you in here.
Yeah. A photographer in a darkroom.
Go figure.
I'm sorry I lied.
I only met Mark
because I was worried about him.
It won't happen again.
The first time we went out...
you warned me there'd be times
you'd take off with no explanation.
<i>And before today, I was okay with that. </i>
But now I'm curious.
When you leave, where do you go?
Come on. I mean, you said
you were gonna be honest with me.
- And I will.
- So tell me. What's the deal?
Do you have some secret life?
Another guy stashed somewhere?
Of course not.
Then why won't you tell me
what's going on with you?
Great.
Honesty.
Hey, Luc--
No, it's okay'cause we're just starting...
and it's better this happened now
instead of later.
Listen, if you're looking for
neat and easy...
then, yeah, you're probably right.
You've got the wrong girl.
But if you think you can handle something
a little more complicated...
then stick around. You won't be sorry.
Yeah.
Hello?
<i>I need to see you. Now. </i>
I've got to go. Davis needs me.
Yeah. I've heard that before.
I finished running the numbers
through the simulator.
Based on the victim's
own height and weight...
and the location
and moderate depth of the wounds...
I believe that the killer
was approximately 5'4", right handed...
and lacking upper body strength.
Mostly likely a female. What do you think?
I think you just described me.
Don't put words in my mouth.
I still don't think you did it.
5'4", right- handed,
my apartment, my knife. Who else could....
I'll deal with exes my way, Tru.
- Julie.
- Who?
Mark's ex- girlfriend.
She and I are about the same size.
There. All we have to do is go to the party,
keep an eye on Mark...
and if the ex shows up,
you and I will be there to stop her.
And if I'm the killer?
I will not let you
make the same mistake twice.
Hey, Tru. Cool party.
It's good to see you again.
Thanks, Marty. Glad you could make it.
- Hey, neighbor. Kicking party.
- Thanks, neighbor.
You okay? You look a little worried.
The last party I had was kind of a disaster.
Before I moved in, I guess.
That's okay. Don't worry.
If things start to slow down...
I'll go get my karaoke machine.
People love that stuff.
So here's a little something
from me to you.
I know you got, like, a ton.
But this one's supposed to be pretty rare.
Oh, my God!
Popeye, 1952, blue base, no feet.
There was only 2, 000 of these made.
How did you know?
You said something about
a collection once.
Guess I wanted you to know
that I was listening.
Look what your brother gave me.
- Sorry. He means well.
- Are you kidding? I love it.
You do?
Yeah.
I don't know, I'm thinking
maybe I was wrong about him.
Maybe he is special.
You haven't seen Mark, have you?
As in your ex? Why would he be here?
- I invited him.
- What?
Why would you do that? What about Luc?
It's a long story.
You know what you need?
Some of my special punch.
Thanks, but not tonight.
Hi.
How's it going?
No sign of Mark or Julie yet,
but it's still early.
I'm glad you're here.
Thanks for having me.
Where should I stand?
Where is that knife I bought?
Need something?
'Cause if you do, you know,
I live just right next door.
Got a knife?
Now I'm selling shoes with my dad
in his store until I can reapply.
How about you?
Would you just excuse me one sec?
Yeah. No problem.
- Where did you get that?
- Your neighbor.
I can't find the one
I bought today. Have you seen it?
No, just be careful, okay?
- Okay.
- Sis, you got a sec?
I don't think it's gonna happen
for me and Linds.
- But she loved your present.
- Yeah, but...
she's so into me now, it's sort of a turnoff.
You mind if I turn on the TV,
check out some scores?
Yeah, whatever.
Okay.
You made it.
Yeah. Sorry I'm late.
My class ran kind of long.
Not a problem. I'm glad you're here.
Yeah. Me, too.
- Do you have a second?
- Sure.
It's kind of loud in here.
Do you think we can go to the roof?
- I'm the hostess, I shouldn't.
- Come on, it'll take a second.
I thought you had a boyfriend.
What happened? He go missing or....
No, he's not here.
- Trouble in paradise?
- Something like that.
Trust me. He's a fool
to walk away from a girl like you.
Take it from someone who knows.
Thanks.
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry, you invited me to the party--
Mark, I told you. I just want to be friends.
But friends isn't enough.
I won't give you up, Tru.
You're gonna have to.
Maybe he got violent,
maybe I fought back.
Look, just stay away from me, Mark.
For your own good.
Tru.
Downstairs, hook a right,
anywhere in the alley.
You rock.
Bye.
- So your brother took off on me.
- You're kidding.
He said something about
a card game downtown...
and then he just split.
Can you believe that?
- What's that for?
- Your vase. Sam knocked it over.
I shouldn't have let him
drink so much tonight.
It wasn't a drunk thing.
It was more like an angry thing.
What do you mean?
He got all worked up
over some professor...
that cost him a slot in med school.
...and this jerk professor
wouldn't give me a make- up.
The killer was approximately 5'4",
right handed--
Then meet me upstairs on the roof.
Sam.
Johns Hopkins!
The most prestigious medical school
in this entire country!
And they wanted me.
I'll make a telephone call
and explain what happened.
It's too late for that now!
It took me months...
but I was finally
getting my life back together...
and then you just go
and show up at my friend's party?
I just knew I couldn't let it go this time.
I couldn't let it go.
Put it down, Sam.
Tru, this is the guy.
This is the guy I was telling you about.
You're drunk. You don't want to do this.
No, I had a plan.
I had one chance, Tru.
And he took it from me.
So take it back.
What are you talking about?
If you don't like how
things went down the first time...
- do something about it.
- I am!
No, you're giving up.
If you hurt Mark...
your life actually becomes
the sob story you think it is.
You could spend 20 years in a cell
feeling sorry for yourself.
Is that what you really want?
God!
Tru, I don't know how to thank you.
You could say goodbye.
Ex- student with a carving knife
on the roof.
The simulator would've
never figured that one out.
I still don't get how Mark made it
all the way back here...
with a knife in his chest.
Well, he loved you, Tru.
That always makes a person stronger.
I hope I'm not too late.
You know what?
I'll just see you guys at work.
Thanks, D.
So I've been thinking.
About?
That nothing good comes easy.
If I need to work a little harder
to keep you in my life, then so be it.
<i>I have a feeIing you're worth it. </i>
What about when I take off?
Think you can handle it?
I guess we'll find out.
Sorry I missed your party.
It's not over yet.
- No?
- No.
Not tonight.
- You're happy.
- Why shouldn't I be?
I'm 22 years old, I'm healthy.
I have a nice guy that I work with.
- Who, me?
- Yes. You, Davis.
I have good friends.
A cute boy,
who I can almost call my boyfriend.
And, every week or so,
I get a shout- out from a corpse and....
You relive the day.
It comes in handy, you know?
Bad day? Do it over.
Bad outfit, quick wardrobe change.
- Premature death?
- Prevent it from happening.
Well, Wonder Woman has nothing on you.
Except for the pointy bras
and the invisible plane, no.
It's nice to see you making peace with it.
Let's be honest.
It's not like I really have a choice.
I don't think those people
will take no for an answer.
Just out of curiosity, who else
have you told about what you can do?
Just my brother. Not that he believes me.
Except when he thinks
he can make a buck on the ponies.
- Anyone else?
- No.
Not my sister, or Lindsay.
And definitely not Luc.
It's hard enough to date
without dropping that bomb.
What about your father?
It's kind of hard to tell someone
who doesn't want to talk to you.
And it's funny. I can prevent death...
but I can't make a father
take interest in his own daughter.
- Tru--
- I know.
Too much information.
No.
I just want you to remember
that a gift like yours is never simple.
But there's someone...
who's gonna be very grateful
for what you can do.
Maybe even today.
Jake.
We just got your CAT scan back.
And?
Why don't we talk for a moment?
Jake.
What are you doing out of bed?
And why are you wearing your uniform?
You know you're supposed
to be in your robe. Jake?
Jake.
No go. You know the rules.
I need to get out of here.
Jake, I'm sorry.
You know the doc said to take it easy.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
I just gotta do something. One thing.
Come on, back inside.
You're not supposed to
be out here anyway.
Jake, you okay? You all right?
I'm just....
- What are you doing? Don't be stupid.
- I told you, I gotta get out of here.
Jake, come on, listen to me.
I just talked to the doc and....
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
You won't even miss me.
What the hell was that?
He had a gun. I saw he had a gun.
It was Jake, for God's sake. It's just Jake.
He's dead.
<i>Hey, it's Tru. </i>
<i>Leave a message. </i>
<i>HeIIo, Tru, it's your father. </i>
<i>I know it's been a whiIe...</i>
<i>but I'd Iike to taIk to you</i>
<i>when you get a chance. </i>
<i>You know where to reach me. Goodbye. </i>
Dad called you, too?
- Yeah, why? You?
- Yeah. And Harrison, also.
He's sweet like that.
Every five years,
no matter how busy he is...
he drops everything and he calls.
What'd he say?
It was a short,
unpleasant conversation.
He asked if I had a job yet.
He asked if I had a husband yet.
Just like the old guy. Charming as ever.
So what did he ask you?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
I didn't call him back yet.
I will, just a little later, though.
You believe that SOB?
Doesn't talk to us in ages.
And when he does,
all he wants to do is criticize.
I wonder what he would've said to me.
"You work in a morgue?"
And"You're not a doctor yet?"
- Sounds about right.
- Look at the bright side.
- At least you've got a job.
- Yeah. And a guy.
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.
How's Grandma? How's Rochester?
One is feeling better,
the other is way too far away from you.
Good news.
Davis is letting me take an early shift
so we can finally have our night alone.
- That's great.
- But?
But there's a small problem.
Train derailment.
<i>They shut down aII routes</i>
<i>up and down the entire seaboard. </i>
- Wonderful.
- But don't worry.
<i>I'II figure it out. </i>
It's gonna take more
than a train derailment to keep us apart.
Well, what the hell.
You don't have a résumé?
Let's be honest.
What is a"résumé" anyway?
A list of jobs that didn't work out.
No, seriously, I believe in starting fresh.
I'm always looking forward. Never back.
And tell me, what are
some of the unique qualities...
that you could bring to this job?
Laughs. A lot of laughs, Marjorie.
You mind if I call you Marjorie?
Not quite as creepy as I thought it'd be.
Meredith, what a surprise.
I figured we're actually
getting along today...
why not push our luck.
I also thought you'd like to know
our brother went on a job interview today.
Dad really got to him, huh?
Yeah, well, not enough to keep him
from totally tanking the interview.
Why, what happened?
Same old thing.
Wore the wrong thing,
said the wrong thing...
didn't even bring a résumé.
Face it,
Harry's not exactly the nine- to- five type.
That's what you came here to tell me?
No, actually.
I came to find out what Dad said to you.
Don't know. I haven't called back.
- But you will, right?
- Why should I?
So he can pass judgment on me, too?
<i>I mean, Iook how he made you feeI, </i>
<i>and Harrison. </i>
Look, Dad's off in Connecticut
with a new wife, a new life...
and every five years he calls his kids
and we're supposed to jump?
He's still our father, Tru.
Yeah. Our father, who art in Greenwich.
Who's that?
Davis, my boss.
Cute.
In that he's- so- not- my- type kind of way.
Wait a second,
I know what Dad said to you...
but tell me
you're not thinking what I think--
- He's a doctor, am I right?
- Yeah, but--
Thought I'd let you know
I'll take my lunch break now.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company.
- Hi, I'm Tru's sister, Meredith.
- Hi.
Tru didn't tell me
she had a younger sister.
Actually, I'm her older sister.
I'm shocked.
Your epidermal layer is flawless.
You know, I haven't eaten all day.
I mean, if you wouldn't mind
some company....
Really?
So the gentleman's aorta...
was literally wrapped around
his left ventricle...
and I'd never seen anything like it.
<i>And not to mention</i>
<i>that his inferior vena cava...</i>
which, an interesting thing about that--
Is there anything else that
we could talk about besides autopsies?
- Sure.
- Great.
So, you a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fan?
No, sorry.
Would you like me to
finish the autopsy story...
'cause it contains
a lot of interesting things.
No, thank you.
Look at that.
lsn't that the bailiff
from Judge Stern's court?
I'll be right back.
Jim. What a surprise.
So nice to see you.
<i>I didn't recognize you</i>
<i>without your uniform. </i>
She walked out on you?
Not literally.
Okay, literally.
She spotted some bailiff she knew.
The next thing I know,
she's riding off on his motorcycle.
Davis, I'm so sorry.
She's a little unpredictable sometimes.
Not to mention, my father
has us all acting a little crazy today.
It's not the first time it's happened.
Just the quickest.
I should've known a girl like that
wouldn't be interested in a guy like me.
Morgue.
You're where?
About 80 miles west
of where I'm supposed to be.
- What happened?
- The rental agency gave me directions.
- Bad ones?
- Not if I wanted to go to Cleveland.
I know we were both looking forward
to tonight...
but it doesn't look like
I'm getting home before dawn.
- That'll teach us to make a plan.
- We'll have our night soon. Promise.
lncoming.
Okay, I gotta go.
Drive safe, okay?
<i>Bye. </i>
Cpl. Jake Voight, 21, just
got home from a tour of the Middle East.
- What happened?
- A disturbance at the Army Hospital.
One of the MPs had an itchy trigger finger.
- Time of death?
- 10:00 a. m. on the dot.
Slight jurisdiction problem,
otherwise we would've had him sooner.
It looks like a clean shot.
Probably died instantly.
He survived the war.
Couldn't survive coming home, huh?
Shipped out from Fort McAllister
18 months ago.
He was wounded in battle.
Took a bullet in the thigh.
<i>CIean biII of heaIth</i>
<i>and they sent him home. </i>
The doc said he was a hero,
saved his entire squad in Afghanistan.
You know anything else about him?
You writing his biography?
Maybe rewriting it.
The Army notify his family?
No one to notify.
The Army said
there is no next of kin.
It's a shame.
No one should have to die alone.
Do me a favor.
Take him to Number 2...
I'll do an autopsy tonight.
I need you.
<i>Hey, it's Tru. </i>
<i>Leave a message. </i>
<i>HeIIo, Tru, it's your father. </i>
<i>I know it's been a whiIe...</i>
<i>but I'd Iike to taIk to you</i>
<i>when you get a chance. </i>
I can't make it to breakfast today.
How about one of these days,
let me know the night before...
- so I don't have to wake up so early?
- Sorry.
I never know when these things
are gonna come up.
By the way,
I got an interesting call this morning.
Me, too.
<i>You know what he said to me? </i>
Wondered when I was gonna get a job.
Look, here's the thing, Harry.
None of us will ever be
good enough for him.
- Nothing we do will ever--
- You don't think I know that?
I stopped trying to impress the guy
when I turned 14.
- Harry?
- Yeah?
I just wanted to say
employers like résumés.
They like applicants who dress nice
and who know their business.
- Tru, what's this about?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
<i>Just one more thing. </i>
Make sure Meredith doesn't stop by
the morgue today, okay?
- Okay. Whatever.
- Hi.
- Who was that?
- Tru. She can't make breakfast.
No surprise there.
And she said not to stop
by the morgue later.
Stop by the morgue?
Why would she think
I'd ever stop by the morgue?
I don't know.
Why would she ever think
I'd need a résumé?
No, I'm serious.
Train derailment?
You haven't heard?
Because it's all over the news down here.
It's a good thing you told me.
I'd hate to get stuck in Rochester all day.
Why don't you take the bus?
I know for a fact there's one
that leaves in half an hour.
That's impressive. Weird, but impressive.
But I'm not much for buses.
I think I'll just spring for
the rental car instead.
- No.
- Don't you want to see me tonight?
No, of course I do.
It's just I want to make sure
you have the proper directions.
Why do I have a feeling
you're gonna tell me what they are?
Hi, Jake Voight?
- Down the hall, Room 248.
- Thanks.
I need you.
Hi, I'm here to see a patient.
I'm sorry, visiting hours
don't start until noon.
Noon?
- Time of death?
- 10:00 a. m. on the dot.
I can't wait until noon.
In fact, I can't wait much longer at all.
I can't wait until noon.
In fact, I can't wait much longer at all.
Jake's an old friend of mine from basic.
I heard he was here.
I'm sorry, miss.
He'll still be here in two hours.
- Please, you don't understand.
- I understand fine. We'll see you at noon.
Jake.
We just got your CAT scan back.
And?
Why don't we talk for a moment?
Jake.
What are you doing out of bed?
And why are you wearing your uniform?
You know you're supposed
to be in your robe. Jake?
Excuse me, Nurse?
- Yes?
- The patient wants a second opinion.
I've got a healthy male with a swollen leg.
lbuprofen and bed rest?
No go. You know the rules.
I've done that for four days.
I think I should see the doctor.
- Smoker?
- Once in a while.
He could have DVT.
You might wanna do an ultrasound.
That's just me.
I need to get out of here.
I'm sorry, Jake.
Maybe you should stick around
a little longer.
What are you doing? Don't be stupid.
No.
I told you, I gotta get out.
I just talked to the doc and--
Jake, put down the gun, please.
Listen to her, Jake.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Okay? You won't even miss me.
No, don't.
Jake, let her go.
I told you, I just gotta get out of here.
Don't move.
Just take it easy.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
Listen, tell them
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Wait, where are you going, Jake?
You okay, Nurse?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Stop!
So is Jake.
- I'm not sure I'd say that.
- Why?
Because if we don't find him soon,
next time you see him, he'll be dead.
Jake was wounded overseas.
The doctors removed the bullet and
sent him back to the States to recuperate.
Two weeks ago,
we learned that a bullet fragment...
had become dislodged
and settled in his pulmonary artery.
So you removed the fragment?
We tried, but he began hemorrhaging
during surgery.
When do you try again?
Well, until this morning we had no plans.
What happened this morning?
A CAT scan revealed
that an embolism had formed.
<i>We have no other choice</i>
<i>but to open him up again. </i>
'Cause if the embolism
ruptures the artery....
He'll die immediately.
That kid has a time bomb ticking
inside of him.
So let's just hope that
the MPs find him before it goes off.
I don't get it.
I save a guy only to learn
he could be dead by the end of the day.
Once the symptoms set in,
shortness of breath, sweating...
it's only a matter of hours.
Even if I find him
before the embolism kills him...
there's no guarantee he'll survive.
Okay, let's just think.
You told me that Jake said
he had something to do.
Yeah. That's what I heard him
tell the MP.
If you knew that you were gonna die
in a matter of hours, what would you do?
I don't know. Cry. Get drunk.
Say goodbye.
According to his enlistment papers,
Jake has no family, no next of kin.
There was a photo in his wallet.
A picture of a girl.
Her name is Bridget Elkins.
She couldn't be older than 19.
There's no Bridget.
There is a George Elkins
at 567 Charleston Road.
- It could be her father.
- I'll take it. Thanks.
By the way, you just missed your sister.
- She came here?
- Yeah.
You guys didn't happen to make plans
by any chance?
I can take it. How bad did it go?
She dumped you
for a bailiff on a motorcycle.
Davis, look, she's my sister
and I love her, but she's complicated.
I should've known a girl like Meredith
would never go for a guy like me.
- You really liked her, huh?
- Yeah.
I may regret this, but take notes...
'cause I'll tell you everything
you need to know about my sister.
London, yes.
But to be honest,
the city that I really love is Dublin.
I lived there my junior year.
That's amazing. That's so cool.
The next thing you know...
you'll tell me you're thinking about
moving back there.
Now this is getting weird.
Someone you know?
No one important.
Of course, I would be remiss
if I didn't mention my love for animals.
I love all kinds.
Dogs, cats. I adore horses.
I see.
So Tru did a pretty good job, huh?
Telling you exactly what to say?
Let me tell you something
Tru doesn't know about me.
I don't want a guy to be
just like me.
I want a guy to be himself.
That's what really impresses me.
- Be myself?
- Yeah.
- Okay, I can do that.
- Good.
So....
You a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fan?
567 Charleston.
Jake.
You okay?
She's gone. They left.
You're that nurse from the hospital.
It's okay, I'm alone.
You have to go back.
Without that surgery, you'll die.
And with it, I hear my chances
aren't that much better.
Anyway, I'm not going back until I find her.
Bridget?
I was 18.
I was stationed at McAllister.
She was finishing her senior year
in high school.
You were in love with her.
Yeah. Crazy love.
I saw her...
and I just knew.
Luckily, she felt the same way.
That's what I thought.
What happened?
I don't know. That's just it.
I had a 48- hour pass
before I was shipped out.
The greatest two days of my life.
Just me and Bridget.
Then I deploy, and a telegram shows up.
She said she never wanted
to see me again...
that we were over. Done.
I called, but her number was changed.
I wrote, but the letters came back to me.
And if you don't mind me asking,
what makes you want to see her now?
As much as I'd like to...
there are a lot of things I can't forget.
About war...
about seeing your best buddies shot down
in the desert...
8, 000 miles from home.
But the one thing I can't remember...
is the one thing I swore I'd never forget.
Her face.
All I have left is this.
I could die...
on the table, or right now.
- And if I do....
- You don't know that.
And if I do...
I don't want to close my eyes...
and not be able to see her face.
Of course, now she's gone.
Can't find her anywhere.
There are a lot of ways
to find someone, Jake.
Really?
If I help you, you promise me
you'll go back and get that surgery?
Sure.
Still, I don't know how I'm gonna find her.
The house is empty. They moved.
Look inside, all that's left
are light bulbs and old magazines.
Old magazines?
Hi, this is Bridget Elkins.
How am I? To tell you the truth,
not too good.
I've called three times this month...
and I still can't get you people
to send your magazine to my new address.
Yeah.
Just so it doesn't happen again,
could you do me a favor...
and confirm that you have
the correct forwarding address?
Yes? 4963 Denson.
That's it. Thanks very much.
You have no idea how many applicants
show up without a résumé.
- No.
- Yes.
I mean, just having one
puts you at the top of my list.
Of course, I don't notice
any prior experience in real estate.
That's because I don't have any.
But look, I've been selling something
to someone since I was 16...
and what I found is that
as long as you listen to the customer...
you can be successful
no matter what your product is.
All right then,
what are some of the unique qualities...
that you could bring to this job?
Laughs. A lot of laughs, Marjorie.
But, seriously. Passion, sincerity...
and a little thing I like to call"persistence."
Unique? Maybe not.
But what this company needs? Absolutely.
Here we are.
Looks like Mr. Elkins
has been doing okay for himself.
- How do I look?
- Great.
Well.
- Not bad for a dead man anyway.
- Come on, stop that.
Hey.
You're sweating.
Once the symptoms set in,
shortness of breath, sweating...
it's only a matter of hours.
You stay here, I'll get her.
You promise, as soon as you see her,
it's right back to the hospital.
Yeah. Just one thing.
If her father answers the door,
don't mention my name.
- Why not?
- Bridget's a smart girl.
He's got big plans for her.
Falling in love with a soldier was not one.
Probably can't blame him.
I mean, does your dad like the guys
you bring home?
He never met them.
I'm sorry. He's dead?
Just by choice.
- Hello.
- Hi. Is Bridget home?
- No, she's out right now.
- Could you tell me where I might find her?
- I'm sorry, you are?
- A friend of hers from high school.
You must not recognize me. Tru Davies.
No, I can't say that I....
New nose. And I lost, like, 20 pounds, too.
Don't be embarrassed.
You wouldn't be the first.
Tru. Yes, of course.
Why don't you come in for a moment?
Now, what's so urgent?
I'm only in town for a few hours.
In fact, I'm on my way to the airport
and if I didn't see her--
She's at school.
She's got class all afternoon.
I'll tell her you stopped by, if you'd like.
Or I could swing by campus,
if you point me in the right direction.
Look, she'll back from the JC
in a few hours.
Junior College,
but Bridget was a valedictorian.
She could've written her own ticket.
Come on, Jake. We're going back
to the hospital right now.
Jake?
Who are you?
Did you bring Jake here?
Is that why you came?
Yes, but you don't understand.
He needs to see Bridget.
You leave my house.
And you stay away from my daughter.
I said let go.
You have to go with them.
I came to see Bridget.
- I didn't see her.
- I know where she is.
I promise you, Jake, I'll find her.
Just please go.
Oh, my God. Hurry.
- Get him back now.
- Come on, let's go.
They're not too happy
about that jeep, by the way.
I'll find her.
You know, I don't even know your name.
Tru.
Tru. You're not really a nurse, are you?
What makes you say that?
You're some sort of angel.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Bridget Elkins.
The registrar said she was here.
She was, yes.
But you just missed her.
The class ended five minutes ago.
Do you know where she is now?
Is Bridget in some sort of trouble?
It's her grandmother. Nothing serious.
She slipped in the tub again,
and Mr. Elkins asked me to find her.
Let me see, if it helps you,
she normally meets Phillip after class.
- Phillip?
- Yeah.
They're quite
the popular couple on campus.
Try the Metzler Building, 212.
He should be finishing up there.
Thanks.
Thanks, Regina. Say bye, Phillip.
Bye.
- Bridget?
- Yes?
- He's beautiful, your boy.
- Thank you.
He looks just like his father.
What?
Listen, I'm a friend of Jake's.
He needs to see you, both of you.
What?
I haven't heard from Jake
in a year- and- a- half--
He may not survive the day.
This is all a little bit much, okay?
I haven't heard from Jake in 18 months.
- Suddenly you show up--
- He doesn't know about Phillip.
Why does that sound
like some sort of accusation?
It's not.
I found out I was pregnant
the day he was shipped out.
And I tried to contact him,
but I couldn't.
Obviously, he had no interest
in reaching me.
You sent him a telegram.
You told him not to contact you.
What? Telegram?
I don't know what he's told you, but....
I'm over him.
I don't know why I'm getting so upset.
He wants to see you
before he goes into surgery.
We could be at the hospital
in under an hour.
Ten years ago, I lost someone that I love.
And not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could see her one more time.
You still have that chance, Bridget.
Sorry. I can't.
I lost him once, I can't lose him again.
Guardian angel or stalker?
You decide.
I was in the neighborhood.
How are you feeling?
As soon as I'm stable,
they're taking me to surgery.
After that, anyone's guess.
- I'm so sorry, Jake.
- For what?
I was supposed to help you.
You wanted to see her,
and I couldn't do what you asked.
Don't do that.
- You tried.
- I failed.
What? You didn't fail.
Why are you being so hard on yourself?
I saw where she lives.
I know she's in school.
She sounds happy. Healthy.
She was more alive for me today
than she has been in two years.
That's nothing to apologize for.
I thought he was never gonna go down.
You hungry? There's--
No, thanks.
A crazy thing happened today.
This woman came by...
- said Jake wanted to see me.
- Really?
She seems convinced that I sent him
some stupid breakup telegram.
Listen, there's a lot of odd people
in the world.
Nothing to take to heart.
Please, tell me it wasn't you, Daddy.
Sweetheart--
Tell me that
you didn't sign my name.
- That you didn't send it.
- Look at me.
Not until you say
that you didn't send it.
Because he's sick.
He could die.
You had your whole future ahead of you.
Princeton, Stanford,
you could have gone anywhere.
My God.
- I knew it.
- You got knocked up by a soldier.
You were the top of your class.
He was enlisted--
- I loved him!
- Where did that get you?
Running between daycare
and some third- rate community college.
You could've been great.
You are my father, you're supposed
to love me no matter what I am.
You ever wonder how one little decision
can change your whole life?
All the time.
If I didn't join the Army....
You never would've been stationed here.
You never would've met Bridget.
Maybe I would have met her
somewhere else.
I would've had a nine to five,
a house and kids.
Man, we would have had some cute kids.
Jake, listen....
I'm sure you would have.
Excuse me.
Hello?
<i>Hey, hey. </i>
Why don't you come meet me
so we can celebrate?
<i>I can't make it tonight. </i>
But congratulations, Harry.
<i>Not sure how you knew, </i>
<i>but thanks to you...</i>
she offered it to me on the spot.
<i>That's great. </i>
I'm so happy for you.
And, thanks to me, I turned it down.
You know, screw the guy
if he can't love me for who I am.
<i>I'II see you, okay? </i>
- Bridget.
- Hi, Jake.
You came.
God, look at you.
You look beautiful.
Jake, there's someone I want you to meet.
You have a son.
We do. Phillip, say hi to your daddy.
Hey.
How did we screw things up so bad?
- Don't talk.
- Were we too proud?
Too stupid?
Here we go, Corporal.
All that matters is I'm here now.
So whatever happens to me,
I want you to have a good life.
I want you to marry.
I want Phillip to have a father.
He has a father.
Have a good life, Bridge. Promise me.
Jake, you're gonna be fine.
Promise me, Bridge.
Take care of him.
It's taking so long.
- It was a risk. We all knew that.
- What?
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.
I lost him.
You didn't lose him, Tru.
His time was just up.
Jake knew he wouldn't survive the surgery.
That's why he asked you for your help.
But it's my job to prevent death.
To save people. All that.
Well, maybe Jake wasn't the one
who needed saving.
Maybe you saved the person
you were supposed to.
Bridget.
You let her say goodbye,
because yesterday, she wasn't able to.
- This job's just confusing sometimes.
- I know.
That's why you have me.
<i>
Key under the mat, right?
You made it.
Yeah. Did you ever think I wouldn't?
No. Never.
- You okay?
- Better now.
Why don't you relax?
There's just one thing I gotta do.
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>at the beep. </i>
Hey, Dad. It's Tru.
I know we haven't talked in a while...
but I want you to know I'm doing okay.
I have a new job.
I guess you could say I help people.
Sometimes, if I'm lucky, they even help me.
That's why I'm calling.
Because I know how hard it is
for two people to find each other.
Especially when one of them
doesn't want to be found.
So, good night, Dad...
I hope you're happy and well, because I am.
And from now on,
you don't have to try to find me...
because suddenly...
I don't feel lost.
<i>
Sorry.
Long day.
Tell me about it.
Then they called me
this frat guy...
and I was like,"No, baby. Pay me."
Yeah, it's a damn good thing, too.
'Cause I was into my boy, Chaz,
for four bills.
You know, I've been thinking
about getting my nipples pierced.
- That's great, Harrison.
- Earth to sis.
Have you been listening to me?
- What's going on?
- Trust me.
You don't want to know.
I do want to know.
<i>I am aII about wanting to know. Tru?</i>
Tru, what are you doing?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I was just....Didn't you see that car
coming right at you?
All day with the questions
and the sneaking around.
- Are you stalking me?
- Ma'am, I swear, I was just trying to help.
Help me write down
your name and number.
I'm sure my attorney
will want to talk to you.
Obviously you'll believe
what you want...
- but I just helped you more than you know.
- I don't need your help.
<i>I do.</i>
I do.
I do.
I do.
Come in.
What are you....
Help me.
God, what are you doing?
We need to talk.
We're not really gonna have
this conversation again, are we?
I think we have to.
You should've seen yourself the other day.
And the way people were looking at you.
I saved someone's life.
I don't really care what people think.
It's getting out of hand.
And I need a real explanation, okay?
Not this crap about do- over days...
and damsels in distress.
What you're claiming, it's not possible.
It's not.
And now you're putting yourself
in danger...
and risking your life over people
who don't care...
over something that's not even real.
Come on.
Did you see where the guy
who was here went?
- Nope.
- Sorry.
What kind of person skips out
on a bill of $7. 32?
<i>It comes out of my pay.</i>
Look, we've been over this before.
And you know what?
I'm done talking about it.
Obviously nothing I say...
is gonna convince you, so I'm just gonna
have to find a way to show you...
once and for all, this is real.
Come on, don't you people have jobs?
Hi, you're here early.
Actually, I just came by...
to see if you wanna grab a bite to eat,
or maybe just hang out.
Hang out? As in me and you?
Yeah. It's just....
Sometimes I feel
like you're the only one who gets me.
Who understands
what's going on in my life. My brother....
He still doesn't buy it?
No.
He believes boxing's legit
and Tupac's alive...
but he can't seem to wrap his head
around this one. So what do you say?
- Just a half hour?
- Yeah.
Hello?
What?
Oh, my God. I'll be right there.
It's my sister.
Oh, man. The ball!
Get it! Come on!
- Meredith, you all right?
- Yeah, I'll get better.
- My car, not so much.
- Forget about your car. Let me see.
Are we done?
One minute.
- Relax, Mere. Just tell me what happened.
- I had this appointment...
running late because of
all the construction on the highway.
- Then this guy just pulls out of nowhere.
- Is there anything I can do?
- Do you need me to call someone?
- No, it just....
I missed my appointment.
It doesn't matter.
Let me see.
I'm sure your office will understand.
I got to get my stuff out of my car
before they take--
You just finish getting patched up.
I'll take care of it.
Appointments. Right.
Thanks.
Odd part of town for you
to have an appointment.
Didn't you used to come down here
to make a different kind of deal?
Yes. Used to.
I really don't appreciate the implication
that this had anything to do with drugs.
Look, sorry, Mere. It's just....
- Don't be afraid to ask for help.
- I am not afraid to ask for help.
I called you after the accident, didn't I?
Is everything okay with your sister?
Yeah, maybe.
Honestly, I don't know anymore.
My God!
Yeah, I know.
Nicole Simms.
Shot by an unknown assailant.
On her wedding day.
Time of death: between 7:00 and 7:30.
Actually might have made it,
but she bled to death in the chapel.
Ambulance was held up by construction
on the highway.
- Who would do this?
- Don't know.
Maybe it was random, or maybe
somebody didn't want her to get married.
Get started on the standards,
I'll go grab the x- rays. I'll be right back.
Can I help you?
Sorry, that snow
just came out of nowhere.
Snow? Here, let me get you something
to dry off with.
No, it's okay. I just....
My....
I think my....
We were supposed to get married today.
And I think they brought her here.
Yeah.
Could I get a couple of minutes?
Um, I never, uh,
I never got a chance to say goodbye.
For what it's worth,
I know what you're going through.
Sorry for your loss.
Thanks.
Um. Can I, um,
Can I see her?
Yeah.
I'll just be right through here.
Nicole.
Good news.
I finally got the cheesy chomps
that I ordered, so that....
Why aren't you running standards?
I gotta start the autopsy soon...
and the Sheriff's Department
needs the bullet for their investigation.
The victim's fiancé came in.
He just wanted to say goodbye.
Where's he waiting? I'll talk to him.
Actually, he's in Standards with her.
You know that's against the rules.
Yeah, but can't the rules
be broken a little?
- What's the harm in--
- Tru, until a case is closed...
- the dead are our responsibility.
- Davis, there's also a live person in there.
You take great care of the dead.
What about the living?
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
- All right, I can explain.
- Tru, call security, please.
No, you stay. You stay where you are.
- Oh, my God.
- Listen.
Whatever it is you want,
you don't have to hurt anybody to get it.
- You don't understand.
- Then help me understand.
You're in a lot of pain right now,
but we can deal with it.
Just relax. Davis, don't.
Don't.
No! Davis!
My God! Talk to me! Davis!
You are not leaving me, you understand?
Get up.
Get up, now!
- You'd better pray he doesn't die.
- I did not want to shoot.
Look, you have to help me, now!
I will never do anything to help you.
That's too bad.
Help me.
We just saw each other yesterday.
Come on, we need to talk.
Tru.
Are you all right?
I don't know yet.
I know you don't believe
half the things I tell you...
but let's just say
yesterday was a real bad day.
Yeah. Tell me something I don't know.
Watching your sister dive tackle
a total stranger.
Not your yesterday. My yesterday.
Look, this is getting out of hand.
And I want a real explanation.
Not this crap about do- over days...
and damsels in distress.
Tru?
- And what is this?
- Your to- do list.
"Diner, 1 1:20. Bring $7. 32."
What the hell is this?
If something were to happen to me,
I need to know that you understood why.
The only way for you to finally accept
what I do, is for you to do it yourself.
- What do I get out of this?
- Be where I tell you, when I tell you...
and by the end of the day,
you'll have your answer.
So I'm guessing this is one of those days.
Since it's not your shift and you're here.
It's a do- over day.
What have we got?
What?
- It's good to see you, Davis.
- It's nice to see you, too.
- I'm just really glad you're here.
- Okay.
You do realize I work here, don't you?
Who's Nicole Simms?
She's getting married today. Or trying to.
Gets shot in the chest and bleeds out...
- before the ambulance can get to her.
- Now you find out who did it?
That's the thing. I think I know this time.
It's her fiancé.
- How do you know that?
- I saw him. He came here.
- What, to the morgue? What for?
- He was tampering with the body.
He must have been
trying to conceal evidence.
You know,
nab the bullet before the cops could.
So, he was here when she asked for help?
Was I here?
- Of course I was here, I'm always here.
- You were here.
What aren't you telling me?
- Davis, I'm sorry, I really got to....
- Right.
Somebody out there needs to be saved.
Something like that.
What do you want me to say?
"Yes" will work.
I'd be willing to take a"fine."
You seriously thought
I would just give you my car?
In some remote cultures,
siblings are known to help one another.
What if you got in an accident?
My insurance premium would increase.
I'll have it back by tonight,
in one piece, I promise.
Look, I'd love to help you out,
I really would.
But I have an appointment across town
with a client this afternoon.
I need my car.
Didn't you used to come down here
to make a different kind of deal?
This appointment wouldn't be
for something else besides work, right?
Tru, look, no more games today, okay?
I have a staff meeting.
How about this?
You can have the car tomorrow.
Call me and we'll set it up.
Tomorrow's too late.
For both of us.
Yes, you did.
You said you wanted him at your table.
Hold on a minute. Hi.
Hi. I'm looking for Nicole.
- And if you found her, you would be?
- Tru Davies. Old friends.
Ma? I'm gonna call you back.
<i>No, I need--</i>
I have a question about tonight.
Are you here for the wedding, too?
I hope so, I'm in it.
- A groomsman?
- Actually, I'm the groom.
Wait, you're marrying
Nicole Simms tonight?
Yeah, that's the plan.
We were supposed to get married today.
Right, of course.
So you're here for the wedding?
I don't remember your name
from the guest list.
Yeah, I'm not on it.
I'm just here from out of town.
I wanted to wish her luck.
Nicole and the troops are all downtown
at some nail shop.
Do you know which one?
It might be fun to surprise her.
It's on Fifth.
- Hands On.
- Great.
Could you just tell her that I miss her?
This whole tradition of me
not seeing her all day....
Just tell her it's killing me, okay?
Yeah. Hello?
- She can't sing.
- I can't stop her.
- She's gonna be my mother- in- law.
- No, she can't sing.
She might get up there
and open her mouth...
but what comes out is gonna be like
something from <i>WiId Kingdom.</i>
Another decision.
God, I'm gonna explode.
Go with sheer. French tips are played out.
Thank you. That may have seemed
like nothing, but I'm grateful.
- Big day?
- Long day. It's exciting, but exhausting.
- I just can't wait to get my life back.
- Good luck with that.
I've got three words for you.
Thank- you notes.
I should've eloped.
Maybe someone didn't want her
to get married.
A friend once said
the hardest part about getting married...
is telling the guy she dated in college.
The guy I dated in college beat me to it.
He got married last year.
You mean there's not one boy out there
in a particularly bad mood today?
Justin? Justin Burke?
Stop it. He hasn't thought twice about me.
Only a guy still hooked...
would buy you something
off your Perry and White registry...
when he's not even
invited to the wedding.
Okay. Point taken.
Luckily, after tonight,
I'll only have one guy to worry about.
"The diner, 1 1:20. Bring $7. 32."
Come on.
What kind of person skips out
on a bill for $7. 32?
<i>It comes out of my pay.</i>
- Did she put you up to this?
- Excuse me?
My sister.
Tell her she's gonna have to do
better than that, okay?
Nice work, though.
Keep the change.
Hi. I'm hoping you can help me out.
My boss had me purchase a wedding gift,
and I think I blew it.
I gave you guys the wrong return address.
If something goes wrong, it's my ass.
Would it be too much to ask
for you to check the files?
Yeah, thanks. His name's Justin Burke.
Where the hell are....
Steve, have you seen my keys?
No, I haven't.
Tru, tell me you didn't.
Just call me a cab!
If it's important, I'm out back!
Sorry to bother you.
It's fine.
This stuff gets everywhere.
Can I help you?
I was hoping I could help you.
I'm a new neighbor...
and I actually have the same
house number as you a few blocks over.
Anyway, a couple of days ago,
I got a package with a"Return to Sender."
I think it was supposed to come here
to a Justin Burke.
That's my boyfriend. This is his place.
I just try to make it livable.
Is he around or....
He's still at work...
but he usually comes home for lunch.
Actually, he should be home any minute.
Do you mind me asking you
where the package is from?
- I think it was Perry and White.
- That figures.
His ex- girlfriend's getting married.
Is that weird, or....
It's like you'd expect.
Since he heard about the wedding,
he's been a little bit off.
I'm sure it's nothing.
Speaking of....Right on schedule.
<i>Now you can teII him yourseIf.</i>
Actually, you know what? I'm late.
I really got to....Thanks for your help.
- What was that about?
- A delivery or something.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. I just....
Do me a favor. When you're done here,
come inside for a minute.
I want to talk about something.
Sure.
So I took off.
I didn't know what else to do.
He lied. He's not the fiancé.
He's a bitter ex. Not to mention a cop.
At least you found the bride.
All you have to do is convince her
to call off the wedding.
That isn't the issue. Stopping the guy is.
I don't know if I can do that.
- You've done it before.
- I've failed before. I can't fail this time.
Tru, what is going on?
What happened yesterday?
I told you.
No, you're working harder
at avoiding my questions...
- than saving this girl.
- What do you want me to say, Davis?
The truth!
This guy...
I told you he came here
to cover his tracks.
By trying to extract the bullet.
But what I didn't tell you is...
we walked in on him...
and he pulled a gun.
In here?
Oh, my God, what happened?
He shot at me.
But the day rewound before I could....
Look, I'll be fine.
- But you need to get out of here.
- A guy came in here...
and shot at you
and you want me to leave?
What are you not telling me?
He shot you, Davis.
He shot me?
Did I die?
I don't know.
So you're telling me that in a couple
of hours from now, I could be dead.
Davis, we don't have time for this.
The longer you stay here...
the better the chance it'll happen again.
I want you to go to my apartment.
Look, if I can't change what happens,
at least I can rearrange the players.
Just take these, please, and go there.
But what about you?
I have to warn the bride. You know that.
I also know she's the reason
a guy came in here with a gun.
I'll be fine, okay?
I'll meet you back at my place, I promise.
Tru. Thank you.
For what?
For telling me the truth.
Those are Gerber daisies.
I didn't order Gerber daisies.
Are you telling me
it's too late to change them?
She's in the hall and can't decide
between <i>Some Enchanted Evening...</i>
or <i>Time of My Life.</i> She wants to sing you
the first verse of each.
That's just perfect.
- How could this day get any worse?
- Nicole, hi.
- Do you have a minute?
- No, not really.
Aren't you the girl from--
The nail place, yeah.
I wasn't completely honest.
Look, I know your ex, Justin.
Okay.
I know how he still feels about you,
and what he's willing to do...
- to keep this wedding from happening.
- What is she talking about?
I have no idea.
Look, you say you know Justin?
So do I.
And I know he would never do anything...
to hurt me like that. And I also know
I'm not gonna let some stranger...
come in here and screw up my day.
I have family for that.
Can you find your own way out
or do you need a hand?
I got it.
If you want her to make it to the"I do's"...
you'd better keep Justin away from her.
Someone's gonna need
my help. Yeah.
Hi. You probably
need some help, don't you?
- No.
- Come on. Give me your arm...
- and let's get this over with.
- Don't touch me!
What about this, lady?
Oh, man.
<i>The baII!</i>
Come on!
Hey.
You need this?
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for hours...
- and this guy--
- Davis, I'm fine. Look at me, one piece.
- How about you?
- I'm okay.
When you say you're okay....
I'm lying.
So you really don't know
what happened after he shot me, if I....
No. That's just it. It hasn't happened yet.
So we're gonna make sure
it doesn't happen again.
I've warned the necessary parties,
now all I have to do...
is get to Justin
before he gets to the chapel.
- Any idea how?
- That's the thing.
He's a cop. Not to mention armed.
So, short of knocking him out
and stashing him in a locked closet...
- I'm running low on ideas.
- I may have one.
Scientific knowledge
always bests physical strength.
How do you think
I got through high school?
- This helps me how?
- Knock him out, yes.
But pharmaceutically.
You want him incapacitated...
- two words: zinc sulfate.
- Zinc sulfate.
That's just gonna make him puke.
For hours. Good idea.
Not that I'm crazy about you
being alone with him in a room...
- but it will buy you some time. If he's--
- Busy, he can't shoot Nicole or you.
Where do I find some?
I have a friend at County
who may not mind--
Give me a name and a number.
I'll go get the pills.
And listen.
This isn't just about me and Nicole.
- He shot three people yesterday, so Tru--
- Don't worry. I will.
I hear you're the man to see.
Well, that depends.
Gonna make it worth my while?
What are you....Are you ripping me off?
I'm talking to you!
Stupid girl. You want something from me?
I want what I paid for.
You'll get it when you get it.
Dispatch called.
Said Nicole was looking for you.
She wants to meet you here
before the wedding.
- Nicole?
- Something you want to tell me?
Justin.
Nicole's just running late,
so she sent me to give you a heads up.
- Who are you?
- Just a bridesmaid fulfilling her duty.
You look familiar.
I am one of Nicole's friends,
and you did date Nicole.
The chances are our paths have crossed.
Yeah. Right. Probably, I guess.
I'm still a little thrown by her call.
Do you know why she wanted to see me?
Honestly, I think she's a little worried
that you're still bent...
about the whole breakup,
and that you might do something about it.
- Tonight.
- Are you serious?
The only thing I'd do is say thanks.
To hear she was marrying...
turned out to be a serious wake- up call.
- What do you mean?
- If she's willing to stop playing games...
and commit, she must really love this guy.
I just hope I'll feel that strong someday.
It's getting warm. Do you mind?
Sure.
You're not wearing your gun.
But you're a cop, right?
I'm a cop, off duty.
I only carry it when I'm on the job.
You say you never carry your gun
when you're not working?
No. Some guys do, but not me.
<i>When I'm off duty, I'm off duty.</i>
- It wasn't you.
- What?
You know what? I've got to go. God.
That's okay.
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.
Are you sure that Nicole's gonna come?
Yeah. And I'm sure
she would want you to wait right here.
When I left Justin, it was 6:40.
<i>He was Iooking forward to seeing NicoIe,</i>
<i>and he didn't have his gun.</i>
He couldn't have been the one
that shot her--
Someone else must've pulled the trigger.
I don't know who.
Then why does he go to the morgue
to cover it up?
I don't know. But there won't be
anything to cover up if I can find Nicole--
- Tru?
- My God, Nicole!
Somebody help!
God!
What happened?
I don't know. I just found her like this.
What are you doing here?
Look, I'm here to help.
Alive. Barely.
- Call 91 1.
- Did you see anyone come in here?
No, it's early.
Most of the guests aren't even here yet.
- My God! Nicole!
- The ambulance will be here any minute.
The ambulance was held up
by construction.
She bled to death in the chapel.
The ambulance isn't gonna
make it in time. We need to--
No! You're not touching her!
Nobody moves her!
What about the police?
Hasn't anybody called the police?
- Give me a phone.
- Listen to me!
There's construction on the highway.
The EMTs will never make it.
If we don't get her to a doctor,
neither will Nicole.
Please, we can't afford to wait.
Help me get her to a car.
But the cars are all blocked
by the catering trucks.
- Not mine.
- What about her parents?
If the family has a problem,
they can find me at the County Hospital.
I'll be saving their daughter.
Hold on! You're gonna make it.
Come on. Nicole?
Come on!
<i>HeIIo?</i>
<i>I couIdn't stop it.</i>
Someone shot Nicole, and she looks bad.
- Don't know if she'll make it.
- How close are you to the hospital?
Not close enough! Wait, who's on duty
at the morgue right now?
- I don't think that's--
- Someone has to know what to do.
I'm only two blocks away.
It might be her only chance.
- Okay, I'll meet you there.
- No!
I spent the whole day keeping you safe.
You won't go back...
- to where you got shot!
- That was yesterday.
Today is yesterday! Davis!
<i>Bye, Tru.</i>
Davis! Damn it!
Help! Gardez! Anyone?
- I told you not to come here!
- You say how much you appreciate...
having someone help you.
Let me help you.
If not, let me at least help her.
- I locked all the doors.
- We've got to do this quick...
- and get out of here.
- What's this?
- Dried blood.
- I don't think so.
I can't tell what, though.
Lily pollen.
- What, from her bouquet?
- No. Those were Gerber daisies.
Then how did it get on her dress?
This stuff gets everywhere.
Can I help you?
Justin left his gun at home.
The only other person...
who would have had access to it
is his girlfriend.
I had the right motive,
just the wrong person.
I find it so interesting...
that you broke up with me
on the day Nicole gets married.
This is about you and me.
It doesn't have anything to do with her.
Well, not anymore.
What are you doing with that?
I shot her.
Nicole?
Amazing how she's always
the first woman on your mind.
- Why would you do that?
- It was so easy for you...
just to end things.
Aly, you didn't have to--
Kill her?
- I didn't, Justin. You did.
- Oh, my God.
She's at the morgue by now.
But I didn't do it.
<i>It's my word against yours.</i>
It's your gun. Your bullet. Your motive.
The evidence is all there.
Somebody just has to find it.
How we doing?
With us.
Okay. I think we're ready.
Okay.
I'll assist you.
I'm not doing this. You are.
- What? You're the doctor.
- I know. I can't work on live people.
- They freak me out.
- Are you kidding?
Why do you think I work here?
Nobody chooses this job.
It's gonna be fine. I know what to do.
I just can't do it without dry heaving.
You can do this, I know you can.
I'll be right here.
- Actually, I'll be right here.
- Okay, what's first?
You need to isolate the entry wound.
Do you think you can do that?
I think so.
Careful. Given the subatmospheric
pressure in the cavity...
debris might have caused infection.
How's the internal bleeding?
- Pretty bad.
- Okay, you need to seal off any gushers...
and decrease the level of blood loss.
Not that one.
The one next to
the hydrogen needle.
Okay, that worked. Now what?
I want you to get out of here right now.
If I leave, Nicole dies.
Who are you? I thought you said
you were a friend of Nicole's?
I lied.
Look, I came to say goodbye.
You came here for the bullet.
- Is she still alive?
- Look, we both know...
that you didn't shoot her.
Yeah, but can you prove it?
Because the bullet came from my gun!
Everybody knows I still love Nicole...
and there were no witnesses.
Now, I need the evidence.
And the evidence is inside of her.
Davis, don't!
If you move, he'll shoot you.
Justin, there is a witness.
And she's lying here on this table.
<i>She's the onIy one who can testify</i>
<i>that AIyssa shot her, not you.</i>
Look, we can save her, and you.
But you've got to give us the time.
<i>Right now, you've got a choice.</i>
Your life goes one of two ways.
Which is it gonna be?
All right, where do I go from here?
You might have to bag her.
How's her breathing?
It sounds okay.
Good.
Looks like her lungs didn't collapse.
That's a good sign.
How was your day?
Well, I'll be honest. Nice effort.
You know, the waitress
and the little kid with the ball. Very clever.
But I'm sorry. Game over.
'Cause it ain't gonna snow out of nowhere.
Let me see your watch.
- Yeah, that's two minutes fast.
- So?
Look outside.
Unbelievable.
I have...
First I thought you were messing with me
with the card....
But there's no getting around this.
I don't understand. I can't comprehend...
but I do believe you now.
That's all I wanted.
You have no idea what this means to me.
- Thank you.
- No.
Thank you.
Do you know what this does for me?
You're omniscient.
You're like the ultimate bodyguard.
- That's not--
- It's like a free pass.
- If anybody steps to me, you can--
- No, that's not what this is.
Hold on a sec.
Hello? Chaz! What's up?
Yeah, I got your money. I'll be honest.
I don't think I'm gonna make it tonight.
No. Look, I'll call you.
- You owe him money?
- Yeah. But what's the rush?
- I'll get it to him.
- Harrison, you can't just do that.
If you don't pay him....
I won't always be there to help you.
But of course you will, Tru.
You're my sister.
Justin turned himself in,
and they arrested his girlfriend...
- based on what he told the cops.
- And Nicole?
I sent her to County. She's stable.
Her parents just called
and they wanted to thank the doctor.
That's nice.
They meant you.
She wouldn't have made it without you.
And neither would I.
It's kind of funny...
this is the second time
that someone's saved my life.
Really, what happened?
Sorry. Hello?
Hey, Tru. It's me.
<i>Meredith, are you aII right?</i>
Tru.
Tru.
Help me.
Hold tight, sweetie, I'll be right there.
It's my sister.
It's okay. Go ahead.
It's been a long day, or two.
We'll discuss it another time.
Okay.
Hey, Tru.
Ronny.
Prom is coming up.
- Is it?
- Yeah, and you know I wanted to....
Ronny, anything you want to tell me...
or ask me, you go right ahead.
Candace, not now. I'll call you later, okay?
I'm really sorry, Tru, but this can't wait.
What he's trying to say is that
he wants to go to the prom with me.
What?
Candace, how could you do this to me?
We're best friends.
Tru, high school's nearly over,
and everyone knows...
that high school friendships don't last.
So why would I let a friendship...
that's probably going to end anyway,
get in the way of something I want?
Try not to take it so hard. Things change.
<i>See you.</i>
Thank God.
Did you nod off?
What's this?
"High school reunion." You going to this?
Go back to high school? Absolutely...
not.
Help me.
I can't believe you.
How many times will you say
you're not coming to the reunion tonight?
It'll be fun.
Lindsay.
Okay, for the last time, you are coming,
even if I have to drag you there myself.
You can try, but I'm warning you.
My girl's stubborn.
Come on. I'm going.
- Harrison, you weren't even in our class.
- I was two years behind.
And Lindsay's taking me as her date.
Good. Go. Have fun, and you can tell me
all about it tomorrow.
Is she okay?
Guess I'll go find out.
So, just out of curiosity,
did you have friends in our class?
Well, not five years ago.
But now I have you.
Did I miss something back there?
I just don't want to go
to my high school reunion is all.
- That bad?
- Parts of it.
Parts of it were great.
I'm just not so keen on reliving it.
Look, I didn't know you back then.
I'm not even sure I know you now.
But you got a lot to be proud of, Tru.
Good friends.
A cool, if slightly morbid, new job.
Med school's not that far away.
No, I know, it's just--
Plus...
you got a cool new boyfriend
you can take to the reunion and show off.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I'm so glad you decided to come.
Okay, what do you think?
Too much cleavage?
Shame on you. No such thing.
You know what you should wear?
Those pinstriped pants you got downtown.
Definitely.
You know what? Meredith borrowed them
two months ago...
and left them at the dry cleaners.
All she left me was this ticket.
- How is Meredith, anyway?
- Good. Rehab is going well.
- She'll be home in a few weeks.
- Good.
Don't worry.
I'll pick something out for you.
Here, start with these. We'll build around.
Hey, do you remember Craig Burg?
- Soccer goalie, total hottie. Sure.
- I had the hugest crush on him.
Yeah. You left him that note.
Yeah. I told him everything
about how I felt...
put it in his locker, waited for him
to do something.
- And what did he do?
- Nothing.
He just never even responded.
God, I think about that all the time.
You think he'll be there tonight?
- One way to find out.
- Yes.
My God, back in high school.
Just for a few hours. Just breathe.
Stay strong.
Come on, let's check out some snacks.
Okay, I'll find you later.
Just remember, breathe.
Billy?
Hi.
That's a nice tie. I didn't know
people were still wearing those...
in this century.
- Who's that?
- Candace Aimes.
- You know her?
- We used to be best friends.
- Tru Davies. It's me.
- Billy.
Billy Lambert. My God, you look great.
I almost didn't recognize you.
Not that you didn't look great
back in high school.
Who are you kidding?
I was a pizza- faced beanpole.
- But that was then, right?
- What's been going on with you, Billy?
I've developed this software
that's gonna revolutionize downloading.
It'll make the MP3 player obsolete.
That's great. I'll see you inside, okay? Bye.
So how you holding up so far?
Glad you came?
My God, it's you!
Judy Rogers.
Judy, of course. How can I forget?
This is my boyfriend.
Can you believe it? Everyone here
in one room. It's like we never left.
Don't you love reunion directories?
You can keep tabs on everyone.
Of course, they don't tell the whole story.
Like Larry Cutler,
addicted to prescription painkillers.
Judy, this is--
And Kenny Lewis is gay.
<i>Heard about Steve Sabitzsky?</i>
He went into his father's carpet business
and fired his own dad.
Judy was--
And Gillian Kaye? You noticed?
Less nose, more boobs.
All bought and paid for.
Judy was the captain of the swim team.
He's adorable.
Well, honey, you traded up.
That Ronny Clifton,
you heard about him and Candace?
She thinks she's everything
'cause she was Prom Queen.
I had the swim team.
Candace couldn't swim.
I see someone I have to talk to.
But this has been great.
Right.
Nice to meet you.
Craig.
Hey, Glenn Carpenter.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Later. Yeah, sure.
Craig Burg.
Hey.
This is gonna sound a little strange,
but toward the end of senior year...
I left a note in your locker...
and I wrote down how I felt about you...
in detail, embarrassing detail, actually.
And I never got an answer
and I was just wondering, you know?
I never got any note.
I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Excuse me for a second.
Hey, what's up, dude?
Hey, big guy.
Voting for tonight's Reunion Queen.
Want to cast your vote?
Yeah. One for Lindsay.
Thanks.
So what exactly was the deal
with you and this Ronny guy?
High school crush gone awry.
But you can ask him yourself.
There he is.
I tell you what. I think
I'm going to go get you a refill instead.
Tru.
Hi, Ronny. God, it's been a while.
Last time I saw you,
it was right around prom time.
I know it's about five years too late,
but I owe you an apology.
I never meant to hurt you, Tru.
Candace just got what she wanted.
You know, she always did.
- Always will.
- You don't sound too happy about it.
Me? No, I'm good. I'm real good.
Life couldn't be any better right now.
Hmm.
Well, it was real nice seeing you, Ronny.
See you, Tru.
What's the matter?
You looking for someone?
No, nobody.
Well, let's go dance or something.
No, thanks.
I'm not really for the dancing thing.
Okay. Well, do you want to go
get a drink then?
Hello? Earth to Harrison.
What do you want to do?
I'll be right back.
Who's that?
Mr. Connor.
He is the best teacher I ever had.
He was the first one
who really got through to me.
Made me think for myself.
He changed my life.
So go say hi to him.
It's not that easy.
Look who he's with. Candace.
Time to let bygones be bygones, Tru.
Mr. Connor, hi.
Tru Davies.
I was hoping you'd be here tonight.
<i>I'm so gIad you came.</i>
- Tru.
- Candace.
You look great.
I could never get away with an outfit
like that. You are so brave.
- Thanks.
- Is this your boyfriend?
We'll give you a chance
to catch up with Mr. Connor.
Couldn't deny you that.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
I think they're free.
Mr. Connor, how are things?
How's the writing?
I remember how you were always
gonna write the great American novel.
Actually, Tru, the writing
is going surprisingly well.
I am working on something
that I feel so good about.
Great. That's great.
Still thinking about Candace.
I guess some things haven't changed
that much in the last five years.
How's it going, man? Grab one of these?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
- Keith.
- Hey.
- Keith Morgan!
- Hey, what's up, man?
- You don't remember me, do you?
- I'm sorry. I can't say that I do.
Well, I'll tell you what.
How about I remind you?
All right.
<i>HeIIo, can I have your attention, pIease?</i>
<i>We've counted aII the baIIots,</i>
<i>and it is now time to announce...</i>
<i>our CIass of'99 Five Year Reunion Queen.</i>
<i>Tonight our Queen is Candace Aimes.</i>
Do you know that
Craig never even got my note?
He doesn't even remember me.
Ouch!
So much for high school memories.
Can you believe this?
I can't. It's like a nightmare.
The recurring kind.
Wow!
<i>Thank you so much.</i>
<i>This is such a surprise.</i>
<i>Okay, not that much of a surprise.</i>
<i>Anyway, it's so good seeing you aII here.</i>
<i>Some of whom I actuaIIy even remember.</i>
<i>This has been--</i>
I told you I don't know who you are!
- Harrison? Jeez! Are you okay?
- Okay? I'm great.
I've waited years
to punch this son of a bitch.
Now I remember. You're that guy
whose ass I used to kick.
Is this what you came here for tonight?
Settle some stupid high school grudge?
Yeah.
I mean, no.
I came for you.
You're unbelievable, Harrison.
He'll be fine. But are you all right?
Yeah. Great.
Convincing.
But it kind of looks to me
like you got Candace on the brain.
Hey, if you two really were best friends,
now's a good time to go talk to her.
Put things to rest.
- Did you see where Candace went?
- I saw her heading to the pool.
Thanks.
Candace, are you in here?
<i>Oh, no.</i>
- My God! Candace?
- Save me.
Did you nod off?
What's this?
"High school reunion." Cool.
You going to this?
Yes, I am.
Again.
Again? You're going
to your high school reunion again?
So does this mean--
My day is repeating itself.
- Who's the lucky victim today?
- Candace Aimes, high school classmate.
- A friend of yours?
- It's complicated.
Let's just say I doubt
she'll really appreciate any of my help.
But she drowned at the reunion yesterday.
Drowned.
Was there fluid in her lungs?
I don't know.
The day rewound before I had a chance
to examine anything.
- So really I've got nothing to go on.
- What about foam?
Drowning victims are often identified
by a physical reaction known as foam film.
When the body goes into rapid shock,
then responds...
with the formation of mucus
around the throat and windpipe?
No. Totally clean.
It sounds like you have a murder to solve.
You think someone murdered Candace
outside the pool...
then dumped her in it
to make it look like a drowning?
It's a theory.
Okay, I got to run. But stay close.
I may need you tonight.
I'm so excited.
I knew you'd come to the reunion.
Wouldn't miss it. I was thinking,
let's just you and me go together.
You didn't want to go, did you?
And miss another round of high school?
I'll survive.
Well, I'm going.
- You weren't in our class, Harry.
- I've promised him.
Yeah, but you'd have so much more fun
without him. Trust me.
You understand, don't you? We'll catch
a movie or something tomorrow night.
No. But I was so looking forward to this.
Hey, count your blessings, Harrison.
High school sucked.
Hey, can I talk to you a sec?
What are you doing?
This is my big date with Lindsay.
Liar. You just want to go
so you can pick a fight with Keith Morgan.
What are you talking about?
There is....
We already went to the reunion,
didn't we?
Consider it a heads up.
You know how annoying it is
to have a sibling with your powers?
You're welcome.
- Tru.
- Hey.
What a surprise. What are you....
How did you know where I live?
You were listed in the Reunion Directory.
Which hasn't come out yet,
but I'm on the committee...
and I helped put it together. Nice building.
It'll do. For now.
I don't mean to be blunt,
but what brings you here?
Candace, you remember
when we used to be friends?
- One reunion and everyone gets weepy.
- Come on.
We used to ditch classes together
and talk on the phone all the time.
- We were kind of tight.
- I know.
But I'm through with the past.
Because as good as things are for me now,
they're about to get a whole lot better.
- Really? How so?
- I wrote a novel.
It's called <i>High SchooI ConfidentiaI.</i>
It's all about life in high school.
No one's seen it yet, but when they do...
it's going to be
this generation's <i>Less Than Zero.</i>
Wow, that's great. I'm so happy for you.
So please don't take this the wrong way...
but you can't go
to the reunion tonight, Candace.
I see.
You still have that jealousy problem.
Is that why you came here?
To keep me away
so I can't outshine you again?
No. It's just,
reunions can get kind of crazy...
and who knows
what could happen tonight?
I know exactly what will happen.
You'll show up with Linda, or Lindy--
Lindsay.
And you'll be wearing something
she picked out for you.
I'm thinking two- year- old black skirt,
faux vintage top.
Thanks for stopping by, Tru.
It's really nice catching up with you.
But I wouldn't miss that reunion tonight
for the world.
What's the matter? You seem
so tense. Got the pre- reunion jitters?
I just keep thinking about Candace Aimes.
Can you think of anyone who would
still be holding a grudge against her?
Strange question. Let me think.
- I know. The entire graduating class?
- Not high school. I mean now, today.
Who would still have issues with her?
Ronny Clifton might still be upset with her
after what she did to him.
Why, what did she do to him?
You never heard?
After Candace stole Ronny from you,
they got engaged...
and then she left him at the altar,
broke his heart.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I guess no one told you because,
well, you know....
Finally. My pants.
- Hi. I have a delivery for--
- Billy!
Tru!
This is....
I haven't seen you for what?
Like five years.
- Yeah.
- Is this for you?
- Under my sister's name, yeah.
- $8.
- Are you going to the thing tonight?
- Wouldn't miss it.
You know my favorite part
about these reunions...
is listening to everyone
out- BS- ing each other...
and trying to make themselves sound
big and important.
Right.
I'll see you tonight, Tru.
Billy, hi.
That's a nice tie. I didn't know
people were still wearing those...
in this century.
She'll always think I'm a geek.
You know, I shouldn't be telling you this...
but I've developed this software
that's going to revolutionize downloading.
It'll make MP3 players obsolete.
Tru!
Hey Billy.
Tru! My God, it's you!
Hello, Judy!
Can you believe it? Everyone here
in one room. It's like we never left.
- Have you seen Larry Cutler yet?
- Addicted- to- painkillers Larry? Yeah.
- And Kenny Lewis--
- Gay.
- And did you hear about Steve Sabitzsky?
- Fired his dad.
How about--
Gillian Kaye, with all that plastic surgery?
And did you know Candace Aimes
could never even swim?
It's been so great
catching up with you, Judy.
Ronny, hi.
- Tru. Hey. You look great.
- Thanks.
- It's weird, all of us being back here.
- Yeah, no kidding.
You okay seeing Candace again?
It didn't work out. Let's leave it at that.
She really hurt you.
No one can blame you
if you wanted her to hurt, too.
Slow down, okay? I mean,
what happened with Candace and me...
yeah, it hurt. But it's history.
Water under the bridge.
She really broke your heart.
People say I broke your heart.
It doesn't make you want to hurt me,
does it?
Craig. Hey, it's Tru Davies.
Listen, my best friend, Lindsay,
is a really good person.
Awesome.
I know you don't remember her...
but in high school she put a note
in your locker and you never got it.
I don't know why. But just do me a favor.
If she brings it up tonight,
just be nice to her.
Could you do that for me?
I guess I can.
Hey, Tru, you got a minute?
I want you to know something.
I'm not some total loser
who works at a dry cleaners'.
- Look, I didn't say anything.
- I know.
You see,
I would have done everything that I said.
See, I had all this venture capital lined up.
It was cool until the guy pulled the plug
at the last minute.
And then, no more capital to venture with.
I'm sorry. Whoever the guy was,
I'm sure he made a huge mistake.
You know who the guy was?
Candace's dad.
- Really?
- Yeah. Nice, huh?
Beer, please.
You made it. I didn't think you'd show.
It's not like we got anything else going on.
Yeah. Thanks to my sister.
You really wanted to go to that reunion,
didn't you?
You want to know why?
- Lindsay.
- No.
Keith Morgan.
See, this guy used to torture me.
It started out with little swirlies
after gym class.
And then it was beatings
on a semi- regular basis.
And now he's back in town.
- You wanted to go tonight so you can get--
- Two words: re- venge.
They asked me to transfer
to another school...
- but I figured that I could do more work--
- Do you mind if I cut in?
Tru Davies. What a treat.
Hi, Tru. Great seeing you.
Did you come here stag tonight?
No boyfriend?
It's a nice outfit.
Somehow not what I expected.
- Do you mind if I talk to you for a second?
- About what?
Why you didn't want me coming?
Tru tried to convince me
that I shouldn't show...
but I told her, high school's over.
She can relax.
Look, there's Larry Whitesman.
I have to tell him how good he looks
with the extra weight.
- Don't let Candace get to you, Tru.
- She doesn't.
How come
you can't take your eyes off of her?
How about a dance
for an old teacher?
Look, maybe it's Candace,
or maybe it's just being back here...
but I can tell there's something
on your mind...
and I just want to say that
even though you've graduated...
my office door is still always open to you.
I appreciate it, Mr. Connor.
Tru, is there something wrong?
Not if I can help it.
Candace, are you in here?
Candace, watch out!
- Dude, this was priceless.
- I've been waiting five years for this.
Come on, get right in there.
- Tru, what are you doing?
- She can't swim.
- You could've killed her.
- It was just a prank, okay?
Yeah, we thought you hated Candace
more than anyone.
You okay?
I think you swallowed some water,
but you'll be all right.
- Hey! What the hell is going on here?
- Nothing, Curtis. I mean, Mr. Connor.
Yeah, we're just having some fun.
Very mature, guys.
Laugh it up, both of you.
They told me to meet them here.
See how funny
you think assault charges are.
You're both witnesses.
Candace, are you okay?
Back off, Tru.
It's not like you saved my life or anything.
All right, guys, back inside. Let's go!
There's some dryers in the locker
room. You might want to use them.
It's too early.
Morgue.
<i>Davis, it's me.</i>
Hey, Tru. How's the reunion?
Everyone still alive?
The good news is, I saved Candace
after she got shoved in the pool.
What's the bad news?
<i>It was just a prank.</i>
Which means her life is still in danger
and the murder's still on track.
Well, maybe the pool prank
killed Candace on day one.
That's impossible. The times don't match.
Candace wasn't in the gym until 9:30
and I found her at 10:00.
<i>Something must have changed.</i>
What did you do differently tonight
than last night?
Luc! Candace was
talking to him yesterday...
and so she couldn't get to the pool.
But he didn't come with me tonight.
<i>That's it. So your invoIvement in events</i>
<i>can change them.</i>
Last night you saved Candace
from humiliation.
<i>Tonight you have to stop her murder.</i>
Unfortunately, you're back to square one
on suspects.
<i>Looks Iike it.</i>
Stay in touch, okay?
I might need you. This isn't over.
God, and I was just a little runt back then.
And this dude put me through a living hell.
For years!
And I have been waiting
since the 10th grade to return the favor.
Tonight was going to be the night, man.
But no!
My sis has got to convince Lindsay
to leave me at home.
Look, I'm sure she had a good reason.
Yeah, when you can do what Tru does,
you always have a good reason, right?
What do you mean?
What can your sister do?
Well, you know....
She's always looking after little brother.
It's too bad we can't just
crash the reunion. That'd solve everything.
Let's crash.
Craig.
Hey, Glenn Carpenter.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Later. Yeah, sure.
Craig Burg.
Hi, Lindsay.
You remembered.
This may sound a little strange,
but toward the end of senior year...
- I left you a note in your locker, and--
- I never got it.
But let me tell you something.
If I had gotten a note from you....
If a girl as beautiful and charming as you
had given me one...
- I'd be touched.
- You would?
Without a doubt. And I would have done
something about it, too.
Who knows where it could've led?
But as it is, I'm married.
- Congratulations, Craig. That's great.
- Yeah, I think so.
But I'm glad you said something tonight.
It's good to reconnect.
It was so good to see you, Craig.
There you are. I've been looking
for you! I've told everyone.
- Told everyone what?
- Votes for Reunion Queen.
Pass.
About you, Tru. Saving Candace.
They all agree you're a big hero.
<i>But I wish we had BiIIy's pictures.</i>
<i>I was taIking to--</i>
I've got something really important to do,
and I'm sorry, but I can't be distracted.
- Tru!
- All right!
Is this a bad time?
I know how eager you were
to have us here tonight.
Great.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I didn't think you were coming.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I didn't think you were coming.
I wasn't, but then I remembered.
I got some business to take care of.
Sorry about the surprise.
It seemed like a good idea
about half an hour ago.
- No, it's fine.
- You sure?
- It's just been kind of a crazy night.
- Crazy good, or crazy bad?
That's the thing. I don't know yet.
Okay.
<i>Why don't you find me</i>
<i>when you figure it out?</i>
I'll be at the bar. Brown jacket.
You know,
I have my own opinion about Candace.
I told you. Now is not the best--
You could've let her drown.
What? You're kidding, right?
You know, it isn't fair.
Everyone always says Candace has things.
She has boyfriends, and she has money...
and looks and popularity.
But Candace doesn't have those things.
- She took them.
- What's that?
She took them from people like me.
I could've been Prom Queen,
but Candace took it.
Now, you ask me,
she deserves everything she gets.
Let's get some air.
Come on, let's get you out of here.
Why?
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>
<i>We finaIIy have aII the baIIots in</i>
<i>and it's now time to announce...</i>
<i>tonight's CIass of'99</i>
<i>Five Year Reunion Queen.</i>
<i>And tonight our Queen is Tru Davies.</i>
No. You don't understand.
Don't be shy!
<i>I think we'd all Iike to hear a few words.</i>
Excuse me, I've got to go.
Excuse me.
Mr. Connor!
Tru. You caught me grading papers.
Why aren't you inside?
I need your help.
- What's the trouble?
- I don't have time to explain.
I need you to listen. Candace is in danger.
I think Judy's going to hurt her.
I know a lot of old feelings
can get stirred up at these reunions.
- But violence? I don't think so.
- Normally, I wouldn't either.
But you're going to have to believe me.
I believe that you believe it.
- How can I help?
- Have you seen Candace or Judy?
- I haven't, but--
- I need you to do me a favor.
Let's split up. I'll take this wing,
you go that way...
and just keep an eye out
for either of them.
- Please don't ask why.
- That'd be two favors, wouldn't it?
Judy.
It's not fair, Tru.
- Where's Candace?
- I said it's not fair!
Okay, now you're starting to scare me.
I can't take it anymore.
It's like high school all over again.
<i>Nothing ever changes.</i>
First, Candace is Prom Queen. Now you.
How come it's never my turn?
How come girls like Candace always win,
and girls like me always lose?
All I can tell you, Judy, is,
things change, I promise.
Now help me out. I need to find Candace.
Why is Candace
so important to everybody?
To you, to Mr. Connor. I'm important, too.
What do you mean, Mr. Connor?
I just saw her, with him.
You just saw them together?
Yeah.
Like two minutes ago.
I wrote a novel.
It's called <i>High SchooI ConfidentiaI.</i>
So you're sure
no one's seen your novel?
It's like I've been telling you, Mr. Connor.
No one's seen it.
- Why do you keep asking me that?
- Just need to be sure.
You told me it was no good,
that it needed lots of work.
Of course I haven't shown it to anyone.
I was feeling so good about it,
until I showed it to you.
Why'd you want to meet me here?
It's so creepy.
I have been trying to write a novel
for years, with no success...
watching students like you graduate,
move on, pass me by.
I thought you'd be proud of me.
I am.
Your first try, you write a book...
that I have been trying to
put to paper for years.
I know my limits, Candace.
The only way
that I will write a book as great as yours...
is if I make it my own.
That's impossible.
Not if no one's seen it.
Not if no one knows.
Oh, God.
No one knows.
The only way for you to steal
my novel from me--
I am so sorry, Candace.
- Tru, what are you doing here?
- I was looking for Candace.
I just wanted to tell her
how much I loved her book.
See, the only way this works for you
is if nobody's seen it.
So now you've got a choice.
You can kill Candace
and put your name on the book.
But you're gonna have to kill me, too.
You won't tell anyone, will you?
Not if you resign tomorrow
and turn yourself in.
<i>You know, it's a shame.</i>
<i>The schooI's going to Iose a good teacher.</i>
You used to be my favorite, Mr. Connor.
But I guess things change.
My God.
<i>Ladies and gentIemen of the CIass of'99...</i>
<i>pIease weIcome back our Queen,</i>
<i>Tru Davies.</i>
That's my sister.
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>
<i>For those of you who remember me...</i>
<i>you know I'm not too good</i>
<i>at giving speeches. But here goes.</i>
<i>High schooI was a time...</i>
<i>that pretty much sucked for most of us.</i>
<i>Let's face it, it was aII about</i>
<i>being picked on or getting Ieft out.</i>
<i>But tonight I think</i>
<i>we get the chance to change that.</i>
<i>We can Iet bygones be bygones.</i>
<i>This tiara means a Iot to some peopIe.</i>
<i>But it doesn't beIong to me. Judy Rogers.</i>
<i>You know everything about everyone</i>
<i>in this entire cIass.</i>
<i>And you've been</i>
<i>waiting five years for this.</i>
<i>So that makes you Queen in my book.</i>
<i>Why don't you come up here</i>
<i>and remind us how great you are?</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>For once, I'm speechIess.</i>
Lindsay? Hi. Glenn, again.
Hi.
This might sound crazy, but there's
something I've always wanted to tell you.
I always thought
you were the most beautiful girl in school.
And then you left that note in my locker.
- I left that note in your locker?
- That note changed my life.
It did?
It made me realize
one very important thing.
If I couldn't have feelings for you,
I couldn't have feelings for any girl.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that my note
made you realize that you're gay?
That note made me gay.
And let me tell you something.
Come 10th year reunion, that tiara is mine.
God, what a night.
My note turned one guy into a liar,
another one gay.
The power of the written word.
- And how was your night?
- Typical.
Don't even get me started
on Harrison, either.
My God, Harrison. I totally forgot.
He didn't try to pick a fight
with Keith Morgan, did he?
- Now I remember you.
- Drinks are up, ladies.
They've been like that all night.
I thought they were going to fight,
but then Luc just started laughing at them.
Now they're the Three freaking Amigos.
Lucky me.
I'll be right back.
There's something I have to take care of.
Candace, how you holding up?
I'm fine. Why?
I was just wondering.
After the ordeal you went through--
- I don't need your pity.
- It's not pity, Candace. It's friendship.
To be honest, I don't need that, either.
Candace, we used to be best friends.
I know things change.
We're not friends now,
but maybe that could change, too.
I know I'd really like that.
What do you say?
Sorry, Tru.
Some things change.
Some things never will.
Hi.
- I'm glad you're still here.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Then how about a dance?
I thought you'd never ask.
So tonight must have
brought back some memories?
Yeah. A few.
You know who you should take
to the prom? Ronny Clifton.
- He's so out of my league.
- No way. He'd be lucky to have you.
- You mean it?
- What are best friends for?
Let's never change, okay?
We'll be wrinkly old best friend ladies
together, forever.
Yeah. Come on.
Harrison?
Call it even.
What's up?
What the hell is going on?
This, guys, is Tru.
My kind, caring...
and did I mention beautiful sister?
Nice to meet you guys. Explain.
You know how you and I
depend on each other?
- Harrison?
- The old saying:
<i>- "Mi casa es su casa"?</i>
- Harrison?
How about the Biblical quotation
that states:
"Let you without sin cast the first-- "
Harrison, just tell me what happened.
Our landlord.
A real stickler for the whole
"paying the rent" thing.
You got evicted?
Which brings us back to <i>"mi casa."</i>
What's that water?
Yeah, you might not want to....
What is that?
Luc just fixed the sink this morning.
What did you do?
Nothing.
Guess you had to be there.
Why couldn't you have gone to Lindsay's?
Because telling your
new girlfriend you've just been evicted...
isn't very effective pillow talk.
Okay, we're out.
- Looks like you need your alone time.
- Thanks.
Let go, boys. I can take a hint.
Zachary.
By the way, there's some more beer
in the bathtub if you want to....
Yeah, right. Yeah.
- Open up the register.
- Excuse me?
You heard me. Open it up.
There's nothing. There's nothing here.
The cash went out an hour ago.
Then give me what you have. Now!
Help me.
You don't mind?
I am perfectly capable of prepping
a body solo.
Besides, you don't look so hot.
Stay away from the shrimp sandwich
at that new deli across the street.
Ouch.
You know, actually I'm....
If you'll excuse me....
Hey, there.
I'm Tru.
And you are...
...in the red.
How about a name?
Help me.
Bad dream?
Yeah. Bad dream.
What am I doing out here?
Well, the plan was you, me,
wine, and a movie.
The reality was you, wine,
passed out on the couch.
Anyway, sorry if I woke you.
I wanted to take care of this.
Luc just fixed the sink this morning.
What did you do?
You're fixing it.
Yeah.
Like you've been asking me to all week.
And she's off.
Yeah, I'm meeting Lindsay for breakfast.
On a weekday? Doesn't she work?
She's taking a sick day.
How do you know? You just woke up.
'Cause that's a girl thing.
- Aren't you gonna change first?
- These clothes are fine.
Besides, I'm running late.
Okay.
All right. Here's the thing.
I don't even mind your crazy excuses
about where you have to go all the time.
What I do mind is that you keep
a part of your life hidden from me.
No, it's nothing.
I'll make it up to you tonight.
Just bring coffee.
Hey, Tru.
<i>HeIIo?</i>
Hey, Harrison, it's me.
I've got some bad news.
<i>Give it to me.</i>
You'll be evicted today.
Tell me something I don't know.
<i>Meredith's in rehab.</i>
<i>Why don't you crash at her pIace?</i>
Or what about yours?
<i>Been there.</i>
- Hated that.
- A dreaded rewind day.
So, what did I do?
Poker with the boys, food on my couch,
flood in my kitchen.
<i>Tru, I am shocked.</i>
Shocked. I would never do anything....
Whoa, wait, was I winning?
Bye, Harr.
I'm kind of in a--
This will take a second.
I'm writing this song and I can't get
the last lyric. Check this out.
<i>I'm Iivin' out Ioud,</i>
<i>I'm drivin'right through</i>
<i>WiII you meet me there?</i>
<i>WiII you be true?</i>
Nice little pun there."Tru."
That's not what I meant.
That's not
quite what I'm looking for.
More of a....
All right.
If the body asked for help, why didn't you
come to the morgue first and check?
Because he asked before I got
anything to go on.
No name, no personals.
I'm lucky I got the receipt.
And you are....
He should be here any minute.
<i>You got nothing eIse?</i>
<i>BuIIet wound to the chest.</i>
Wait, Davis, put the sandwich down.
- Why?
- Davis, it's a rewind day.
You want details,
or do you want to trust me?
Done.
Look, here he comes. I'll call you later.
...in the red.
ATM can really ruin your day, huh?
Can I just go on through? Thanks.
Can I help you?
Yes. There's a man
who went in before me.
Are you a relative?
No, but--
Nobody goes there unless they have
an appointment. Do you have one?
Didn't think so.
I have to ask you to take a seat.
And I have to ask you to bend the rules.
Otherwise you'll have
a situation on your hands.
I think I already do.
All right, yeah.
What's up, Harrison?
I went over to Meredith's, like you said.
<i>So you broke in?</i>
I didn't have a key.
And nobody told me she installed
this insane security system.
- So what's the password?
- What?
Wait! I'm coming!
Thanks a lot.
<i>Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth.</i>
<i>Nearest unit respond immediateIy.</i>
<i>The password.</i>
<i>What is the stupid password?</i>
Sorry, I've got to call you back.
What?
Fellas. It is so good to see you.
Just give me the money.
There's nothing here.
- Now!
- Don't!
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
- Hey.
- I didn't mean to....
Can you hear me?
God, I'm sorry.
Talk to me. Hey.
Come on.
No. Please, no.
Stay with me.
No.
Is he....
Save me.
This can't be happening.
Bad dream?
More like a recurring nightmare.
Sorry if I woke you.
I wanted to take care of this.
Right. Thanks.
Sorry about crashing out last night.
I swear I'll make it up to you.
And she's off.
Where are you going this time?
The library.
- Doesn't open till 12:00.
- Right. I'm going to the university library.
For what?
For a work thing.
Are we playing 20 Questions?
No, just two.
Look, it's no fun for me either,
but I've really got to go.
And don't worry about the sink.
I don't think it's meant to be fixed.
- I can handle it.
- I didn't mean....
I know you can.
Thank you.
Bye.
Any time.
<i>No, Harr.</i> Mi casa es mi casa.
So you're asking me
to take up residence in a building...
where all my neighbors are dead?
Hang out at the morgue
until I figure something out.
<i>Wait, Iet me guess.</i>
Rewind day?
You could say that. Twice.
- So, what did I do?
- Trashed my place...
got busted breaking into
Meredith's apartment.
<i>Impressive.</i>
Just go to the morgue.
<i>Later.</i>
- Hey, Brian.
- I'm writing this song.
See if you can help me out.
Check this out.
<i>I'm Iivin' out Ioud,</i>
<i>I'm drivin'right through</i>
<i>WiII you meet me there?</i>
<i>Or are we through?</i>
You want me to rhyme"through"
with"through"?
That's creative.
How about....
- It rewound again?
- Yes.
Well, that's unexpected.
I thought I finally understood
how this thing works.
Someone asks for help, I save them,
happily ever after. But this time....
- Someone else died.
- Yeah. Because of me.
But because of you, someone lived.
Yeah, a guy committing a felony.
Explain to me how that's fair.
Can anybody just ask for help now?
Maybe there's a homicidal maniac
who needs some assistance?
Come on, Tru.
I've been through this twice,
and each time someone different died.
Which one am I supposed to save now?
Both.
Great. I know where one of them
is gonna be in eight minutes.
About the sandwich?
Right about...
now.
Aren't you....
Hey, I'm Lauren.
I work at the Rose Food Market.
Sorry, no.
In case you're planning on stopping by...
you should know we're closed
for inventory today.
Doors are locked, the registers are empty.
Listen, I don't know you,
or the Rose Food Market...
and I don't know why I care
if you're doing your inventory today.
Muscle tone appears slack.
Large, fatty liver.
Could be cirrhosis.
- I thought I had it bad.
- What are you doing here?
Following orders.
Tru told me to crash here.
Crash?
Yeah.
So where's my room?
Room?
We don't have rooms. We have drawers.
Whatever.
I'm easy.
I haven't seen you since my sister's party.
We never really got a chance to chat.
About?
Hello?
We're the only two people
who know what she can do.
Hey, you ever thought of convincing her
to play the ponies?
No.
I believe her gift provides her
with a higher calling. Do you mind?
These are sterile.
Well, they were sterile.
So, rewind day, huh?
Multiple rewind day.
Multiple?
Yeah, she told me.
First.
You gonna eat this?
No, it's good.
It's all yours.
Thanks.
Hey.
Can I help you?
Yeah. I don't feel very good.
I'm sorry. Do you have a doctor
or caseworker here?
No.
Okay, let me just get you set up.
Right now, I'm gonna be sick, ma'am.
To my stomach.
Down the hall, to your right.
You should be able to get it
more than anybody else.
You're telling me you can't
help me? Can you get me the medicine?
No--
Are you telling me you can't help me?
Will you give me the medicine?
I can't.
That's it?
- I don't have any more time.
- Mr. Mancuso, wait.
Hi, Patricia? Yeah, Stephanie Brandis.
Stephanie, it's nice to meet you.
Finally we got
another caseworker here. Come in.
If you're finished in the bathroom,
the doctor will see you now.
You know what? I'm feeling much better.
Hey, a little busy right now.
You must get your brother out of here.
Ten minutes ago, I found him
locked inside a crypt.
It's not a good time.
He's asking me how much
a corpse goes for on the black market.
Keep him occupied.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Not soon enough.
Why don't you ask me for help?
<i>Come on. Hook a brother up.</i>
Hey, dude?
What the hell was in that sandwich?
Mr. Mancuso!
Mr. Mancuso?
Wait!
Wait, I'm coming! Thanks a lot.
Somebody's robbing that store.
<i>Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth.</i>
<i>Nearest unit respond immediateIy.</i>
- Then give me what you have. Now!
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
Dear God.
Drop your weapon on the floor.
- I don't have any.
- It's in his left pocket.
- Empty it.
- This is all a big mistake.
My God! I didn't see him.
He came out of nowhere.
Somebody call an ambulance!
1180, Orange and First.
I need an EMS team immediately.
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>They're on their way.</i>
- Forget the ambulance.
- Is he....
Why didn't you listen to me?
I told you not to go in there.
Please.
Help me.
You've got to be kidding me.
What?
You've been trying to get me
to fix this sink for weeks.
Something tells me
it wants to stay broken.
Whoa, that's the fastest
I've ever seen you get ready.
That's the fastest I've ever seen
anybody get ready.
- Sorry, I've really got to run.
- Where?
Visiting Meredith.
- She wasn't allowed to have visitors.
- Only immediate family.
If it was something else,
you'd tell me, right?
Of course.
<i>Go crash at Lindsay's.</i>
'Cause telling your girlfriend you've been
evicted isn't very effective--
Pillow talk, my ass.
Nice language.
You having one of those days?
More like three of them.
Just be a polite guest, she'll understand.
Three? Sweet.
- Writing a song?
- How'd you know?
Because you're holding a guitar.
I'm sort of in a hurry.
Right. Okay. Check this out.
<i>I'm Iivin' out Ioud,</i>
<i>I'm drivin'right through</i>
<i>WiII you meet me there?</i>
<i>'Cause I'm stuck in traffic</i>
That doesn't rhyme.
Three times?
And each day, because of me,
someone different dies.
It's not your fault.
Besides, look at the bright side.
What's that?
Each day you're getting
a little bit more information.
Another clue.
Now you know the guy in the store
didn't have a gun.
So he's desperate. I get it. But so am I.
I mean, what if this day
never stops repeating?
If every day I wake up and make
the same lame excuse to Luc...
and call my brother in a vain attempt
to keep him out of trouble...
and then my neighbor with his lousy song?
I can't keep doing this.
Maybe your job isn't
as obvious as we thought.
What do you mean?
Perhaps someone
is supposed to die today...
and stay that way.
I can't deal with this.
I am not in the business of deciding
who is or isn't supposed to die.
- How do you know?
- Don't say that.
You know what everyone else my age
is deciding right now?
Grad school, or get a job?
Order in, or go out?
Do I really need a phone
that takes little pictures?
People say things happen for a reason.
That reason is fate.
Fate, by definition, is immutable.
- Maybe you're here to make sure that--
- Fate gets its way?
How do I know what it wants?
It'll tell you, eventually.
- And until then?
- You've got to trust your instincts.
- Back to the ATM?
- No.
Something went down in the clinic.
Whatever it was...
that's what made him desperate enough
to hold up the store.
Hi. I'm Stephanie Brandis,
one of your new caseworkers.
Hi, Patricia? Yeah, Stephanie Brandis.
Of course.
Through the door and to the left.
Patricia Norris is expecting you.
I thought she might be. Thanks.
Thank God. I've been asking
for a new caseworker for months.
Come on in.
I already started flipping
through some of the files.
I'm halfway through
the Mancuso case.
Awful, isn't it?
She is the sweetest child
you will ever meet.
She?
Elizabeth.
Her parents tried everything,
but with a case like this--
I haven't finished reading the file.
Elizabeth has acute viral cardiomyopathy.
- She had an echovirus last year.
- What's the course of treatment?
The doctor has her
on a daily antiarrhythmic.
But the medicine's just a Band- Aid.
Ultimately, she'll need a heart transplant.
- Is she on the list?
- Yeah, pretty far down.
With O- neg patients like her...
the chances of a heart
becoming available are....
Slim to none.
Exactly.
Mr. Mancuso lost his job six months ago.
- His insurance is on its last leg, so--
- I need to talk to you.
Michael. We were just discussing
your daughter's case.
This is Stephanie Brandis,
a new caseworker.
Nice to meet you.
I need more Amiodarone.
We ran out, and Elizabeth's breathing
is very heavy today.
I went to the pharmacy,
but the insurance denied me.
You know, they were gonna charge me
$500 for two pills?
I don't have $500.
I'm aware--
I need you to get me that medicine.
I promise, I'll pay you back.
- Mr. Mancuso, calm down.
- She's in pain.
I'm not a pharmacist.
I'm not authorized to give away medicine.
I thought you were supposed to help me.
Give us some time.
We'll see what we can do.
- I don't have any.
- Mr. Mancuso....
Mr. Mancuso, wait.
I don't have any more time.
- I can't imagine it getting worse for him.
- I can.
Look, I swear to you,
I'm Stephanie Brandis...
and I have a meeting.
Don't make me call security.
Michael.
I understand your daughter is in trouble,
but Patricia can help you.
- Wait for her call.
- My daughter needs her medicine now.
She's not going to get it
if you do something stupid.
What are you talking about?
Don't tell me you're looking
for a quick way to get cash...
which might include holding up
the nearest store you find.
Leave me alone.
Don't do this.
You got any other options?
She's 11 years old.
The one thing my daughter needs
is the thing I can't give her.
I look at her friends and I wonder...
why their hearts work and hers doesn't.
Why she got sick and they didn't.
I can't fix her...
but I can make her feel better.
She needs her medicine.
She needs it now.
I'll get it for you.
Just give me an hour.
And no charge, but promise me
you won't go into that store.
An hour?
And your address.
820 South Normandy, Apartment 2.
Amiodarone, right?
Yeah, 15 milligrams.
Got it. Go sit with your daughter.
I'll be right there.
Thank you.
Wait! I'm coming!
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
<i>Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth.</i>
<i>Nearest unit respond immediateIy.</i>
Go to the pharmacy on the corner
and ask for Timothy.
If she has shortness of breath,
this should work.
With acute viral cardiomyopathy,
she'll eventually--
I know. Need a transplant.
You sure he's gonna give me
$500 worth of medication?
He owes me. I set up his grandma
with a nice coffin last month.
It looks like you were wrong.
No one had to die today. Not one person.
I'm glad I was mistaken.
- What's up, Harry?
- I took your advice and went to Lindsay's.
<i>And you said to be a poIite houseguest.</i>
<i>WeII, I tried.</i>
But I thought I'd be nice
and cook a little something for dinner...
and I might have started a small fire.
And you're calling me why?
On the off chance
the day boomerangs again...
I need you to say two simple
words: takeout.
Good luck, Harry.
You okay?
Kind of not. No.
- Word of advice. Stay away from that--
- Shrimp sandwich.
Yeah, my bad. I forgot to warn you.
I've been kind of busy. Sorry.
It's okay. Priorities. Go.
Michael, I have the medicine.
Is she....
She's gone.
I should've been here sooner.
The medicine wouldn't have saved her life.
Thank you for trying.
I'm so sorry.
There's a plan for everyone.
Oh, come here.
<i>She's in a better pIace.</i>
We did everything we could.
You know we did everything.
Please.
Help me.
Bad dream?
I wish.
You don't need to bother fixing that.
Trust me.
- Are you okay?
- No.
Can I help?
No.
And she's off.
Out of curiosity,
where are you rushing off to?
I could make up some excuse
that you'd see right through...
because you know me, and I love that.
But for us to work,
you need to know everything.
For that to happen,
you need to wait a little bit longer.
Obviously, we have a lot to talk about.
But I see you're stressed about something,
so let me help with that.
You're right. Maybe you could help me
with something.
Harrison's having
a really bad couple of days.
And he might come by here.
Can you keep him out of trouble?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- I'll talk to you tonight.
- Yeah.
We'll see.
Tru.
<i>I'm Iivin' out Ioud,</i>
<i>I'm drivin'right through</i>
<i>WiII you meet me there?</i>
<i>So we can start anew</i>
That's my song.
I think we're on the same
kind of wavelength here.
You want to start a band?
You must be so sick
of explaining this to me.
Each time the day repeats, it gets worse.
You should've seen this family.
Let me get this straight again.
You saved the father.
Yeah. So he could watch his daughter die.
How is that okay?
- Without you, they both would've--
- I know.
But I'm still stuck in the same day.
What am I doing wrong?
Maybe you're doing everything
exactly right.
Davis, you can theorize all you want.
Maybe everything
was meant to lead you...
directly to this little girl.
So I'm supposed to keep Michael
away from the store...
and get help for his daughter?
And don't forget, the help that
he thinks she needs is useless.
The medicine isn't gonna save her life.
I have to get her to the hospital.
Davis, the sandwich in the fridge,
hand it over.
- What?
- Now.
What am I supposed to eat?
Michael.
- Who are you?
- You don't know me.
There's no time to explain,
but I'm here to help your daughter.
- She has to get to a hospital now.
- She's gonna be fine.
She's not. Elizabeth's in trouble.
- Believe me.
- How do you know her name?
Same way I know you're about to find out
that your balance is - $432.18.
- I don't understand.
- You'll go to the clinic...
to beg for free medicine for Elizabeth,
but let me save you some time.
Patricia Norris, your caseworker,
will be sympathetic...
but she's not authorized
to give you the meds.
What are you talking about?
Amiodarone isn't gonna save her life.
Her heart is gonna fail today.
Is there anything you wouldn't do
for your daughter?
I'd die for her.
Call your wife, and tell her
to get Elizabeth to the hospital.
Here.
Honey, it's me. Is she....
No, the medicine is not gonna help her.
Take her to the hospital.
Yeah, I'll meet you there.
Thank you...
whoever you are.
I want all your money right now.
I don't have a thing.
<i>Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth.</i>
<i>Nearest unit respond immediateIy.</i>
Come on!
Please. He doesn't have anything.
- Shut up.
- Please.
Take my necklace. It's worth a lot.
Just don't hurt him.
Please, take this.
All right.
All right, take it off. Come on.
- Come on.
- I'm trying.
No!
No!
Move it! The necklace, come on. Let's go.
Hey, it's okay.
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>
Multiple stab wounds.
He's bleeding out. We need another line.
Get a 14- gauge
and set up the rapid infuser.
Send a type and cross match
to the blood bank now. On three.
One, two, three.
- Who the hell are you?
- City morgue.
Where's my daughter?
Damn it. She's in v- fib.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
Get the paddles.
No.
Everybody clear?
Elizabeth.
Still no pulse. Start the compressions.
Please, no.
Oh, God, no.
Please try and calm down.
<i>Three entry wounds in</i>
<i>the right upper quadrant, set up for a DPO.</i>
Yes, doctor.
Blood in the peritoneum.
Where the hell is the trauma surgeon?
I'd die for her.
I'm not gonna make it.
Doctor?
Please.
Make sure she's okay, please.
Pressure's still dropping.
Clear.
Push more ringers, fast.
He needs blood.
Where is the O- neg I ordered?
On its way.
Scalpel.
With O- neg patients like Elizabeth...
the chances of a heart
becoming available are....
Slim to none.
You're a mess.
His heart was destroyed.
<i>But not today.</i>
I didn't need to save him,
I needed to save his heart.
For her.
Your daughter's gonna live a long
and healthy life.
Come on. Push through.
Damn it.
Time of death, 12:32 p. m.
His daughter needs his heart.
Notify the transplant team,
and get Pediatric Cardiology.
I hope
you didn't just break that.
Because Luc spent two hours
trying to fix it.
Yeah. I know.
Hey, you okay?
This has been the longest day of my life.
I know the feeling.
If it makes you feel any better,
I got evicted today.
Really?
But your boy Luc really saved my ass.
He kept your buddies
from trashing my place?
Yeah, that, and he joined
the poker game and then he....
Let's just say that I have
enough money for last month's rent.
Oh, and next month's, too.
But you should get some rest.
- I'm out. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
I really hope so.
Hey.
Hi.
So you were right.
Someone was supposed to die.
He just had to die differently
so someone else could live.
I should've been able to save them both.
You can change events,
but you can't change fate, Tru.
I can do things that
probably no one else can.
Sometimes even that
doesn't feel like enough.
Sometimes it isn't.
Valentine's Day.
Somehow, even the morgue
seems more romantic.
When do you guys leave
for the big weekend?
Harrison's picking me up in the morning.
He tell you where you're going yet?
Someplace up in the mountains.
Pinetop Cabins.
He says it's supposed to be beautiful.
So what about you and Luc?
He found this little bed- and- breakfast
up the coast...
and he's picking me up
right after my shift.
How sweet are our guys.
Valentine's Day comes up and
they put together fabulous weekends...
- for their respective hotties.
- Don't you love this time of year?
Valentine's Day is a sham...
perpetuated by the floral and
greeting card industries to move product.
You'll have to excuse Davis.
He's very single.
Shocker. So, I'll see you Monday.
Have a great weekend.
- You, too.
- I will.
So, are you working tomorrow?
Yep, filling in for one of the married guys.
I gotta tell you, Davis,
this weekend can't start soon enough.
I so need a break from my job.
This one or the secret one?
For a change, both.
Help me.
You're up.
Thank God.
I was about to check for a pulse.
When I picked you up at the morgue...
you said you were gonna close your eyes
for five minutes.
That was four hours ago.
Oh, no. This can't be good.
There's been some flash flooding
up ahead, sir.
Road's closed for the next 24 hours.
But we need to get through today.
This is the only road that goes through.
Sorry. If I were you,
I'd go back the way I came.
So we'll spend Valentine's Day at home.
No big deal.
<i>What are you Iooking for?</i>
According to this, we're just 50 miles from
the place Harrison and Lindsay went to.
Pinetop Cabins?
How did you know about that?
Harrison called me last week
and said something about a package deal.
My brother the romantic.
The point is
it's supposed to be really beautiful.
Harrison said it was beautiful?
I believe his exact words were,
"Rustic, yet romantic."
Come on, let's surprise him.
I've been craving chips
for the last 30 miles. You want anything?
I'm good.
Hello?
I just heard on the radio they closed 14.
I wanted to give you a heads up.
<i>Thanks, but we sort of found out</i>
<i>the hard way.</i>
How's everything in Morgue- ville?
It turns out I'm not spending
Valentine's Day alone after all.
No?
<i>I'm here with a Marissa Hatcher.</i>
Cops found her in McKinley Park
with her throat slit.
<i>Really?</i>
Yeah. The weird thing is...
the killer left a newspaper clipping
in the shape of a heart.
Some kind of a calling card or something.
God, there are a lot of freaks out there.
Poor girl.
Anyway, try to relax and have a good time.
Thanks, I will. I'll see you on Monday.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
It's okay.
You're not heading south by any chance,
because I could really use a lift.
I know what you're thinking:
Mysterious stranger asks pretty girl
for a ride.
It's like the first scene
in some bad horror flick, right?
Sort of.
I'm Kevin Rafferty, and my car broke down
just a few miles from here.
Good thing you're at a gas station.
Yeah. Well, the mechanic took off
for the holiday...
which kind of puts me in a bind because
I'm supposed to be meeting my girlfriend.
We've never spent
a Valentine's Day apart...
and I'd hate to start now.
I'd really like to help, but....
- No hitchhikers.
- Yeah.
Well, have a nice Valentine's Day.
You, too.
Has anyone seen my wallet?
It's red with a velcro snap.
- You must have just dropped it.
- Thanks.
Aren't you my little Good Samaritan.
Any idea how close we are to the motel?
I checked with the cashier.
15 miles, and we're supposed to look
for a painted sign.
Apparently, we can't miss it.
Is that what I think it is?
Leave it to Harrison.
All I tried to do
was take you away for a nice weekend.
- Here?
- I know it's a little creepy--
They've got their own cemetery.
No, that cemetery
is not part of the property. I asked.
I want to go home, Harrison.
Look, they're supposed to have
this amazing waterfall around here.
I was thinking
we could go for a hike tomorrow...
have a little picnic...
maybe watch some birds or something.
I don't know.
- You would go hiking?
- For you? Absolutely.
"Rustic, yet romantic."
We're all set with towels, thanks.
It's me, Harry.
<i>The owner toId me where to find you.</i>
Hey.
What the hell
are you doing here?
We couldn't make it to the coast.
The road was closed.
I tried both your cells,
but I couldn't get through.
The radio said some relay tower
got hit by lightning last night.
- There's no reception for miles.
- We were thinking of getting a room.
Great! The more the merrier.
<i>You two go check in.</i>
Once you're settled, we'll grab dinner
in the main cabin. My treat.
I thought you said meals were included.
lxnay, baby. We'll see you in 30.
Look, I know this isn't exactly
what I promised.
Luc, really, it's you and me.
Anywhere would be fine.
You sure?
Yeah.
We meet again.
Hey.
Tru?
- I asked her for a ride a few miles back.
- At the gas station. You were inside.
It's okay. Hank picked me up
a few miles down the road.
I'm really sorry.
Me, too.
If I'd known we were both going
to the Pinetop Cabins...
I could've caught you a discount
on your room.
My sister owns the place.
Hey, Kevin.
- Hey.
- Hi.
You made it.
- Welcome.
- This is Hank. He gave me a ride.
Hi, come on in.
The way I see it,
you just fix up some of these cabins...
clear out some of those graves,
and Pinetop Cabins Motel...
is Pinetop Cabins Resort and Spa.
Am I boring you, honey?
No, it's just that poor guy...
all alone on Valentine's Day.
Maybe he wants to be alone.
- Who cares?
- I care. I think it's sad.
Awww.
- Some meal.
- Yeah, it's good stuff.
What?
Nothing.
Just wish you wouldn't always worry
about everyone else.
So what are you saying?
What, you think I'm a busybody?
Only when it comes to everyone else.
Who's still got room for dessert?
You're right.
I should become more like you
and think only about myself.
- All the time.
- You calling me selfish?
I'm not the one who used up
all the hot water in the cabin.
So I like long showers. Sue me.
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.
In private.
- I'm breaking up with him, Tru. Tonight.
- It's Valentine's Day.
Yeah, right.
The most romantic day of the year,
and Harrison and I can't stop fighting.
Wait. You're not mad, are you?
No, of course not.
It's just you guys are my best friends.
And we still will be.
We just won't make out as much.
I guess
they finally fixed the relay towers.
At least something
went right tonight, right?
Happy Valentine's Day.
Luc, they're beautiful. Where did you--
Someone just left them there
on one of those graves in the cemetery.
I figured they probably
didn't need it anymore, so I....
I'm kidding. They were stashed in my bag.
Come here.
You're dumping me?
We fight all the time, Harrison,
about everything.
You know, I actually thought this weekend
would make things better for us.
Maybe it did.
Look, I'm just gonna go for a walk,
so if you want the bed....
No, I'll take the cot.
The bed smells funny.
Damn.
Hello?
Harrison, if that's you....
Hello?
God, you scared me!
- What are you doing?
- I was just getting ice. Are you okay?
Yeah, sorry.
I thought I heard a noise in the woods.
Sorry, this place is just sort of creepy.
What, the motel with its own graveyard?
Go figure. See you.
<i>HeIp me.</i>
<i>PIease.</i>
Is anybody out there?
Kevin.
I need you.
You're up.
What?
Thank God.
I was about to check for a pulse.
- Who are you calling?
- Harrison, to warn him.
About?
Lindsay's allergies.
He was gonna cook her dinner tonight,
but if he makes anything with peanuts....
A relay tower
got hit by lightning last night.
<i>There's no reception for miles.</i>
Oh, no. This can't be good.
There's been some flash flooding
up ahead, sir.
Road's closed for the next 24 hours.
We need to get through today.
Only this road goes through.
Sorry. If I were you,
I'd go back the way I came.
So, here's a crazy idea.
We're not too far from the place
Harrison and Lindsay went to.
Pinetop Cabins.
I was thinking
maybe we could go there, too.
That's so weird.
I was just thinking that same thing.
And if you see a gas station,
could you pull over?
- I've got this weird craving for chips.
- Chips.
Bag of chips coming right up.
<i>Hello?</i>
Davis, it's me.
I was just getting ready to call you.
<i>I know.</i>
I get it. Do- over day.
What have you got for me victim- wise?
His name's Kevin Rafferty.
He was killed at the motel we went to.
Slit throat.
When I found him, there was
a newspaper heart next to the body.
- Sound familiar?
- Two victims, same M. O. Sounds like--
A serial killer. I know.
<i>Serves me right for thinking</i>
<i>I was gonna get a vacation.</i>
These things do happen
at the worst possible times.
All the better to ruin my life.
Tell me everything you know
about the first murder.
And tell me fast. I'm gonna be meeting
victim number two any second now.
According to the police report...
a witness saw a man
leave the scene of the crime.
What else?
There's some residue on the paper heart.
<i>Specks of something.</i>
<i>I can't tell what.</i>
I'll do a chemical analysis
and get back to you.
Fine, but you won't be able to reach me
until 6:03 tonight.
<i>Why not?</i>
Phone issues.
Just find out everything you can by then.
What are you gonna do in the meantime?
Anything it takes to keep Kevin away
from that motel tonight.
I gotta go, Davis.
Let me guess. You need a lift.
Yeah, just up to the Pinetop Cabins Motel.
It's not very far.
That's fine by me...
but we should check and see
if it's cool with my boyfriend.
Great.
That's him right there,
if you want to ask him.
Has anyone seen my wallet?
It's red with a velcro snap.
He's got it. I just saw him snatch it
right off the counter.
That's not true.
- If you don't believe me, check in his bag.
- What?
All right, let's take a look.
I did not take that, I swear.
Right. Never heard of that one before.
I don't understand you.
Why are you doing this to me?
It's not what you think, it's....
I'm just trying to help.
Come on, let's get out of here now.
I'm gonna go talk to Harrison.
I'll be right back.
How do you know which cabin he's in?
Four. It's Harrison's lucky number.
He always stays in four.
Fine, we'll stay.
Yes.
We're all set with--
Open up, you guys. It's me.
Tru?
Hey, guys.
The road was closed.
We couldn't make it to the coast.
We decided to come here instead.
Luc's out front.
- Great.
- I need to talk to Harrison...
about something, in private.
- So you got the poor schnook arrested?
- To save his life, yeah.
Unbelievable. A serial killer, here.
That's right. So I want you and Lindsay
to pack your things.
We're all going home. I won't take no--
Relax, you had me at"serial killer."
I'm out of here.
Good.
But wait.
Shouldn't we call the cops?
Tell them we got a whack job loose?
I'd love to, but we don't have any proof.
And if we told them I was reliving a day,
they'd think we were insane.
Let's call the tabloids, tell them you had
a psychic premonition about the killer.
- How would that help?
- It wouldn't, but we could make a mint.
Think about it.
Pack your stuff.
We're out of this dump.
What?
You were right about everything.
I should've taken you someplace nicer.
- My bad.
- But you just talked me into staying.
Here? Are you kidding?
They've got their own cemetery.
Okay.
Bad news. Harrison says
the cabins have rats. We can't stay.
- But I just checked in.
- So check out. We'll go someplace else.
Trust me,
this is not the place we want to be, okay?
All right. I'll be right back.
We meet again.
- You surprised to see me?
- You have no idea.
Your little prank almost worked.
Till I realized that the Mini- Mart
had a security camera.
I told the sheriff to check the tape.
Guess what he saw.
I know it doesn't seem like it right now,
but it was for your own good.
Framing me for petty larceny
was for my own good?
I don't know what you're doing
at my sister's motel.
But I suggest that you leave
before I call the cops.
Kevin. Hey...
You made it.
- Hi.
- Hank. I gave your brother a ride.
Hey.
Hi.
There's been a change of plans.
I'm staying.
What?
The victim just showed up.
I can't leave him.
- So what do we do now?
- "We" aren't doing anything.
You're taking Lindsay back to the city,
like we agreed.
There's no way I'm leaving you here
with a psycho on the loose.
- So I'll send Lindsay back with Luc.
- Right.
And how are you gonna explain that one?
Besides, now that victim boy's here,
we're all perfectly safe.
We can't be sure about that.
We've already started
making changes to the day.
Changes that could affect
yesterday's outcome.
Meaning tonight's victim could be....
Me?
Honestly, there's no way to know.
All right. If I bite it, I bite it.
I'll ask you for help, the day will restart...
and we can do this crazy dance
all over again.
If I let you stay.
What are we gonna tell Luc and Lindsay?
The truth.
The first time I told you I relived days,
you thought I was insane.
In that case, we lie our asses off.
- So now you want to stay?
- It's not that I want to. I have to.
Harrison and Lindsay
are in the middle of a nasty....
...fight. As much as I'd like to take you
someplace nice....
...I just don't feel right
leaving them here alone.
Maybe they should be alone
so they can work it out for themselves.
I don't think that'll happen.
Harrison's being....
- ...totally unreasonable.
- That doesn't sound like Tru.
That's what I'm saying.
She's not being herself.
I think I should spend some time
alone with her...
so I can figure out what's what, because....
...they're gonna break up.
- All right, is there anything I can do?
- No.
So just sit here. Don't move.
As soon as I talk some sense
into my sister, I will be back.
I'll go check in. Again.
- How'd it go?
- Piece of cake. You?
So what's next?
One of us should keep an eye on Kevin
while the other looks for suspects.
We got any?
Davis said a man was seen
leaving the scene of the first murder...
in McKinley Park.
Great. So how many dudes
are staying here...
that aren't me, Luc, or the victim?
Two suspects.
One guy gave Kevin a ride today.
The other guy was at dinner last night.
Older guy with glasses.
Yeah, he checked in with me and Lindsay.
His name's Carl.
Okay.
Can you believe we're in a motel
with a cemetery next door...
and a frigging psycho on the loose?
Can it get any more <i>Friday the 13th?</i>
No, this is <i>Summer Camp.</i>
- Whatever.
- Harry, be careful.
I've got Tru Davies as my sister.
I don't need to be careful.
- I thought I told you to leave.
- You did, and I was going to.
Why are you still here?
I feel bad about what happened today,
and I wanted to apologize.
You tried to get me arrested.
Saying sorry is not gonna cut it.
It's hard to believe,
but I was trying to protect you.
From what?
Kevin.
Is there a problem?
No.
No.
No problem, Eileen.
Just a little misunderstanding.
Good. I was hoping
you'd get me some wood from out back.
I hope you can forgive my brother.
He always gets so worked up
this time of year.
It's Valentine's Day.
I'm sure he's got big plans tonight.
He told me he was meeting his girlfriend.
He hadn't mentioned it to me,
but big sister's always the last to know.
Keep an eye on him tonight, okay?
I always do.
Since our parents died, he's all I've got.
I don't know what I'd do without him.
What are you doing in my cabin?
Your cabin? I thought this was....
Wake up, Harrison!
So you walked in here by mistake?
Yeah, I got in here, and I was like:
"Where's my stuff and my girl?
Who cut up all these crazy newspapers?"
- That would be me.
- Really?
Putting together a little ransom note,
are we?
My wife's obituaries.
She passed away last week.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know it seems morbid...
but the papers said such lovely things
about her.
According to this,
the funeral was yesterday in Philly.
And you were there.
It was a beautiful ceremony.
So you couldn't have been
in McKinley Park last night.
Pardon?
Is that....
My wife's ashes.
She asked that they be scattered here.
I'm sorry about the mixup,
but I've gotta go.
Carl's not our guy. He was in Philly
when the murder occurred.
You're positive?
I've got his wife's ashes to prove it.
On my hand.
That leaves the guy with the pickup truck.
What cabin is he in? I'll check him out.
We should switch up. Kevin made it clear
he doesn't want me around.
I'll take Kevin. You take the other guy.
- If you see anything suspicious--
- I'll scream like a little girl.
I'll come find you. Whichever.
Come in.
Hey.
Come on in, have a seat.
I was just wondering if you'd heard
anything from Tru or Harrison.
Zilch. You?
Nothing.
Some Valentine's Day.
It could be worse.
We could be single.
In which case, I'd probably be moping
around my apartment right now...
watching dopey Meg Ryan movies
and eating ice cream.
Damn, I wish I was single.
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but what set off the big fight?
Sorry?
The fight.
Tru told me about it.
You and Harrison are fighting, right?
No, you and Tru
are the ones fighting, right?
No.
Right on time, Davis.
Tell me something good.
The lab guys just finished analyzing
the residue on the paper heart.
<i>And?</i>
They identified the substance
as tobacco flakes.
Tar and nicotine levels are consistent
with a certain brand of cigarettes:
<i>Bullseye Lights.</i>
So keep an eye out for smokers.
Got it. Thanks.
There's more.
I did a little research this afternoon
on our serial killer.
The cops are trying to keep this quiet.
It turns out there were five murders
over the last two years.
All with the same M. O.
<i>All five occurred</i>
<i>on or around VaIentine's Day.</i>
So he's killed even more people
than we thought? Wonderful.
Say the word, and I'll meet you there.
<i>There's no way you'd make it in time.</i>
Just sit tight.
I'll call you if I need anything.
You want to tell me
what you think you're doing?
- Luc, what are you--
- You're the one breaking into a pickup.
So you answer my question first.
I was turning the lights off.
He left them on,
and I just didn't want it to kill the battery.
I guess you and Harrison
worked everything out.
I guess you and Harrison
worked everything out.
Yeah, it wasn't easy,
but I think I finally got through to him.
I talked to Lindsay.
We know you guys lied to us.
- Luc, you don't understand.
- No, I think I do.
This is the part where you tell me
your life's really complicated, right?
That you take off without explanation,
and I just have to deal with it.
No, I just--
Here I am...
thinking you're the most amazing girl
I've gotten to know in a long time.
And the truth is
I don't really know you at all.
Luc.
Next time you break into a man's vehicle...
don't get into a shouting match
outside his cabin.
It tends to wake a body up.
I know what you're up to,
and I'm warning you.
- Stay away from Kevin Rafferty.
- What?
You heard me.
You're the second person I met today
that smokes that brand.
- These aren't yours?
- Of course not.
I've got severe asthma. I can't smoke.
Damn it.
If these aren't yours, then whose are they?
Kevin's. He probably dropped them
getting out of the truck.
Kevin's?
There you are.
I was just gonna come look for you.
Save it, okay?
I don't know what you and Tru are up to,
and I don't even want to know.
But whatever it is,
I'm sure it's mostly your fault.
Whoa, whoa. Calm down.
First thing in the morning,
you'll take me home.
But, baby--
No, Harrison, really. No buts.
And no more of your stories.
This time, we're through.
Uh, Kevin?
Damn it.
Terbutaline. That's only prescribed
for people with life- threatening asthma.
- So the cigarettes belong to Kevin?
- Right.
<i>Which makes him the seriaI killer.</i>
Right again.
Well, if Kevin is the serial killer,
then who killed Kevin?
I'm thinking maybe Kevin went looking
for another victim last night.
And that victim turned the tables on him.
Right. The only question now is who.
Come on. You've gotta be kidding me.
Locked out?
Yeah, you work here?
My sister owns the place.
She went for a walk,
but I was just about to go find her.
If you want to come with,
I'll get you another key.
You are a lifesaver.
Lead the way.
The guy with the pickup
isn't the serial killer. Kevin is.
- What?
- There are two killers.
Kevin killed the girl in McKinley Park,
and someone else killed him last night.
Davis and I think
it must be someone he attacked.
That doesn't make
what I have to tell you any easier.
- Kevin took off. I lost him.
- You what?
And Lindsay stopped by to chew me out.
I only took my eyes off him
for two seconds.
Great. That means he's still in danger.
So what if he's in danger?
The guy's a serial killer.
Let's knock off
and let nature take its course.
You don't get it.
Everything you and I did today...
that we didn't do yesterday,
it changed fate.
So?
So things might play out differently
this time.
Maybe the person Kevin attacks
doesn't fend him off tonight.
Maybe that person dies instead of him.
Evening.
- Carl, buddy, what's shaking?
- I was about to ask you the same question.
I just saw your lady friend
walking off with another fellow.
What? Who?
Eileen's brother. She introduced me once,
I forget his name.
Which direction did they go?
And then,
as if things weren't bad enough...
he leaves me sitting in the room alone
for three hours and....
Are you sure this is the way
your sister went?
I want you to meet someone.
My girlfriend, Amanda.
We never spent a Valentine's Day apart.
This is a joke, right?
She died three years ago. A car crash.
Have you ever lost someone close to you?
It changes you.
It separates you from other people.
They say they're sorry.
They bring flowers, they send cards.
But they don't really understand
what you're going through.
They don't know
what it meant to lose her.
That's why I do this.
So that other people will know
what it feels like.
I want them to understand, just like...
the people who love you
are going to understand.
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
Yeah, I think so.
You okay?
So I guess we finally figured out
who iced the guy.
Yeah, I guess. It's just....
What?
Are you okay?
Sorry, this place is just sort of creepy.
No, it couldn't have been Lindsay.
I saw her yesterday
just before I found the body.
<i>She was fine.</i>
So who the hell killed this guy?
You.
The killer has to be someone
who knew the truth.
He said that was his girlfriend.
What was that, sweetie?
He said that was his girlfriend.
He told me he was meeting his girlfriend.
He hadn't mentioned it to me.
Eileen. She was covering for him.
You always looked after me.
You always took care of me.
<i>PIease don't stop now, all right? Kill me.</i>
Kill me before I hurt someone else, please.
I can't. I'm your sister. I love you.
If that's true,
then you will put an end to all of this.
Once and for all, I'm begging you.
Kevin.
Please.
Don't do it, Eileen.
I would never.
He's my brother.
How long have you been protecting him?
I haven't.
He confessed everything to me
just before you came to the cabin.
I begged him to go to the police,
but he promised he wouldn't kill again.
I believed it,
until I saw him following your friend.
And then I knew he couldn't stop.
Do it, please!
Kill me, please, before I kill again.
No, I can't. I'm sorry.
But we'll get you help.
The best doctors.
I don't want their help.
I wanted yours, but if you can't--
No, Kevin, don't. Please!
You're all I have.
I gotta be honest.
I don't even know if you deserve to live.
But I know if you go through with it...
you're not just killing yourself.
You're killing her, too.
Thank you.
So let me see
if I've got this straight.
Tru overheard this psycho confessing
a murder to his sister this afternoon.
And instead of going to the police--
Which she couldn't do
because the phones were down.
Right. She went to you.
So why didn't you tell me and Luc?
We didn't want you getting all freaked out.
Well, maybe if I was
a little more freaked out...
I wouldn't have gone for a walk
with the guy.
I can't believe
I almost broke up with you tonight.
What you did for me...
I didn't think a man could be that brave.
Look, I know I screwed up.
No, lives were at stake.
You did something good.
But for reasons I may never understand,
you felt like you couldn't come to me.
- I was trying to protect you.
- I didn't need you to protect me.
I never did.
What I needed was for you to let me in.
To be a part of your life.
But now....God, after this....
Luc, please. It won't happen again.
It will.
Maybe not the same way, but it will.
'Cause we're going in circles here, Tru.
We're running into the same problem
over and over again.
I just don't think one more chance
is gonna change that.
I went through hell this weekend.
And for what?
To save the life of a serial killer.
Now he's in prison. Some people
would say that's worse than death.
All I wanted was two days, Davis.
Two lousy days away from this job
and this thing that I do.
But I couldn't get away.
It followed me, and it cost me Luc
because I couldn't tell him the truth.
You have a calling.
A calling is something
you're destined to do.
Something that gives your life meaning,
that makes you happy.
What I do feels more like a curse.
Look, you were chosen for a reason.
Whoever gave you this gift
knew what they were doing.
They saw the same things in you
that I see in you:
strength, compassion, conviction.
Curse or calling, love it or hate it,
you are the right person for the job.
There's no doubt in my mind.
Drop those lights down!
Check the sound again.
I'm still hearing feedback.
I don't care what you told them, Marty.
I'm not gonna sing.
My friend at <i>The Times</i> says
they'll send their best photographer.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Hi.
Hi.
Will you be moving sometime today,
or should I go change in my car?
Sorry.
You know this room
is only for contestants, right?
I am a contestant.
Right, of course you are.
My name's Jackie.
No offense, sweetie,
but I'm not looking to make friends today.
I'm looking to win.
- Hello?
- Tru Davies?
<i>May I ask who's caIIing?</i>
Sorry, how rude of me.
Michelle Carey, <i>Post Dispatch.</i>
The newspaper.
<i>Some peopIe think so.</i>
Anyway, I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.
Actually, I'm not interested
in a subscription.
<i>That's not why I'm caIIing.</i>
I've been looking through police reports
over the past several months. All sorts:
an attempted murder- for- hire scheme,
suspected mass poisoning, and so on.
And the only thing all these
very different crimes have in common is...
well, you.
I'm not sure I understand--
<i>In aII the cases I've Iooked at...</i>
<i>you were cited by the wouId- be victim</i>
<i>as the reason he or she was stiII aIive.</i>
Every time. It's really quite remarkable.
I'm sure it's some sort of coincidence.
Well, that's just it. I'm not.
For a city morgue worker, you spend
a lot of time in the police blotter.
You know, now really isn't a good time.
<i>ShouId I caII you Iater?</i>
Maybe I could just call you.
Fine. The paper will find me wherever I am.
- I look forward to your call.
- Great.
Help me.
I am not depressed. I'm just--
Single.
Linds, Luc and I
just weren't meant to be.
If you ask me, he'll be begging
to get back with you any day now.
Anyway, I'd better run.
That's right, you've got
that beauty pageant thing today.
I still can't believe
you talked your firm into running it.
I know. They're also letting me pick
one of the judges, so I had this brainstorm.
Since they're looking for a regular girl...
who better to choose one
than a common man.
Don't tell me. Harrison.
And your girlfriend
knows nothing about this?
Not a thing. She trusts me completely.
- You're not getting cold feet now, are you?
- Me? Please.
With yours truly on the judges panel,
I can practically guarantee...
that your daughter
will be the next Miss Fresh Face.
"Practically"?
There're three judges on the panel.
I'm only one of them.
Listen, Harry,
Angela made it this far on her own.
Your proposal,
as creative as it may be...
is null and void should Angela finish
any lower than, let's say...
first place?
Marlon, be reasonable, man.
I am.
You pay me four large right now,
and I'm reasonable.
You make sure Angela wins,
I'm also reasonable.
Anything else, I'm not so reasonable.
Hey.
You're here early.
I'm not staying.
I want to return this to County Records.
- Your mom's autopsy report?
- Yeah.
- Anything new?
- No.
Standard B and E gone bad.
Single bullet, massive blood loss.
I only read it 15 times, and still think
there's something I must have missed.
Tru, if I may,
sometimes there is just a single bullet.
A lone gunman, a tragic death.
Sometimes, the truth
is exactly what it appears to be.
- What makes you say that?
- Eight years of working here.
I just wish I thought so, too.
See you tonight.
Yeah.
Hello?
I knew it.
I knew this girl was gonna be trouble.
Two minutes before the pageant starts,
and this finalist drops out.
- Know what this means?
- You're one girl short?
Yeah, exactly.
Now I need to find a replacement.
Someone fabulous to fill in.
Someone fabulous, just like--
- Not a chance.
- Tru, come on.
Listen, someone who holds your hair
when you throw up, I'm your girl.
Need a ride to the airport? Look no further.
But beauty pageants
is where I draw the line.
- It'll be fun.
- I'm so sorry, but it's just not happening.
<i>Thanks anyway, Tru.</i>
Bye.
Hello, and welcome to
the First Annual Miss Fresh Face Pageant.
<i>Now Iet's join our judges</i>
<i>in weIcoming our first contestant.:</i>
<i>Miss AngeIa Todd.</i>
<i>AngeIa's a recent graduate of OakviIIe....</i>
By the way, I was checking out
the contestants backstage.
Angela girl, very impressive.
Smart as a whip,
and quite the pleasing disposition.
<i>I Iike rock.</i>
But that's just me.
<i>Okay, AngeIa. If you couId have</i>
<i>dinner with any figure from history...</i>
<i>who wouId you have dinner with?</i>
<i>That's a good question, Chuck.</i>
<i>I'd have to say KeIIy CIarkson.</i>
<i>AngeIa, Iet me cIarify.</i>
<i>Any figure from history--</i>
<i>KeIIy CIarkson.</i>
Wow!
<i>AngeIa, thank you.</i>
Wasn't she great?
Wow.
There is a girl with conviction!
An all too rare quality
in our young people today.
Excuse me.
- Miss Walker?
- Yes, Mr. Barnes?
- We have a problem.
- We do?
- I am fired?
- I'm sorry, okay?
Julian Barnes said
you were playing favorites...
- trying to influence the other judges.
- That's crazy.
I know, but he's the boss.
But what about you and me,
and the sharing of your work...
and all that stuff?
Doesn't that count for anything?
Of course it does.
That's why I saved you a seat
right in the front row.
Perfect.
Tru?
Luc.
I'm glad I ran into you, because
I wanted to talk to you about something.
In person.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's just....
Look, this isn't easy to say,
but I'm gonna try.
If you ask me, he'll be begging
to get back with you any day now.
Take your time.
These things are important.
Yeah, that's why I wanted to talk to you
face to face.
Now that we're not together anymore...
it's inevitable
we're gonna start dating other people.
And since we work together,
I know that could be awkward.
That's why I wanted you to know
that I'm going on a date tonight.
Oh.
I hope I did the right thing. I just didn't
want you finding out some other way.
No, of course. I appreciate that.
Anyway, I should get to work.
It's funny. We've known each other
for three months...
and this is the first time
I've left a conversation before you did.
Hello?
<i>It's me.</i>
And I need you now.
Can it wait?
<i>Yeah...</i>
- if you want to see me in a full body cast.
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
Sorry, but I've got to run.
Why aren't I surprised?
<i>She graduated with honors</i>
<i>from the IocaI community coIIege...</i>
<i>and Jackie majored in education.</i>
Let me get this straight.
You convinced your girlfriend...
to make you a judge
in order to rig the voting...
so the daughter of your loan shark
would finish first?
You know,
that's a very poorly constructed sentence.
I hardly know what you're talking about.
Fine, yes. That's why
I need to borrow $4, 000 from you.
I don't have $4, 000.
I figured. So, I don't know, $40
and tomorrow's winning lottery numbers?
<i>Now teII us, Jackie, why shouId you</i>
<i>be the next Miss Fresh Face?</i>
<i>I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Okay. Moving right aIong.</i>
That poor girl.
These pageants can be rough.
Yeah, and I thought I had problems.
Let me ask you, if you don't pay this guy,
what would he do to you?
I'll put it this way.
I may be asking for your help tonight
from beyond.
Harrison.
I'm joking.
You start saving dead people, and
suddenly you lose your sense of humor.
Don't worry. I'll think of something.
- I'm having a really nice time.
- Me, too.
This might sound like a strange question...
but you have no reason to run off
in the middle of the meal, do you?
No. Not unless you ask me to.
How about we make a deal?
I won't ask you, if you don't volunteer.
Sounds perfect.
<i>Okay, Iadies and gentIemen.</i>
<i>And the votes are in</i>
<i>from our remaining judges.</i>
<i>Now, the first runner- up...</i>
<i>who wiII step in shouId our winner</i>
<i>be unabIe to perform her duties is...</i>
Don't say"Angela Todd." Do not say--
<i>...Miss AngeIa Todd!</i>
Oh, crap.
<i>And the officiaI new face</i>
<i>of JuIian Barnes Cosmetics...</i>
<i>winner of the cash prize,</i>
<i>the modeIing contract...</i>
<i>and the Iifetime suppIy of cosmetics is...</i>
<i>Miss AIex ReynoIds!</i>
<i>We're aII as excited</i>
<i>to have Miss ReynoIds aboard as you are.</i>
<i>But what do you say we give her a chance</i>
<i>to freshen up before taking more photos?</i>
Seriously. My makeup must be a mess.
Thank you.
<i>Thank you, Iadies and gentIemen.</i>
- All right, we're out of here.
- What's up?
Let's just say some people
have some major anger issues.
We can't get out this way.
- Why not?
- Because we need a pass.
Excuse me, Frank.
I was a judge, remember?
Come on.
Man, I was so close. All I had to do
was convince the other two...
and I would've been....
Hey, track star, pick up the pace here.
You should stop borrowing money
and getting into these situations.
Okay, Dad.
- Did I imagine that or....
- I think it came from over there.
I don't know if right now is a good time
to be taking the scenic route.
What happened?
It's Jackie.
She was like this when I came in.
Go call the police now.
So she's....
Dead.
They just always seem to find you,
don't they?
Unfortunately, yes.
So, is....
- So, is now when it happens?
- What?
When she asks for help. The dead chick.
I don't know when it happens.
It just happens.
Do me a favor. Go stand outside the door.
We need to keep the crime scene intact.
Sorry, but I have got to see this.
There's no guarantee it's gonna happen.
Even if it does,
you won't remember it tomorrow...
because it wouldn't have happened yet.
Yeah....
I think I'm just gonna wait outside.
Help me.
<i>Hey, it's Tru.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>
<i>Hi, this is MicheIIe Carey</i>
<i>at the</i> Post Dispatch.
Tell you what.
Since I seem to have missed you at home,
why don't I just give you a call at work?
Just once.
Just once I'd like to go somewhere
and have everyone stay alive.
Is that too much to ask?
- You really want me to answer that?
- No, actually I don't.
- What do you know about the victim?
- Not much.
Just that she broke down and ran off
during her Q and A section.
Well, those questions can be tough.
So I'm told.
Anything on the body?
There was some nasty discoloration
under her eyes.
- Puffy?
- More like burned.
Doesn't ring any bells, but I'll look into it.
Let me know. First things first,
I've got to convince Jackie to drop out.
Not like she's gonna win anything tonight.
What, and shatter her dreams
of becoming Miss Fresh Face?
No, I'm gonna save her life.
Hey.
If a reporter named Michelle Carey calls
looking for me...
just don't answer any questions.
Questions? What kind of questions?
The kind we don't want to answer.
That kind. Right.
I'm going on a date tonight.
Hey, Tru, I was hoping I'd run into you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, the reason is--
Actually, there's something that
I've been wanting to talk to you about.
Okay.
It's just now that
we're not together anymore...
it's inevitable
we'll start dating other people.
And us working together,
things might get awkward.
I just wanted to let you know
that it's fine with me.
Really?
I just hope you find someone
that makes you happy.
I just hope you find someone
that makes you happy.
But I thought that, I mean....
- I got to run.
- Go. Yeah, right.
Tru.
I was just gonna call you. This is so perfect.
Really? What's going on?
One of the girls just dropped out,
two minutes before the pageant.
- And I need someone fabulous to fill--
- I'm in.
- Really?
- Yeah, whatever you need.
Wow, I'm shocked. I totally thought
it was gonna be a long shot.
So should I get backstage?
- Yeah, I'll get you a pass. Just wait here.
- Okay.
Hey, Harr.
What are you doing here?
You know, stuff.
Don't tell me.
So, who kicked it? Me?
What, was I the one?
No, not you. One of the girls.
- Don't tell me it was Angela Todd.
- Her name's Jackie.
Man, can you believe it?
Murder at Lindsay's fashion show...
- where I'm a judge and you're--
- A contestant.
Oh, my God.
You?
I'm sorry, I didn't....
- It's the only way to get close to her.
- Yeah.
While you're having a good laugh...
let me just mention
that your little scheme isn't gonna work.
What's that?
Fixing a beauty pageant for
your loan shark? What were you thinking?
It's hard enough saving these people...
without always having
to bail your ass out of trouble.
But that's our thing, right?
Just try not to be so obvious.
You got yourself kicked off
the judging panel yesterday.
Good to know.
Okay, come on, let's get you backstage.
So this is the replacement?
- Yeah, Tru.
I need you to get into your dress
for the first round. Eveningwear.
This was so last- minute.
I don't have a dress.
You can borrow one of mine.
Help me.
- Thanks.
- Don't worry about it.
Couldn't decide, so I brought four.
It sounds like a plan.
Okay, let's kick it into high gear, girls.
Hi, I'm Tru.
Jackie.
I heard a rumor there was a late entry.
So you must be the new girl?
Nice to meet you.
So what, you just decided over breakfast
that you wanted to be Miss Fresh Face?
Actually, yeah.
Unbelievable.
They'll let anybody into these things.
- Is she always so warm?
- Afraid so.
But it's not just Alex. It's all of them.
I guess catty competition's
just not my thing.
I thought it could be fun,
but these girls will do anything to win.
<i>Before we start,</i>
<i>I'd Iike to introduce you to our judges.</i>
<i>PIease weIcome</i>
<i>the CEO of JuIian Barnes Cosmetics...</i>
<i>Mr. JuIian Barnes!</i>
<i>Our next judge is a former spokesmodeI</i>
<i>who, if you ask me...</i>
<i>looks like she shouId be back here</i>
<i>with the rest of our finaIists.</i>
<i>I know JuIian thinks so,</i>
<i>and that's why he married her!</i>
<i>Ladies and gentIemen,</i>
<i>pIease weIcome Adrian Barnes!</i>
<i>And our man on the street,</i>
<i>Mr. Harrison Davies.</i>
There's something I got to tell you,
and it's gonna sound weird, but--
Come on, you look so serious
all of a sudden. Let's talk inside.
Tyler? What are you doing here?
- Jackie, I uh, look, I missed you and...
- I told you not to come.
Just listen to me, okay?
Go away!
- The least you can do is give me a chance.
- Tyler, there is nothing left to say.
I live here now. This is my home.
You have to go.
No, I'm not leaving. I came
halfway across the country to see you.
Is there a problem in here?
Please. Just leave.
- But--
- You heard the lady.
- Probably a good idea.
- Don't bother.
This way, sir.
I'll find my way out.
My ex. Not exactly a clean break.
I moved here to start over.
I never thought he'd come looking for me.
Trust me, men are never predictable.
- Here, try this one. It'll look great on you.
- Thanks.
<i>Last question:</i>
<i>If you couId have dinner....</i>
- What did he do?
- Nothing. In fact, he's been quite pleasant.
The problem is it's come to my attention
that Mr. Davies' sister...
has been slotted in as an alternate.
Conflict of interest.
- So, I should....
- Can him.
Am I in the right place?
I was told to speak with Tru Davies.
Actually, she's not here.
But I'd like to help you.
I could help you. Or not.
I need to pick up a death certificate
for a relative of mine.
- Actually, you'd have to go through--
- County Records, right?
I was there all morning.
When they finally got around to helping...
they said they'd lost the original
and to come here for a new one.
Unfortunately, any request
for a new certificate has to go through--
Please don't tell me
I have to go back to County Records?
I'm already four hours
late for work.
Well, I guess we could bend the rules
just this once.
- I'm sorry about your loss, Miss....
- Park. Susan Park.
<i>Now, Jackie's wearing a stunning design...</i>
<i>from the JuIian Barnes coIIection</i>
<i>of fine formaIwear.</i>
I hope she's kidding with that ass.
Ouch!
Big much?
What's between you two, anyway?
The only thing between me and Jackie
is the crown.
No one else stands a chance against me.
No offense.
It's just a contest. If you don't win,
it's not the end of the world.
You so don't get it.
<i>Winning something Iike this</i>
<i>puts a girI on the map.</i>
To where?
Mini- malls of the Eastern Seaboard?
Got to start somewhere.
And a word of advice.
If I got into the finals because
my best friend was running the show...
maybe I wouldn't talk so much.
Hey.
- You looked really great out there.
- Thanks.
I've been thinking about what you said
about these girls, this whole thing.
And the truth is, I feel the same way.
So here's an idea. Let's drop out.
- Excuse me?
- I'm serious. Let's get out of here.
We could be halfway through a pizza
before they even know we're gone.
It's tempting, I have to admit.
But I signed up for this thing,
and I should see it through.
It can't get any worse, right?
Anyway, you being here is proof
that not all the competition is so bad.
There's something that
I didn't get a chance to tell you before--
I know. I walk too fast.
And if I'm not careful,
I'm gonna take a nasty spill in these heels.
No, that's not it. It's something else.
About tonight.
<i>Tru Davies.</i>
I don't know how to tell you this, but--
<i>Tru Davies?</i>
Talk later. Walk now. Go.
Good luck.
<i>Ladies and gentIemen, Tru's</i>
<i>a Iate entry into our IittIe pageant here.</i>
<i>But I'm sure she's as deserving</i>
<i>a candidate as we've seen here tonight.</i>
This is why I wanted you
to come home with me.
I always thought I'd propose to you
once we got there...
but after we argued this morning,
I figured it was now or never.
So, what do you say, Jacks?
I want to.
And I love you, Ty, more than anything.
But I need some time to think about it.
Whatever you need.
I'm not going anywhere.
Here we are: Terrance Park,
68 years old, massive coronary.
Korean male.
Uncle by marriage.
It says here the original certificate
was signed by a Jessica Park.
My cousin.
She was gonna come with me today...
but it was so hard for her to come here
the first time.
- It's never easy coming to the morgue.
- And yet you do it every day.
You must be a very strong person...
working here all alone,
surrounded by death.
Well, actually I oversee a small staff.
Tru, right? My cousin said
she dealt with somebody by that name.
Yeah.
Actually, I should go
get you the new certificate.
I'm not in any hurry.
Besides...
I like talking to you.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
This might sound like a strange question...
but you're not gonna run off somewhere
in the middle of dinner, are you?
- Not unless you want me to.
- No, I don't. No, not at all.
'Cause that's one thing I can't stand...
when a girl just ups and leaves
right in the middle of a meal, because my--
Ex used to do that.
- Did I mention that already?
- Three times.
Look, Tabitha,
you seem like a really great girl.
The truth is I thought I was ready
to start dating again...
but maybe I'm just not.
Great. Maybe you could've thought of that
before you asked me out.
You know what? Here, watch me run out
in the middle of the meal.
This was a waste of a night.
What did he do?
<i>KeIIy CIarkson.</i>
<i>Okay, AngeIa, thank you.</i>
<i>And now for our next contestant,</i>
<i>Tru Davies!</i>
<i>So, Tru, your bio says...</i>
<i>that you work the night shift in a morgue?</i>
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>
<i>So teII us, how do you spend your time...</i>
<i>when you're not out tagging toes?</i>
<i>I heIp peopIe.</i>
<i>So, voIunteer work?</i>
<i>You couId say that.</i>
Alex, this is the last time
I'm gonna ask you, do you understand?
<i>Did you bring it or not?</i>
It's here somewhere.
I can't give it to you. At least, not yet.
I haven't got time for this.
I shouldn't be out here...
in the middle of a Q and A.
Careful, Jules.
The judges take off for bruising.
You know you could go out there
with two black eyes and still win.
I knew that tape would persuade you.
Don't worry,
you've got all the votes you need.
That's all I wanted to hear.
You're up next.
<i>Tru, in 50 words or Iess...</i>
<i>teII us why you shouId be</i>
<i>the next Miss Fresh Face.</i>
<i>I wish I couId, Chuck, but I'm kind of</i>
<i>on a tight scheduIe. Thanks.</i>
- What was that all about?
- It's just the crowd. I got nervous.
Too bad, because
I think the judges like your look.
<i>It's the one and onIy</i>
<i>Miss Jackie Connors. Let's give her....</i>
Speaking of judges, where's Harrison?
Speaking of judges, where's Harrison?
- Yeah, I sort of had to fire him.
- You what?
Once you entered,
there was a conflict of interest.
It wouldn't have been fair
to keep him on the panel.
<i>Now teII us, Jackie, why shouId you</i>
<i>be the next Miss Fresh Face?</i>
<i>I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm sorry.</i>
Okay.
Guess I don't have to worry
about her anymore.
<i>Our next contestant is....</i>
I thought you said
she was your main competition.
Not after that performance.
Right now, she'd be lucky to beat you.
All this paperwork....
I bet you don't get out on many dates.
Actually, women kind of think I'm strange.
- Everything okay?
- Yes.
- Can you excuse me a second?
- Yeah.
Hello?
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>
I just heard back from the tox lab,
and the discoloration around the eyes...
is consistent with the topical application
of an organophosphate.
<i>Most IikeIy</i>
<i>a pesticide of some sort.</i>
You're saying she died
because someone rubbed it on her skin?
<i>Organophosphate is</i>
<i>a powerfuI nerve agent...</i>
and once it gets into the nervous system,
it shuts the lungs down.
- It's instant asphyxiation.
- Lovely.
What about you? Any suspects?
<i>I had two, and now it's none.</i>
What happened?
I thought it was the angry boyfriend,
but he was only looking to propose.
Then it was another contestant,
but Jackie just bombed the Q and A...
<i>so she's not a threat to anyone.</i>
There's got to be someone.
<i>That's the thing. There isn't.</i>
Jackie's one of the sweetest girls
I've ever met. No one wants to hurt her.
And she's gonna be murdered
in the next 30 minutes.
I got to go. I'll be in touch.
Exactly who's going to be murdered
in the next 30 minutes?
Hey, I saw what happened out there.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
- I'm leaving.
- What?
This whole night is fake.
The girls look fake...
the winner is fake,
and absolutely none of it matters.
I wanna help you, but I need you to tell me
exactly what's going on.
It's Alex.
She's got something on one of the judges.
- Some sort of tape or--
- She's blackmailing him?
To make sure
she's declared the winner.
Which means
nothing we did here today counted...
because the whole stupid thing was fixed.
Oh, God, look at me.
I'm all Tammy Faye.
I can't let Ty see me like this,
or he might take back his proposal.
And the discoloration around the eyes...
<i>is consistent with the topicaI appIication</i>
<i>of an organophosphate.</i>
Most likely a pesticide.
Jackie, stop! Don't use that.
- Why not?
- Because it'll kill you.
Why would Alex's makeup remover kill me?
- Wait, this isn't yours?
- Mine's already packed.
I was just gonna borrow some of hers.
But if this is Alex's....
Oh, my God.
Then she was supposed to die yesterday,
not you.
No offense, Tru,
but you're sort of freaking me out.
Sorry, it's just that
I think someone's trying to kill Alex.
Why would anyone want to kill her?
Aside from the fact
she's a total B- I- you- know- what.
You said she had some sort of tape
that she was using...
to blackmail one of the judges?
To win a third- rate beauty contest
is not exactly grounds for murder.
I don't think it's about the pageant.
I think it's about the tape.
Look, maybe all the pressure
is getting to you.
I don't know, but I think I'm gonna....
You know, I got to say,
I'm glad we met today.
<i>It was an absoIuteIy miserabIe time,</i>
<i>and I don't ever want to do it again.</i>
But having you around....
It made a world of difference.
I asked you a question.
Let's get you your certificate
and you can be on your way.
I don't want the certificate.
And my name isn't Susan Park.
You Michelle Carey?
I have nothing further to say to you.
- What do you not want me to know?
- Please leave.
Is it something do with her
mysterious appearance at crime scenes?
Her uncanny knack
for saving the lives of strangers?
Listen, you are so far off. This is ridiculous.
Then enlighten me.
Tell me what's really going on here.
Nothing is going on here.
- You're saying that I imagined all of this?
- Absolutely.
Then let me tell you something else
that I might have imagined.
I did a little research, and it turns out
Tru isn't the first young woman...
to mysteriously pop up in the nick of time
and save the lives of total strangers.
There was another before her.
I asked you to leave.
Tell Tru I'm sorry I missed her,
but I'll be sure to catch her another time.
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>about this, Mr. Barnes.</i>
<i>I'II make you a deaI.:</i>
<i>You caII me JuIian...</i>
<i>and I'II caII you Miss Fresh Face.</i>
<i>But I'm not Miss Fresh Face.</i>
<i>Not yet, but you wiII be.</i>
<i>- Promise?</i>
<i>- AbsoIuteIy.</i>
<i>Now why don't we drop the chit- chat?</i>
<i>And the officiaI new face</i>
<i>of JuIian Barnes Cosmetics is...</i>
<i>Miss AIex ReynoIds!</i>
Oh, crap.
Big surprise?
I'm sorry there can only be
one Miss Fresh Face.
But we'd like you to try again next year.
Maybe next year I could bring a tape.
I don't understand.
Tell you what, I could arrange a screening.
Maybe that would help jog your memory.
- So, what do you want? Money?
- I want you to turn yourself in.
- For what?
- For trying to kill Alex tonight.
What the hell are you talking about?
Why would I hurt her? She won. It's over.
You're right.
Your motive went away as soon
as she won the contest, but who....
<i>What do you say we give her a chance to</i>
<i>freshen up before taking any more photos?</i>
Your wife.
Seriously.
My makeup must be a mess.
I would stay here if I were you.
Unless Miss Fresh Face is okay
with having a corpse for a spokesmodel.
What?
Adrian didn't like that
you slept with her husband...
<i>so she added a speciaI ingredient</i>
<i>to your makeup remover.</i>
<i>Something that cIeanses</i>
<i>and kiIIs pesky bIackmaiIers.</i>
You poisoned my makeup?
What better way to kill a beauty queen?
You can't prove any of it.
Not my department.
But as soon as I turn over the evidence...
they're gonna have
plenty of questions for you.
Adrian, I had this handled.
What did you do?
She made a fool out of you, Julian,
and she made a fool out of me.
After tonight,
her face would have been everywhere...
and I couldn't stand the thought of it.
Two days!
I'll get you everything, plus interest!
Sorry, buddy, too late now.
Daddy, I was looking all over!
Sorry, baby.
I just had a little business to attend to.
<i>It's too bad about that contest--</i>
- I won!
- What?
I won!
That other girl was blackmailing a judge,
so they disqualified her.
- Do you mean....
- I'm Miss Fresh Face!
Yes!
The scholarship, the modeling
contracts, the free cosmetics! All mine!
I got to go call Mom!
Yes.
That's just great.
I don't know what you did,
but I'm impressed.
Any time, baby.
Any time.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- How'd your date go?
- Honestly, not so good.
The truth is
the whole time I was with Tabitha...
I couldn't stop thinking
of another girl I knew.
Hey, remind me again why we broke up.
Because I was unpredictable...
and because I ran off
in the middle of sentences.
Because I kept secrets.
- And that bothered me?
- It did.
Maybe I overreacted.
Maybe I could learn to live
with those things.
No, you didn't. And you couldn't.
Because as much as I'd like to,
I'll never be able to change.
That's who I am.
That's who I'll always be.
And because of that,
I'll have to give up things.
Sometimes really great things.
I'm sorry, Luc.
- Don't be.
- No, I'm sorry for me.
- Hey, Davis.
- Hello.
You okay?
I will be, I guess. What about you?
Did that reporter ever call?
No. She came in.
Don't worry, I didn't say a thing.
Good. It's just been a long day, you know?
I don't know if I could handle reading
about myself in the morning paper.
She does know something, though.
Something that I've known for a long time.
Not that she'll be able to prove it.
Maybe I should've told you sooner...
but I didn't want to confuse you even more.
- Davis.
Before you, there was someone else.
A woman. She relived days.
She could prevent death.
Once you asked me why I believe you...
how I readily accept what you can do.
And that's why.
Because I met her.
And as many times as you read her file,
it's never gonna be in there.
It was your mother.
What you can do...
she could do it, too.
Hurry.
Tru, come on.
What's wrong, Mommy?
Come on, sweetie.
Is everything okay?
Shh!
Stay quiet now, Tru.
Are you alone?
Yes.
Where's your daughter?
She's not here.
Good.
I see Mom's face.
And then I hear it.
A man's voice and....
It's'cause Daddy's coming to town.
- The dream has nothing to do with Dad.
- Right.
Besides, Meredith says
he's only in town for a conference...
so the odds are
we won't even hear from him.
But there's something else.
And that is?
What I do...
going back, trying to save
these people from dying...
I think Mom could do it, too.
Where did you get this?
Davis.
He was an assistant
the night they brought Mom in.
How does this freak- fest from a morgue...
become such an expert on our mother?
He talked to people, did research.
Besides, the question isn't how he knows,
but if he's right.
And if he is...
what am I going to find out next?
Help me.
There's this new technology
everybody's talking about.
It's called a bed.
Sorry.
I haven't been sleeping very well lately.
Your shift's over. Why don't you go home
and get some real rest?
How"over"?
I'm meeting Harrison and Meredith
at the diner in three minutes.
Rumor has it our father's in town.
This is Meredith's way of dealing.
Your father?
Yeah.
Just because none of us
has seen him in five years...
doesn't mean he still can't make us crazy.
So, you want to talk
about our father, right?
Actually, I was going to see
who wants to split the French toast.
Here you go.
Expecting someone?
Right. About that.
Well, you asked if I had anything
to say about Dad...
and so I brought someone...
who I thought could say it better.
His wife.
Jordan.
Well, it ain't breakfast, it's an ambush.
Don't blame Mere. This was my idea.
Anyway, I'm sure you all remember
this weekend is your father's birthday.
<i>And since he's in town for a conference...</i>
I convinced him
to let me throw him a party.
- Yeah.
- Here in his hometown.
And I thought
what could be more special for Richard...
than to spend his birthday with his kids?
- From which marriage?
- Harry, she's trying. Why can't you?
It's just a small get- together.
I work nights.
Well, they let you out to eat, don't they?
Just come tonight.
lsn't showing up the least you can do?
Funny, I thought the same thing
about my dad my last 10 birthdays.
Tru, I'm sorry, that's not--
For what?
For breaking up my parents' marriage,
or pretending it never happened?
You know, I just remembered
I got to be somewhere.
Tru.
You wouldn't believe it, but we get some
pretty questionable job applicants.
But you, on the other hand...
good school, six years of EMT experience.
This is pretty good.
- Some would say that you're overqualified.
- Some might say I'm late paying my rent.
Yeah.
Look, the reason I'm here is because
they say this is a decent place to work...
reasonable on- call hours, steady turnover.
Well, you have done your homework.
I do have some other candidates
coming in...
- but I'll show you around the place.
- Great.
So, this is the sign- in room.
The hub of most of the activity.
Not today, obviously, but....
Right.
Do you guys use LFD
as your primary filing system?
Yeah.
Slow week.
Probably a good thing in our business.
You mind if I take something to drink
before I hit the road?
- No, not at all. It's right there.
- Thanks.
Perfect timing.
<i>Odd and compIeteIy off scheduIe,</i>
<i>but perfect.</i>
I forgot these
when I took off this morning.
This is Mr. Harper.
He will be interviewing to replace Gardez.
Hey. Jack.
Hey. Tru.
You had to write it down?
Just so the functional illiterate
wouldn't drink my soda.
Right.
Can't be too careful...
what with the big soda shortage
I've been reading so much about.
And here I was thinking you didn't read.
Okay, you know what? I'll probably
make my decision by this afternoon.
Great.
Well, you know where to find me.
Excuse me.
Thanks.
That guy's going places.
Yeah.
Let's just hope
somewhere far, far away from here.
Are you all right?
Fine. I just don't get why
you'd want to hire someone like that.
I know you have a lot on your mind,
but are you sure...
that it's Jack that's bothering you?
Hey, Claire.
It's Tru.
- I know who you are.
- It's been a while, I wasn't sure.
Anyway, I'm looking for Jordan,
your mom.
She's not here.
Do you want to talk to my daddy?
- No, that's okay.
- Dad.
Yeah?
Tru.
Hi, Dad.
It's good to....
I was sure you'd be at your conference.
I was actually just looking for Jordan.
Claire, do me a favor.
Go keep an eye on your brother, will you?
Come in. Or are you in a hurry?
Jordan's actually running errands.
But she'll be at the party tonight.
Can it wait until then?
I don't know if I'll be able to make it.
You know, work.
Right.
Jordan told me
about your breakfast this morning.
And it will mean a lot to her
that you came here to apologize.
Apologize? No.
I might have been a little out of line.
I was upset.
With Jordan or with me?
I should go.
Come tonight, okay?
If I can.
Look at you.
You are so much like your mother.
It was your mother.
What you can do, she could do, too.
Jordan, it's me again.
I don't know if you're still out...
or if you even have your cell phone
with you. Should I worry?
Call me.
<i>Thanks.</i>
- Thought I'd make an appearance.
- I'm glad you did.
I can only stay for a minute.
Where's Jordan?
I'd still like to have that conversation.
Running late, as usual. She was supposed
to meet me here after her errands.
Typical Jordan.
I'm sure she's just out
getting you a last- minute gift.
Yeah.
Come on.
Look who's here.
Come on.
Harrison.
Hi.
I want to introduce you
to my lovely girl, Lindsay.
- Hi, Mr. Davies.
- You're Tru's friend from school, right?
Yep.
I don't think Harrison has ever formally
introduced me to anybody he's seeing.
It wasn't really necessary before.
- Lindsay, let's go get drinks.
- Yeah. It was good to see you again.
Seems like a nice girl, Lindsay.
- And here it comes.
- Don't get defensive.
I look at you,
and you've got so many options.
Why limit yourself?
Usually you save the advice
for the occasional Christmas card.
Don't waste
all your good material tonight.
What I'm trying to say, if you'll
let me finish, is that you're doing fine.
Just don't let this thing
with Lindsay confine you.
You're young. Keep your eyes open...
for what might otherwise pass you by.
Well, just so you know...
it's kind of a now thing. It's no big deal.
Good to know where we stand.
Hello.
Hi.
How was the party?
A bust.
The only reason I went was to apologize
to Jordan, who never showed up.
Listen, about your mother.
- I just wanted to say that--
- It's okay.
I think I've had enough
big conversations for one day.
So how about the new guy?
When does he start, Mr. Mooch?
He doesn't.
I checked his references and....
He didn't check out?
No. It turns out that Mr. Harper
has a nasty habit...
of not showing up for work. Permanently.
Until I called, his last three
employers had no idea where he was.
You're kidding.
So it looks like it's just you and me.
Who brought this one in?
Copland from County.
He's helping me
until I find a replacement.
Must've dropped it off
when I was on break.
It looks like a mugging.
It's multiple stab wounds.
Oh, God.
Jordan.
Dad, I'm....
I know.
You probably don't remember this,
but when your mother....
This is where we....
We could have her moved somewhere else
if it would make it easier.
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have let her go.
There's nothing you could've done.
Mugged.
God, if I could just have it
to do over again.
You should talk to them.
I will.
You know, there are pieces I remember
from the night Mom died.
<i>Things I wish I didn't.</i>
<i>And they don't have to be here.</i>
We're ready for you.
I'll keep an eye on the little ones.
It's all right. I'll do this.
<i>You can wait out here.</i>
Let Daddy handle it.
All right.
Now what?
I'll take it from here.
- You sure you can....
- It's my job.
Yours is to be with your children.
They're going to need their father.
What are you doing? Go home.
I'll cover this. I'm serious.
No one's giving out extra credit
for the bravest girl in the room.
Go on. Go home.
You cannot save everyone. Go.
Victim suffered multiple stab wounds
to the upper torso.
<i>Tru.</i>
What?
I didn't say anything to you.
<i>Sex: FemaIe.</i>
<i>Tru.</i>
Stop him.
My God, Davis, I'm so sorry.
The coffee's just really hot.
This is the third time this week
you've crashed out during your shift.
Why don't you--
Can't.
I've told you about my father's wife,
Jordan, right?
She's in town and sometime today,
she's going to be murdered.
- One of those days again.
- And about the Jack guy...
check his references before the interview
so you don't get your hopes up.
Okay. Where are you going now?
Believe it or not, I'm going to
spend the day with my stepmother.
Tru?
Jordan, hi. This is unexpected.
She wanted to see us
to talk about some things and--
That's funny,
because I was just telling someone...
how I thought it was time
you and I got to know each other better.
You were?
I would like that, Tru.
Which makes what I came to ask you
much easier.
Your father's birthday is this weekend
and I'm throwing a party for him.
I'll be there.
You said she'd probably walk out on me.
I'm thrilled, Tru. Thank you.
Excuse me, I'm going to wash up.
Okay, what's going on? Those are the first
polite words you've ever said to her.
I guess we're all full of surprises today.
Hey, kids. What's cracking?
Jordan came by and told us she's throwing
a party for Dad tonight, and Tru--
- Told her off?
- Actually, Tru said she'd be there.
She was killed? Come on, get out of here.
Why else do you think I'd hang out
with her? I don't have a choice.
She was killed, she asked for my help,
the day rewound...
and I'm stuck with her for the entire day.
We're going to go pick up Dad's cake.
I guess we'll see you guys later?
Mind if I come along?
You know, help with the party planning?
Of course. That'd be nice.
What do you know?
Could you excuse us for just one sec?
You can't tell me something like that
and just run off to some bakery.
- Do you need me to do something?
- I don't think so, not yet.
But when Dad asks you
about Lindsay tonight...
tell him how you really feel,
not what he wants to hear.
You'll be glad you did. Okay?
My office. I'll be right back.
So, Jordan, where to after this?
Back to the hotel
or you may be meeting someone else?
It depends on how much time I have.
What kind of cake do you think
he's going to want this year?
Honestly, you've got the wrong girl...
if you're looking for intimate knowledge
of Richard Davies.
Then we have something in common.
What do you mean by that?
Tru, I love your father.
And I might even understand him.
But that doesn't necessarily mean
that I know him.
I think that he only ever let
one person in completely...
and that was your mother.
So the rest of us,
we just take what we can get.
Can I help you?
We'll take the big chocolate one.
Sure thing.
I see the bulk of your work
experience has been as an EMT.
Why the sudden desire
to change teams?
The truth is, I think I'd accomplished
everything I wanted to in that line of work.
I contacted all your previous employers...
and they all said the same thing,
that you were good at the job...
but one day you didn't show up.
Just disappeared.
Is there anything you want to say
about that?
A couple of years ago...
I died.
Excuse me?
I was at a scene working on a kid
about nine years old.
He had a gunshot to the back.
We'd just gotten a pulse...
and I guess someone didn't want the kid
to make it.
He started firing.
I caught the bullets instead.
I remember...
it felt like a bee sting
on the back of my neck, right here.
Three minutes and 28 seconds.
That's how long my heart stopped.
And then, I came back.
And what was that like?
You know, they say an experience
like that changes you.
It should make you want to live every day
to the fullest.
But for me, it just....
I lost it.
I knew something had to give.
It just didn't feel right....
It just didn't feel right
entrusting lives to my unsteady hands.
I thought a change of location would help.
It didn't.
I'm hoping a change of vocation will.
Some would say once you survive
something like that...
that you were brought back for a reason.
I guess we'll see.
I love cutting through the park.
If it stays like this,
it may be nice living here.
Are you sure
you don't want to just take a cab?
I know you have a lot to do today.
No, we're just going a few blocks.
I just want to let you know I really
appreciate you giving me a chance today.
You know,
your father and I don't fight very often...
but when we do, it's usually about
his relationship with the three of you.
Really?
For what it's worth,
I think his distance comes from guilt.
About how he dealt with what happened.
But he's different now.
He wants to make things right.
He's changed.
He's a different man, Tru.
Jordan, go!
Now we know why we left the city.
They can talk all they want
about the shrinking crime rate.
You know, I think I'm going to lie down
a bit, before the party.
Close my eyes.
Hey.
Thank you.
<i>Who knows what couId've happened</i>
<i>if you hadn't been there?</i>
- I'm just glad you're okay.
- Thanks.
Boy, never a dull moment.
If not the little ones, it's Jordan.
- Luckily, she's fine.
- Luckily, you were with her.
She's sweet, Dad.
I probably should've noticed that sooner.
I'd probably better get going--
It's nice that you stopped blaming her.
Blame her? For what?
Me and your mother.
Look, Dad, I'm glad that I could
help Jordan, but now is not the time.
No, it's not the time.
It's long overdue. Sit down.
When I met Jordan, yes,
your mother and I were still married.
I'm pretty clear on that part.
But we had already decided
to get a divorce.
What?
Why didn't I know this before?
Because you didn't want to.
I loved your mother, Tru,
but the fact is...
we grew apart.
She became distant, unreliable.
She'd run off at a moment's notice...
at very odd hours, flimsy excuses.
It was like she was living some....
Secret life.
The truth is, when I met Jordan,
I'd been alone for years.
But I've said enough.
Too much, probably.
Today is not a day
for living in the past.
<i>I'II see you tonight, won't I?</i>
It would mean the world to Jordan
if you would make an appearance.
And it would to me, as well.
- Hey, you made it.
- I did.
- Hi, you look beautiful.
- So do you.
Please, I stopped looking beautiful
two children ago.
So, this is Tru. Richard's daughter.
The one I told you about.
Jordan's been singing your praises
all night.
So, if you'll excuse us,
I have a lot of people I want you to meet.
Come here.
Harrison.
Dad.
I want to introduce you
to my girl, Lindsay.
- Mr. Davies.
- Aren't you Tru's friend from school?
Yeah.
There's Tru. It was nice to see you again.
She seems like a nice girl.
She is.
One of the nicest ones I've met
in a long time.
That's good to hear.
But at your age, Harrison--
Yeah, at my age, you met Mom.
Now you wouldn't consider that a mistake,
would you?
No, absolutely not.
Think about it.
You have three wonderful kids.
If you haven't noticed.
Yeah, I see your point.
God, you are so unexpected sometimes.
Dad?
What?
- He's here.
- Who? What are you talking about?
The man from the park
who attacked Jordan. He's here.
Or at least he was.
He's here now?
That means it wasn't random.
He's looking for her.
I'm going to call the police.
Don't let Jordan out of your sight.
Excuse me.
You...
what do you want with her?
The daughter's always the last to know.
Where's your daughter?
It was you. You killed my mother.
What do you want from us?
What's up?
Dad said something was going down
with Jordan.
- He was here.
- The man who mugged Jordan is here?
- The man who killed Mom.
- What?
It's the same person.
Go find Jordan, make sure she's okay.
Harrison, go. Hurry up!
You've gone way too far
this time.
I told you the last time,
this is over. You understand?
I never want to see you again.
Tru!
Wait.
- Will you give me a chance to explain?
- You knew him.
This is not what you think.
You don't want to know
what I think right now.
Yeah, I know him. He's an ex- con,
and his name is Carl Neesan.
- And you know that because?
- I was the one who convicted him.
I was an ADA 15 years ago.
He was a kid up on a murder rap.
He said he was innocent,
which they all do.
The evidence was flimsy, but I was out
to impress, so I went after him.
And was he guilty?
The jury said he was.
That was good enough for me.
At the sentencing, he swore revenge...
and he said if he ever got out,
he would make me pay.
Why today?
Why today, of all days, does he show up?
You think this is the first time?
This has been going on for years.
He shows up, he demands money.
He threatens retribution, so I pay him...
and he goes away. Until the next time.
And today?
Today I told him it had to stop.
I wasn't going to pay.
I never thought that he would
follow through with his threat.
God, I never wanted to get you involved
in this. Not you, not Jordan.
And what about Mom?
What does your mother
have to do with this?
He killed her.
- He killed Mom.
- Why would you say that?
I was there.
- No, sweetheart--
- I heard his voice.
I will never forget that voice.
He killed Mom because he was angry
with you. He wanted revenge.
Tru, no.
Don't tell me no, I saw him.
I was there, I saw him pull the trigger.
That's not what happened.
- How can you tell? He said he--
- It's not!
You don't think his was the first name
I thought of?
The police investigated this
thoroughly, and said this was not the man.
Airtight alibi.
"Not your man, Mr. Davies."
But I heard his voice.
But did you see his face?
No.
We live with the question long enough,
we want an answer.
So our mind plays tricks on us
and makes us think we've got one.
But we don't.
- Come on, it's cold. Let's go inside.
- No, I can't. I've got to go to work.
- Tonight?
- They're expecting me. I should go.
Happy birthday, Daddy.
Don't you think
you've been through enough?
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?
Sleep. That's a novel concept.
If Neesan didn't kill my mother,
then is it true?
What?
That her death had something to do
with her calling.
Despite what you might think...
I don't have all the answers.
But I'll promise you this,
I'll help you find them.
Thanks, Davis.
But for now, I'm going to take you up
on your first offer.
I'm going to go home, draw a bath,
and try and get some sleep.
I guess you didn't hire Jack after all.
Actually, I did.
I decided to go with my gut.
- That's weird.
- What's that?
Well, yesterday he took my soda.
This one with my name on it.
And today, it's still here.
You know how many ways
you can alter fate.
<i>Yesterday you met him, today you didn't.</i>
It's impossible to predict
how that might alter things.
Yeah, I guess.
Just give him a chance.
I think you'll be happy that you did.
He's next door.
It'll get easier.
What's that?
This. Doing what we do.
All these people.
Taken before their time.
Sometimes it just doesn't seem fair.
Never really thought about it.
That's one way to deal, I guess.
But if you ever want to talk,
sometimes it helps.
You know what I think is unfair?
When tubes and machines
keep people alive.
When life is prolonged
beyond its usefulness.
That's what's unfair.
- Yeah, I guess.
- I'll be honest with you. For my money...
I think that death
was one of the fairest things...
that ever happened
to some of these people.
You said you hadn't thought about it.
You caught me.
Anyway, I just wanted to say welcome.
I'm Tru.
- Like the name on the soda can.
- Yeah, that's right.
Jack.
And, um...
And thanks for making me feel
so welcome.
It's never easy being the new guy.
It feels familiar, doesn't it?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Don't move. Stay here.
- Dad, no, he'll kill you. He killed Mom.
I don't care what the cops say,
I swear it's him.
I believe you.
And that's why this has to end.
No, Dad.
Lock the door, wait here for me.
You're growing a conscience
in your old age, Richard?
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- The man you paid to kill your first wife.
- At least, if I remember correctly.
- We had a deal. I pay you, you go away.
You didn't honor it, so now it ends.
Now, I mentioned the letter, right?
The letter detailing everything
that's sent to your daughter...
if I meet an untimely death?
Tru, go!
<i>Go!</i>
Now!
When we meet next,
there won't be any warning shot...
there won't be any chase down an alley.
It's just going to be
a bullet through your heart.
Goodbye, Carl.
Did you....Is he....
It's over, sweetheart.
It's over.
Daddy's taken care of it.
Hello?
<i>Tru, it's 1:00. Are you up?</i>
I am now. You know I work
the graveyard shift, right?
It's Jack's orientation.
You have to show him around.
Don't tell me you forgot.
No, Davis, I didn't forget.
I'm just running a bit late.
Okay. She's running late.
Okay, we can start over here.
This is the digital autopsy capture.
First we--
Scan the body with the camera
for any visible signs of trauma...
then enter the name and case number
into the database.
Right. Exactly.
Okay. Over here,
this is the live scan machine.
Used to log fingerprints,
flat panel to take hand impressions.
- I read the manuals.
- Good.
I wish someone had told me.
I wouldn't have gotten up so early.
Then we couldn't have spent
this quality time together.
And the truth is...
- there are a couple of things I don't know.
- Such as?
Such as, do you like working here?
The reason I ask is you don't look like
your average morgue attendant.
Yeah? And what do I look like?
You look like a girl
who takes things way too seriously.
Someone who should be
enjoying life...
but probably spends Friday nights
home alone watching TV...
eating a microwave dinner.
Should I bag the personals?
I don't spend every Friday night at home.
I mean....
Well, anyways,
what do you do on Friday nights?
Why don't you tell me?
Well, you don't stay in. That's for sure,
because that'd mean you'd be alone...
and you're not a guy
who's very keen on being alone.
So you go out to a bar or a club.
And after a few hours,
you return home, sometimes solo...
but usually with some nameless,
faceless, shameless girl...
who just doesn't understand you.
But either way,
by the end of the night...
you're alone, in front of the TV,
eating a microwave dinner.
I don't own a microwave.
But you still haven't answered
my question.
Do you like it here?
Actually, I do.
I understand.
You do? Because not everyone does.
That's because most people believe
that only the living need help.
Hand them over. Right now!
- Can I help you?
- You sure can.
Open the safe under the counter
and fill it up.
We don't have a safe.
Open it or she dies!
Please do what he says!
Now!
Help me.
- Harrison Davies?
- Yeah.
Are you Tru Davies' brother?
Who wants to know?
Michelle Carey, <i>Post Dispatch.</i>
Right, Tru told me all about you.
I have a couple of questions
about your sister.
She's been
at a series of crime scenes.
I was wondering
if you've anything to say about that.
Sorry, Michelle, I don't talk to the media.
They tend to make me a little nervous,
you know?
But I'll tell Tru
you were asking about her.
Harry, what a surprise.
You know me, I am full of them.
This is my brother, Harrison. This is Jack.
Jack Harper.
Nice to meet you.
You, too.
You got a sec?
Yeah.
Check.
I ran into
that reporter, Michelle.
And?
Didn't say a word.
<i>The gunman Ieft</i>
<i>the Lion's Lair Arcade at 2.:00 p. m...</i>
<i>and reIeased a hostage shortIy after.</i>
<i>We'II have more....</i>
So, what's up?
I just wanted to check in,
make sure you're doing okay.
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
The whole thing with Dad
shooting the guy who killed Mom.
Yeah, I'm dealing with it the best I can.
You know, they haven't found the body.
You gotta hand it to the old man.
He really took care of things.
So is that the only reason you stopped by?
Well, now that you mention it...
it's me and Lindsay's
three- month anniversary.
I'm shocked you remembered.
I don't think it's a big deal,
but it means a lot to her.
So I booked reservations
at Le Petite Fleur....
- Whatever it is she's talking about.
- Good. She'll love that.
The problem is I'm a little tapped out.
But if you
could float some cash my way...
I can make sure that
your best friend, Lindsay...
has a night that she'll never forget.
Lucky it's payday.
Here.
Pretty expensive restaurant.
Of course, I should valet the car.
- Yeah, street parking. Not a problem.
- Get out.
Yeah, I'm going.
You are the best.
<i>And they're off.</i>
That's it, baby! Go! Come on, Eight Ball!
Hold on! Come on, Eight Ball.
Come on, go!
<i>Now Aidan's Luck swings up</i>
<i>on the outside.</i>
Do it for daddy, baby! Come on.
<i>It's Eight BaII bringing</i>
<i>to a narrow Iead.</i>
<i>And here comes Aidan's Luck.</i>
Just trying to parlay some cash
to bring the old lady out to a nice dinner.
<i>Eight BaII, Aidan's Luck</i>
<i>neck- and- neck.</i>
No!
<i>As they hit the finish Iine,</i>
<i>Aidan's Luck by a nose.</i>
- Looks like you guys are eating in.
- God.
No, that's cool.
I still got one more race, win it all back.
So, what do you think of
Hodge Podge and Nightcap?
Not much.
Look, I'm going with Deep Shaker.
Deep Shaker?
He's 20- to- 1.
Lots of luck with that, pal.
Hey, Tru.
What's up?
I just wanted to say thanks
for giving up your afternoon...
- to come in here and help me.
- It's no problem.
- So we're okay, you and me?
- Yeah, why wouldn't we be?
I just want to make sure.
I didn't want to come off like a know- it- all.
- No, you didn't. Perfectly, well--
- Hey, Tru.
Oh.
Luc, hi.
This is Jack, the new forensics assistant.
Luc's a crime scene photographer.
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.
So....
So, how have you been?
Fine.
- Busy.
- Me, too.
You always are.
Speaking of busy, I....
You know, head back.
Well, I'll see you around.
See you, Jack.
Nice to meet you.
You, too.
So how long did you two date for?
What?
Come on, I saw it.
The long lingering looks,
the unfinished sentences.
- What are you talking about?
- I think it was about two months.
And then things got complicated,
and you broke up.
Only, now you're wondering
if you did the right thing...
or just the easy thing.
Okay, yeah, something like that.
Now's the part
where you're gonna lay into me...
for being that girl
who's way too serious, right?
No.
I was gonna tell you I'm sorry things
didn't work out the way you wanted.
- How did it go with Jack?
- Good, I think.
Did he mishandle equipment?
What did he do?
No, nothing like that.
He's a smart guy. He knows his stuff.
I just can't get a read on him,
for some reason.
It's like one minute he's in your face
and almost obnoxious.
The next, he's charming,
trying to be your best friend.
He's just trying to get acclimated,
you know.
You remember your first few days here?
Besides, we need the extra help,
especially with your other job.
Yeah, I guess.
Anyway, I've got to run.
I will see you tonight.
- Tonight?
- Yeah, Luc's show.
What show?
- Never mind.
- Davis.
Okay. Luc is having a photography show
at some gallery.
I'm sure it's no big deal.
I was only invited at the last minute.
No, it's fine. I mean, it's totally fine.
We broke up,
and I'm working tonight anyway.
- Did I mention it's fine?
- Yeah, three times.
- Well, it is. It's completely and totally--
- Fine.
You didn't have to go to all this trouble
for just three months.
Although I'm so glad that you did.
I can't wait to order dessert. They have
this amazing chocolate soufflé here.
Is everything okay?
Who? What's that?
Nothing. It just looks like
you're planning an escape or something.
Oh, my God. Here, drink some water.
- Sir, are you all right?
- Oh, my God!
A bone?
- This was in my veal. I almost choked!
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- Let me get you another dish.
- Another dish? And another bone?
I don't think so, pal.
I'm sure the maitre d'
will take your meal off the bill.
- My meal? What about hers?
- Harrison, it's fine. You're fine.
We're happy to pay for my meal,
and thank you for everything.
Harrison, sit down.
A fish bone? You ordered veal, you idiot.
Let me guess.
You don't have any money, do you?
It's just one more chapter in the
Harrison Davies book of disappointments.
Who would've thought
that Deep Shaker would have won?
It was a 20- to- 1 shot. 20- to- 1!
<i>In what is amounting</i>

Hey, Linds, how was dinner?
<i>Great.</i>
Until your brother pretended to choke
on his entrée.
What?
<i>Trying to get his meaI comped...</i>
because he blew his money
at the track today.
You're joking, right?
<i>I know</i>
<i>his heart's in the right pIace...</i>
but I really think
I'm at the end of my rope with him.
He's my brother and I love him, but....
Anything you need?
Besides a chocolate soufflé?
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay. Bye.
Harrison.
Is your brother in trouble?
Sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.
Is everything okay?
Just family stuff.
Siblings. They can get to you
like no one else.
You have brothers and sisters?
I had a sister.
She died a couple of years ago.
I'm so sorry.
Thanks. That's nice of you.
But I really feel like
she went to a better place.
<i>I know it sounds cIiché...</i>
but I really believe it's true.
She was sick, and then she wasn't.
Anyway, I know what you're going through
with your brother.
You feel like he's your responsibility.
Tell me about it.
Still, sometimes you gotta let them
make their own mistakes.
Learn the hard way, you know?
Speaking of mistakes....
I had this soup from the vending machine.
Forgot about that on your tour.
Anywhere around here
a guy can get some edible food?
Yeah, the diner two blocks up isn't bad.
I was gonna get some takeout.
- I'll get you something.
- Only if I can pay.
Sounds like a deal.
- Pickup for Davies.
- A couple more minutes.
Okay, I'll be right over there.
Hello, Tru.
- Do I know you?
- Michelle Carey.
We almost spoke on the phone
a couple of times.
I've got nothing to say to you.
I ran into your brother today.
He wouldn't talk to me, either.
You've been dodging my calls
for over a month now.
I'm sure your boss told you
about our chat?
He also told me
that he kicked you out of the office.
Aborted suicides, murder attempts,
near accidents. All these rescues.
What have you to say about showing up
each time before the police do?
Or the fact that your mother
did the same thing?
What are you talking about?
Where are you getting all this?
Doesn't matter. Now is the time
to give your side of the story...
or you'll read about it
in the paper next weekend.
I'll go to print
whether I get a quote from you or not.
Order's up.
At first I thought you had
some sort of hero complex.
Setting up these near misses
so you could rescue people just in time.
- But you never took any credit.
- There's nothing to take credit for.
No one moves or she dies!
Empty the register. Quick!
This guy hit two other places today.
He took a hostage each time,
then let them go.
Everyone shut up!
Fill it up.
I am not kidding. I'll kill her if you don't!
Police officer! Drop the gun!
Somebody get us some help, hurry!
It's gonna be okay, Michelle.
Here.
Hang on, Michelle.
Someone call 91 1, please!
Hang on, Michelle.
It's gonna be okay. Come on.
Hurry, please!
God, no.
Is she....
Yeah.
I need you.
- Hello?
- Tru, are you up?
- Because it's Jack's orientation today.
- Tell him I'll be right there.
Again.
Tru, to be honest,
this doesn't set a good example.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to keep you waiting.
- It's okay, I'm not busy.
Good. Then, Davis, can I talk to you
for one sec? In your office?
- Okay.
- Be right back.
I'll be here.
Michelle, the reporter,
is the one who asked for help?
Unfortunately. But not before she had all
these questions about me saving people.
Was there anyone else hurt?
The gunman grabbed a customer
who was wounded in the crossfire.
Then he dragged her out with him.
Now you must try to save
the woman trying to expose you.
Jeez Louise, talk about irony.
What do you know about the gunman?
Apparently, he was going on
some sort of crime spree today.
This guy hit two other places today.
<i>...he heId up the Pharsyde</i>
<i>CIothing Store shortIy after 6.:00 p. m.</i>
Three places in five hours: an arcade,
a clothing store, and then the diner.
And each time,
he uses a customer as a shield.
- That worries me.
- Davis, you're always worried.
No. The fact that Michelle's the one
that died concerns me.
Some people are fated to die
before their time.
And I believe that some people are fated
to lead to the death of others.
If you wind up back at the diner with her...
fate could be altered enough
where someone else could get shot.
Not to mention that if you save her,
you're exposed:
who you are, what you can do.
You've got to call the cops, Tru.
If you can get the gunman arrested
at either of the other two places...
he'll never make it to the diner.
Michelle will be safe and so will you.
- Okay, fine. I'll do it.
- And then....
You will? That was easy.
- I thought you were gonna call the cops.
- I am.
I need to make sure the cops get this guy,
so that Michelle's safe.
Listen to me for a minute.
Look, I know that you're good
at what you do.
- But that doesn't mean I can't worry.
- That means a lot, Davis.
Just keep your cell on at Luc's show.
I may need you.
Yeah, maybe I'll see you there later.
Actually, I wasn't invited.
Don't worry. I'll call you later.
What about that tour?
A little personal business. But I'll give you
an orientation later this afternoon.
Tru's a busy girl.
Yeah, she's got a lot of hobbies.
- What's the rush?
- I think it's sweet...
that you remembered your three- month
anniversary, but I'm not giving you money.
Why would you think that? Why....
Why do reliving days suck for me?
So, what did I do?
You lost everything I gave you
at the track.
So you're gonna have to be more creative.
And I'm gonna do you
an even bigger favor today.
I'll borrow your car
so you can't go to the track at all.
- No, wait--
- I gotta go.
Go on. Save everybody but me.
I gotta get a job. No.
You look a little lost there, bud.
Everything okay?
- You'll have to ask my sister.
- You must be Tru's brother.
- I'm Jack, the new guy.
- Harrison. What's up?
You sure everything's okay?
Yeah, it's nothing.
My girl wanted to go out
for the anniversary, you know.
I was gonna take her to a nice dinner,
but I'm all tapped out, so....
Well, what do you usually do
to score some quick cash?
I bet the horses.
- But I don't even have start- up cash--
- I love the track.
Why don't we go together
and I'll spot you a few bucks?
- Get out of here!
- I got some time till orientation. Let's go.
Sweet, because if we hurry,
we can still make the daily double.
Check it out.
I need to talk to someone
about a potential robbery.
<i>HoId, pIease.</i>
Come on.
Desk Sergeant Cooper.
How can I help you?
Someone I know
is gonna commit a robbery today.
<i>An armed robbery.</i>
Someone you know?
- What's your name, miss?
- I'd rather not say.
This person you know
give any specifics as to time or place?
The Lion's Lair Arcade on Fifth
around 3:00.
Okay, I'll bite.
What does this armed man look like?
No one moves or she dies!
Mid 20s, about 6' tall, short black hair.
He wore....I mean, he's wearing
an orange T- shirt under a gray jacket.
Okay, we'll send an officer to check it out.
Thank you. Please hurry.
What's up, Frankie?
Give me $20 on the 2 horse.
Two seconds.
What's the matter? Second thoughts?
I must have lost
when I bet the horse yesterday.
What are you talking about?
No, Tru told me that I didn't....
I mean, that the horse didn't....
The horse won't do well.
I've only known Tru
for a short period of time...
but she doesn't strike me
as an expert on the ponies.
She's not. She's....
Tru is lucky, man.
So am I. So go with me
and bet the 7 horse.
- Aidan's Luck?
- Aidan's Luck loves this track.
Three- for- three at this distance.
Right.
Forgot about that.
Sorry about that.
Had to have a quick powwow
with my new consultant over there.
Give me $20 on lucky 7, to win.
Hand them over. Right now!
Everything okay?
Fine, sir.
No problem here, Officer.
Can I get some change
for the parking meter?
See anything out of the ordinary today?
Besides half my clientele? No.
Give us a call
if you have any problems.
They must have seen the cops.
Hey, Davis?
You think you'll be able
to make it tonight?
- Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
- Great. It's my first show...
and I'm afraid the photos
are gonna outnumber the people.
I know that Tru's really excited
about going.
She loves photography and photo stuff.
Actually, I didn't invite Tru.
Really? I had no idea.
I thought she's got a lot going on.
I didn't think she'd have the time.
Look, I'm no expert
on successful relationships...
or any relationship, for that matter.
But let me just say this.
Sometimes people will surprise you.
Wh- What?
<i>Unit 47, what's your status</i>
<i>on that 2- 11 at the Lion's Lair Arcade?</i>
<i>This is McLain.</i>
<i>That 2- 11's a negative.</i>
<i>10- 4.</i>
Some nut just called in a false alarm.
The premises were checked.
It's all clear.
<i>AII right, 10- 4.</i>
<i>We got you back in service.</i>
If that woman calls again,
you let her know...
<i>that the faIse reporting of a crime</i>
<i>is a feIony.</i>
<i>WiII do. 10- 4.</i>
What are you up to?
The gunman never showed up,
so the robbery never happened.
You altered the day.
He must have cased the place.
Saw the cops and took off. Right.
- There's just one problem.
- The guy's still out there.
Right, and his crime spree is still on track.
I have no assurance
that Michelle's gonna be safe.
It might be time
for another anonymous tip.
You gonna bail me out
after they lock me up?
Sorry, it's up to me now.
I've gotta head to that second location.
- No, it's too dangerous.
- Davis, I can't turn my back on fate.
Who knows what could happen?
I have to do this.
Okay, but I want you to take this.
- A St. Benedict medal.
- It's for protection.
Many people believe that it ensures...
no harm will come to the body or soul
that possesses it.
<i>It was given to me a Iong time ago...</i>
and I like to think
that it's kept me safe ever since.
I'm gonna be just fine, D.
I hope so.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I'm just--
- I know, on your way out the door.
Hey, Tru.
I know you're busy
and this is kind of last- minute...
but if you get some time tonight,
I'd love for you to come to my show.
Thanks. I'll try.
- I'll keep my hopes up.
- Bye.
Thank you, Aidan's Luck. 2, 3, 4, 5.
And thank you.
I don't know what I would've done
without you.
No, actually, I do.
I wish Tru could see this.
Teach her to have a little faith
in her baby bro.
What's with your sister, anyway?
She's a little overprotective of you.
She can't help it.
You know, ever since our mom died
and the old man bailed...
she kind of looks over the family.
Maybe that's why she seems like she has
the weight of the world on her shoulders.
Yeah, she's got
a lot of other stuff going on.
Like what?
More than you could imagine, my friend.
I got a pretty big imagination.
Well, she's...
She's one- of- a- kind. But enough about her.
More importantly,
who do you like in the next race?
You're not gonna like it.
Deep Shaker.
What? He's 20- to- 1.
He likes the outside on a dry track.
Could be his day.
And if you win this bet, you'll have
enough money for six anniversary dinners.
Deep Shaker?
$20 to win.
Don't do it.
I know what you're gonna do.
You're gonna grab someone
and try and hold this place up.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Listen.
You haven't done anything yet.
Didn't hit the arcade because of the cops.
- Stop before someone gets hurt, or worse.
- Who are you?
Does it matter?
Get out of my way.
Don't go out there.
The guy that just left has got a gun.
- Sorry, but I'm in a rush.
- Didn't you hear what I said?
<i>Morgue.</i>
Davis, you're not gonna believe this.
Honestly, nothing at this point
surprises me.
He tried to hit the clothing store.
I stopped the robbery but he escaped.
<i>What about the hostage?</i>
<i>That's just it. There isn't one.</i>
He isn't taking a different hostage each
time. It's the same girl at every location.
- They're a team.
- Just like Bonnie and Clyde.
Kind of, except in this case,
Clyde uses Bonnie as a fake hostage.
That's an interesting twist.
I should've known when he took her
from the diner after she got shot.
She wasn't a shield.
He wouldn't leave her because--
<i>They're in it together.</i>
Right.
You've been busy today.
- Feel like telling me what's going on?
- Michelle.
I see we don't need to be
formally introduced...
- even though I haven't met you.
- I recognize your voice.
Really?
You've harassed my phone machine
enough times.
If you'd just talk to me,
maybe I'd stop.
<i>Today's not the day.</i>
<i>It's the perfect day.</i>
You're calling in false alarms,
chasing people out of clothing stores.
Just another typical day
in the life of Tru Davies.
I checked police logs, auto track records.
Your name pops up everywhere. In fact--
Michelle.
You don't want to be around me today.
I want your answers, Tru.
I'm not going anywhere until I get them.
- Okay, meet me tonight.
- Time and place?
8:00 sharp at the morgue.
Just please promise me
you'll wait until I get there?
I'll be there.
And this better be good.
Believe me, it's good.
Did you get all that?
<i>Yeah.</i>
She'll be at the morgue at 8:00.
Make sure she waits until I get there.
That way, we can ensure she stays alive.
Even if she isn't at the diner,
someone could still get hurt.
It's my job.
It's a chance we're gonna have to take.
<i>I'II caII you Iater.</i>
- Did I hear someone mention the diner?
- No, I was talking to Tru.
Is she getting takeout?
'Cause I could really use a burger.
No, she has her hands full.
Before we got there,
I'm thinking to myself...
it's gonna be canned soup
and crackers for us.
Jack, he's turned me in the direction
of this long shot.
I'm a little dubious, mind you,
but Jack said:
"If this horse wins,
you can buy six anniversary dinners."
Are you gonna eat the rest of this?
Deep Shaker
was a 20- to- 1 shot.
But Jack had a feeling.
And boy, did he ever have a feeling!
I'm talking about $400 worth of feelings.
I have an idea. Why don't I leave
so you can have dinner with Jack?
What?
Never mind.
What a day, what a night, and it ain't over.
Where are you going, chief?
For your little lady.
Thank you, sir.
No, you ought to thank Jack.
Drop the gun!
Everyone shut up!
You're a policeman, right?
I'm off-duty, ma'am.
Is there something I can do for you?
I hope so.
Hello?
Hello?
Can I help you?
Hi, I didn't see you there.
Michelle Carey, <i>Post Dispatch.</i>
Sorry, I subscribe to the <i>Times.</i>
I'm not peddling subscriptions.
I'm looking for Tru Davies.
Yeah. Davis said she's at
the Standard Diner down the block.
Really? She's supposed to meet me
here at 8:00.
- I'm sure she's on her way back.
- I'm not.
Why don't you just pop in on her?
It's just out the door,
two blocks down on your right.
Thanks. I think I will.
I don't know who tipped you off...
but I don't see
the blonde woman you described...
let alone some guy holding up the place.
I don't understand.
They should be here by now.
Things couldn't have changed that much.
I can't believe you're not gonna do this.
That girl knew we were gonna be
at the arcade and the clothing store.
- It was a coincidence. Bad luck.
- She knows we're together.
She has no idea who we are...
and there's no way in hell
she knows we're gonna hit this diner.
- Unless you talked to somebody, Charlie.
- You think I'm nuts?
Why would I tell anyone
about this?
Look, this is getting out of hand, Beth.
This was supposed to be
just the two of us having a few kicks...
grabbing some quick dough
without anyone getting hurt.
Who's gotten hurt, Charlie?
- No one, but--
- Exactly. No one.
We promised each other
that the minute there was any trouble...
- we're gonna back off.
- Meanwhile, we haven't seen a dime.
As for kicks,
we haven't got much there, either.
Later, hon.
Sorry, but you're gonna miss all the fun.
Beth!
Beth!
Looks like your friend gave you
a bogus tip.
- It wouldn't be the first time.
- Sorry to have troubled you.
Better to be safe than sorry.
You leaving already? Because
if you'd like to join me for dinner....
Sorry, but I've got another crisis
waiting for me back at the office.
And unfortunately,
this one's gonna show up.
Did a reporter come here looking for Tru?
Long dark hair, mid- to- late 20s?
Yeah, Michelle something.
About 10 minutes ago.
I told her Tru was at the diner
and she took off.
8:00 at the morgue?
- I was just gonna pick up some dinner.
- Eating light?
Look, you can't even begin to understand
what's been going on today.
Oh, no.
- Wait right here. I'll be right back.
- Like that's gonna happen.
Wait for me at the morgue.
It's for your own good, believe me.
Okay, but you better show.
Give me the money right now!
Don't do this.
You.
Police officer! Drop the gun!
I don't know what you're doing here,
but just shut up!
- Get in the booth.
- It's not gonna end well.
Now!
All right, let's have it right now.
Drop it right now!
Hurry up!
Put the gun down
and no one gets hurt.
All right.
I leave, she lives. Simple as that.
No one's been hurt yet
but that could change.
In fact, I could almost guarantee
it's going to.
Just let it go, miss.
- What if she gets shot? What if she dies?
- Just shut up!
Everyone knows what you look like.
You'll end up alone in prison for the rest
of your life. Is that what you want?
No, she doesn't.
Please, Beth. You gotta stop.
We never wanted to hurt anyone.
<i>This isn't what we do.</i>
We're not criminals.
We're not even good at it.
How else could
she have been on to us all day?
<i>And if she is...</i>
- the cops can't be far behind.
- Actually, there's one right there.
Beth, please, let this woman go.
Put down the gun and kick it to me.
Drop the gun!
Over here.
Police! Put the gun down!
I'm from 64 Precinct.
Badge number 83049.
Police!
How'd you get here
so quick?
Got a 91 1 call from the Coroner's Office
about a holdup in progress.
<i>Said he was worried about his friend here.</i>
So, Harrison spent a fortune on dinner.
<i>He did?</i>
Yep.
He also spent the entire evening talking
about his new track buddy named Jack.
No kidding?
<i>Why do I feeI</i>
<i>if a coupIe of Iong shots hadn't come in...</i>
I would've had frozen pizza
instead of a soufflé?
I won't try and convince you otherwise.
You gonna be all right?
- Yeah. Ask me in the morning.
- Okay, good night.
I think you owe me an explanation.
God, I've had it with you!
It's not enough
I just saved your ungrateful....
- Okay, you want the truth?
- That's all I ever wanted.
Turn on that tape recorder.
Yesterday, I went to the diner.
You were following me,
just like you did today.
- Yesterday? I didn't go--
- You want to hear this or not?
There was a holdup at the diner.
You were shot and killed.
After you died, you asked for my help.
The day rewound,
and now I'm reliving yesterday.
What?
In order to keep you from dying,
I had to try and prevent a crime spree...
which you tipped me off on yesterday.
And thanks for that, by the way.
But you ended up at the diner anyway,
because that's how fate wanted it.
So now you want me to think
you're just plain nuts?
Nice try, but it's not gonna work.
I don't know
exactly what happened back there...
but you and I aren't done.
Luc, hey.
Yeah.
Your show. I wanted to be there.
I really did.
- It's just my day wouldn't end.
- Tru, you don't have to explain.
I invited you because I wanted you there,
not because I thought you would be.
It's okay, really.
Well, how did it go?
Pretty good. Had a decent turnout.
Sold two prints.
- It was a good night for me.
- That's good. I'm glad.
You know, I thought for a while
that maybe I could change our fate...
but I guess fate's one thing
you just can't change.
Thank God.
It's okay, Davis. I'm in one piece.
And Michelle lives to see another day.
I'll reserve judgment
whether that's a good thing or not.
So did the medallion keep you safe?
No, Davis. It was you who kept me safe.
You called the police.
It's the least I could do
after letting Michelle out of my sight.
Anyway, thanks.
No.
No, that's, uh...
That's yours to keep.
I appreciate it. Thanks, D.
Yeah.
One thing.
I'm in danger all the time.
I mean, dodging bullets, chasing bad guys.
But today, the medallion,
making me call the police.
Why were you so worried about me today?
Well, for one, there was Michelle.
But the truth is...
I worry about you every day, Tru.
Today I just wanted to help.
You have a fun day at the races?
Actually, we did.
Your brother's a pretty cool guy.
I happen to think so, too.
Just not sure why you had to go
to the track to figure that out.
Don't worry so much.
Harrison's a big boy.
He can take care of himself.
Besides, he won, didn't he?
Well, I'm his sister.
I know Harrison a lot better than you do
and what's best for him.
Maybe so.
<i>But you know what?</i>
You can't take care of everyone, Tru.
That isn't gonna stop me from trying.
Did Harrison call?
Hi. No, was he supposed to?
He was supposed to give me a lift.
But, never mind.
I'm not gonna let anything
ruin my mood today because....
Look at me, Davis.
It's the new woman.
And she would be different
from the old woman because?
I won't put everything on hold anymore...
just because a few corpses
get conversational with me.
From now on,
I'm back in control of my own life.
But....
How you doing? You look a little tired.
I've got this thing tomorrow
at my apartment.
- And I haven't unpacked.
- When did you move in?
Three years ago.
Yes, some people are coming over,
because a guy I know from JPL...
is feeding us images
from the Mars Spirit Rover, and--
Why don't I help you unpack?
Really? All right.
Then it'll be me, you, and Jack.
Jack? Why is he--
Because he volunteered
before you showed up.
Honey, I'm home.
Shot through the heart,
found in an alley downtown.
<i>FamiIy's on the way.</i>
Still got her lD and wallet.
Not your average mugging.
Melissa Sumner. 19. College student.
I like a girl
who pays attention to the details.
It's my job.
But not everyone does it so well,
or so thoroughly.
Help me.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah.
I got to go. Just one sec.
That body that just came in,
she asked for help.
- Just now?
- Just now.
But you're still here.
That's because nothing happened.
No rewind. Nothing.
Help me.
Are you sure you didn't imagine this?
Davis, please. I may be overworked,
but I'm not hallucinating.
So is this it?
Am I never gonna rewind again?
- We may never know.
- Did I do something wrong? Or--
No. Don't start that now. You put yourself
on the line for these people.
You've done nothing wrong.
Maybe it didn't happen for a reason.
Something specific to this case, this girl.
A college student. You think
there's something special about her?
Hey. Melissa Sumner's parents
are here for an lD.
I guess we'll find out.
Mrs. Sumner, I'm sure
this is of little comfort to you now...
but I am truly sorry for your loss.
We always told her
how dangerous the city is.
How she should just hand over her wallet
if someone wanted it.
Actually, Mr. Sumner,
her wallet was still with her.
<i>$20 inside.</i>
Can you think of anyone who might have
had animosity towards your daughter?
No!
<i>MeIissa was....</i>
<i>She got aIong with everyone.</i>
<i>She was aIways a good girI.</i>
She was so bright.
She had a brilliant future and....
Honey.
Honey,
you shouldn't be here, okay?
We'll go outside.
The worst part of not rewinding
is watching the family.
All that pain every day,
how do you stand it?
You get used to it.
Where're you going?
I can't just leave it like this.
I mean, I can try and find out...
what happened to Melissa
and why she asked for my help.
I know, I am sorry, okay?
I forgot to pick you up...
- but something unexpected came up.
- A girl or a bet?
Hey, it was an emergency of a kind.
Okay, so I boxed a trifecta at 3- 4- 7.
It was 3- 4- 6.
I was only off by one.
But who would've thought that
Vanilla Custer wouldn't pass a urine test?
- You know what, just forget it.
- What's your hurry?
My hurry is
that a body just asked for my help.
This is a do- over day,
and you let me lose $200?
It's not a do- over. The body asked for help,
and nothing happened.
What, were you fired?
I was Melissa's roommate,
but we really didn't talk much.
She always had her head in a book.
She was doing
a math and engineering double major.
And she was a teaching assistant,
and had a 3. 9 grade point average.
Any arguments, disagreements?
I mean, was she upset about anything?
She seemed fine. Everything was normal.
- I'm sorry I can't be more help.
- No, I appreciate it.
You know, it's not like Melissa and I
were really friends.
But I go back to the room now,
and all of her stuff is still there.
- Like she'll walk in any second.
- Yeah.
But I guess this is just another day to you.
Good. Thanks for coming.
No problem.
This is it. How'd it go?
Actually it didn't go very far.
The roommate backs up the parents.
Nobody has any clue
why anyone would shoot Melissa.
At least you're starting to build
a picture of who she was.
- Hey, Tru.
- Hey, Jack.
I put all 13 episodes of <i>I, CIaudius...</i>
on the same shelf as <i>The X- FiIes</i> videos.
Is that wrong?
What, you were serious
about alphabetizing?
Wow. Davis is a dedicated employee,
isn't he?
He really takes his work home
with him.
I'm trying to imagine
a first- date scenario.
Why don't you come to my apartment?
I'll show you all my books on death.
- Kind of a mood killer.
- Unless you're dating a serial killer.
Hey, Davis. We were just checking out
some of your books.
I thought you guys were here
to help me unpack.
Who's this?
- Someone special, I presume?
- We were together, now we're not.
Look, Harbor Marina. She's pretty.
Yeah.
You still talk to her?
Look, I think I can take care of the rest
of this if you guys want to take off.
He's a funny guy, isn't he?
- Funny?
- Yeah.
He lives alone, he makes death his career.
Have you ever noticed how
he always avoids talking about himself?
Come on, he's just eccentric, that's all.
- How much do you know about him?
- Plenty.
Really? Then tell me this.
Is Davis his first name or his last name?
I'll bet he knows a lot about you, though,
doesn't he?
I got a pickup.
I'll see you back at the morgue.
Yeah, see you there.
Why?
What do you want from me?
How can I help you?
Talking to yourself?
Occupational hazard in a place like this.
You know what I always say.
When they start answering back,
then it's time to worry.
<i>Look at this guy.</i>
Swallowed a whole bottle of downers.
What have we got?
Check this out.
No lD, but he picked up
a lot of business cards.
Maybe he was a salesman.
And the piece de résistance.
"Jean, I'm sorry, please forgive me."
Signed, Geoffrey.
Short, concise, to the point.
Got to admire that.
Save me.
Davis. Two bodies, one day. We got to talk.
Davis, where are you?
No lD, but he's picked up
a bunch of business cards.
You're here early.
I need to talk to Davis. A personal matter.
You rely on him a lot,
for someone you know nothing about.
Or am I wrong about that?
See you, Tru.
Look, Harbor Marina.
"H. Clarke."
I got here as fast as I could.
You want to go talk in the office?
Could these two people
be connected in some way?
<i>What does a murdered coIIege student...</i>
and a businessman's suicide
have in common?
We don't even have a last name
on the suicide.
He signed the note"Geoffrey."
No lD, no address?
We didn't find any.
But I did find a bunch
of different business cards in his pocket.
I checked the company names
on the computer. Get this:
they all had the same address.
It sounds like a place to start.
Two people to save, double workload.
You gonna be okay?
I'll be fine.
I got a head start on Melissa yesterday.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
Does the name H. Clarke
mean anything to you?
Why do you ask?
Tru was looking it up on her computer...
and I was just wondering
whether I'd lost a body.
I mean, H. Clarke wasn't on the list,
but maybe....
It probably doesn't mean anything.
Okay.
I need to borrow your car.
- That's so weird. I was coming--
- No, you weren't gonna come and get me.
And if I were you,
I'd stay away from the trifecta, too.
That is so not fair.
You know what I did and I don't.
You let me down again. Nothing you
haven't done a thousand times before.
And you know what? Lindsay says
the same exact thing about you, too.
Well, excuse me. I made a mistake.
I'm not lucky like you.
You screw up, and it's:
"What am I gonna do?
You know what, I'll just redo it."
That's right, I'm lucky, right?
Because I have two lives to save today
and I have no idea how I'm gonna do it?
You know what? Let me help you on this.
Help me?
You forgot to even come pick me up.
Look, I know about that, but look...
I'm good with people, you know that.
And I've helped you before.
You don't have a lot of options.
You got two lives, right?
You got to trust somebody. Why not me?
I swear, Tru, I will not let you down.
Okay, I'll tell you everything I know
about Melissa Sumner...
but I need you to pay attention...
because you never know
what's gonna be important.
Okay, drive to Hudson,
its uptown campus, Waverly Hall.
She's gonna TA a math class at noon.
All right, that's it for today, class.
Just remember, when you think
something is random, it isn't.
<i>It's aII about patterns.</i>
As Einstein once said,
"God doesn't play dice with the universe."
I liked that little lecture thing there,
especially the end part.
I'm not sure I agree with it, though,
about God not playing dice.
You feel up to arguing with Einstein?
Well, gambling's fun, right?
It just stands to reason that God would
wanna have a good time with His creation.
Probabilities are fun for you and me,
because we can't see the future.
But since God already knows all the cards...
he probably doesn't get
the same kick out of it.
No, that's where you're wrong.
I actually know
a little bit about the future myself.
You do?
Yeah.
I see you. I see me.
We're having lunch together.
Nice try, but I see separate tables.
Right.
"368 West 1st Street."
Hello, Harry.
It's a little harder than I thought.
I've known bail bondsmen
who are friendlier than this chick.
Right. So listen, you have to get
into this girl's life, Harrison.
<i>Whatever her pIans are for today,</i>
<i>you've got to change them.</i>
You can do it. Just be yourself.
I was myself.
- You hit on her?
- No.
Well, not in so many....Yeah.
Then be your other self.
- Lie?
- Bingo.
Got it.
You committed to 6, 000 pounds
of bison meat.
<i>This pIace isn't even refrigerated.</i>
<i>Okay, damn it, you can't get mad cow</i>
<i>from freaking buffaIo.</i>
<i>That's why they caII it"cow."</i>
All right, hold on a second,
just hold on.
Hello? Jean, hi,
it's so good to hear your voice.
No, it's great timing.
Yeah, it's not even
midnight here.
<i>No, that's right, Hong Kong doesn't sIeep.</i>
<i>Listen, honey, I'm right in the middIe</i>
<i>of finishing dinner with some cIients.</i>
No, it's going really well. It's going great.
<i>I miss you, too.</i>
<i>Yeah, I'II be home in a few days.</i>
Okay. I love you, sweetheart.
Hello?
Hello?
Damn it.
- Man of many names?
- Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm here to see Geoffrey.
I'm from the bank.
I just talked to your manager.
I told him I'd get the money today,
and I will.
<i>I'm working on something right now.</i>
Always a scheme?
I have a brother like you.
Look, the bank's gonna get their money.
I've got everything under control.
- So, thank you for stopping by.
- No problem.
You know, I come up here to be alone.
I can see why, it's a great spot for it.
If you're looking for a girl,
this campus is full of them.
Look, no offense, and....
This is so embarrassing.
I need some help with some math tutoring.
Really? What do you need help with?
Advanced calculus? Beginner?
Ah, um...
Fractions. I need some help
with some fractions.
Come on.
Okay, you multiply, divide, and...
one goes over the other...
and those little slashes?
What is that about? It's confusing.
No, the thing is...
you look like you need a break.
You're all
about patterns, right?
Why don't you break out of yours?
Look, I'm sorry.
You seem like a really nice guy, but...
I've got a lot to do.
Right.
Harbor Marina?
Yeah, I'm looking for H. Clarke.
The owner of a boat called <i>The Comet.</i>
Yeah, I'll hold.
Doctor's office.
Try getting a human being on the phone.
Yeah, I'm still here.
You here for the poker game?
It's high stakes players only.
I'll be right back.
Harrison, what do you know
about a poker game...
at a place called The Countdown Club?
That place. Once a month
they have a high- stakes game...
where they throw out all the small fries.
I don't know,
I've only heard rumors about it.
It looks like Geoffrey's gonna lose
and kill himself sometime tonight.
He's desperate for the money.
Think you could get into the game?
lnto the game?
What about Melissa? And besides...
you need $5, 000 to have a stake.
Right. Just stay where you are,
I'll get the money and bring it to you.
<i>We're gonna switch.</i>
<i>Poker's your worId.</i>
You take Geoffrey,
and I'll take care of Melissa.
Where are you gonna get that kind of cash?
Tru?
Vanilla Custer flunked the urine test.
Or so you told me yesterday.
You pick winners for perfect strangers,
but not even your own bro?
Where is Melissa?
She's in her dorm.
That's the only entrance, right over there.
And, hey, good luck.
Hello?
I ran one of those aliases you gave me
through a credit bureau.
Harold Smith co- signed a loan
for, get this, Geoffrey Pine.
Pine? We finally got a last name.
<i>I think Geoffrey creates</i>
<i>new identities to open new Iines of credit.</i>
And probably get away from those people
he owed money to when things got bad.
He must be deeper in the hole
than he's ever been...
if he's committing suicide over this.
His wife has no idea.
She thinks he's in Hong Kong.
He's been living a lie.
<i>You know what the crazy thing is?</i>
<i>He's not a bad guy.</i>
With all of his schemes and everything,
he reminds me so much of Harrison.
Mirror images, duality, life and death.
That's a way a lot of religions
see the universe.
Davis, I got to go.
Hello.
<i>I'm at the game.</i>
And I'm just checking in.
Great. Don't lose track of Geoffrey
while you're staring at your cards.
<i>No, come on, Tru.</i>
<i>I wiII not Iet you down. I swear.</i>
<i>Everything is under controI.</i>
Tru?
Did you follow me here?
How could I follow you if I was here first?
Now that you mention it,
I think you should leave. Like now.
- All right, who the hell are you?
- Maybe I'm a friend of your wife's.
Not with that tell.
"Tell?"
It's a giveaway.
You looked away when you lied,
and you pushed your hair back.
No, seriously,
I think you should get out of here.
What is it with you?
Why are you obsessed with me leaving?
I just have a feeling that you
might have some bad luck here tonight.
Yeah, nice try at psyching out
your competition.
But I need this money, and I'm not moving.
Come on.
What does a young, pretty,
smart girl like yourself...
need with that kind of money?
Your wife doesn't know
about your secret life, does she?
Guess what, when they take your house
away, I'm sure she's gonna figure it out.
You don't understand.
My wife told me to straighten up my act
a long time ago.
She thinks I did.
I've been putting my theories
of probability to practical use.
I've been gambling, okay? A lot.
Got it.
Over the long run, I tend to win.
But over the short run, I....
Hmm?
I lost my tuition money.
You mean all of it?
Look, I can fix this, okay?
I can win. I just need one good streak.
That's why I'm here.
Consider me your good luck charm.
In a few days, the school
is gonna write a letter to my parents...
unless I head it off
by getting this money tonight.
Look, this is my last chance, Harrison.
I like you, but I'm gonna have to beat you.
Flush beats the pair.
How about a break?
Yeah.
No offense, but as a good luck charm,
you're not working hard enough.
Damn, she's a hell of a player.
She probably won last night, too.
That's why she was killed, for the money.
So, Geoffrey lost, offed himself,
and Melissa won and--
And was robbed and shot
in the alley outside.
If she leaves broke, it'll keep her alive.
But then she gets kicked out of school.
We have to think of this as an ER.
We have to save their lives.
You have to beat her, Harrison.
Not to shock you or anything,
but I'm trying.
- You have a tell.
- I do not!
You pull on your collar
whenever you're bluffing.
You playing?
Yeah.
Just remember who
the experienced poker player is, okay?
Straight beats two pair.
The ace.
Yeah!
Congratulations,
you were faking the tell.
Well, you know...
it was only the last one, so....
Um, this is, uh...
This is really awkward for me.
I got to warn you.
I'm in a serious relationship and--
Look, Harrison, the truth is
I really need this money.
Do you think that you would consider
loaning it to me?
I mean, I would pay you back
with interest and everything.
If you'd just give me a little bit of time....
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Yeah.
Thanks.
This whole knowing the future thing....
- It can really suck.
- Yeah, sometimes.
That was just step one,
because step two is...
now you lose all that money to Geoffrey.
Why don't you just stick a bullet
right through my heart?
Start losing, Harry.
Hi, I'm looking for H. Clarke.
I'm Hope Clarke.
Are you the owner of the boat
registered out at the Harbor Marina?
Well, I'm not the sailor in the family.
My daughter, Haley, bought it.
Then can I talk to Haley?
May I ask you what this is about?
Two lousy pairs. I'm out.
Good luck charm says cash out.
Are you crazy?
A little friendly advice, pal.
Leave while you're ahead.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm on a streak
and there's still money on the table.
There's always
money on the table somewhere.
So, I guess I'm never gonna know
who the hell you are.
Guess not.
Well....
I think I'm gonna go surprise my wife
with an early return from Hong Kong.
Thank you.
I can't believe
I voluntarily lost all that money.
Welcome to my world.
Now, I've got to go to work.
What about you?
Melissa left here
thinking I'm some kind of jerk...
so might as well try to find her...
and make sure
she knows it wasn't personal.
Hey.
You did good.
You ain't so bad yourself.
<i>He was great, Davis.</i>
I mean, two people saved,
and he didn't just leave it at that.
He's gone to see Melissa
to try to make things right with her.
What's with Geoffrey Pine?
Just this feeling I have,
like there's unfinished business.
The truth is,
I may have saved his life this time...
but if he doesn't make some changes....
The man reminds me so much of Harrison,
I can't just....
<i>HeIIo?</i>
Can I speak to Geoffrey?
<i>He's stiII in Hong Kong.</i>
<i>Can I take a message?</i>
No message. Thanks. Bye.
<i>Bye.</i>
His wife says he's still in Hong Kong.
He left to go see her.
He should be home by now.
I better go make sure Geoffrey's okay.
Tru, it may be nothing.
- We talked about duality, mirror images?
- Yeah.
Murder and suicide on day one.
If that were a complete mirror image,
you know what would happen.
Hello? Melissa?
Mel? Hey, you in here?
Hey, Harrison.
I'm at the campus.
Melissa left a suicide note.
<i>My God.</i>
You need to get down here.
<i>I can't.</i>
<i>I'd never make it there on time.</i>
Geoff's still in danger.
He never went home.
You know where he is.
Where does any gambler go?
- He went back to the game.
- Just forget him, okay?
I know where she's got to be--
I have to reach Geoffrey.
He has no idea what he's walking into.
She's going to kill herself, Tru!
You are there. You can do this, Harry.
You can do this.
Melissa, I....
Look, I know why you're here and....
Melissa, I can help you.
Are you giving me the money after all?
Look, I would, but...
Um...
I don't have it anymore.
You lost it?
Hey, no, don't.
Hey, look.
Losing money
ain't the end of the world, right?
I mean, take it from me.
I can help you.
You can tell your parents.
No, I can't. I can't face them.
They work 16 hours a day
so that I can have a better life.
They gave up everything
for me and my sister.
How could I possibly tell them
I gambled away all my college money?
- They would never understand.
- There has to be another way out, okay?
No! It's hopeless. I would have to get
the money to school by tomorrow...
before they write a letter to my parents.
Hey, hold up.
Hey, look, uh...
my car.
My car. It ain't worth but $5, 000, but...
it's yours.
It's yours.
Huh?
Will that give you time?
You would do that for me?
Of course.
Come here. Come on.
Yeah.
What a night.
Looks like I don't need
my good luck charm after all.
I'm still on that hot streak.
That's tough luck, man. Maybe next time.
Hey!
Just stay calm
and hand me the money.
No!
You know, I don't know why
you keep looking out for me.
And I'm not sure I know how to thank you.
Well, if I was really looking out for you,
what do you think I'd say?
Tell my wife.
Harder than a high- stakes game.
Think you can handle it?
No. But it's time.
Hey. I got a pickup down in the van.
How do you get so banged up
on this job? The dead don't fight back.
You'd be surprised.
Hey, did you know that Davis was married?
His wife's dead.
Dead? He tell you this?
Davis? Volunteer personal information?
Are you kidding me?
I got an ear for gossip.
You got to come out with me.
I'm serious.
Don't know.
Get out of here.
Dude, live it up a little.
Hey.
Hi.
I rescued a pizza
on the way back.
After saving a damsel.
Yes, sir.
Is something wrong?
Yesterday, at your apartment,
there was a picture of a woman.
Maybe we should discuss that.
You know what, no,
it's none of my business, actually.
It is.
You know,
should I just go and--
No, stay, Harrison.
You deserve to hear this, too.
Okay.
We were married for a year.
You're married?
And I was supposed to meet Haley
at her mother's.
We were going to a restaurant
for our anniversary dinner.
I'd been working late here,
and I was going out to my car and...
the gas had all been drained from the tank,
the tires were flat.
There was this crazy woman there,
telling me I had to call my wife...
and prevent her from getting in her car
and getting on the freeway.
- Crazy woman?
- Our mother.
But I knew
the evening could be salvaged.
Haley knew if I was running late,
I could meet her at the restaurant.
Our mother didn't know where she was.
And you didn't call Haley.
To tell her that there was a lunatic
claiming she was gonna die that night?
<i>I thought, yeah, that'd be a great way</i>
<i>to say happy anniversary.</i>
What happened?
The autopsy said
that she had a seizure at the wheel...
and her car drifted over three lanes
before she was hit by a semi.
So on day one?
I died with her.
That's why you know so much.
That's why you understand.
Our mother saved you.
Davis, I'm so sorry.
It happened a long time ago.
And, you know, today is a celebration day.
Yeah.
Two lives saved.
Cheers.
So that's it?
No more shocking revelations?
No more secrets?
You officially know what I know.
Well, not everything, Davis.
- First name or last?
- Yes.
It's my middle. Actually, it's a funny story.
Hey, Jack? Hey, my man.
Why don't you come in here,
join the party? You work too hard.
Actually, it's a slow night.
I only had this pickup on campus.
What?
Harrison, let's just go sit down.
We'll figure out what happened.
She was all right when I left.
The suicide was a friend of his?
She was all right when I left.
Everything was fine.
Hey, man, it's easy to misjudge
when someone's depressed.
Who knows
what's going through their head?
- Where are you going?
- What difference does it make?
Lindsay was right about me.
You were right. I'm not like you.
I can't save anybody.
Not even myself.
Look, don't go. Just stay with me.
We can talk.
I got to get out of here.
I know this is of little comfort to you now...
but I am very sorry for your loss.
Why?
<i>Why'd she think she had to Iie?</i>
It was only money.
We put too much pressure on her.
Honey,
you shouldn't be here, okay?
We'll go outside.
Could you be any more specific?
We got a phone call.
A man said that Melissa had lost
all her tuition money playing cards.
Somebody told them.
Somebody told Melissa's parents.
They must have called her
after Harrison left.
They wanted an explanation.
That's why she killed herself.
But that doesn't make any sense.
On day one, they didn't know.
What changed?
<i>Who couId've done such a thing?</i>
<i>PreviousIy, on</i> Tru Calling:
Stay quiet now, Tru.
Where is your daughter?
She's not here.
Good.
This is Harper.
He'll be interviewing to replace Gardez.
And thanks for making me feel
so welcome.
It's never easy being the new guy.
That guy's going places.
Let's just hope
somewhere far, far away from here.
What's with your sister, anyway?
Ever since Mom died,
she looks over the family.
That's why she seems to have
the weight of the world on her shoulders.
There was someone else.
<i>It was your mother.</i>
What you can do...
she could do it, too.
It's the end of the line, Maggie.
Please, Nick. I promise
I won't tell anyone what I know.
You're right.
You won't.
See? That's her. That's her right there.
That's Carly Anders.
Right. It's the girl
from all those teen movies.
She put an album out, also, so....
And I care because?
Because she's gonna be
spending the day with us tomorrow.
Okay, remind me again
why some actress is coming here?
Because she's playing a morgue attendant
in her next movie...
she wants to make sure that she has
all the technical aspects of the role.
That's not what I meant. I don't get
why she's coming here, to our morgue.
A hometown girl.
<i>Her mom and eight- year- oId sister</i>
<i>Iive nearby.</i>
- Two birds with one stone, I guess.
- Okay.
Hey, what's this?
"Victim's sex, manner of death."
Well, it's personal data of everyone
that you've saved so far.
<i>I'm using it to Iook for recurring patterns</i>
<i>among wouId- be victims.</i>
So if a body comes into the morgue,
we'll know how likely it is to ask for help.
You know you're most likely to be asked
for help on Mondays and Thursdays...
that the killer is someone
that the victim is close to?
Does it say anything about my mother?
I'm not sure that I understand--
It say why she didn't tell me
about reliving days?
That she could do it, too?
I'm sure she would've,
but she ran out of time.
She must have known
there was some chance...
that she'd pass it on to her kids,
but never told us.
She never prepared us.
I mean, not one word.
I know that you're angry--
I just wish your research
could tell me that.
Not that I just won't be getting
any Mondays or Thursdays off for a while.
That's perfect.
'Cause I'll take all the Mondays I can get.
Big TV night for me.
- Is that the new schedule?
- No.
It's nothing. But I'll post the new schedule
in the morning.
Okay. Bye.
You know, Tru, I was thumbing
through the intake records this morning...
and I couldn't help but notice
you've never been on a pickup.
- That's ridiculous. I've--
- No, not one.
You're right. And that's my fault.
And I'm sorry.
And, Jack, thanks for pointing that out.
Thank you.
Any time.
All your pickups have been on relive days.
You remember?
It's like it never happened.
Do you think he heard us?
We so need a secret lair.
Help me.
$2, 200?
<i>PIease, sir, don't insuIt me, okay?</i>
<i>This is a hunk of junk.</i>
<i>What are you, out of your mind?</i>
<i>That's an insuIt.</i>
This vehicle's six years old,
has under 30, 000 miles?
<i>$2, 200 is a steaI.</i>
Yeah,"steal"
being the operative word.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Got some brewing in the office.
Sorry, I just got off the night shift.
- Oh, really? Where do you work?
- I work over at the county--
Sidebar, you and me, right now.
What did we say about sharing
personal info with the used car guy?
Once they think you've got cash,
they jack up the price.
All I said was I work the night shift.
Look, just stick to the plan.
Talking to dead people, your thing.
- Haggling, mine.
- Fine.
Yeah, she'll give you $2, 000 for it, Monty.
Not a penny more.
Deal.
I'll start the paperwork.
Coffee, right?
Why do I feel he would've gone lower
than $2, 000?
Hey, at least you got a set of wheels now.
So you can do your girly stuff
and go save dead people.
All the things that you like to do.
I gotta go. Lindsay wants to prep me
for dinner with her sister tonight.
All right.
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.
Remember, celebrities
are just like you and me, only famous...
- so try to keep it cool.
- I'll try.
Hi, you must be Davis.
Tru Davies.
Carly Anders.
And this is my assistant, Anna.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
So, this is the Standards Room,
where a body gets processed.
After being picked up from a crime scene?
That's part of a morgue attendant's job,
to retrieve the body?
Typically, yeah.
But what if there isn't a body?
What if you get to a crime scene and it
looked like a murder had taken place...
but the body was gone?
Where are you going with this?
The reason I ask is that
in the first act of this movie...
my character issues a death
certificate for a guy who vanishes...
while hiking in the mountains.
You're wondering why you'd do that
if there wasn't a body?
Exactly.
Under certain circumstances...
a coroner's office can declare a person
legally dead without a body.
It's called
a certificate of presumptive death.
Let me ask you another question.
So how'd you get into this line of work?
Well, I had an internship lined up
to help me get into med school...
and when that fell through,
I kinda ended up here.
I used to want to be a doctor
when I was a kid.
But then the acting thing took off.
You know how it is when you find
your calling. You gotta answer it.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
But, judging by your success,
it seems you made the right choice.
I'm not so sure sometimes.
I mean, all the pressure, the hours,
putting up with the media...
it gets to you after a while.
Maybe I should work here.
Dead people are much less demanding.
Actually, you'd be surprised.
Look, I know this probably seems crazy...
but, Erin, she never likes my boyfriends,
and I really want her to like you.
- Relax. She's gonna love me.
- Well, she'd better.
We both know how spotty
your track record's been lately.
- Yeah.
- Look, I'm just....
I'm really counting on you, okay?
- Jackie, what's going on, man?
- Harrison.
Excuse me.
What is up?
How are you?
You at a funeral?
Yeah. A friend of mine passed away.
I came to pay my respects.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah. Me, too.
Hi.
Jack, Lindsay. Lindsay, Jack.
Jack? Yeah, Harrison's told me
lots about you.
You know, I was about to go get a drink.
Would you guys like to join me?
I know it's early, but it's kinda been
one of those days, you know?
I actually have a ton of stuff to do
before tonight...
but if you think you can squeeze a drink in
before dinner, then....
Are you kidding?
Probably knock back three or four, huh?
But we won't.
She was really nice, Davis.
Totally down to earth.
Not at all what I expected.
Someone I could definitely hang with.
Yeah, if she wasn't going back
to Hollywood tomorrow.
It's not just that.
This whole superhero thing.
All the running around I do,
it's hard to keep the friends I have...
let alone make new ones.
Traditionally, superheroes
don't have many friends.
Just a close- knit group of allies
and confidants.
Well, I'm 22 years old, Davis.
I need more than allies and confidants.
- Hey. Can I help you?
- Yeah.
- I'm looking for Carly Anders.
- You just missed her.
Oh, shoot. I was really hoping
to catch up with her.
- Is she a friend of yours?
- We go way back.
You wouldn't know
where she was heading?
Her mom's, I think.
You could try her there.
Thanks, I will.
Well, Davis, I'll see you tomorrow.
It's been kind of a long day.
Tru, about your mother....
Maybe she never told you because she
didn't think you were ready to understand.
Well, I guess we'll never know, will we?
Bye.
Oh, no.
To new friends.
It's never easy
being the new guy in town.
I just wanted to say thanks
for making it not so hard.
Well, hey.
What's so funny, friend?
Just picturing your sister's face
when she finds out we hung out.
Yeah, don't take it personal.
You know Tru.
No, actually, I don't.
I mean, we work in the same place,
we talk every day, we work side by side...
but I can't really say I know her.
- Well, she's cool, bro.
- No doubt she is.
She's like me. Loyal.
But she is smart as hell.
And she works her tail off.
Tell me about it. She comes in off-shift...
practically memorizes the stats
of all the corpses.
That job, it's like she lives for it,
you know?
- Understatement of the year.
- What's that?
What's what?
Something about your sister
I should know?
What?
No.
<i>TaIk to me.</i>
Nice job.
- My car is a lemon.
- What?
It won't start.
Something's wrong with the engine.
We'll take it back in the morning.
Right. I'm sure Monty's Used Cars
has a real accommodating return policy.
<i>I'II figure something out,</i>
<i>I promise.</i>
- Look, right now, all I need is a ride home.
- A ride home?
Look, I'd love to help you out, Tru.
<i>But I gotta go home, get ready.</i>
If I don't look just right tonight,
Lindsay is gonna kill me.
- Whoa, you're kidding, right?
- Ask her where she is.
- Where are you?
- At the corner of Third and Ogden.
- Third and Ogden.
- Tell her I'll swing by the morgue...
and pick up the van,
be there in 20 minutes.
My man, Jack,
says he'll be there in 20 minutes.
Jack? No, I don't want a ride from Jack.
Babe, gift, horse, mouth. Need I say more?
So, you want to ride up front
or in the back?
Very funny.
Harrison sends his love, by the way.
Where were you two, anyway?
The racetrack?
- No, actually we were in a bar.
- Much better.
Why do I feel you don't want me
hanging out with your brother?
Probably because you're very perceptive.
- Harrison's a nice guy.
- Yeah, and I'd like to keep him that way.
A guy's gotta make friends somewhere.
What's that supposed to mean?
You think it's been easy for me
working in the morgue?
I try to be friendly, I try to be a good guy,
but every time I walk into a room...
you and Davis clam up,
or you change the subject, or you leave.
That has nothing to do with you.
Still, it doesn't exactly make me feel
like part of the team.
Jack, if we made you feel left out...
that's not at all what we're trying....
We would never want to....
Apology accepted.
Go for Jack.
Yeah? Yeah, I'll be right there.
Well, it's your lucky day, Davies.
You're about to go on your first pickup.
<i>Hop in.</i>
I mean, have you noticed this
crazy weather we've been having lately?
I remember it being much, much warmer
this time last year.
I know, isn't it the strangest thing?
I mean, it's late spring,
and I'm still in my midwinter wardrobe.
That is a lovely color on you, by the way.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Would you excuse me?
I'm just gonna powder my nose.
Yeah, sure.
You are doing awesome.
Come on, babe. What did you expect?
Don't answer that.
The deceased called 91 1 from her car
approximately 90 minutes ago.
Said she was being pursued by another
vehicle as she approached the bridge.
Then the line went dead.
Three guesses what happened next.
I'm gonna get the gurney. Be right back.
Okay. Do you think
she was forced off the road?
The divers found a red paint
scrape on the driver's side door.
Most likely from
the pursuing vehicle.
Who took her body out of the car?
She was already washed up on the shore
when we got here.
<i>MostIy IikeIy thrown free on impact.</i>
Jim.
Oh, no.
Carly.
Tru, I need your help.
$2, 200 for this hunk of junk?
What are you, out of your mind?
That's an insult.
Oh, boy. Here we go again.
$2, 200 is a steal.
"Steal" being
the operative word.
- I don't want it.
- Pardon?
I don't want it. I want....
I want that one.
- I thought I was doing the negotiating.
- Not today.
Little lady, I think you're mistaken.
This car is in"like new" condition.
<i>It's got at Ieast another 60, 000 miIes in it.</i>
It's got six miles in it,
and then it's gonna die.
And I'm not your little lady.
Did the day restart
so you could save a car?
I'll give you $1, 500 for that red one.
- It's listed at over $2, 000.
- $1, 500. Take it or leave it.
Deal.
Thanks, Monty.
The Carly Anders,
as in the one who's getting ready...
to come down the elevator?
Yeah.
I'm nervous around regular people,
but famous people that are about to die?
She's not gonna die, Davis.
Not if we have anything to say about it.
Who knew you would be asked
for help on Wednesdays?
Why wouldn't I be?
According to my research,
relived Wednesdays are a statistical rarity.
I was gonna make it your day off.
No more research.
Take it off your computer altogether.
Why?
Jack's been asking questions.
He thinks we're up to something.
We should be more careful,
don't you think?
- Well, what about suspects?
- There aren't any. Not yet anyway.
Find out what you can during the tour.
We need something to go on here.
Okay.
<i>And try to be cooI today.</i>
Hi. You must be Davis.
So, did you like the elevator?
What if, at the crime scene,
it looked like a murder had taken place...
but the body was gone?
Depending on the circumstances...
you'd issue a certificate
of presumptive death...
which allows the coroner
to declare a person legally dead...
- even if there's no body.
- Really?
Yeah. So, what's it like coming home
after striking it big? Is it weird?
Sure. But going home is always weird,
no matter who you are.
Yeah, but do you run into
any real jealous types?
- Here and there.
- Anyone who has any big issues with you?
Look, you seem like a real sweet person...
but I'd rather not talk
about my personal life.
Right. Of course. I was just wondering....
- Please, let's just stick to business, okay?
- Okay.
I was just gonna grab some lunch
from that diner up the street.
- Do you want anything?
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
Okay.
- Hey, Davis?
- Yeah?
Mind taking over?
I'm gonna run to the diner with Anna.
Yeah. Will you get me
a slice of chocolate....
I have a corn dog here, so it's fine.
Okay.
I've been with Carly for four years now.
Best boss I ever had.
- So you're pretty much with her 24/7, huh?
- More or less.
Then you'd know if there was someone...
who might be
holding a grudge against her?
A grudge?
Yeah. I mean, she got so famous, right?
Some people might resent that.
Everybody loves Carly.
So, you're saying you can't think of
one person who might feel otherwise?
The tabloids have a field day with her,
but Carly's tough.
One of the most determined people
I've ever met.
Really?
Her mom told me the only time
she ever took off was eight years ago...
right after a big movie.
She was 16 years old,
and on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
Finally, her mom forces her
to take a year off.
After that,
she comes back stronger than ever.
Wow.
Where's Carly?
That guy came in,
said he needed to talk to her.
I tried to stop him,
but she said it was okay.
He came looking for Carly yesterday,
but she'd left by the time he got here.
You heard anything they've been saying?
Been keeping their voices lowered.
I can't do this anymore!
I'll see you later, Carly.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
That was just an old friend.
- Didn't look too friendly to me.
- Yeah? Well, it's nothing.
- Anyway, I should be going. Is Anna....
- Pulling the car around.
You sure you don't want
to stay a bit longer?
- I could autopsy something for you.
- No, thanks.
Nice meeting you.
Yeah, you, too.
You just gonna let her leave like that?
Don't worry, I'll be right behind her.
After all, I have to return this.
Did you steal her purse?
I had to do something.
- I needed to buy myself some more time.
- For what?
To figure out how I'm gonna tell her
she's gonna die tonight.
- Relax. She's gonna love me.
- Well, she'd better.
We both know how spotty
your track record's been lately.
- Yeah.
- Look, I'm just....
I'm really counting on you, okay?
- Jackie.
- Harrison.
So, you all ready
for Lindsay's big test tonight?
Oh, the test? No, no.
It's, you know, it's....
Dinner. Right.
You're a braver man than I am, Harrison.
But, hey, if I would've played it safe...
maybe I wouldn't be pushing 30
and all alone.
No, safe? No. It's....
Me and Lindsay? We click.
- You know what I'm saying, man?
- I stand corrected.
The truth is, I envy you, man.
You have what every guy wants...
whether he's man enough
to admit it or not.
To you and Lindsay.
Me and Lindsay.
You must be Carly's sister.
- Are you a reporter?
- No. My name's Tru.
- Swear you're not a reporter?
- Swear.
Oh, Tru.
Hey, your sister's adorable.
She looks just like you.
- How can I help you?
- You left this at the morgue.
- Wanted to return it before you left town.
- Thanks.
I wanted to talk about the guy
that came to the morgue today.
- Peter?
- Yeah, you two seemed pretty worked up.
- I don't see how that's your business.
- It's not, but....
- Listen, I'm worried about you.
- Why?
Because I have a bad feeling.
- So, what, you're psychic now?
- No.
Look, you've been asking
strange questions all day.
Thanks for dropping off my purse,
but you should go now.
If you're in trouble, maybe I can help.
I don't even know you.
No, not yet.
But if you just gave me a chance--
- We'd be the best of friends.
- Carly, please, I'm just....
Look, come near me or my family again,
and I'm calling the police.
Yo, thanks again, bro.
We should do this again sometime.
We should.
About what I said back in the bar....
No, don't worry about it.
No, I've just lost too many buddies
to wives and kids.
I don't want to lose another one.
You keep picking up that tab,
there ain't no chance of that.
All right.
Need a lift?
No, man. It's a nice day.
I'm gonna walk. Good luck tonight.
Thanks again, man.
Leave the key in the lock.
Step away from the car.
All right, buddy. Take it easy, man.
Take it easy, okay? Be cool. All right?
No problem.
Hang onto your keys, Harrison.
- No, you did not just say that.
- I'm afraid I did.
- Jack? Jack, just....
- Keys!
It's your car, not his.
Shut up!
When a guy with a gun asks for keys,
you hand the keys to him.
That's how it works.
Not this time.
The only way this guy's gonna get your car
is if you give it to him.
Because he certainly doesn't
have the stones to do it on his own.
If he did, we'd be dead already,
and he'd be nothing but a set of taillights.
- You sure about that?
- Oh, yeah.
Look, the car is a piece of crap, man.
It ain't worth it, okay?
Five seconds, your boy here's dead.
Jack, come on, man.
Five.
Come on, Jack.
It ain't worth it, Jack.
Four.
Come on, Jack! Hey!
Three.
Jack, man, come on!
- It's okay, Harrison.
- Two.
Let me give him the keys, man! Jack!
No!
One.
Bang.
What the hell was that, man?
This was a mistake.
She won't even talk to me now.
She just doesn't understand you.
<i>WeII, we were totaIIy cooI yesterday.</i>
And now, thanks to my gift,
she thinks I'm a psycho.
Which, to be completely honest,
I can't blame her.
- All that matters now is saving her life.
- Yeah, I know. It's just....
Sooner or later,
this gig is gonna cost me all my friends.
Tru, a hero's journey is treacherous.
Yeah, treachery I can deal with.
But being alone kinda sucks.
I'm guessing you weren't able
to find anything out...
- about the guy she was arguing with?
- No, just a name. Peter.
<i>Angry ex or something?</i>
Sounds about right.
- So, what's the plan now?
- Well, stick close to Carly...
and see what happens,
and pray she doesn't see me.
Why don't I meet you
and keep you company?
Davis, you don't have to do that.
<i>No, I want to, because....</i>
Tru, you're not alone.
- Thanks.
- I'll see you.
You okay?
- Do I look like a guy who's okay?
- You look like a guy who's still got his car.
Oh, my God.
What?
- He was gonna kill you, man.
- But he didn't.
Look, I am all about standing up
for what's yours.
But that was....
What, you got some kind of death wish?
Harrison, death isn't something
you have to wish for. It's coming anyway.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- Can I make a confession?
- Sure.
I lied to you...
before, when I said that an old friend
of mine had passed away.
I was at a funeral,
but I didn't know the person who died.
Did you go to the wrong church, what?
No. Just something I like to do.
- Go to strangers' funerals?
- Yeah.
- For what, kicks?
- No.
For clarity.
Right. Jeez.
I go to remind myself
that death is inevitable.
Death is part of life.
And as soon as you understand that,
you're free.
You can do anything you want.
So, is that what you meant earlier,
when you were you were talking about...
playing it safe with Lindsay?
Lindsay?
Look, I'm sure Lindsay's a great girl.
But the problem with great girls is,
they want great lives.
They want a house with
a white picket fence and 2. 5 kids...
playing in the yard.
I don't know you that well...
but you strike me as a guy
who wants more than that.
Who needs more than that.
More freedom. More fun.
More life.
Whoa, there's more here
than what I asked for.
Consider it a severance package.
That's not how our arrangement works.
You see, I ask you for money,
you get it to me...
whether it's today, tomorrow,
or a year from now.
I've honored that arrangement
for eight years.
I think that's long enough.
Not for me. I mean, I appreciate the bonus.
But you will be hearing from me again.
Count on it.
Why didn't you tell me
about your arrangement?
- And you are?
- Someone who cares about Carly.
She said you were an old friend...
but you look more
like an extortionist to me.
Actually, I'm a reporter for the <i>Sun- Times.</i>
What you just saw was an interview
for a story, nothing more.
She paid you off to keep quiet
about something...
- that happened eight years ago.
- I can neither confirm nor deny.
Look, what was it, Peter?
What happened back then?
Her mom told me the only time
she ever took off was eight years ago.
<i>Your sister's adorabIe.</i>
<i>She Iooks just Iike you.</i>
It's lsabelle.
She's not Carly's sister.
She's her daughter.
Whatever it is you're planning tonight,
you can forget it.
Because if you hurt Carly,
I'm going to the police.
Are you kidding?
Carly's little secret
helped pay for my summer home.
The last thing I'd ever do is hurt her.
Are we done here?
Carly's younger sister
is really her daughter?
<i>What a scandaI.</i>
<i>You don't think the reporter's the kiIIer?</i>
- No, Carly's worth too much to him alive.
- If not him, then who?
<i>I'm back at CarIy's</i>
<i>trying to figure that out.</i>
I can't believe you did that!
Look at it!
According to your spreadsheet,
there's a probability...
that the killer's someone
close to the victim?
Right.
Who's closer to Carly than Anna?
Just leave me alone.
Hey, what's up?
You were supposed to be here
two hours ago.
- Where the hell have you been?
- I lost track of time. No biggie.
Actually, no, it is a biggie.
I told you that this was important to me.
Well, I'm here now.
- So, where's the big sis?
- She left.
Her loss, right?
Why are you acting like this?
I don't know.
Why are you acting so clingy?
What?
- Exactly what Jack was talking about.
- Jack?
What does he have to do with us, huh?
You know, sometimes I'm gonna be late.
Sometimes I might not show up at all.
That's just something
you're gonna have to deal with.
That's just something
you're gonna have to deal with.
No, I won't.
Because if you're feeling tied down...
then by all means,
consider yourself untied.
Whatever.
We're through.
Anna?
Tru, what are you doing here?
Carly had a few more questions
about the morgue, asked me to stop by.
- Is everything okay with you two?
- Honestly? No.
Why, what happened?
I asked Carly if I could borrow her car
to run some errands...
while she's at her mom's. She says fine.
I get in a fender- bender while I'm out,
and she throws a fit.
You were in an accident?
I was pulling out of a spot when
this other car just crunched the door...
and left a nasty red paint scrape.
But so what? It's just a rental.
Sorry.
Hello?
Good. You made it.
- Anna was in an accident in Carly's car.
- What?
A red car crashed
into the driver's side door.
If the damage was before
she drove to the bridge....
Maybe she wasn't forced off the road.
- Maybe she drove off the bridge herself.
- Suicide? No way.
The police said that Carly called 91 1
saying someone was following her.
Why would she do that
if she was planning suicide?
- Someone killed her, I know it.
- But who and why?
Carly.
But that can't be right.
It doesn't make any sense.
Fine. Yeah, I'll call you back
after I talk to her. Bye.
- Is everything okay?
- That was Carly's agent.
And according to him,
there is no morgue movie.
What?
The movie about the morgue attendant
doesn't exist.
Her next project's
supposed to be a romantic comedy.
If there's no movie,
why spend the day with me and Tru?
I was just wondering the same thing.
Hello?
Carly lied to us.
There never even was a morgue movie.
- What?
- It doesn't exist. She made it up.
Why would she come to the morgue?
Why would she ask us all those questions?
What if you get to a crime scene and
it looked like a murder had taken place...
but the body was gone?
Davis, this may sound crazy, but I think
she's trying to fake her own death.
- What did you say?
- Both days she asked what happens...
if I got to a crime scene
and there was no body.
She needs to be sure the missing person
would still be declared legally dead.
Why?
<i>Because that was her pIan.</i>
Fake her own death and disappear.
That's why she spent the day with us.
She wanted to get the details right,
so no one would catch on.
She had everything.
Why would she do something like that?
Think about what the last eight
years have been like for her.
<i>Knowing her secret</i>
<i>couId come out at any time.</i>
She must have had enough. Probably
thought this was the only way out.
If you're right, then Carly wasn't
forced off the bridge by another car.
<i>- And that caII to 91 1....</i>
- Also fake.
There's just one problem.
Carly didn't fake her death yesterday.
She actually died, otherwise the day
wouldn't have restarted.
Something must have gone wrong.
Something she didn't plan for.
Well, whatever that something is,
you have to get there before it happens.
Oh, my God.
I need help! You have to come
now! Someone's following me!
I can't get away! Please hurry!
What?
Carly, listen to me.
What are you even doing here?
I know what you're planning,
and it isn't gonna work.
It will, as long as you don't tell anyone.
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Please, just leave me alone.
Carly, I....
Watch out!
The SUV hit you yesterday.
That's how you got in the water.
That's how you died.
Died? What are you talking about?
I know why you did it, Carly.
I know about lsabelle...
- that she's your daughter.
- How?
I figured it out.
I thought that if word got out,
my career would be over.
So, you covered it up for eight years?
You don't know what it's like, Tru...
to have a secret
people are trying to expose.
Actually, I do.
Because I have a secret, too, you know.
There have been times
where I wanted to run away...
pretend it wasn't a part of me.
But I don't,
because there's someone's life at stake.
- Whose?
- Tonight it was yours.
Someday, someone
would have exposed us, I know that.
It's no way to live,
waking up each morning...
wondering if today's the day
the story finally comes out.
That's why I finally told lsabelle
the truth a few months ago.
That was the hardest thing
I ever had to do.
It took her some time,
but she's okay with it now.
She wants us to be together,
start a new life.
By faking your death?
Look, I'm leaving the country tonight,
and I'm taking lsabelle with me.
I didn't want to go to this extreme, Tru.
I tried to buy my way out today.
Pay off the one person
who knew the truth about lsabelle.
But he wasn't about to let the story die.
So I had to go to my backup plan.
If she's okay with you being her mother...
then why go to all this trouble?
Why not just come clean?
You think the tabloids
would ever leave her alone?
Ever let her have a life?
I'm sorry if you can't get away
from your secret, Tru.
But please, I need to get away from mine.
I thought you had that thing
with Lindsay and her sister.
I did, yeah. It didn't go exactly as planned.
She ended it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I should've seen it coming, you know?
She gives me chance after chance,
and, you know, I screw up.
That's what I do. I screw up.
I know it must be hard,
losing a girl like Lindsay, but...
maybe it's for the best, you know?
I mean, all these chances
you keep talking about...
did it ever occur to you
that maybe they were chances for her?
Chances for her to change you?
Real friends don't do that, man.
Friends accept you for who you are...
appreciate you for who you are.
Yeah, I guess, you know?
No, don't guess, Harrison.
Know.
Now, I know I haven't known you
for very long, but I'm your friend, man.
No matter what.
- Duty calls. I'll see you soon, yeah?
- Thanks, man.
- Are you sure about this?
- Don't have to be.
I can't say it's my choice,
but it's Carly's life.
She can do what she wants.
Well, there's a lot of ways
to help people, I guess.
Some people need help living, some dying,
some a little bit of both.
I think I finally understand now.
She did it to protect her daughter.
Well, here's hoping
that Carly pulls it off.
Actually, I wasn't talking about her.
I was talking about my mother.
I don't get it.
Why would they call
and bring us all the way down here...
if there's no body to pick up?
Must've jumped the gun
when they found the car.
- Probably figured the body was still in it.
- The currents must have washed it away.
We may never find it.
I'll see you two back at the office.
It's too bad.
Your first pickup and no body.
Go figure.
Poor Carly Anders.
She had a lot to live for.
It's funny how life works, huh?
One day you're here,
the next day you're not.
Well, wherever she is tonight...
I'm sure it's a better place.
Hey, Mom.
I know it's been a while,
but I've been busy.
I guess nobody would understand that
better than you.
But I'll be back soon, Mom.
I promise.
<i>PreviousIy on</i> Tru Calling:
Anyway, I just wanted to say welcome.
I'm Tru.
Jack.
A couple of years ago...
I died.
And then, I came back.
Some would say once you survive
something like that...
that you were brought back for a reason.
I guess we'll see.
How did it go with Jack?
I just can't get a read on him,
for some reason.
One minute he's in your face
and almost obnoxious.
The next, he's charming,
trying to be your best friend.
Leave the key. Step away from the car.
Hang on to your keys, Harrison.
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.
What, you got some kind of death wish?
Death isn't something
you have to wish for. It's coming anyway.
Death is part of life.
Someone stopped us from saving her.
But that doesn't make any sense.
<i>So you ended up ordering takeout?</i>
<i>What did you get?</i>
Moo Shu pork.
<i>Nice choice. With the pancakes?</i>
No, straight from the box. You?
I'm just digging into a rack of lamb
with some garlic mashed potatoes.
Cereal again?
<i>Yeah.</i>
The doctor says I'm fiber- poor.
So what are you doing tonight?
You know, the usual.
Nothing?
Exactly.
Look, me being alone on a Friday night
is one thing...
but you, on the other hand....
With my life,
it's rejuvenating to have a night off.
And besides, I told you. I'm between exes.
What?
It's okay to say that you miss someone.
Luc? Why would you say that I miss Luc?
I didn't say Luc. You said Luc.
Yeah, well--
<i>The way I see it is,</i>
<i>just because we're aIone...</i>
<i>doesn't mean that we're IoneIy.</i>
So by that reasoning, you'd argue
that my neighbor across the way?
She looks like
she's having the time of her life.
<i>She's probabIy miserabIe.</i>
Gotta tell you, Davis,
it sure seems like she's having fun to me.
<i>Trust me.</i>
<i>Nothing is ever exactIy what it seems.</i>
Listen, I've got to go.
The <i>Outer Limits</i> marathon
is about to start.
I'll let you go.
<i>Tru, for what it's worth...</i>
I happen to think that you have
a pretty exciting life, you know?
Time travel...
<i>saving Iives, pretty cooI boss.</i>
Yeah. Good night, Davis.
Good night, Tru.
<i>Leave me a message, I'II caII you back.</i>
Consider this a warning.
You can make all the trouble you want...
but it's only a matter of time
before I find you.
And when I do, let's just say
there won't be a second warning.
Help me.
Delivery!
Coming.
4B, not 3B.
Four, as in upstairs!
Tru? Hey.
I haven't seen you around much.
I thought you moved.
No, I've just been working
some weird hours lately.
But the delivery man
left this at my door by accident.
Cool. Thanks.
Hey, Tru!
Can I get your advice on something?
Sure.
There is this girl.
And she lives nearby...
and she is amazing.
Right.
She's always busy
running around all over town...
but whenever I see her,
she just makes me want to smile.
I see.
Yeah, and, well...
I've been wanting
to ask her out for a while...
but I'm afraid that if she says no,
things will get weird.
You know, on account of us
being neighbors.
Yeah.
I would advise you...
to first make sure that she's ready to date.
And after that, I would take things slow.
Right. Yeah. Slow.
Very slow, you know?
Okay. Makes sense.
- Okay. Thank you.
- No problem.
Just the morgue attendant
I was looking for.
I'll bet you say that to all the girls.
Remember I told you
I was looking for a new apartment?
I found the perfect one- bedroom.
It's close to work, utilities included.
- Congrats.
- I haven't signed the lease yet...
- 'cause I wanted to run it by you first.
- Me, why?
The thing is, it's in the building
across the street from yours...
and I didn't want you feeling crowded
or anything.
So I figured I should check with you.
Are you kidding? You should jump on it.
Places in my neighborhood
are so hard to find.
Morning, gang.
Hey, you got your state license forms.
Davis only called me three times
to remind me.
So you're sure about this?
Positive. It'll be so nice
to have a friend across the street.
- Guess I got a lease to sign.
- Sweet.
See you.
Okay, bye.
Signed and dated. Perfect.
You put the morgue
as your mailing address.
I hope that's okay.
I've been staying at a friend's place
since I moved here.
- Figured this was the best place to get me.
- Not a problem.
As a matter of fact,
you got some mail this morning.
Here it is.
The Schenkman Center.
That's an impressive facility.
Yeah, one of the best in the country.
Were you there long?
I don't remember it being on your résumé.
It was a long time ago.
I didn't think it was relevant.
Did you ever run into a guy
named Tom Forrester?
An old college buddy of mine.
We used to play D&D on the weekends.
We called him Wizard.
Forrester. Yeah, sure. Big fella.
Hell of a guy.
Yeah.
Good old Wizard. I wonder what he's....
I should give him a call.
So the meet's at noon.
High noon.
Don't be so dramatic.
It's the first time me and Lindsay
are seeing each other since the breakup.
We're exchanging stuff.
How is that not dramatic?
Look, I want you both to be happy.
But the truth is,
it's not so bad being single.
Who are you kidding? Not me.
And you've been busted up
since you and Luc split.
That's just not true.
Yeah?
And what's your love life now?
Talking on the phone with Davis all day?
Telling me your upstairs neighbor
has a crush on you?
You're pleasant today.
You're right, I'm sorry.
I'm just nervous.
Anyway, I got to get going.
Whose turn is it?
You ask that like we actually take turns.
Yeah, well, I'll get the next one.
I'll hold my breath.
I don't care. You listen to me,
for the last time, leave me alone.
My neighbor looks like
she's having the time of her life.
Some guys won't take no for an answer.
Well, try saying yes.
Yes, you're a psycho.
Yes, I was right to break up with you.
I'll have to remember that.
You look familiar. Have we met?
No, but I've seen you
around the neighborhood.
Thanks, Chris.
- I'm Tru Davies.
- Chris Barronson.
- Always nice to put a name with a face.
- Absolutely.
- Thanks. Take care.
- Bye.
One Motley Crue concert tee.
One deck of naked lady cards.
Two eggs of Silly Putty.
And 13 assorted comic books.
I've been looking for these.
All right, where's my stuff?
That's it?
Yeah, I turned my place upside down...
and that is all I could find.
That's not even mine.
Yeah, well, uh...
Look, the reason I asked you
to meet me here today...
is because I wanted to
look you in the eye...
into those eyes...
and tell you that I want you back.
What?
Just give me one more chance,
that's all I'm asking for.
No, I've given you, like, 50 chances...
and you blew every single one of them.
You're just too self- absorbed to know it.
And you're the perfect girlfriend, right?
What?
You're so needy. And demanding.
You always order
the most expensive thing on the menu...
when you knew I couldn't afford it.
Right?
Hmm?
Take care of yourself, Harrison.
When will I learn to shut my mouth?
Hi. Tom Forrester, please.
Hi, Wiz?
Hi, it's Gothar, the Elf King.
Yeah. Davis.
Yeah. Listen, turns out
we have a friend in common.
Jack Harper.
Yeah, he used to work with you
at Schenkman.
Mmm- Hmm.
Really?
Hello?
So your brother and I
are officially through.
Can't say I'm surprised, but I'm so sorry.
<i>He made this sad, Iast- ditch</i>
<i>attempt to patch things up.</i>
<i>And when I said no,</i>
<i>he caIIed me needy and demanding.</i>
<i>Can you beIieve that?</i>
Hello, Tru, you there?
<i>Yeah, sorry, I just....</i>
There's this couple across the building
and they're having this nasty fight.
<i>Are they stiII going at it?</i>
I can't tell.
They just turned the lights off.
One guess. Makeup sex.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Anyway, Linds, I got to get to work.
Fine. I'll talk to you later, okay?
<i>Okay.</i>
lncoming.
<i>Hey, Tru?</i>
I thought you said
your neighborhood was getting better?
It is.
I've got a homicide here
that might disagree.
You picked this up near my place?
A building across the street,
if I'm not mistaken.
Victim's name is Chris Barronson,
died from massive head trauma.
Chris Barronson?
Friend of yours?
No, we just met. Today.
- You sure you want to see this?
- Yeah.
That's not Chris Barronson.
- It's what his lD said.
- No, Chris is a girl.
I saw this guy at her place earlier tonight.
He was furious about something.
You know, the cops said something about
thinking the killer was a woman.
Bag this, will you?
Two people, same name, same apartment?
- It's either coincidence...
- Doubtful.
...or our buddy here's been up to no good.
Hi, Tru.
I thought you were home for the night.
- I was, but--
- Couldn't stay away?
Actually, if you have a moment?
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Can it wait?
It's actually important. We need to talk.
Tru, go ahead. I got this.
- Tru?
- Yeah. Okay, I'm coming.
Please save me.
Delivery!
Delivery!
Wait! Hold on!
You've got the wrong apartment!
Even when you relive days
they still get away.
So your neighbor and victim
have the same name?
He's dead and she's the prime suspect?
Yep. But it wouldn't be any fun
if it were easy.
Okay, well, here's a theory.
Could be identity theft.
He took her identity
and she killed him for it.
ldentity theft is on the rise.
They're either stealing it online...
or taking a picture of your credit card
with a cell phone.
She seemed so normal.
It's hard to imagine her killing anyone.
People can do a lot of things
in self- defense.
Especially when they're pushed
past their limit.
For the last time, leave me alone.
- Maybe you're right.
- Hi, Jack.
Sorry to interrupt. I just wanted
to drop off my state license forms.
Super. Thanks.
Hey.
Hi.
We were just going over
the new intake procedure.
Cool. You mind if I check the mail?
Unfortunately, this is the only address
most people have for me.
- No, go ahead.
- Thanks.
Tru, about the new intake procedure.
Were there any other clues
about the victim's real identity?
He had a pen with a logo on it.
It was a sunburst with a capital"A" inside.
Probably from his work. I'll look into it.
An identity thief with a day job.
All the better to meet new victims.
I got to get going.
Chris will be at the diner any minute.
Okay. I'll call you if anything comes up.
There was something else...
you wanted to tell me
right before the day rewound.
- I did?
- You said it was important.
No clue. Too bad I don't relive days.
But look on the bright side.
If you don't change
too many things today...
then we'll have
the same conversation tonight.
Here's hoping.
Yeah. A redo day.
I get it. No time for breakfast.
But considering you're 24 hours
ahead of me...
<i>what happened with Lindsay yesterday?</i>
Do you want my advice?
Save the sit- down for another day.
Another week even.
Man. It was that bad?
Put it this way: Yeah.
All right. Thanks for the heads up.
Too bad you're blowing off breakfast
'cause I would've picked up the tab today.
It must be nice living in your world, Harry.
Jack, is Tru around?
- You just missed her, man.
- Damn.
I needed to ask her something.
There's kind of a time factor.
She should be on her cell.
No, this is one of those things
that's best to do in person.
Make sure she means what she says.
You mean women don't always say
what they actually mean?
Not the ones I fall for.
See you, man.
Yeah.
<i>You're finished. The fun is over.</i>
For the last time, leave me alone.
Coffee, please.
Some guys,
they just can't take no for an answer.
- Ex- boyfriend?
- It's sort of a long story.
Thanks, Chris.
You know, you look familiar.
You don't live on York by any chance?
Yeah, I do.
- Same here. I'm Tru Davies.
- Chris Barronson.
It's always nice to put a name with a face.
Chris Barronson.
Yeah. Have you heard of me?
Sort of. There was this guy
outside your building this morning...
asking all these questions about you.
He seemed pretty belligerent.
About 6', dark brown hair?
Same guy who just can't take no
for an answer?
Only he's not an ex.
Well, it's nothing I should get into.
If you're heading home,
I could walk with you.
You know, in case he's still around.
- Okay.
- Okay.
It was six months ago...
when I found out he'd stolen my identity.
I was applying for a loan,
and the bank ran a credit check.
They found 10 different credit cards
in my name.
He'd used them to run up
nearly $60, 000 in charges.
And now he's threatening you?
- Because I went to the police.
- No arrest?
lD theft's tricky to prosecute.
You need absolute proof,
which I don't have.
But it's getting worse because now I feel
like someone's been watching me.
That's creepy.
Any idea how this all started?
No, but there's a million ways.
If you don't have a shredder, a firewall...
a digitally scrambled phone...
you may as well have a sign up saying:
Ruin my life.
Anyway, thanks for the company.
And do me a favor,
if you see that guy again...
just say I moved or something.
No problem.
Because if I run into him,
there's no telling what might happen.
- Jack?
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
Moving in.
You're kidding?
No. I saw the"For Rent" sign
and snapped it up.
Lucky for me.
The guy who was supposed to take it...
missed the deadline'cause he had to
run it by his girlfriend or something.
The thing is, it's in the building
across the street from yours...
and I didn't want you feeling crowded.
But his loss is my gain.
Third floor, great view. Unbelievable.
So I've heard.
I got to get started with
the packing process. I'll see you later on.
Tru, your friend, who I just met.
She wouldn't happen to be single,
would she?
I'm not sure a new guy
is what she needs right now.
Besides, a word of advice.
Girls don't appreciate
being hit on by their neighbors.
We need to find
some more interesting neighbors.
Maybe you need to find
some less desperate tenants.
Look, she's having guy trouble right now.
A bad breakup?
Not exactly.
All right. Fine. Don't tell me.
I'll find out on my own soon enough.
Hey, wait.
The truth is, there's this guy
that's been harassing her...
and the last thing she needs is--
- Two.
- Yeah.
Enough said.
Okay.
You know, Tru...
if that other guy really is a problem,
I wouldn't mind keeping an eye on her.
I know you think I'm heartless...
but I have been known to show an interest
in people other than myself.
Thanks, but I've got it under control.
I'd expect no less.
Hello.
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>
I found your logo and your identity thief.
Really?
It's a company called Advantix.
They sell medical equipment.
And there is a salesman there
by the name of Chris Barronson.
Did you get an address?
Don't need to. He's coming to the morgue
in 20 minutes to make a presentation.
You made an appointment with the guy?
I told him we weren't happy
with our current distributor.
You're always chasing the bad guy.
<i>Why not make them come to you for once?</i>
Nice, D. I'll see you in 20.
<i>Okay.</i>
This is my colleague, Tru.
This is Chris Barronson.
Please save me.
This is my first sales call to a morgue.
Most of our equipment's designed
to keep the patient out of a place like this.
Everyone passes through sooner or later.
Right.
Anyway, let me show you guys
what might be useful.
Had this job long, Mr. Barronson?
Eight, nine months. Why?
Does it pay well?
Only if you buy what I sell.
I guess you don't sell that much.
All right. Who are you people?
I think who you are is the bigger question.
What?
We know who the real Chris Barronson is
and you are not her.
And it's only a matter of time
before the police figure that out.
Right. She's good.
I'll give her that.
She pulled a fast one on you guys.
- I don't think you get it.
- No, I do. You don't get it.
All right, the police are on my side.
Except they're too inept
to do anything about it.
Look, I'm the real Chris Barronson, okay?
Here, see?
All right? She stole my identity.
And if you guys know who she is...
you'd better talk some sense into her
before I find her myself.
The DMV has his picture on file
back to the early'90s.
The state police confirm
there were six identity theft reports...
filed by a man named Chris Barronson.
Looks like he's the real deal.
Which means
the girl you met in the diner isn't.
She probably gave me that name...
because it was on the credit card
she was using.
I've spent the day helping a con woman...
while the guy who needs help
wants nothing to do with me.
Helping the criminal may be
the only way to help the victim.
Since the real Chris won't talk to you,
focus on the fake one.
See if you can't keep her
from committing a murder today.
Right.
Hello.
<i>It's Jack.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>
Your friend's on the move.
She left the building?
<i>But don't worry.</i>
I'm keeping an eye on her.
<i>You foIIowed her?</i>
You seemed worried about her.
Thought I was doing you a favor.
<i>Where is she now?</i>
She's headed back
into your neighborhood.
But about an hour ago,
she was in a jewelry store downtown.
Did she buy anything?
Yeah, a necklace.
But she didn't keep it long.
She walked six blocks to a pawnshop...
and sold it for half of what
she just paid for it. Crazy.
<i>She's aImost home now.</i>
She's all yours. I got some errands to run.
Wait, Jack?
You got to let me hang up
so you can miss me.
Cute, but, no.
You followed her.
I can't help wondering why.
She looked like she might be in trouble.
And aside from a little white- collar crime,
she's harmless.
Just be careful.
She's not exactly who she seems.
Who is?
- Jack is following her?
- He was trying to help.
Listen, I want you to take this
before you go.
It's the name and the number
of the cop I talked to, just in case.
Who's Tom Forrester?
He's an old college buddy of mine,
but I haven't talked to him in years. Why?
Yesterday, you had a note to call him.
Remember to find out
what it is you want to tell me.
We have to keep the days
as similar as possible.
Okay. I'll give him a ring.
He's a hell of a guy.
Great Dungeon Master.
God, did I just say that out loud?
Harrison.
Look, about today, I....
<i>Let me guess.</i>
<i>Not gonna work for you.</i>
No, not so much.
You lost all my stuff, didn't you?
No. It's not that. It's just....
It just isn't the best day for it.
Why not?
Well, because, I got to....
It just isn't. Okay?
Fine. Whatever. We'll just do it tomorrow,
same time, same place.
I'll be there. I promise.
<i>Yeah. Bye.</i>
You better be right about this, Tru.
Excuse me, miss?
I didn't want you to forget this.
- Randall?
- Lindsay?
My God.
Feel like telling me who you really are?
I already told you. I'm Chris Barronson.
Look, don't bother. I know you're not.
I know you've been buying jewelry...
with someone else's credit card
and pawning it off for quick cash.
How did you know that?
It doesn't really matter.
It's just time for you to stop.
Just give this guy, Chris, his life back.
I will. Someday.
Someday isn't soon enough.
Trust me on this.
I don't trust anyone.
That's why I'm so good at what I do.
Stay out of it, Tru.
You're in over your head.
Hey, Tru. What a nice surprise.
How's it going?
Good, thanks.
I got a package for you delivered to me
inadvertently this morning.
Do you want to come up and....
There's this girl.
Right.
I've been wanting to ask her out.
You know what? I'll just drop it off later.
I'll save you the time, okay?
I'd be happy to come by.
I'd love to see your place.
- I'm actually just in a hurry, so....
- Okay.
Can I ask you one question?
Sorry, I'm in the middle of something.
But I'll catch up with you later, okay?
<i>What is she doing now?</i>
Looks like she's packing.
<i>What is she doing now?</i>
Looks like she's packing.
<i>That's good.</i>
<i>Maybe you spooked her enough...</i>
<i>so she'II be gone by the time</i>
<i>the reaI Chris Barronson shows up.</i>
Maybe, but we can't count on it.
- I talked to Tom Forrester, by the way.
- And?
He told me about his wife and his kids...
and his research
after leaving the Schenkman Center.
But it's certainly nothing
I need to discuss with you.
It was worth a shot.
<i>You don't think</i>
<i>that the important thing...</i>
has anything to do with the kidney stone
I passed last week, do you?
Okay, probably not. I'll keep looking.
I know you think you can handle this,
but you're the one in over her head.
<i>It'II onIy get worse.</i>
<i>Running won't soIve anything.</i>
Let me help you
or I'll tell the police where to find you.
It's your choice.
It was just so easy, you know?
Like free money.
And at first, I only did it to get by.
But now, it's....
God, you got to believe me.
I had no idea it would go this far.
Okay. But it has.
And now we have to do
something about it.
I'm scared.
The messages
this guy's been leaving for me.
What if I paid him back?
Do you think he would still
turn me in to the police?
You can pay him back?
Yeah, I could give him cash.
Really? You have that much money?
I told you, I was good.
If only that were something to be proud of.
You. You turned my life upside down.
She wants to make amends.
That's why I called.
Sure, now that I know where to find her.
- I'm so sorry.
- You're sorry?
- I'm so sorry.
- You're sorry?
- No, I really am.
- Sorry doesn't cover it.
Here. Maybe this will.
It's the least I can do
with you giving me a second chance.
I almost forgot. Here.
The credit card I took out
in your name.
If I ever hear from you again,
or if I see you--
You won't. I promise.
Fine.
I have a phone call to make.
And you?
You should be gone when I get back.
Thanks, Tru.
I know you probably don't care...
but my real name is Cathy.
It's nice to meet you, Cathy.
Here, let me get this.
No, I got it.
This one's on me.
Thank you again for everything.
Hey.
You caught me using a city vehicle
for personal business.
What vehicle?
I want to thank you
for helping me out today.
It's nothing
you wouldn't have done for me. Thanks.
Still, I mean you took it upon yourself
to look out for someone...
I told you was in trouble,
no questions asked.
Should I have asked some?
I can't help thinking most people would.
Whatever's going on
between you and your friend...
it's none of my business.
- It's never stopped you before.
- All right, fine.
Tell me.
And if I don't?
I'll ply you with alcohol
and pry it out of you.
Right.
Or you'll owe me one.
Lock up the van for me, will you?
- Keys?
- They must be inside.
- I talked to Tom Forrester.
- And?
He told me about his research
after leaving the Schenkman Center.
Here you go.
I guess you can lock up yourself.
Hey.
Hey.
Could I get a roast beef sandwich to go?
Sure thing.
- Nothing smaller?
- No, not tonight.
I'm sorry, but this bill's a fake.
You got to be kidding me.
You said your friend Tom
worked at the Schenkman Center, right?
Did you mention Jack
when you spoke to him?
No, why would I?
Jack had a letter
from the Schenkman Center in his coat.
I bet you found it first yesterday.
Why don't I give Tom another call?
Yeah, just let me know
what he says, okay?
Here we go again.
Lock yourself out?
Yeah, it happens to me
at least once a week.
Here, I'm sorry. I'm the new tenant.
I appreciate it.
You bet.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Matt?
Now I feel like someone's
been watching me.
There is this girl.
And she lives nearby.
Chris.
<i>What is he doing?</i>
Matt?
Come on.
<i>HeIIo?</i>
Jack, it's Tru! I need to get in.
Hey, Tru. What are you doing
on this side of the street?
Please, Jack, I need to
get into Cathy's apartment right away.
Cathy? Who's Cathy?
Chris. Chris is Cathy.
The girl that you followed.
- Please, Jack, hurry!
- Okay.
<i>Let me just try and figure this thing out.</i>
<i>It's trickier than I thought.</i>
<i>Did that do it?</i>
Thanks. Excuse me.
<i>Tru, did that do it?</i>
Tru?
Tru?
I'm telling you, stay away from her!
She's a nice girl!
Put it down, Matt.
He broke into her apartment!
He wants to hurt her!
I know you want to protect her,
but you don't know anything about her!
Yes, I do! I watched her every single day
since she moved in.
I know her better than anyone.
No, she's not who you think.
Look, she's a thief.
She stole this man's identity.
No. She can't be. She's perfect!
She would never do that!
It's okay, Matt.
You're not the only one that she's fooled.
But I'm telling you the truth.
She's stolen thousands of dollars.
She's ruined people's lives.
She's a thief?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Why did you come here?
I thought that we had an agreement.
Yeah, we did.
Till I found out
that the money she gave me was fake.
Now she's gone, I'm still broke...
and I'm probably
never gonna see her again.
You never know.
Stranger things have happened.
I don't understand what's taking so long.
It's been 45 minutes already.
I'm very sorry.
Did my card not go through?
The card number's fine,
but our computer's down.
Just give us another minute,
we'll get you all sorted out, Miss Davies.
Heading out of town, Tru?
You know, it's a good thing
I don't believe every sob story I hear.
Mine, for example?
You almost had me.
But then you absolutely blew it
back there at the diner.
This one's on me.
You pulled out your camera cell phone
the second I put my credit card down.
All I had to do
was call the credit card company...
and report a stolen credit card.
I knew you had the number,
but I was hoping that you wouldn't use it.
Then I got the call.
<i>Miss, there's activity reported</i>
<i>on your credit card at A vaIon Car RentaI.</i>
Thank you.
Is it too late for me to explain?
To me? Yeah.
But I know a couple of guys
who'd be happy to listen.
Really, you had a good day?
<i>It was the best, Tru.</i>
The perfect afternoon
with the perfect guy.
Wait, you were with my brother?
No. Harrison was his usual self.
Called to cancel after I was already there.
But that's how I spotted Randall.
Randall?
I met him a few years ago
when I was studying abroad.
<i>He's actuaIIy in town for a few weeks</i>
<i>and he's a totaI opposite of your brother.</i>
Well, lucky break.
Just when I was starting to think
they didn't make them like this anymore.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Good night, Tru.
<i>Hey, it's Luc.</i>
<i>I couIdn't get to the phone right now.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>
Hey, Luc, it's me, Tru.
I heard through the grapevine...
<i>that you missed out on that apartment</i>
<i>across the street...</i>
<i>and I just wanted to caII</i>
<i>and say that I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I know that we're not together anymore...</i>
but it would've been nice to be neighbors.
Just to know you were close.
<i>I'II taIk to you soon. I just wanted to caII.</i>
Okay, bye.
Luc?
No, Tru. It's me, I'm sorry.
I saw the morgue number and thought
he was working tonight. What's up?
I talked to my friend at Schenkman.
What I had to tell you
is definitely about Jack.
Turns out he was a patient there.
A patient?
But Schenkman's a psychiatric facility.
It seems like he was there voluntarily.
He checked himself in
so he could check himself out.
Well, we knew
something was off with Jack, but--
<i>There's more.</i>
<i>When Jack committed himseIf,</i>
<i>he thought he was going crazy.</i>
But the doctors couldn't diagnosis it.
Going crazy how?
He thought he was reliving days.
Reliving days?
Like me?
Exactly like you.
<i>PreviousIy on</i> Tru Calling:
I relive days.
You relive days?
This is Mr. Harper.
He will be interviewing to replace Gardez.
Hey. Jack.
Thanks for making me feel so welcome.
It's never easy being the new guy.
- Do you like working here?
- Actually, I do.
I understand.
You do? Not everyone does.
That's because most people believe
that only the living need help.
I just can't get a read on him,
for some reason.
It's like one minute he's in your face
and almost obnoxious.
The next, he's charming,
trying to be your best friend.
When Jack committed himself,
he thought he was going crazy.
Going crazy how?
He thought he was reliving days.
Like me?
Exactly like you.
Come on. You've got to let me talk to him.
He was in a psych ward, Tru.
He was diagnosed as being delusional.
And so would I, if I'd gone to a doctor
claiming to be reliving days.
But what makes you so sure
he's not just like me?
And out of all the gin joints in the world,
he walks into mine.
- I did.
- You were meant to.
Maybe he was meant to,
but we won't find out unless I talk to him.
And say what?"How about
this whole reliving days thing?"
Yeah, why not?
If it's true, he'd be relieved to know
that there's someone like him.
The way you are?
Okay. Yeah, sure.
It would be nice to have someone
to share the responsibility with.
What if he's been doing it for a while?
He may know more than we do.
That's assuming we can trust his answers.
Come on, Davis.
You don't trust the waitress to give
you decaf till you see what pot she uses.
Coffee's important to me.
And so are you.
You know
I'm gonna have to talk to him soon.
I know.
Oh, my God!
Call 91 1.
Help me.
Tru.
Hi.
You must be Randall.
I've been hearing about you all week.
I can't stay. I have to get back to work.
But first, Lindsay tells me
it's absolutely vital that you like me.
So what can I do?
You can leave,
so we can start talking about you.
All right.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Here, hold my cell.
Okay, what's going on?
Remember how we always said
when someone proposed to us...
we'd call the other one and the first thing
we'd say was,"Don't drop the phone."
- Well, don't drop the phone.
- No.
Yes! He asked me last night.
He wants to get married this weekend.
What did you say?
I asked for more time.
Do you love him?
Yeah, I think I might.
God, am I crazy?
It's not like he's a total stranger.
We dated that semester abroad--
But you've only been back together
for a week.
Great. So we both agree I'm totally crazy.
No, not if you asked for time
to think about it.
I did.
I told him I'd let him know
by the end of the day.
You okay?
If by"okay," you mean
25 minutes late for work, yeah.
But if you're on your way out,
avoid downtown.
- Construction?
- No, there was a bad accident.
The radio said a dump truck
plowed into the Number 6 bus.
- There's all kinds of gridlock.
- Are we expecting any bodies?
I wouldn't be surprised.
Do you ever notice how we always end up
in this hallway at the same time?
Maybe someone
is trying to tell us something.
Anyways, I know you're in a rush.
- Right, yes. I'll see you later.
- Okay.
So, you probably heard.
A certain lovely young woman
has seen the error of her ways...
and is returning into the arms
of her man, Harrison Davies.
Who are we talking about here?
Who are we talking about?
Lindsay, of course.
She left a message.
She needs to talk.
- It's reconciliation time, baby.
- You never know.
A message like that
could mean a lot of things.
You should've heard her voice.
I could hear
how much she cares about me.
- Harr.
- Yeah?
She's thinking about getting married
to someone else.
What?
Why would you say that?
His name's Randall Thompson...
and they've been seeing each other
for a week.
A week? She just met the guy.
Actually, they dated
when she was studying abroad...
and now he's an investment banker
at Burkess and Wells....
Come on. What's he after?
Not everyone's on the scam, Harry.
He's Euro, right?
I'm sure a green card would make
it real easy for him in this country.
You've never met him.
Don't have to.
He's working an angle...
so he can keep doing this investment
banking crap on this side of the Atlantic.
It doesn't matter what you or I think.
This is Lindsay's decision.
Stay out of it, Harr.
Dr. Frank Colvin,
mid- 40s, victim of a heart attack.
Dropped on the street
a couple of hours ago.
Time of death?
8:10 a. m.
Sorry about crashing here
after the late shift last night.
You guys should try sleeping
on that sofa in there.
I swear, this guy's the only guy in here
who feels worse than I do this morning.
What, did I miss a memo?
- That's probably not important.
- I can handle everything in here.
You sure?
You know, Davis is an interesting guy.
But why do I get the feeling
we'll come here one morning...
and all the corpses are gonna be
dressed up for an imaginary tea party?
Tru, I can appreciate the silent treatment
as well as anyone else...
but what's going on?
I can't even piss you off lately.
See, you want the truth.
- Davis and I, we--
- Let me save you the tap dance.
This is about the letter I got
from the Schenkman Center last week?
- Partly.
- I had a feeling.
- Look, I can explain that.
- You don't have to.
Why?
Because I know
it can be kind of hard to explain.
Jack, what you thought
was happening to you...
it happens to me.
I think we should go get a drink.
You know,
I had my suspicions about you.
Running off all the time, the way
you're so invested in these people's lives.
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Why didn't you?
- It's just, I can't believe--
- That there's two of us. I know.
I can't believe I'm finally talking
to someone who doesn't think I'm crazy.
- How sick are you of having--
- The same conversation...
over and over again.
And then having to act surprised,
like you hadn't heard it.
- "Oh, my God. No way."
- "So interesting."
- So when did it start?
- For me, it started a while ago.
I woke up after a near- death experience...
and found that it was the same day
over again.
And now I had this job to do.
What about you?
Almost a year ago now.
On the anniversary of my mother's death.
Really? Your mother?
So bodies ask for your help, too?
Yeah, although
it hasn't been happening lately.
Now I understand why.
Obviously, they prefer to go to you.
Can't say I blame them.
But you've gotta admit,
it's pretty amazing.
Being able to save people's lives,
to change things, make things right.
Is that what we're doing?
I guess I just wonder sometimes.
- About?
- Consequences. Ripples in fate.
How what we do affects others.
Jimmy, I got some seats over here.
There's a dartboard over there.
Let's go play.
So, who else knows about you?
First I told Harrison, and then Davis.
You told Davis?
He figured it out on his own.
He's really helped me navigate this.
At least now I understand
why you're single.
What's that supposed to mean?
You told Luc and he bolted, right?
First of all, nobody bolted.
It just wasn't working.
Second of all, I never told him.
Because you were afraid he'd bolt, right?
Who have you told?
Me?
Nobody.
It tends to make things complicated.
Speaking of bolting, I got a pickup.
Well, thanks.
God, it's so nice to know
I'm not in this alone.
Yeah.
I'll see you later tonight.
Or depending on the body,
maybe I'll see you this morning.
Okay.
Hey, Lindsay.
I did it. I finally made up my mind
about Randall's proposal.
And?
I said no.
<i>And he said goodbye.</i>
He's such a great guy, Tru.
It just felt too fast.
I am sure that you did the right thing.
The day will come when you'll tell me
not to drop the phone again...
<i>and then it'II be the right guy,</i>
<i>the one who was meant to be.</i>
You really believe that?
Of course, rebound girl.
Thanks, Tru. Good night.
Good night.
Someone's got a little extra bounce
in their step.
Someone's got a little tequila
in their system.
But more importantly, I talked to Jack.
- And?
- He's just like me.
He understands everything I've been
going through because he does it, too.
- You told him about you?
- Of course.
Was he surprised?
I guess.
Just getting it out there was so liberating.
And he brought up
something interesting.
He asked if I ever thought about
how what we do could have a ripple affect.
Well, yes.
Every time you save someone,
it changes the course of history.
You not only affect that life...
but the lives of everyone
that person will touch.
Tru, the power that you have
is awesome:
to change history for the better.
What is it?
It's just the way he was talking about it.
I'm not so sure
Jack always thinks it's for the better.
Could I get a hand out here?
I got a body.
Suicide, found over at Chelsea River.
What's going on with the good doctor?
No one came to claim him?
- That's kind of sad.
- Yeah, it is sad.
What?
Nothing.
You told him, didn't you?
It's okay. You can trust him.
- Here, let me help you with the body.
- <i>Wait.</i>
What?
I didn't say....
Here we go.
Help them.
Jack?
<i>Did you?</i>
Yeah.
Looks like they're playing our song.
So, what do you remember
about the doctor?
6' tall, mid 40s, dark blond hair.
It's 8:02. You said Colvin died around 8:10?
According to witnesses.
Do you remember
where you picked him up?
Tru, I've never been
much of a morning person.
<i>Come on, Jack.</i>
3rd and Cliffwood.
<i>East or West?</i>
- East.
- Meet you there.
- East 3rd and Cliffwood. Where is he?
- I don't know.
It's 8:09. He should be here.
- What?
- It might have been West 3rd.
Excuse me.
I'm calling it. 8:10 a. m.
- That man is dead because of me.
- That's not true.
I could've sworn it was East 3rd.
- We can't always be perfect.
- Have you ever lost anyone?
Yes. I understand how you feel.
It's hard to believe
anyone understands how I feel.
Dr. Frank Colvin.
He's the one that asked for help?
Yeah, we didn't make it to him on time.
What do you mean by"we"?
Jack and I.
- Together?
- Yeah.
Thus the"and."
So you guys talked?
Right. Sorry, I told you yesterday.
Of course, you don't remember.
Jack and I spoke.
And, Davis, he is another me.
Really? He said that?
It's incredible, isn't it?
Yeah, it's incredible.
Just one sec.
It's Lindsay.
I'm supposed to be meeting Randall.
This guy proposed to her.
Go ahead, you can take the call.
That's okay. I'll call her back.
Now, about what you're not saying....
I don't get it. There was two of you,
and you still couldn't save him?
Jack got the street wrong.
- Right. Wrong street.
- Seriously, it was an honest mistake.
When did you last make a mistake
that cost someone their life?
- Why are you being so hard on him?
- Why aren't you?
You beat yourself up
over the slightest misstep.
You're gonna give Jack a free pass
over someone's life?
I told you, it wasn't his fault.
What's going on with you, anyway?
Can't you just be happy for me
that I found Jack...
or does every silver lining
have to have a cloud?
- Sometimes it does.
- I'm sorry, I can't live like that.
I have to take victories
where I can find them.
Since when is losing someone
considered a victory?
He's right, Tru.
Maybe we just have to admit
we lost this round.
I don't think that we have.
It's good to see
we're all on the same page again.
- You were saying?
- I don't think this is over yet.
Dr. Colvin died of a massive heart attack.
We couldn't have stopped that
even if we got there on time.
And he said,"Help them," not"help me."
Maybe he was supposed to die.
lnteresting.
Everyone asks for help for a reason.
We just have to find out
what his reason was.
You got something to add, Davis?
I was thinking, if every rewind
is a matter of life and death...
and the doctor said,"Help them,"
you have to figure...
there's at least one person connected
to this man who will die today.
<i>Maybe more.</i>
The question is: Who is it,
and can you find them before it's too late?
Since no one claimed the body yesterday,
we should start with the next of kin.
Lindsay, you're my best friend,
and I believe in you.
Somehow, I know you'll make
the right decision about Randall today.
All right? I'll call you later. Bye.
How'd it sound?
Too surprised? Not surprised enough?
It was perfect. I almost thought
you were worried she might say yes.
Not today.
So, you think the doctor's son
is the one we're supposed to save?
He's the next of kin and his only family.
Can I help you?
Are you Marc Colvin?
Yeah.
We work at the morgue downtown...
and I'm sorry to have to tell you this...
but your father passed away this morning.
Heart attack.
Yeah, it would be.
We were wondering if you'd mind coming
down to the morgue to claim the body.
I'd rather not.
Thank you for telling me about it, though.
But you're his son.
My father and I weren't very close.
It's none of your business,
but he didn't exactly approve of me.
Since Frank Colvin
never claimed me as a son...
I don't think I should have to be the one
to claim him now.
Why don't you try his office?
That's where he lived most of his life.
What's up, doc?
God!
Is Tru around?
No, she's out in the field.
Can I take a message?
I wanted to tell her in person.
I'll tell you anyway.
I've got some great news about Lindsay.
She already knows about that.
How does she know?
I just got the message.
Because Tru has been
talking to Lindsay about the guy all week.
What guy?
The guy that Lindsay
is thinking of marrying.
I didn't say anything about marriage.
This is awkward, isn't it?
Only if you don't keep talking.
Come on, Davis.
What guy?
Randall Thompson, I think.
An investment banker with an lrish accent,
which women find so appealing.
I don't understand
why accents have such an effect...
because when you think about--
He's foreign. He's from another country.
He just lives here.
Suddenly, he just pops the question
and asks some chick to marry him?
Hello? What does that say to you?
That he's impulsive and likes to travel.
No, I'm actually a referral.
Dr. Colvin left me a message
asking me to come by today.
Dr. Colvin's office, this is Grace.
Can you hold, please?
Miss Casola, the doctor will
be here soon. Please take a seat and wait.
He said 10:00 a. m. I've been waiting.
You know what? Forget it.
Sorry about that, Mrs. Hoffman.
Your test results will be in this afternoon,
and I'll have him call you first thing.
Okay, bye. Hi, how can I help you?
My name is Jack Harper,
and we're with the city morgue.
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this...
but Dr. Colvin died from a heart attack
at around 8:00 a. m.
We were wondering
if someone from this office...
could come down to the morgue
to identify the body.
Right.
We need to close for the day.
Look in the doctor's book...
and call anyone
who's scheduled for an appointment?
Lily is probably still waiting for him.
Someone should probably tell her.
Lily?
She's a waitress
at the coffee shop across the street.
She's going to community college...
and Frank was tutoring her.
Let us help you. It's on the way.
We'll tell her.
So, you think
this girl might be one of"them"?
You said it yourself. Ripples.
One person's life touches so many others.
How many lives did Dr. Colvin touch?
And if Davis is right,
which one of them is gonna die today?
Oh, my God.
- What happened?
- He had a heart attack.
I served him coffee every morning
for over a year.
One day he saw me drawing...
a sketch of the human anatomy
from my biology text.
He corrected me.
On what?
He told me the left lung
is smaller than the right lung...
to make room for the heart.
He said that
that's how he'd remembered it...
because it's like life.
The heart always comes first.
Excuse me.
The man Lily knew and the man
his son knew were two different people.
You know how families are.
They always save the most
dysfunctional stuff for each other.
Hey, man, Lily left her book here.
You can probably catch her
at the bus stop.
Which one?
Down the block. The Number 6.
A bad accident.
The radio said a dump truck
plowed into the Number 6 bus.
Yesterday there was an accident.
Lily's bus?
There it is.
Wait, stop!
Stop the bus!
Hold on!
Lily!
Stop the bus!
Wait!
Jack, no!
Jack, what the hell were you thinking?
Are you telling me...
you've never jumped in front
of an oncoming vehicle to save someone?
Are you okay?
I think so.
You forgot this.
Thank you.
So Jack stopped the bus. Okay.
That's okay. You're allowed to be wrong
about him. I forgive you.
- All right, what now?
- That's the thing.
Yesterday you and I talked about
how one life touches so many others.
How do I know this is what Dr. Colvin
meant when he said,"Help them"?
Anybody die in the accident yesterday?
That's just it. Luc wasn't sure.
Although Jack thinks--
Jack thinks? What do you think?
What I was gonna tell you,
if you'd let me...
was that Jack and I were talking
about lives touching--
You told Jack
about what we talked about?
Come on, it's not as if it was classified.
I didn't even know
that you talked to me about it until now.
What's with you?
Why are you acting like this?
I know it must be a big relief
to share this with someone.
But ever since you learned
the truth about Jack...
you're walking around with blinders on,
which is exactly what I think he wants.
Please don't tell me you're jealous.
I'm not jealous.
- I'm skeptical, which you used to be.
- What's there to doubt?
Jack's practically proven
that he's here to help.
- Has he?
- He jumped in front of a bus.
To stop an accident,
which you just said yourself...
might not have killed anyone.
You have to ask yourself,
"Why Jack? Why now?"
Why would the two of you
be in the same place at the same time?
<i>I know that</i>
<i>you don't want to be aIone in this...</i>
but something here isn't right.
And something about him isn't right.
You okay?
Fine. My mind's just on other things.
You feel like sharing?
I just want to follow up a little
on Dr. Colvin's call for help.
Tru, we saved a busload of people.
Our work here is done.
You've got to learn
to take yes for an answer.
The son might know something.
I just want to try him again.
- All right, let me grab my stuff.
- No, it's fine. I got it.
No reason for both of us
to be obsessive, right?
Why should I waste my time?
Because it's the right thing to do.
You're his son.
I needn't pretend it meant
more to me than it did to him.
Can't you, just for today,
do this one little thing for him?
I'm sorry to intrude.
You again.
Your father's body is still unclaimed,
and nobody's even come to identify it.
What, you both go
to the same school of etiquette?
- I have my reasons. Good ones.
- We're not here to judge.
You didn't know my father.
He was the man who convinced
a 15- year- old kid that he was a failure...
because he wanted to do something
other than follow in his father's footsteps.
It was years before I realized that
"artist" didn't mean"disappointment."
Okay, so your father wasn't a saint.
But he tried to help people.
Did you know he was tutoring someone?
A girl in junior college?
Really? Was she studying biology?
Something medical?
Yeah.
Dad was a decent guy
if you met his expectations, but if not....
Let's just say that I know how it feels
to go unclaimed.
Excuse me.
He wouldn't return my phone calls.
I just wanted to ask him
to help me choose a mortuary...
pick out one of Frank's suits.
All the things
that should be done by family.
I guess I am alone in this.
Help them.
No, you're not.
- You Randall Thompson?
- How'd you....Where's my assistant?
- Sit down. This will only take a second.
- Who are you?
Harrison Davies.
Lindsay's Harrison.
Right.
I'm only gonna say this once.
You listen up.
If you think you can take
this sweet, innocent girl...
get some green card,
and break her heart...
I don't care where you go,
I don't care what you do...
but I'll find you and break you.
My grandfather gave this to
my grandmother when they got engaged.
My grandfather gave this to
my grandmother when they got engaged.
My father gave it to my mother.
I was hoping to get it resized
so that Lindsay could wear it...
when we move to London.
London?
The firm's sending me back.
I've been promoted.
And I want to take Lindsay with me...
as my wife.
See, I don't need a green card. I need her.
I keep seeing him all day.
Ever since you told me.
It happens for a while.
After my mom died, I saw her all the time.
At the grocery store,
in the carpool line at school.
It will stop.
What if I don't want it to?
Gardenias.
Frank gave them to me for my birthday.
This may be none of my business but....
I loved him.
Did he know?
I never said anything...
but somehow I always thought
there would be time...
to let him know what he meant to me.
There is no time, is there?
Frank was always doing things like this:
taking on other doctors' lost causes,
helping people.
"Lost causes"? Meaning terminals?
Her HCG levels were elevated,
which usually signifies inoperable cancer.
But Dr. Colvin ordered additional tests
to be run on her blood samples.
May I see that?
According to this, the patient
recently suffered a miscarriage.
Pregnancy would cause
her levels to be off.
That means she was misdiagnosed
by her previous doctor.
She's not going to die.
I'm sure Frank meant to tell her.
"Nadine Casola."
Miss Casola, the doctor will
be here soon. Please take a seat.
She was in your office today, but she left.
- Yes.
- So she still believes she's dying.
Grace, you have to call her. She needs
to hear this news right now. Please.
Oh, dear.
It's ringing.
- There's no answer.
- Keep calling.
Hello?
Sounds like you're in a rush.
The son put you onto something?
<i>I know who was supposed to die.</i>
Nadine Casola. A suicide.
She was misdiagnosed.
I'm on my way to the....
I got a body.
Suicide, found at Chelsea River.
Wait a minute.
You picked her up yesterday.
<i>The suicide at CheIsea River.</i>
Why didn't you say anything
on seeing her at the doctor's office?
Maybe I just didn't recognize her.
Sometimes suicides don't look all neat
and tidy when you get to the scene, Tru.
A life is in danger.
Can't we argue about this later?
Wait, Jack. Why didn't you tell me
what you knew?
I've got to go, Tru. My cell's dying.
Nadine!
We're too late.
- I gotta see for myself.
- Why are you being like this?
- I'm trying to do my job.
- So am I.
You don't want me to save her.
You want her to die.
- So help me God, if you don't let go!
- Tru, think a minute.
Nadine Casola is supposed to die.
Why should you change that?
Because someone asked me to.
Because I can.
That's not good enough.
You have no idea what you're doing.
If you save someone who shouldn't
be here, there are consequences.
Do you think I'm messing up
some grand plan? Maybe I am the plan!
If someone needs my help,
I am not gonna stand by and watch.
And I'm not gonna stop you.
This time.
What did you do?
You're okay. You're gonna be okay.
Stay with me, okay? It's gonna be all right.
Come on, Nadine. It's okay.
You're gonna be fine.
Yes, I want to report an emergency.
I need an ambulance.
I have an overdose.
She's still breathing.
<i>You're gonna be fine, Nadine.</i>
Hi.
What are you....
I never returned your key.
Harrison, tonight isn't--
I heard about the proposal.
And?
And I checked this guy out.
- I know it pisses you off.
- Harrison.
You need to know something...
before you make a mistake
that you'll regret for the rest of your life.
You should go. You shouldn't be here.
Say yes.
Say yes.
He is the real deal.
He's the better guy.
A better guy than I could be for you.
At least, right now.
And he really loves you.
Say yes.
Thank you.
I see you chose the suit.
He wore it one night
when he was going to a concert.
He looked very distinguished.
I still want to help.
If there's anything I can do....
Hi. Grace?
I'm Lily.
I came to give back Dr. Colvin's book.
Please.
Hi.
Hi.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Frank spoke so highly of you.
You, too.
Did you like the gardenias?
How did you know about that?
God, he agonized over
which ones to get you: gardenias, roses.
He finally chose gardenias
because of what they meant.
Unspoken love.
I'll put this in his medical collection.
It was very nice to finally meet you.
I'm really sorry it had to be this way.
It's so ironic.
Frank touched so many people.
And the one person
he wanted to help the most, he couldn't.
- You mean....
- His son.
Frank just never knew
how to tell him.
Thanks for coming.
You said on the phone I had to sign
something, then this would be over.
Right, a notarized statement.
I get your signature,
we can release the body...
and you'll never have to think
of your father again.
Please, come in.
Grace, I've got a lot of work to do.
She told me that this whole thing
was gonna just take a few....
He's been buying them
from galleries for years.
I don't....
He wanted to be with you.
<i>This was as cIose as he couId get.</i>
I thought that he didn't....
Why didn't he say anything?
Maybe he thought there was time.
Hey, stranger.
We've gotta stop meeting like this.
Do we?
- Tru, I understand--
- I got something pointed out to me today.
We never have as much time as we think.
Meaning?
I don't want to stand around
and wait for someday to come.
I want to make it work with us.
I understand that you're serious.
But what's different now that's
gonna make things better between us?
Unless there's something you want to
say that you couldn't or wouldn't before...
what's gonna keep us
from going in the same circles?
This time there is something different.
This weekend, let's talk.
About everything.
Okay.
I tried to call, but you weren't around.
I saved a life today.
That's good.
Jack tried to stop me.
You were right, Davis...
and I should've listened.
But I didn't want to hear
what you were saying.
So I'm just really sorry that--
- I'm sorry, too. I just kind of lost--
- Davis, just let me do this, okay?
You said that I'm different
because of this gift that I have...
and I've gotten to a place
where I can accept that.
But what I don't want to be is alone.
And I wanted so badly to believe in Jack...
that I ignored the one person
who's been with me all along.
I needed to know there was someone else
out there who was like me.
But Jack, he's not even close.
No, he's not.
It's not just supernatural theory.
It's scientific fact.
From Eastern philosophy
to Newton's Third Law of Motion...
they all say the same thing.
That every force
has an equal and opposite force.
I should've said something sooner,
but I didn't have any real proof until today.
You're right about Jack. He is not like you.
He is the opposite of you.
- You save lives and he....
- Takes them.
Help me.
He's gone.
He must've taken off
as soon as he realized we were on to him.
Yeah. Gone. Almost.
- What's on your mind?
- Well, here's the thing.
We know who you are. You are life.
You give a second chance to those
that have died before their time...
- and we know who Jack is.
- My opposite.
- Choice adjective excluded.
- Right.
He relives days to ensure that
those victims once again die.
Okay, so we know that.
Here's my best guess.
The next time that your day restarts...
our friend Jack Harper
will make his return...
because it's clear why he came here
two months ago.
His work is undone.
- He came to find his opposite.
- And stop me.
<i>Hey, it's Tru. Leave a message.</i>
<i>Hey, it's Lindsay.</i>
<i>I know it's Iike 6.:00 a. m. ,</i>
<i>but I had to caII and say one thing.</i>
5:15.
I'm getting freaking married today, Tru.
Can you believe that?
It still doesn't mean I'll pick up the phone.
<i>My God! And I aIso noticed you RSVP'd,</i>
<i>pIus one.</i>
So, who are you bringing?
All right, never mind.
I'll just call you later. Bye.
I've driven women to drink.
I've driven women to other women.
But I have never driven a woman
to the altar...
within a month of dumping her.
Look, here's the thing. I love Lindsay...
but she's never been
very good at being alone.
I blew it, you know?
I was undependable, unreliable.
But ever since this Randall guy,
I have decided...
that I'm gonna be a better man.
You know, someone I can be proud of.
Someone you can be proud of.
A new leaf, so to speak.
- A new leaf?
- Well, yeah. I'm a young guy...
it's never too late to change your spots.
Speaking of sudden character
transformations, any luck finding Jack?
No, nothing.
I scoured the town, just like you asked.
I went to bars, strip joints.
- About that new leaf?
- Pacing myself.
I'll tell you who I have run into lately. Luc.
- So, you've been avoiding him.
- Here's the thing.
The last time I spoke to Luc,
I promised him I'd tell him about me.
But as long as I don't tell him,
I can still have hope for us.
'Cause I know that as soon as I do,
I won't even have that.
No, maybe.
But maybe not. But, see, the point is...
that you will never know unless you try.
And if I can turn a new leaf, anyone can.
- I gotta go, Wonder Woman.
- Bye.
- Hey, I hope I'm not interrupting.
- No, come here.
Watch this. It's still cooking.
The photo sits in the developer
and the chemicals draw out the image.
Just give it a couple more seconds and....
It's an old roll I never developed.
- She looks familiar.
- Yeah.
- Ex- girlfriend.
- Sounds complicated.
It is. Just like her.
I'm sorry if you feel like
I've been avoiding you.
Well, I'm sorry, too.
Mainly because you're so damn good at it.
Look. Maybe heart- to- heart's
not your thing, and that's fine.
- No law says you have to explain--
- How about tonight?
- Tonight?
- Yes.
Come to Lindsay's wedding with me,
and I will explain everything.
- Semiformal, right?
- I'll see you at 6:00?
Okay.
But, hey, Luc?
Just remember, she is complicated.
Right.
Harrison.
Jack. What the hell are you doing here?
- I came to see a friend.
- Great.
You let me know when he shows up.
Look, I know Tru wants you to think
I'm the enemy. I'm not.
Your sister and I
just see things differently, that's all.
Right. She saves people...
- and you kill them.
- I'm not a killer.
Straight up. When a bullet gets shot
into a man's chest...
I don't pull the trigger.
When a drunk driver takes out a family
of four, I'm not behind the wheel.
But when those people ask
for my sister's help...
you're not exactly lending a hand now,
are you?
Death can be tragic.
Death can be unfair. But as much as
we may all hate to admit it...
death is inevitable. I'm merely helping
fate get what it wants.
And you're telling me this because?
Because she listens to you.
And you love her.
And I know that you will find a way
to make her stop.
Stop saving the lives of people
who are supposed to die.
Stop messing with fate. And stop
screwing with the order of the universe.
Yeah. Okay. No.
No, it's okay.
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
I'll be right there.
But she'll never stop,
and I'll never ask her to.
So do yourself a favor, friend.
You stay the hell away from me...
and my sister.
We're gathered here today
to celebrate the union of two people.
Lindsay and Randall. Two people
who have found each other...
in a world where we rarely slow down
to let ourselves be found.
And to celebrate that love, the bride has
asked her very good friend, Tru Davies...
to read a passage today. Tru?
"I carry your heart with me
(I carry it in my heart)
"I fear no fate (for you are my fate,
my sweet)
"i want no world (for beautiful
you are my world, my true)
"and it's you are whatever a moon
has always meant
"and whatever a sun will always sing
is you
"here is the deepest secret
nobody knows"
Excuse me just a moment.
- Your cell was off. There was no other--
- Davis, what's wrong?
Your brother. He's been shot.
- He's got bullet trauma, single entry.
- Doesn't look good.
Let's set up the rapid infusers,
and get a truckload of O- Neg.
Could be a hole through the anterior LV.
Get the thoracic surgeon on call, stat!
Get him to Trauma before he drains
into the pleural cavity. Not a lot of time!
God, Harrison!
I'm his sister, what happened to him?
EMT radioed ahead,
they found him in a house on Bank Street.
I'll ask. If anything happens,
I promise I'll ask.
No, you are not gonna die.
Do you hear me? You'll be fine.
Let us do our job. That's all you can do.
- Any word?
- No.
It's okay. It's Harrison.
He's a fighter, you know?
He's gonna be okay.
I'm so sorry about the wedding.
The wedding can wait.
Lindsay belongs with you.
Hello. I'm looking for a patient.
Harrison Davies?
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, ma'am. He's still in surgery.
I'm Harrison's sister. Do you know him?
Not really. I was the one who called 91 1.
- He was shot.
- Your were with him?
No, I mean, it's my ex.
He just gets so jealous.
I am so sorry. I shouldn't have come here.
- I just wanted to make sure he was okay.
- Your ex? Who's....Wait!
Dad.
I was in town for a meeting.
They found my card in Harrison's wallet.
He's hurt, Dad. It's not good.
We don't know anything yet.
I'm gonna find the doctor.
He's still in surgery.
They just told me to wait here.
Okay. We'll wait.
Excuse me.
Hey!
I want you out of here right now!
You are not welcome here!
I came to see my friend.
You had something to do with this,
I know you did.
This morning
I went to your brother's place.
Our conversation ended badly,
so I called him to clarify.
A paramedic answered the phone.
I got worried.
If anything happens to him,
I'm holding you responsible.
Do you understand that? It is on you!
Tru
- Tru, sweetheart.
- No.
They did everything that they could.
No.
- No, he can't be.
- Tru!
Talk to me. Talk to me, Harry!
- Miss, you're not supposed to be in here.
- He needs me.
You said....
Harry, you always said you'd ask me.
Please, I'm right here.
Just ask me.
Sweetheart, come on.
I'll be waiting at the morgue.
I won't leave you.
I'm always by your side.
Tru.
You can't let him win.
<i>Hey, it's Tru. Leave a message.</i>
<i>- Hey, it's Lindsay. Look, I know--</i>
- Thank God!
<i>But I'm getting freaking married today.</i>
<i>Can you beIieve that?</i>
Yeah, let's hope so.
I'm only a few minutes--
It's good to see you, too!
I tried to reach you all morning.
I called your house, I called your cell.
I'm a heavy sleeper. What?
- I went by your place. You weren't there.
- Why? What's going on?
Today isn't gonna be your day, Harrison.
Today's the day that
I'm gonna be a better man.
- Today's the day that I'm gonna--
- Die.
Let me get this straight. I'm dead,
in the hospital, and I ask for your help?
Fortunately, yeah.
Wow.
- So was Lindsay there?
- What?
Lindsay. Was she there at the hospital?
Yeah, she postponed the wedding
as soon as she heard you were shot.
Okay.
That is great! Yes!
So, were people sad
and, like, tears flowing and--
- Harrison.
- What?
Well, come on! How many times
does a guy get to die and come back?
Set the scene for me.
I can set the scene for you,
or I can keep you alive.
- Which do you prefer?
- Fine.
Okay. First of all, who are you dating?
Dating? No one.
Wrong time to be coy, Harry.
There was a woman at the hospital.
Said you were shot by her jealous ex
on Bank Street.
Do you know anyone who lives
on Bank Street?
No one.
Look, there's no girlfriend.
There's no jealous exes.
There's no Bank Street. Are you sure
it was me who asked for help yesterday?
Okay, we may not know why you
were killed, but we know one thing.
Your death is entirely preventable.
So let me ask you this.
On a scale of one to ten...
how much weeping
are we talking about here?
Harrison, everything you did yesterday,
we have to do differently today.
Okay. So where to?
The place you were least likely
to be yesterday.
How can you be so sure
I wasn't here yesterday?
Because the last book you read
had pictures in it.
That's a good point. Yeah.
- I got here as fast as I could.
- Hey.
- What?
- I'm so sorry.
Please accept my condolences.
You were so...young.
Dude, I'm still alive. I died yesterday.
Why don't we talk in private.
This one's personal,
but you're doing everything right.
I can't think of any reason
why you can't win this one.
I can.
Jack came by the hospital last night.
You don't remember me telling you this...
but yesterday he showed up
at Harrison's apartment.
You don't think Jack
has anything to do with....
No, not yesterday.
But if Jack is my opposite, then today....
He'll make sure that fate plays out
the same way.
Meaning, it's his job
to make sure Harrison dies.
Oops. Sorry.
Hello.
He seems to be handling it okay.
He wanted an estimate of number
of tears people shed last night, in gallons.
Okay, don't worry.
I'll take care of it. No, I'll be right there.
Look, this is probably something
you don't want to hear.
- But there is someplace I need to be.
- No way. Not a chance.
Someone's in a jam
and they need my help. It's important.
- No!
- Probably called yesterday, too.
Who is it, and what do they want?
Need I remind you, you died yesterday.
All right, look.
This may sound stupid, but ever since
Lindsay met this Randall guy...
I took stock.
And I'm tired of being the screwup.
Look, there's this Rec Center
around the corner from my place.
They have all these sorts of programs
for these kids.
Well, the other day I just walk in
to get change for the meter...
and I walk out someone's big brother.
- Who's the kid?
- Ethan McCrane.
His folks got divorced last year.
Look, I may not know how it is
to be a great dad...
but I know how to survive without one.
That's Ethan on the phone,
and he got busted shoplifting.
He's too afraid to call his mom, so unless
an adult goes there to claim him...
- the owner's gonna call the cops.
- And where's the store?
- It's on Carver and Fifth.
- It's a good three miles from Bank Street.
- You can go, but I'm coming with you.
- Okay. Let's go.
- See you, Morgue Man.
- Are you coming?
No. Go ahead and go.
There's something I need to take care of.
Ok.
You took my seat.
I was sitting there yesterday.
I just wanted to let you know that
Harrison won't be showing up today.
Good old Tru.
At least she's gonna make this sporting.
So, why don't you tell me
what you really want.
I just want to hear it for myself.
- What's that?
- Who you are. What you can do.
How you can live with yourself.
I respect you, Davis.
You're a man of science.
You want answers, conclusions.
So how's this?
I preserve the order of the universe
by ensuring the cycle of life.
Fate already has a representative, Jack,
and it is not you.
Tru? Now this is where we're gonna have
to agree to disagree.
Because if Tru was serving fate,
why does fate need me?
- She helps people live.
- Who were supposed to die!
Don't you see? She can't win.
You're wrong.
I've seen her save people. She can win.
Yes. You've seen her outfox killers...
talk people off ledges,
and quite capably, I might add.
But if you think that's the end of the story,
you're missing the best part.
What's that?
I think we'll save that for another time.
Wouldn't want to blow
all my best material at once.
But it's good to see you, boss.
Tell Harrison I'll catch him later.
If I see him in my place again,
I'll call the cops.
Yes, sir. Not a problem. Come on, buddy.
If you're hungry, you call me.
I'm, like, VIP at all the restaurants in town.
Forget candy bars.
I'm talking steak and tiramisu.
This is my sister. She's cool. She's....
Well, she looks out for me.
- Kind of how I look out for you.
- Hi, Ethan.
Hi.
- You're not gonna tell my mother, are you?
- Not a chance!
- You are.
- What?
Yeah, we'll take you home.
Where do you live?
It's a few blocks. I can go on my own.
Come on, buddy, just tell me where.
Fine. I live on Bank Street.
But she's probably not even home
from work yet.
- Did you say Bank Street?
- Yeah, 95 Bank Street.
Ethan, do you think your mom would
mind picking you up at my office?
Why don't you guys wait in Sign- In
until Ethan's mom gets here?
- Where you going?
- I hear Davis in the crypt. I'll be right back.
And just do me a favor?
Don't play with anything.
- I won't.
- I was talking to him.
Davis.
Sorry if I got your hopes up. I just came by
to give my two- week notice.
Don't bother. Davis took you off payroll
once we realized you were Death.
I'm not Death, Tru.
I don't determine who lives or dies.
It's my job to bring a little order
to the universe.
Which means today your job is
to make sure my brother dies.
- I take no pleasure in that.
- Oh, I'm sure. Later, Jack.
What if I let him live?
For a guy who claims he isn't Death,
you sure talk a good game.
I like your brother. I'd hate to see him die.
I'd hate to see you see him die...again.
Death's Top 10 Come- Ons.
Number 10:
promise to spare the life of a relative.
I also hate reliving days.
I mean, the first time was cool,
but after that, dull as dishwater.
Number nine: bitch about the job,
and then invite her back to your place...
to see your new black robe.
You know what I hate
more than anything?
The way you're looking at me right now.
So I won't stand in the way
of you saving Harrison.
- If?
- If you stop.
The next time someone asks for your help,
ignore it.
If your day should rewind, have fun.
But don't save the life
of someone whose time is up.
- Think about it.
- I don't have to think about it, Jack.
I can save my brother
and anyone else who needs me.
Is that how you think this works?
When you save someone who's supposed
to die, there are consequences.
The universe
keeps very strict accounts, Tru.
And what you're doing is messing
with the books.
So if you save Harrison,
the one certainty is...
someone else is gonna die today
in his place.
- It doesn't work like that.
- I guess we'll see.
Twelve hours till midnight.
And I'm sitting on the edge of my seat...
because I know someone's
gonna die today. Could be anyone.
- It could be you.
- Or you.
- I guess we'll see.
- I guess we will.
Say goodbye to Harrison for me.
Read into that any way you'd like.
Yes! That's good!
- Mom.
- There you are. Ethan.
You can always call me, no matter what.
You understand?
Hi, I'm Harrison. I know we only spoke on--
On the phone. Right. It's nice to meet you.
- Well, what can I say? Thank you so much.
- Oh, no problem.
Emma.
- Hi. Have we met?
- No, I'm Tru, Harrison's sister.
Hey, Harry, you want to just give us a sec?
Oh, yeah.
Girl talk. Dude, come on.
He worships your brother.
All I've heard for the last week is,
"Harrison this, Harrison that."
It must be really tough raising him
on your own.
Yeah. His father and I
split up six months ago.
Harrison may be the first
stable role model he's ever had.
Not exactly Donnie's strong suit.
- Being a role model?
- Being stable.
Could you just excuse me one sec?
Emma's got a jealous ex. But she
and Harrison never even met until today.
- He must've taken Ethan home and--
- Wrong place, wrong time. Right.
You're doing everything you need to do.
Keeping Harrison away from Bank Street.
- What about them?
- They're safe.
The only person in danger is the guy
he thinks is sleeping with his ex- wife.
It still couldn't hurt
to keep an eye on the house.
But wait, Davis. You?
From across the street.
If there's any real work to be done
I'll call you. I'm not doing that stuff.
I'll see you later.
Tru, you were awesome! You did it!
You saved me! I knew it!
I always knew you could do it.
Hey, we're not out of the woods yet, Har.
Come on! You said it yourself. Stay away
from Bank Street and I am bullet- free.
So what's next? 'Cause I'm starving.
This whole dying and coming back thing
really works on my appetite.
Stop! Listen to me!
Look, you don't remember yesterday.
You don't have to, but I do.
I stood over your body. Your dead body.
And I will not lose you again,
do you understand me?
Yeah, sure. Whatever.
So let's go.
I'm taking you somewhere safe.
Safe? What could be safer than a morgue?
We're gathered here today to celebrate
the union of two people.
FYI. Given a choice between death
and attending my ex's wedding...
I might have chosen death.
And in celebration of that love...
the bride has asked her friend, Tru Davies,
to read for us a passage today. Tru?
- I'll be right back.
- I'll be right here.
- What's his name?
- Stop it, Donnie.
- We've been through this many times.
- We've been divorced six months.
You already found a replacement?
You know how crazy this is?
How crazy you sound?
- Who is he?
- There's no one!
I haven't been out on a date since
high school, and that was with you.
- Don't lie to me, Emma!
- Oh, my God!
Would you stop that and put that away.
- My buddy saw him.
- Daddy?
Hey, Eth. I didn't know you were....
- Mommy and Daddy, we were just talking.
- You should leave, Donnie. Now.
Yeah.
Hey, look, Daddy's gonna come see you
real soon, okay?
I'm gonna find this guy.
Don't think I won't.
Goodbye, Donnie.
Hey, honey.
Watch where you're going.
I know where I'm going.
The question is, do you?
- What the hell's that supposed to mean?
- Donnie McCrane?
- Yeah?
- Jack Harper.
Sacred Heart Basketball League!
Come on, I was the point guard.
We beat St. Anthony's for 30 points
back in'91. You must remember.
Sorry, Jack? No.
Hey, I was sorry
to hear about your divorce, man.
Some of the guys were talking about it.
I've been through it myself.
It sucks, doesn't it?
They leave you for some young stud,
and we get left paying the bills.
Anyway, I was sorry to hear it.
But keep your chin up.
You're a much better- looking guy
than he is.
Hey. You know him?
- You know the guy Emma's seeing?
- Know him? Oh, yeah.
Not only that,
I know where he is right now.
Come on, Tru.
Pick up the phone. Pick it up. Come on.
- Sorry, Davis.
- Give me that!
This is between me and Tru.
"here is the deepest secret nobody knows
"and this is the wonder
that's keeping the stars apart
"i carry your heart (i carry it in my heart)"
I can't tell you how surprised I was
to see you.
Lindsay called, and she said
she hadn't heard from you all day.
She had a nagging suspicion her best
friend was gonna go stag to her wedding.
Well, that's why she's my best friend.
She knows what I want.
It can't be easy for him,
seeing Lindsay marry somebody else.
It beats the alternative.
- What's that?
- It's a long story.
I'm not going anywhere.
You haven't heard the story yet.
Okay. I promised you answers.
Explanations that are long overdue.
So here goes.
Harrison's here today
because I'm saving his life.
You're saving his life?
Yesterday he was shot, and he died.
He asked for my help, and my day
restarted, and so I'm helping him...
because that's what I do.
I help people live who aren't ready to die.
And when we were together,
if I ever showed up late, or ran off early...
or acted in some inexplicable way,
it was because someone needed me.
- Because someone needed my--
- Your help.
Right.
And I never told you this before,
because I know how it sounds...
but I can do all of those things.
Every one of them.
Excuse me, everyone.
Before we move inside for dinner...
I would like to make a toast...
to my beautiful bride, Lindsay...
who has--
Luc. Luc.
accepted me for who I am.
And has made my life richer because of it.
- To Lindsay.
- Hear, hear.
Harrison.
Look, I told you, buddy.
I didn't sleep with your wife.
- That's not what I heard.
- I'm telling you the truth!
- Honest! Ask anybody! Ask--
- Your son!
Who are you?
Someone who knows
the same thing that Ethan does.
My brother met your ex- wife
for the first time today.
You may not believe me,
but you have to believe your son.
Look, you're mixed up. I get it.
I just had to watch the woman I love
marry another man.
Okay, I know how you feel,
but I'm not the guy you're looking for.
Honest.
You better both be telling me the truth.
- It's okay.
- Yeah.
Do me a favor and keep an eye on him.
There's just one more thing I gotta do.
- That's a little harsh, don't you think?
- Actually, I'm not so sure it is.
Let me guess.
She's in love with someone else.
I wish it were that simple.
- I can see you need some alone time, so--
- She seemed so normal at first.
I mean, she's pretty and smart and....
You know what? Forget it.
Hey.
Sorry for prying.
Okay, no, how about this?
And I can't believe I'm even repeating it.
She thinks dead people talk to her.
- Yeah, she thinks that she--
- Relives days.
- How did you know that?
- She told me, too. This morning.
It was a practice run for you, I think.
- And, yeah, it did sound crazy at first.
- Yeah.
Until I got some proof.
And suddenly it didn't seem so crazy.
It sounded miraculous.
- You got proof?
- Oh, yeah.
Tru sent me to talk to this woman, Emma.
She lives over on Bank Street.
- 95 Bank Street.
- And what did she tell you, Emma?
Well, I'm not really sure
I can do it justice...
but somehow she made everything clear.
Don't take my word for it.
Just go talk to her yourself.
I don't know, man.
- Bank Street?
- Yeah.
Yeah. Why not.
The things we do for love, huh?
And this Emma is a bit of an odd bird.
She tends to be more talkative if you go
over there without being empty- handed.
You know what I'm saying?
Learn from my mistake.
Flowers. Not candy.
Women.
- Great. Thanks, Jack.
- Any time.
So, your brother's gonna live.
Yes, he is. No thanks to you.
- Would it ring hollow to say I'm glad?
- Would it ring hollow to say I don't care?
Unfortunately, someone still has
to die today.
Try not to sound
so broken up about it, Jack.
I'm really sorry, Tru. Like I said...
there are parts of my job that sometimes
don't make me feel good about myself.
- What did you do to him?
- I didn't do anything. You did.
You told him who you are.
I just told him where he could get proof.
Emma? Come on, open up. Look, I'm sorry.
Ethan? You guys home? Hello?
Safe? What?
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Emma.
- She's not here right now. And you are?
- I'm Luc.
Nice flowers.
- You a friend of Emma's, Luc?
- No, actually we've never even met before.
Okay, why don't we try this again,
and how about the truth this time?
Are you a friend of my wife's, Luc?
- I think there's been some kind of mistake.
- Yeah, and you made it.
Was it worth it? I know she's good,
but was she worth your life, Luc?
I understand that you are upset,
but I have never met your wife before.
Then why do I see you, the two of you,
in my bed, and it makes me sick!
- It makes me want to--
- No, Donnie, please! Put the gun down.
- Listen to me.
- He's sleeping with her.
- No, he's not. It's all a misunderstanding.
- Tru, get out of here.
Donnie, please listen to me.
We'll all talk this out.
- I can't lose her.
- Now, I can handle this!
- Donnie, don't do this!
- Tru, get out of here! Tru, go!
- I'm so sorry.
- Please! Donnie, don't do this.
Please, no! Donnie, no!
Luc. Look at me.
- You're okay.
- I'm sorry, I didn't believe you.
No, Luc. Come on, it's gonna be fine.
I'll get help.
Just stay with me. Look at me, okay?
I love you, Tru.
No, please, don't, Luc.
Please just stay with me.
You're gonna be fine. Look at me.
Look at me, please!
Luc.
Luc, come on, please don't.
In certain hope of the resurrection
to eternal life through our Lord...
we commend to almighty God
our brother Luc Johnston.
And we commit his body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.
The Lord bless him and keep him.
The Lord make his face to shine upon him,
and be gracious unto him...
and give him peace. Amen.
I owe you my life.
Thank you.
Is there any chance that he'll ask?
Don't know. Don't think so.
- Wait here.
- Don't, Tru.
I take no pleasure from being right.
It's my turn to talk, so listen up.
My mother had the calling,
and she passed it on to me.
If you think for one minute that
I'm ever gonna stop, you're wrong.
So you'd better watch your back, buddy,
because it's on.
You should know one thing.
This is bigger than you think.
And you should know one thing.
You have no idea what you've begun.
I love you, too.
Get in.
So, tell me, what does my daughter know?
Nice to see you, too, Richard.
Why don't I start
with what she doesn't know.
That you once did what I do.
She's tough.
You'll have your work cut out for you.
- Just like I had with her mother.
- You won that one, didn't you?
Besides, I love a challenge.
Well, Jack, I believe you've got one.
<i>- Last season on</i> Tru Calling<i>:</i>
- In layman's terms...
...I relive days.
You relive days?
Jack, what you thought
was happening to you...
...it happens to me.
- I just wonder sometimes.
- About...?
Consequences.
Ripples in fate.
He is not like you.
He is the opposite of you.
- You save lives and he...
- Takes them.
You have no idea what you're doing.
You save someone who shouldn't
be here, there are consequences.
You think I'm messing up
some grand plan? Maybe I am the plan!
What's gonna keep us from
going in the same circles?
This weekend, let's talk.
About everything.
Okay.
Oh, Luc. Look at me.
Come on.
My mother had the calling,
and she passed it on to me.
If you think for one minute
that I am ever gonna stop, you're wrong.
You should know one thing.
This is bigger than you think.
You have no idea what you've begun.
Get in.
Tell me,
what does my daughter know?
Why don't I start with what she doesn't
know. That you once did what I do.
She's tough.
You'll have your work cut out for you.
- I love a challenge.
- Well, Jack...
...I believe you've got one.
- <i>Hello?</i>
- All right, I'm here.
We've been though this, Tru.
You know exactly what to do.
- Okay, I'm in.
- <i>Okay, good.</i>
<i>Now, remember where you need to go.</i>
- Johnson, 201.
- I don't see it.
Turn left, third door on the right.
And relax, you're good at this.
This is what you were meant to do.
I'm here, Davis. I made it.
<i>I can 't believe it.</i>
First day of med school.
Yeah, almost.
<i>What do you mean "almost"?</i>
Well, I'm only auditing. If it wasn't
for all those strings you pulled...
- <i>Tru, Tru, listen.</i>
- What?
It's okay to be proud of yourself.
Thanks, Davis. Bye.
- Harrison.
- <i>It's me.</i>
- I've got some interesting news.
- You found Jack?
No, one-track mind,
I haven't found Jack.
Forgive me.
When someone kills my boyfriend...
...then disappears for two months,
I get obsessed.
It's a good point. It's a good point,
but no. Dad's in town.
- Dad?
- Okay, everyone, take your seats.
<i>Yeah, he wants to have lunch.</i>
<i>Wouldn 't say why.</i>
Hey, listen, I really gotta run.
I'm gonna be late for another delivery.
Oh. Might wanna congratulate me.
Six weeks on a job.
It's a personal best.
- Congrats, Harry.
- Ms. Davies?
I gotta go. Yes, professor.
Just because your coroner friend
used his pull to get you into my class...
...doesn't mean you won't be held
to the same standards as real students.
- Real students? I am a real student.
- Okay.
Perhaps you'd care to tell me which
artery terminates as a nasopalatine artery.
I, uh...
It's a maxillary artery. You're
in medical school now, Ms. Davies.
You only have one decision to make. Are
you committed to saving lives or not?
- Yes, I'm committed.
- How reassuring for all of us.
Now, moving on to things
that actually matter...
- Are you moving here?
- Crime's up.
Business is good for a defense attorney.
An office in the city was a natural.
- What about Jordan and the kids?
- Weekends.
It's not ideal, but they understand.
So tell me, how's Tru doing?
I know how upset she was
after what happened to Luc.
She's tough. She'll feel better
once she finds out who killed him.
Promise me something:
You won't let her get too obsessed.
It's too late.
Enough small talk.
I wanna tell you why I asked you here.
Since I'm opening an office,
I need some help.
Investigators, researchers,
resourceful young people.
Like yourself.
Wait, are you offering me a job?
What do you say?
Wanna come work for the old man?
- You turned it down?
- Yeah. I told you, I got a job.
And I know it might not be glamorous,
but it's legit.
And it's mine. I did it on my own.
You know, what's funny is,
my whole life, I just wished Dad...
...would start acting like a real father.
And now that he is, I don't need him.
- Oh, no. No, no. Wait, wait.
- What's wrong?
What...? The van. The van.
I parked it right here, the company van.
- Is it towed?
- No, no, not towed.
I fed the meter and everything. What...?
Glass. Broken glass.
Somebody stole it.
They stole it, Tru. They stole the...
Oh!
Personal business. Personal business.
I'm cooked. They're gonna can me, Tru.
- Okay, just relax, okay? Just...
- Relax? Look, I love that job.
I'm good at it. Damn it.
You see that? You see what happens?
I try to live an honest life, and look.
We'll think of something,
I promise, okay?
Just call in sick,
and I promise you we'Il...
- What?
- <i>Hey, I think your guy's here.</i>
- <i>Took 10 grand off me.</i>
- Right now?
- <i>Yeah. I'll stall him if you want.</i>
- Okay, cool. All right, thanks.
- Hey, that was my bookie.
- Uh, about the honest life...
Let me finish.
Someone matching Jack's description
showed up to collect 10 big ones.
- Where?
- 111 Grand Street.
He's stalling him till you get there.
But, hey, what you are you gonna do
when you get there? Tru. Tru!
You're welcome.
What the hell was that, Jack?
Tru. What a nice surprise.
Kids today. Not even a thank-you.
So, what, now you save lives?
One, who's to say that truck
would've actually killed her?
And two, why do you look
so surprised?
Because you take lives,
you don't save them.
I guess you don't listen so well, Tru.
I preserve fate.
Until a day restarts,
I'm no different than him or her...
...or you.
- Oh, you are different.
I don't kill someone's boyfriend
and then disappear for two months.
Living in the past can be so debilitating,
don't you think?
You thought killing Luc
would make me stop?
Well, guess what,
it only made me stronger.
Preaching to the choir.
I saw you myself all summer.
All those people fated to die
that you saved.
That's right. I didn't lose once.
While you did what, exactly?
- Traveled. Relaxed.
- Death took a holiday?
But you know what I did
more than anything, Tru?
I hoped. I hoped that you would
come to your senses.
I hoped that you would find a way
to stop saving people...
...who are supposed to die.
Correction, who are supposed to live.
Don't you see? I gave you a gift.
I gave you the perfect excuse
to walk away.
Actually, you gave me
every reason to stay.
So here we are.
Right back where we started.
Later, Tru. Catch you on the rewind.
- I'll be waiting.
- Unless I get there first.
Help me.
He's back, Davis.
He's come back to stop me.
You're ready. Nothing to worry about.
You're prepared for this.
Okay. So why do you look so worried?
I'm not worried. I'm curious.
Was she surprised to see you?
I think there's some bigger surprises in
store for her, Richard, wouldn't you say?
Look, I told you, I can handle her.
You don't need to move here.
And I told you, Jack,
I know my daughter.
And you're gonna need
all the help you can get.
I have plenty of help.
You. Harrison, if need be.
But this is my calling, a job
I was chosen to do. I can beat him.
Are you ready?
Because I'm certain she is.
Oh, you're proud of her. That's cute.
But I gave her a chance to stop,
and she didn't take it.
- So I'll stop her myself.
- Confidence.
You remind me of myself
when I had your job.
Except I won.
Until the day restarts, you've done
all you can. I gotta get upstairs.
I'm running late
for my psych evaluation.
Right, with the staff shrink.
Good luck, Davis.
Well, it's just a formality.
Tom Jordan and I are old friends.
Tom's been representing me for years.
- Okay, Tom, let's get this over with.
- "Get this over with"?
- Oh, I'm looking for Tom Jordan.
- He's gone on indefinite medical leave.
- Oh, I didn't know he was sick.
- Yeah.
Oh. I'm sorry, how rude. I'm Dr. Carrie
Allen. I'm his replacement.
- And you must be...
- I'm Davis.
Davis. Here.
- You are two hours late, Dr. Davis.
- It's actually just Davis.
Oh. I actually assumed that you
weren't going to show up at all.
No, I like psychological tests.
Ink blots and such. Call me crazy.
I know you're probably nervous
about this.
But the wonderful thing about my test:
There are no wrong answers.
- Okay.
- All I need you to do...
...is look at this picture and tell me
the first thing that pops into your head.
- No wrong answers?
- No wrong answers.
That is the lost continent of Atlantis and
the puppy that I never got as a child.
Yeah, I think he should take the job,
Dad, but you know Harry.
- He likes to do things on his own.
- Incoming.
Right, Dad, but look, I gotta go.
I'll call you later, okay?
My father, Ward Cleaver
all of a sudden.
Oh, no. Cop.
Harbor Patrol officer. She died
answering a distress call in the bay.
Kate Wilson responded to an SOS call
at 3:07 p.m.
Some college kids lost control
of a boat called the <i>Green Hornet</i>.
- Sounds routine.
- Would've been.
- Except for the white squall.
- White squall?
A storm that comes unexpectedly,
no real warning...
...till, bang, you're in the middle of it.
- A swell knocked her overboard.
- What about her partner?
Couldn't get to her. Waves were too
rough. It's a miracle he didn't drown.
That'd be me. Duty calls.
- She's all yours, Tru. See you.
- Later.
Lost consciousness
when hypothermia set in.
Fluid in her lungs. No surprise there.
Keep that up,
you won't need me here anymore.
- Yeah, that will be the day.
- No, I'm serious.
It's nice to know
if anything happens to me...
...that you could take over
on your own.
- Look, is this about Jack?
- It's not about Jack. Jack.
- It's about Carrie.
- Carrie?
Dr. Allen. Tom Jordan's replacement.
My psychological test
didn't go over too well...
...and she's requested more testing.
What does that mean?
- Could mean, you know, nothing.
- Or?
Or it could mean that I'm...
...crazy, clinically speaking.
And if the test results show that,
then I won't be here anymore.
- They won't let me.
- No, that's not possible.
Actually, it is.
First I get humiliated at med school,
then Jack shows up and now this.
What next?
Save me.
Here we go again.
- It's me.
- <i>Why are you calling now?</i>
- You're not due in class for three hours.
- I know. It's one of those days.
- Okay. Who's the lucky victim?
- Kate Wilson, Harbor Patrol.
She died in a white squall.
Whoa. You don't hear about that every
day. Need an address or something?
No, already got one. I did my homework.
She starts work any minute.
<i>Okay, what can I do for you?</i>
You can listen very carefully, because
you missed quite a day yesterday.
Jack came back,
my father moved to town...
<i>... and you flunked your psych exam.</i>
What? Tom Jordan
would never flunk me.
No, but his replacement would.
Dr. Carrie Allen, the new staff shrink.
What, a woman?
Well, did I find her attractive?
Because if I did, that would explain a lot.
Hey, Davis, I gotta go.
Stupid question.
Of course I found her attractive.
- Officer Wilson?
- Yes?
Hey, I'm Tru Davies.
I'm interested in Harbor Patrol,
I'm told you're the woman to talk to.
- And who told you that?
- Question is, who didn't?
I've asked around,
and you've got a lot of fans.
Nice to see the checks
have been clearing.
I would love to pick your brain,
get some pointers on the exam.
Kate, let's get a move on.
I'm late for my patrol. But tell you what,
I have a lunch break at 1.
Meet me here, and I'll tell you
what you need to know.
Great, thank you. I'll see you at 1.
- <i>Hey</i>.
- Hey, Harry, it's me.
That's so weird.
I was just about to call you.
- I know. That's why I called you first.
- <i>Oh, got it. One of those days.</i>
All right, what do I need to know?
Just try to act surprised
when Dad offers you a job.
A job? Really?
- Well, did I take it?
<i>- No, you turned it down.</i>
But let the old man down easy.
He took it pretty hard.
Well, see, that's great,
because they love me at this job.
Yeah, well, maybe not for long.
What did I do?
Look, your van got stolen
while you were at lunch.
The day rewound before I talked to you
again. My advice is, move the van.
<i>All right, consider it moved.</i>
Ms. Davies, good of you to join us.
- Yeah. I'm really sorry.
- Ms. Davies...
...just because your coroner friend
used his pull to get you into my class...
...doesn't mean you won't be held
to the same standards as real students.
- Real students? I am a real student.
- Okay.
Then tell me, which artery terminates
at the nasopalatine artery?
That would be the maxillary artery.
Of course, the nasopalatine itself ends
as the posterior septal branches...
...after it crosses under the surface
of the sphenoid. Ballpark?
Yes. That's right.
That's absolutely right.
There's nothing doing out here today.
What do you say we head back?
- What's that?
- Hold on, give them a second.
Go.
- Come on.
- I'm going in.
Kate!
Come on.
Come on, Kate.
You saved my life.
I have no idea what happened. I was just
paddling along, and next thing I knew...
- You're fine now. Everything's okay.
- You're a very lucky man.
Don't I know it.
Thanks.
The things we take for granted, huh?
Never a dull moment.
Ow.
Come here, let me see.
You must've smacked your head
when you tipped. Sit down.
Thank God you were out there.
The last thing I remember is getting
in my kayak. Next thing, lights out.
- Don't get on the water much, do you?
- What gave it away?
Well, the truth is, my sister's sailing
into town tonight...
...and when we get together,
a boat race is inevitable.
So I figured I'd polish up on my skills
before she got into town.
Guess I'm getting a little old to let
the competitive spirit get the best of me.
Oh, where are my manners?
I'm... I'm Jack Harper.
- Hey. Kate Wilson.
- Hey.
Maybe next time you should
just let your sister win by forfeit.
Well, thanks to you,
there will be a next time.
Officer Wilson?
- Yes, Mr. Harper?
- Um...
Here's the deal. Believe it or not, you're
not the first person who saved my life.
I didn't save your life.
The first person was a trauma surgeon
in Irvine, California.
Pulled a bullet out of my neck
and sutured arteries...
...so I wouldn't bleed to death.
- I'm sorry.
The point is, by the time
I came out of the coma...
...Dr. Trakk had been
transferred back East...
...and I never got the chance to say
thank you. Not the right way, anyway.
So I swore to myself
that if I was ever unlucky enough...
...to need someone
to save my life again...
...I would find a way
to express my gratitude properly.
Your kayak flipped.
Chances are, you would've pulled
yourself out if I hadn't come along.
Well, at least let me buy you lunch.
Lunch? Um...
Let me get my things together and...
- You can wait a moment?
- I got nothing but time.
Kate?
- Oh, hi, Tru.
- Ready for that cup of coffee?
Oh, damn. I'm sorry,
it completely slipped my mind.
I just made lunch plans
with Mr. Harper.
Hey.
Jack Harper.
Officer Wilson just fished me
out of the bay.
- What a shame.
- Tru's interested in joining Harbor Patrol.
Oh.
- Bored with your day job?
- Just looking for some new challenges.
I see. Competition at work's
not to your liking.
It's fine. It's just not as good
as it thinks it is.
Look, why don't we just reschedule.
I can meet you any morning next week.
- No, we can't.
- We can't?
This entrance exam is next week,
and we really need to talk.
- And we will, just not right now.
- Kate, really, this is more complicated...
Officer, if this lady's bothering you,
I could call someone.
Thanks, I'm fine. Listen,
I don't know what your deal is...
...but do us both a favor
and find someone else to help you.
I'm gonna put my things away.
- Meet you in the office?
- Okay.
Ah, the eager recruit. A classic.
Too bad it's not gonna work.
Too bad she didn't let you drown.
You know, I missed this, Tru.
I really did.
You can be so entertaining
when you're losing.
- You haven't won anything yet.
- No. No, I haven't.
But the beauty of my job is,
I don't have to change anything.
I merely have to prevent you
from changing anything.
And from where I sit,
Kate's day is right on course.
Feeling pretty good about yourself
right about now?
Yeah, I'm getting there.
Anyway, it's been lovely to see you, Tru,
but I'm late for a lunch date.
And don't worry, I'll make sure
Kate's last meal is a memorable one.
No one should die
on an empty stomach.
Look, the day is very young.
No reason you can't win this one.
Two hours to go, Davis. Kate died after
answering an SOS at 3:07 yesterday.
So far, I've done nothing
to change that.
- What's Jack up to?
- Probably his shrimp appetizer.
- He took Kate to lunch.
- Winning the war of hearts and minds.
<i>It's hard to convince people</i>
<i>they're in danger.</i>
It's that much harder
with Jack working against you.
Okay, well, if you can't stop Kate
from answering the distress call...
...then maybe you can stop
the distress call itself.
Right. There's no danger
if there's no one to save.
Some college kids lost control
of a boat called the <i>Green Hornet</i>.
Thanks, I'm on it.
Just one thing I need you to do.
- Yeah? What's that?
- Find a way to ground Kate's boat.
You mean ground the police boat?
Yeah, we have to cover our bases
and stay one step ahead of Jack.
Well, you're one step ahead of me.
You can't ground a police boat, Tru.
You'll think of something,
I know you will. All right? Okay, bye.
People think I'm crazy
around here. Jeez.
She's a beauty. Fiberglass hull,
Evinrude engine.
Yeah, it's my father's.
Thinks of it as the son he never had.
- So can I help you with something?
- Actually, I think I can help you.
I'm a volunteer with the Harbor Patrol.
There's a storm advisory for the bay...
...so we're grounding
all recreational crafts.
- You're kidding me.
- I wish I was.
Hasn't exactly made me
Miss Popularity today.
No, I mean...
Man, I thought he was nuts.
- What's that?
- I'm guessing you're Tru, right?
Yeah.
Some guy paid me a visit this morning,
said you might stop by today.
- And he told me to give you this.
- A guy?
Said you'd try to ruin my trip.
Something about a storm.
I thought he was crazy.
No, you have to trust me.
It's not safe out there today.
With people like you around, the bay
sounds like the safest place I could be.
Hey, this is Harrison.
Stolen? What? You're kidding.
Ground a police boat.
Ground a police boat.
Okay.
Hi, this is Admiral McNulty
of the Fifth Fleet.
I was pulling in port today.
I couldn't help but notice...
...a vessel, starboard side,
that was...
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Dr. Allen.
- Tom Jordan's replacement.
- Oh, God. My psych evaluation.
Can you hold on a second?
Yeah, you're about a half an hour late,
so I decided to come down...
...and see what was keeping you.
And now I know.
You were making phony phone calls.
- It's not... It's not what you think it is.
- Really?
Why don't go ahead and explain it
to me then, admiral.
It's a funny story, actually. The...
- Okay, maybe it's not that funny. It's...
- The good news, doctor?
I don't think you'll be needing
that psych evaluation after all...
...because I'm thinking that I have
all the answers that I need.
Hello? Yeah, I'm still here.
- Thanks again for lunch.
- Thanks again for saving my life.
Hey, I know this might sound
a little forward...
...but there's a street festival downtown
that's supposed to be a ton of fun.
I know that look. You're flattered,
but you have a girl...
...who wouldn't appreciate me
asking you out.
You're right, I do have a girl.
My sister's sailing into town tonight,
and we have a lot of catching up to do.
Sure. Right. Anyway,
it's none of my business, so...
But...
...I am free all day tomorrow.
Great.
Me too.
Kate! Come on, let's go.
But you should probably leave.
If they see me loafing anymore...
...they'll dry-dock me.
I won't be able to make any rescues.
- Right. Well, we wouldn't want that.
- See you tomorrow.
Tomorrow. Right.
- Kate, hi.
- Tru, we are way past amusing here.
You have to listen to me.
It's not safe for you out there today.
Maybe this job isn't for you,
but it's what I do. I save people.
- Like Jack Harper?
- Yeah, exactly.
Things aren't always as they seem.
- Are you saying I didn't save Jack?
- I'm saying things can be deceiving.
Like right now, the water's calm,
but that can change so quickly.
- So?
- A storm can come on without warning.
- A white squall or...
- A white squall?
Tru, you've been watching
too many movies.
The weather's beautiful. We haven't had
a distress call since this morning.
Responded to an SOS call at 3:07 p.m.
<i>Mayday!</i>
<i>This is the</i> Green Hornet<i>. Our location:</i>
<i>We're just past the drilling platform.</i>
<i>We're taking on water. We're in trouble.</i>
- This is Harbor Patrol. We're on our way.
- Kate. Kate, wait.
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
Today's no different.
- But it is. Let me come with you.
- Should I answer, or is laughter enough?
Come on, let's go.
I know what it's like to wanna save
people, but we can't save everyone.
Well, maybe you can't, but I can.
<i>Green Hornet</i>, this is Harbor Patrol.
Restate your position.
<i>We're just past the drilling</i>
<i>platform. Please hurry, the engine's dead.</i>
<i>Green Hornet</i>, can you hear me?
<i>Green Hornet</i>? Damn it!
Oh, my God.
- What the hell is that?
- She was right.
We can't go into that.
We won't come out.
We have to. They need us.
We have to.
<i>This is the Coast Guard.</i>
<i>Spotted the vessel. Got a tow line.</i>
<i>Bringing her in. Over.</i>
Coast Guard, this is Harbor Patrol.
Do you need assistance? Over.
<i>Under control. Got a tip</i>
<i>from Admiral McNulty, Fifth Fleet.</i>
- <i>Didn 't know there was a Fifth Fleet.</i>
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- You're okay.
- Coast Guard took the call.
Someone called in a tip.
Good one, Davis.
You know, I'm not quite sure
what you're all about...
...but I trust you're gonna
leave me alone now?
Gladly.
Who says I can't save everyone?
- <i>Hello</i>?
- Nice call on the Coast Guard.
- I didn't think they had jurisdiction.
- They don't. I was very convincing.
- What time do you have?
- Four-fifteen. Tru?
- What?
- Kate is safe. You averted her death.
- You did all you were supposed to do.
- The rules have changed. Jack is back.
Until I have him in my sights,
I can't trust that I've won.
He has to be here.
Jack saved this little girl yesterday
at exactly 4: 16.
If his job really is to preserve fate,
then he has to save her again today.
That's right. In Jack's view, letting
someone die who's meant to live...
...is just as bad as letting someone live
who was meant to die.
Well, let's hope he's as good at his job
as he thinks he is.
Okay, Davis, it's showtime.
Hey.
Your skateboard, you don't have it.
Some guy just bought it from me
for $50.
Jack.
Sorry for being so pushy...
...but just couldn't stay away.
It's really starting
to come down out there.
I thought you had plans tonight.
I did, but my sister called.
She's running late...
...so looks like I'm free.
That's funny, so am I. I asked some guy
out this afternoon, but he said no.
Now, what kind of fool would do that?
Okay, listen, I get off shift
in about 10 minutes.
- So you think you can wait?
- You bet.
Okay.
<i>Mayday.</i>
<i>This is a fishing vessel.</i> Cloud One.
Excuse me.
Harbor Patrol. Please state the position
and nature of your emergency. Over.
<i>There's a boat.</i>
<i>It's out in the storm. It's flipping.</i>
Please state your position. Over.
<i>Just past the buoy</i>
<i>at the mouth of the bay.</i>
- And the boat, can you identify it?
- <i>No, wait.</i>
<i>It's the</i> Jezebel.
<i>That's what it's called.</i>
The <i>Jezebel</i>? No, that's the ship
my sister's sailing in on tonight.
They were running late,
but everything was fine.
<i>Harbor Patrol, there's a girl.</i>
<i>She's overboard. She's in the water.</i>
Harbor Patrol's responding.
- Kate.
- It's my job, Jack.
Harbor Patrol.
How did I know
you were gonna answer?
- How did I know you'd be calling?
- What did you say?
What did you say
to get her back out there?
- She's saving my sister, Tru.
- Your sister's dead.
Oops.
Kate Wilson was fated to die
this afternoon, Jack, and I saved her.
Yes. Yes, you did.
But the day's not over yet...
...and therefore, my window
of opportunity is still open.
And luckily for me...
...this storm just keeps getting worse.
- <i>Kate helps people. She saves lives.</i>
Good people have to die too, Tru.
You know that as well as I.
You say you're not a killer, but what
the hell do you call what you're doing?
My job.
Later, Tru.
Really not a good time, Harry.
But you will not believe what happened.
- They stole the van again?
- No, not that. That's not the problem.
See, apparently, the Gerber brothers,
they run some sort of scam.
Yeah, they boost their own van,
and they collect the insurance money.
Yeah. I parked in a secured lot,
and almost screwed up the whole thing.
<i>Here I thought I was, like,</i>
<i>living this clean life.</i>
But no. No, I've been working for crooks
the entire time.
- I'm sorry, Harry, but I'll call you later.
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
Don't worry. She's gonna be fine.
This is what I do.
I'm sorry, that... I've just been
wanting to do that all day.
- Kate?
- Yeah?
We'll have dinner another time.
- Yeah?
- <i>Everything back on track?</i>
I almost thought you really saw her boat
out there, Richard. I'm impressed.
I'm glad to be of help, Jack,
but next time, do it yourself.
Pan-Pan. Pan-Pan.
This is Harbor Patrol.
Pan-Pan. This is Harbor Patrol. Damn.
No!
No!
Kate.
Kate. Hang on, I'm coming.
Hang on, Kate.
Got you.
Just hold on, Kate, I've got you.
Come on.
Come on, Kate, it's okay.
Okay. You're gonna be okay.
Thank you.
Here. You're all right.
Doctor.
Hi. I was just getting ready
to go upstairs to apologize.
I'm sorry about
what happened in there.
Really? I was just on my way down
to tell you not to bother.
I spent the evening
going through your file, doctor.
- Oh, boy, my file.
- And you know what I found?
Glowing personnel reviews,
meritorious raises...
...and commendations from everybody,
from the mayor to the chief of police.
- My file?
- So, what I'm saying is, doctor...
...if you feel the need to do crazy things
now and again to blow off steam...
...well, maybe somebody has to be
a little crazy...
...to work here in the first place.
I'm saying I think
the evaluation can wait.
Yeah. Yeah.
And I don't think that we've been
properly introduced.
Hi.
- I'm Dr. Carrie Allen.
- I'm Davis.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
I am so glad you changed your mind.
It's gonna be great working together.
Yes. It will be great
to make an honest living.
Listen, maybe this job is gonna give us,
I don't know...
...a chance to make up for lost time,
for my mistakes.
There is still a lot we can learn
from each other.
- Yeah.
- About each other.
- What?
- Wouldn't it be ironic if you and I...
...were a lot more alike
than people thought?
- Refill?
- No. I'm gonna get out of here.
I wanna be fresh,
impress that new boss.
Yeah.
See you tomorrow.
- You got sloppy today.
- Thanks, coach.
Don't take it so hard.
I told you she was good.
Well, at least one of us won today.
- Harrison?
- Signed and sealed. Starts tomorrow.
- Gonna tell him?
- In time.
I just told him I'm proud of him.
One bombshell at a time.
He's a good kid. He'll be an asset.
But he does love his sister,
and that bond is stronger than you think.
So's the bond between father and son.
Night, Jack. Get some rest.
Apparently, you'll be needing it.
I thought I heard you come in.
I beat him, Davis. I beat Jack.
Saved Kate, gave fate what it wanted.
So why doesn't it feel like enough?
Because it wasn't Luc.
Is that how it goes? I save strangers,
but I lose the people I love?
- Tru...
- Sorry. I'm fine, really.
- It was a momentary lapse of...
- Humanity.
Anyway, it's late. I better go.
Good night, Davis.
Night. Oh, by the way...
...what did Jack say
when he realized you beat him?
Don't know.
But I wish I could've been there.
<i>Previously on</i> Tru Calling:
You're in medical school now.
Are you committed
to saving lives or not?
Yes, I'm committed.
Don't you see? I gave you a gift.
I gave you the perfect excuse
to walk away.
Actually, you gave me
every reason to stay.
You missed quite a day. Jack came back,
and my father moved to town.
Are you offering me a job?
What do you say?
Wanna work come for the old man?
He does love his sister,
and that bond is stronger than you think.
So's the bond between father and son.
Good people have to die too, Tru.
You know that as well as I.
You say you're not a killer.
What do you call what you're doing?
My job.
Every cadaver has a story.
Treat it with respect...
...and you will be privileged
to learn from it.
Break into groups. Four to a cadaver.
Excuse me.
Are you the girl who answered Seidel's
trick question and made him look bad?
- I don't know if I made him look bad.
- Guys, this is her. We want you.
How awkward. She means
for our lab group. We need a fourth.
- And you want me?
- Absolutely.
You cut Seidel off at the knees,
which was so hot.
Obviously, you're brilliant,
and because you're auditing...
...you're not gonna affect
the grade curve.
Tyler says
that you're the perfect woman.
- Jensen.
- Tru.
You got a really deft hand
with that duodenum.
I suppose you hear that
all the time though.
Thanks. Sorry, I work nights.
It was a long shift.
- Didn't get much sleep.
- You must get jaded quickly...
...if you're yawning in a room
with dead bodies.
- What is with this bag?
- What's wrong with the bag?
- It's a gift for Lexi.
- Jensen looked up from his books...
...Iong enough to get a girlfriend.
We were all very relieved.
- "Essence of Roses."
- Essence of Roses.
Avery, what...? What are you doing?
I can't put it on myself.
What if I don't like it?
I don't need you to analyze it.
I need you to tell me if it's a gift
that says I care about you...
...or that you smell bad.
I don't know, it depends
on where she sprays it.
Nice. Very nice.
That's no way to handle
a gallbladder, Mr. Lee.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Lexi's perfume.
I'm sorry.
Hey, smells better than formaldehyde.
What is that smell?
What smell?
It smells like roses and formaldehyde.
- So, Harry, what's with the camera?
- Oh, it's nothing.
Just my first solo gig
at Dad's law firm.
The training wheels are off, baby.
Check it.
These two guys got in a fight
on a golf course...
...and one of them is filing an A&B.
- A&B?
- Yeah, assault and battery charge.
He claims he was too hurt
that he couldn't leave the house.
Well, I happen to know
that he's a major hockey fan...
...and he's got tickets
to tonight's game.
So you're gonna be taking shots of him
jumping up and high-fiving his friends.
And when I lay those pictures down
on Dad's desk, he's gonna love me.
Love me.
I'm glad you are getting along.
I know how much that means to you.
Yeah, it's great. You know, you two
are getting along, right?
And... I don't know, maybe we were
just too hard on him.
Maybe.
- Hi, mind if I join you?
- Oh, Dr. Allen.
- No, go ahead.
- Oh, you can sit down.
Oh, damn.
- I forgot to ask for sugar.
- Oh, have one of mine.
- Oh, shoot.
- Is it all right?
Yeah, it's just a little
wool-polyester fiber.
Mmm.
Did you get the memo
about the fire drill?
- No, I didn't.
- Tomorrow afternoon.
I like to warn people because
sometimes that alarm goes off...
...at the most inconvenient times,
when you're in the toilet...
...or you're elbow deep
in someone's chest cavity, and...
Well, I suppose I should go back
across the street.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Bye.
Thanks.
I'm just cursed. I'm just...
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.
When the saints were around
my cradle, they said:
"He will be able to analyze 60 kinds
of bullet wounds...
...but when it comes
to conversational skills, none."
I thought you didn't even like
small talk.
- I hate small talk.
- So then why would it bother you if...?
Ah.
What was that? What was that "ah"?
It's just an "ah," Davis.
There's no agenda.
Okay.
- Harry.
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>
- I got those pictures.
- Congratulations.
Yeah, it came at a price though.
The guy's got a mean right hook.
- Ouch.
- It's worth it. I can't wait to show Dad.
I am so happy for you.
I'll call you later, okay?
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Bye.
- Yeah, about the "ah"...
- Talk to her again.
Find a topic you can both
get excited about.
I find that my interests don't overlap
with the rest of humanity's.
Okay. Thomas Burrell, M.D.
Looks like a note he
scribbled to himself.
- What is it, a grocery list?
- "Varden"...
...and an arrow pointing to "DSM3."
Must be a psychiatrist.
- How do you figure?
- Well, you see...
Please.
Help me.
That's no way to hold
a gallbladder, Mr. Lee.
I am so sorry.
I'll thank you not to bring your feminine
trinkets into the lab, Miss Davies.
No. I'm sorry, I'll go tell him
it was mine.
It's all right, but I have to go.
Is it me, or does Tru seem
a little abrupt?
Help me.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Is he in?
- Yes, go on in.
Thanks.
I rewound.
- Got it. Day two. Cause of death?
- Shot in the back at Fourth Street Market.
What's your strategy?
My daughter is expecting you...
...and her record's been good since Luc,
which was a stretch of the rules.
I told you. Luc was meant as a lesson.
Not a lesson she seems
to have learned from.
I am not losing this guy to Jack.
- You did well against him last time.
- <i>That's the point.</i>
There's an opportunity here
to take things to another level.
Learn from the mistake you made
with her mother.
- Marrying her?
- Killing her.
We know that won't help.
The ability only goes to someone else.
No, Tru has to be rendered powerless.
And I have an idea
on how we can do that.
- Who's the victim?
- Thomas Burrell, M.D.
Must be a psychiatrist.
His office is at...
...87 Third Street.
- I'm going straight there.
Maybe I can head him off
before he goes to the market.
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you...
...but your receptionist
seems to be away.
Oh. Um...
Well, I'm sure she'll be back
in a minute.
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.
L... I've been going through
a lot of changes lately...
...and I was thinking maybe it's time
to talk to someone about them.
- Could you be more specific, Mr...?
- Goodwin.
- Paul Goodwin.
- Dr. Burrell.
What do you hope to get
out of therapy, Paul?
Well, I have
a very high-stress job...
...and I wouldn't mind learning
some coping skills.
May I ask what it is you do?
You might say I'm a repo man.
People cheat, try to hold on
to what's no longer theirs...
...and when that happens,
I come and take it back.
Well, I can see
where that might be stressful.
People must get angry with you
all the time.
They do. They fail to realize
that what I do isn't personal.
Laws are there for a reason.
- Someone has to say no.
- Mm-hm.
Well, Tuesday at 5 for a beginning?
- Great.
- Good.
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
I don't know where Jan's gone.
This is Dr. Burrell. May I help you?
I see. And who made the referral?
Thanks, I'm ready.
No. That shouldn't be a problem at all.
I'll just lighten my caseload.
No, I tell you what.
Well, Jan's out of the office right now.
When she gets back I'll just get her
to move some things around.
No. No problem. You're welcome.
Hi. You know what, I gotta run.
Tuesday at 5, right?
- That'll be fine.
- Great.
I should mention, I've got an ex-girlfriend
who's just a little <i>Fatal Attraction</i>.
She cornered my last shrink
with a lot of questions.
Claimed the doctor
was in some sort of "danger."
She was trying to invade my privacy,
you know?
No, I promise you, I take doctor-patient
confidentiality very seriously.
I figured that. Thanks, doc.
See you Tuesday.
Dr. Burrell.
Oh, you're too late.
The good doctor just left.
How do you know these things?
How do you get to a victim
before I do?
Does Apple tell Microsoft?
We're not business rivals.
This is about people's lives, Jack.
Our business is people's lives, Tru.
I'm not gonna stand here
arguing with you...
...because I've got a job to do.
Love the perfume.
See you.
- Dr. Burrell.
- Yes?
I need to talk to you.
It's an emergency.
- Would you mind coming with me?
- Coming where?
I can't talk here,
but it'll only take a minute.
If you wanna talk,
make an appointment with my office.
No, there isn't time.
Dr. Burrell.
Dr. Burrell.
- Police!
- My God!
She killed that man!
No, I...
Hands in the air. You're under arrest.
I didn't do it. Someone shot him,
and they're getting away.
They were arguing.
She shot him when he turned.
- It did look like that.
- I was only talking to him.
- Ma'am, your name would be?
- Kelly Robson.
Tru, what's the deal?
I thought you were supposed to be
the responsible one.
Handcuffs?
No problem. I see this all the time.
If you're in this predicament again,
a good penknife will get you out.
I don't usually carry a penknife.
Well, any sharp blade will do.
How many times
have you been in these?
You know what? Don't answer that.
What's that smell?
- Hi.
- I'm in trouble.
I tried to stop the murder,
but things didn't go well.
- <i>I need to see you.</i>
- I would advise against that.
Are there, by any chance, cops there?
That would be correct.
I'm sorry that we won't
be seeing each other today.
I got to him too late. Jack was there.
He set me up.
It all happened so quickly.
I was standing there
listening to him lie to the police...
...so I got out of Dodge.
Sometimes situations like this
can have a legal solution.
- You want me to turn myself in?
- No.
I think he wants me to talk to Dad.
Well, he's got a point, Tru.
Dad's a criminal-defense lawyer.
I mean, this is what he does.
Okay, message received.
I'd better go. Call you later.
- Okay.
- Who was that?
That was my contractor.
He's working on my bathroom...
...and he said
he'd have it ready today, but...
They never show up.
- Dad, something happened.
- I know. The police were here.
Come sit with me.
Honey, you're gonna
have to tell me everything.
- Son, would you mind waiting outside?
- No, it's okay.
Harrison, please.
Sure. Yeah. Outside.
Dad, this is all a setup. I didn't do it.
You should know that the police
have already begun investigating you.
They found your name
in his appointment book for therapy.
- They know you were his patient.
- I wasn't his patient.
They also found a file
with your name on it in his office.
I never even met this man
before he was killed.
A number of witnesses say
they saw you having...
...an argument with this man.
What was that about?
I never had a gun when I was arrested.
Does that mean anything?
Prosecutions go ahead
without the weapon.
A place that crowded, people tramping
through the crime scene...
...anybody could've kicked it,
anyone could've picked it up.
The police will not see that as significant
because they have a witness.
This witness is the man that framed me.
His name is Jack Harper.
He's looking for a way
to bring me down.
Why would he wanna do that?
Because we have this past, Dad.
It's complicated.
Dad, why did you ask Harrison
to step outside?
Because I thought you might have
something to tell me...
...that you wouldn't want him to hear.
I have to go.
Tru.
- He thinks I'm guilty.
- No. You just misunderstood him.
Harry, he believes that I killed someone,
that I'm a murderer.
He must've had his mind made up
before I got there.
I was stupid to expect
that just because he's my father...
I'm on my own in this.
No. Look, you are not
on your own, okay?
You got me.
I'm not some hotshot lawyer, okay?
But I know people.
I know a guy who can get us
some fake IDs, passports.
We can go to Mexico, Thailand. Really.
I'll find a job.
You could look for an opening
at a morgue.
There's dead people
all over the world, right?
I don't think it'll work, but thank you.
Come on, let's go.
- Good job.
- It is the humanitarian approach.
What harm could she do behind bars
for the next 50 years?
Okay, so she could save a few felons,
I'll give her that.
Did you know that when
the guillotine was invented...
...the idea came from a physician?
Dr. Guillotin.
He thought that was humanitarian too.
Well, it was quick.
You sure you can talk?
- You okay?
<i>- Usually, if the day were this bad...</i>
...I'd do it over,
except I'm doing it over already.
Burrell's body got here a half-hour ago.
Okay, you'll find a piece of paper
on the body.
And there's a note scribbled.
"Varden" and "DSM3."
You knew he was a psychiatrist
from what you found on the body.
- How's that possible?
- It must be the DSM3.
That's the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical</i>
<i>Manual of Disorders.</i>
It's kind of the bible
of psychiatric diagnosis.
It's weird, though, because the third
edition was replaced by number four...
...back in the '90s.
Is any of this helping you, or...?
I wish I could say it was.
Because I have this crazy idea, I guess.
Right now, I'm so open.
Well, if you can get in contact
with Burrell's body...
...he might ask for help again.
And that way your day could restart,
and you can get yourself...
...out of this mess. It's a long shot,
but it may be the only shot we have.
The problem is that there's still
way too many police here.
If I can't get to the body,
maybe you could bring it to me.
Well, I find that cadavers
tend to get noticed in public.
I know one place
where they're old news.
The anatomy lab on campus.
It should be empty right now.
- <i>I'll meet you there</i>.
- Okay.
Yeah, and fleeing to Thailand
was a crazy idea.
Look, I can do this on my own,
but they'll be searching for my car.
Lend me yours?
I'm driving.
Hey.
So some alone time
with Mr. Gorenstein?
Yeah, I'm just reviewing
this morning's work. What about you?
- Me? Same thing.
- Well, pull up a stool.
Wouldn't you rather pull up a stool
at the coffee shop, say?
- Are you asking me out for coffee?
- No, I'm just confused is all.
I mean, you seem like the last person
in our class who'd need to review.
I mean, you're brilliant.
You graduated college early,
masters in chemistry.
Teachers are already impressed with you,
so take a break.
Did Avery tell you that
in the two minutes it took me...
...to get sponges this morning?
- Maybe.
- Yeah.
It's not the professors
I really need to convince.
Heard of the Bettendorf Clinic?
Right up there with Mayo
and Johns Hopkins.
My dad's kind of their poster child.
Some people say he's
the top diagnostician in the country.
- Hard to live up to.
- Yeah.
No, besides from
the inhumanly high standards...
...he's kind of like Martha Stewart,
you know?
And I just keep
folding the napkins wrong.
I know what you mean.
Yeah, I never know
what my dad's gonna be.
Which is why there's no point
in being here on a nice day...
...trying to impress these guys.
Um...
Tru?
Look, I'm in trouble,
and I can't explain why...
...but I need you to trust me.
Don't tell anyone I'm here.
What are you doing? Tru?
Tru, is there something
I should know here? Tru?
I'm Officer Gomez.
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for a Tru Davies.
I understand Miss Davies
audits class in here?
Yeah, in the morning she does,
but it's over now.
- So you're acquainted with her?
- Yeah, she's a medical student.
She's in my anatomy class.
What can you tell me?
Um...
May I ask why it is
that you're looking for her?
She's wanted for questioning
in regard to a murder.
Oh, so you're looking for her
as a witness?
We'd just like to speak with her.
What's that smell?
Oh, that's perfume. I dropped a bottle.
It was a gift for my girlfriend.
- What do you think?
- I think it's a little strong.
Why should I have to
fork over my hard-earned taxes?
Excuse me?
Hey, can I help you?
You mind if we check that?
Wait right here.
Gomez here.
He did?
No. I wanna question him myself.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
I have to go.
Here's my card. You can reach me
at that number any time.
Was there something
you wanted to tell me?
Just if I hear anything, I'll call you.
Tru, what the hell is going on?
Thank you. Just thank you.
You did the right thing.
Hopefully, I'll be able
to explain this to you someday...
...or that I won't have to.
Tru, what are you...?
Thanks, officer. Mr. Davis.
It's actually just Davis.
Why don't we have a little chat.
Tru. Tru, you gotta get back
to the car.
The cops are looking for you.
You can't stay in one place too long.
Where the hell's Davis?
He didn't show up with the body...
...and he's not answering the phone.
May I?
Davis, what's going on?
It's Detective Gomez, Miss Davies.
<i>Guess what. You're number one</i>
<i>on your boss 's speed dial.</i>
<i>You need to think</i>
<i>about turning yourself in.</i>
You're an intelligent woman. You're only
getting yourself deeper in trouble.
- And now your friends too.
- Triangulating.
Detective, I didn't kill that man.
Hang up the phone.
- That man was a good human being.
- Tru.
I was meeting him
because he told me about you.
- What?
- He wanted to discuss a patient.
I was never his patient.
Tru, they can trace the call.
It's down to a 12-block radius.
Your name was in his book,
you were seen with him...
...and you wanna tell me
you didn't know him?
Do yourself a favor and surrender.
Let your lawyer do the talking.
Give me that. Look, you keep this.
I got a work phone in the car.
- What are you gonna do with mine?
- I'm gonna drive away...
...make a call and throw it in a truck.
If there's one thing I know, it's sneaky.
What about you?
Davis got busted
so there's no rewind.
All I've got is a note from the doctor.
Varden and DSM3.
- So?
- Okay.
Can you do one more sneaky thing
for me before you go?
I need you to steal a book
from the medical library.
No problem.
Stay here, keep an eye on our friend.
Watch in case Miss Davies returns.
You never know.
Detective, as I've told you, I was taking
Dr. Burrell's body to the security crypt.
Generally, that is where we keep
high-profile cases.
I thought it was a good idea
at the time...
...because the suspect
was a morgue employee.
And, yes, Miss Davies
is on my speed dial.
But so is Funky Chicken
and Charmed Pizza...
...as well as
three other morgue workers.
Now, you've got your body.
I have a morgue to run.
Excuse me.
Thank you so much, Harry.
I really appreciate it.
And a little bonus for you.
Tru, you watch yourself.
They're handing these out to everyone
who passes the Union, okay?
Thanks.
Hi. Do you mind if I join you?
No, go right ahead.
Oh, damn. I forgot to ask for sugar.
I wanted to discuss
patient-therapist confidentiality.
Oh.
Davis, as a psychologist,
I'm employed by the city...
...but I respect anything you might
have shared during your evaluation.
Oh, I'm being hypothetical.
I'm writing a book.
Are you really? Wow.
Hands-on professional and a man
of words, all in one package.
Tell me you can do laundry
and we'll run away together.
Under what circumstances is it ethical
to discuss a patient with the police?
The laws vary from state to state...
...but basically,
when there's immediate threat.
Knowledge of a past crime
wouldn't be enough?
Only if it contributes to your belief
that there's a threat.
And past crime can help predict
future behavior.
You are a man
of many surprises, Davis.
- What's the book about?
- Hmm?
- Hello?
- It's me.
Harrison gave me your number.
He said something about putting
your phone in the back of a truck?
Oh, God, Davis, it's so good to hear
your voice. Are you all right?
I'm fine, don't worry about me.
Did you find anything about the note?
No. And the word's spreading.
I don't know how much time
I have left.
We still don't know what Varden means.
<i>But if it is the killer's name,</i>
<i>and he is a patient...</i>
<i>... he probably will be in Burrell's files.</i>
I thought of that.
But breaking into the man's office?
That's risky,
and the police could still be there.
And if Varden's not in the files,
then it was all for nothing.
Not necessarily.
I've been speaking with Carrie.
Search for someone the doctor
would assume...
<i>... would present a danger.</i>
<i>Someone with a violent background</i>.
I can't sit there all night
going through files.
- You're right.
- We'll hope the right one is near the top.
There's one more thing. Unless you have
a background as a jewel thief...
...I don't know about, I don't see you
just waltzing into a locked office.
Does the morgue still have
Burrell's personal effects?
- I see where you're going with this.
- Talk to you later.
I'll be right there.
Hey. Messenger.
- Package going to County Records?
- Make sure it gets there quickly.
Trust me, I got it.
You really came through today, Harry.
I'm good with emergencies.
It's that day-to-day stuff I can't hack.
Yesterday you were at a hockey game
right now...
...taking those pictures you wanted
for Dad. I'm sorry.
This is more important.
We stick together, sis.
And that way, Dad can be disappointed
in both of us.
Okay. Well, just get out of here.
I got my work phone. If any cops even
think about showing up, I'll call you.
Tru? Tru?
Harrison.
Varden. Varden.
"Donald Stuart Mitchell III."
DSM3.
"Violent tendencies.
Narcissistic personality.
Sense of entitlement.
Possible involvement...
...in the disappearance
of girlfriend, Grace Varden."
Looks like my tip was right.
Detective, listen to me. I'm holding
the killer's file in my hands right now.
Donald Stuart Mitchell.
He's the patient Dr. Burrell wanted
to talk to you about.
He must've found out
what the doctor was gonna do.
Oh, my God.
If he was at the market early enough
and saw you two talking...
...he'll wanna kill you too.
Put the folder down.
You're not doing yourself any good.
Listen to me.
He'll wanna kill you too...
...if he thinks you know
he killed Grace Varden.
Grace Varden?
Thanks. I think that file's mine.
- Relax, I'm not gonna kill you.
- No.
Because the police would only look
for another shooter.
This way I'm the end of the trail.
I go to prison for two murders.
- And one a cop-killing.
- I'll tell them the truth.
Feel free to tell them
whatever you want.
Because without this file,
it becomes a story you made up.
It's too bad the circumstances
aren't a little different.
Because you are a lot prettier
than Grace was.
Jack. He decked me.
Sorry, Harry.
There's nothing left to do.
Help me.
That's no way to handle
a gallbladder, Mr. Lee.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you. Really.
But I really have to go.
Why are you taking that?
I don't have a penknife.
Is it me, or does Tru seem
a little abrupt?
- Day three?
- And two lives to save.
What I can find is that
Grace was a coed...
...who disappeared three years ago.
The cops think she was a murder victim.
But there's no evidence of what became
of her. They never found her body.
And her family is devastated, but they
have no idea what happened to her.
I have to make another call. Are you clear
on what I need you to do?
- Got it.
- Okay.
Hey, sis.
I'm on my first solo gig for Dad.
No time. It's a rewind day. Listen.
Yesterday, I was arrested for murder.
You got decked by Jack.
- I was what?
- <i>Never mind.</i>
Today, I'm gonna do things differently.
Jack's gonna do things differently too.
He'll throw a curve ball
where we least expect it.
<i>Here's what I need you to do.</i>
Dr. Burrell. You're here to meet
Detective Gomez.
Yes. Couldn't she make it?
Are you with the police?
You're in immediate danger
from one of your patients.
Donald Stuart Mitchell.
We think he's here.
If you'll go with this man,
he'll take you somewhere safe.
Thank you.
That was for yesterday.
I think.
Harrison, Harrison, get out of the way.
Your sister's in danger.
Whoa. Right. Coming from you?
I don't think so.
You got two targets today.
You're trying to make sure
that cop dies.
The killer thinks your sister is the cop.
Don't you see?
He saw her talking to the doctor.
Your sister is the target.
- Wouldn't that make you happy?
- No. Tru didn't die yesterday.
She's not supposed to die today.
Whatever you think of me, I don't care.
But do you wanna take a chance
with your sister's life?
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving your life.
Officer! Help!
Police. Nobody move.
- Jack.
- Watch this. The detective's all mine.
Hey, that's Detective Gomez.
She's the one you want.
Drop it.
You're under arrest
for the murder of Grace Varden.
I have a feeling Grace Varden's family
will finally be getting some closure.
Thank you.
Bye.
Well, it's been...
Well, it's been confusing as usual.
I gotta get out of here.
I got a job to do.
Those incriminating photos
don't take themselves.
Enjoy the hockey game.
And watch out
for a sudden right hook.
I never thought I'd know
anybody that was on the lam.
Yeah, it's more fun in the movies...
...when you're with Cary Grant
or Matt Damon.
Yeah. Well, you just had
Harrison and me.
Oh, Davis, please.
You guys were the best accomplices
a girl could want.
- Hey, Davis.
- Oh, hi.
I'm so absent-minded, I was in the
elevator when I realized I forgot sugar.
Oh, here.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
- Hi. Tru.
- Hi. Carrie. I've seen you around.
So seen any good cadavers lately?
Uh...
Yeah, actually I have. This guy came in
and his entire intestinal system was...
- It was orange.
- She was kidding.
I... I was too. It's, like...
...joking around and stuff.
- I should get back. Bye.
- See you.
- Bye.
- Enjoy the sugar.
Enjoy the sugar. God.
My complete ineptitude. Jeez.
- You like her.
- No, I don't.
Yeah, maybe. I don't know.
- Is there a day one for this?
- Didn't go well.
- Day two?
- Don't know. I was too busy to talk.
It probably didn't go very well.
There's some kind
of weird connection I have, though.
I'm probably full of myself.
Well, as a henchman
in my underworld gang...
...you were the best.
I don't know what happened
to etiquette.
It's been a week.
You don't call, you don't write.
Don't people still say thanks
when someone saves their lives?
I would thank you if you hadn't been
setting up Detective Gomez...
...to die at the same time.
Then there's that
"framing for murder" part.
You take things too personally, Tru.
A word of advice:
This med school thing is a nice dream.
But you can't have both worlds.
As long as you do what you do,
you don't belong in there.
My advice to you:
Work on being a gracious loser.
Tru can tell you I was right
about the metatarsals.
- You're not.
- She's right about the metatarsals.
It's gonna be like that
for the rest of the year?
You two ganging up?
It's not fun.
He knows I was right.
Coming.
- Happy birthday!
- What?
Happy birthday!
- I'm sorry, I still can't quite...
- You heard me. Two's all you get.
I know how you love your birthday and
all, but I got some things to do today.
Oh, and your gift, in the works.
Not here yet.
And Dad, he's in Omaha,
and he sends his love.
No, he doesn't. He forgot again.
But thank you for lying.
What are all these things
you have to do today?
When Dad's out of town
you get a day off.
Yeah, but not today. Check it out.
He wants me to talk to a guy
who might have seen something...
...about someone that could help out
a guy. I don't know, it's pretty big stuff.
Hey, so, what's the plan
for the festive B-day?
Well, I figure I'm a 23-year-old
with a mystical gift and a credit card...
...so I'm gonna treat myself
to something special.
Maybe some hot dogs?
It's looking a little thin in here, Tru.
There's this jade necklace
that's been calling my name...
...which is much less creepy
than what usually calls my name.
Ha! Yeah, jewelry. Mmm.
You women think us guys
notice stuff like that. We don't.
Other guys notice jewelry.
You just don't.
You know what? It's time
for me to get this day started.
Hey, push.
You know what? I'm taking these.
- Hey, Avery.
- Hey, Tru.
- Hello, Mr. Gorenstein.
- Happy birthday.
I love that necklace. Is that new?
Why, yes, it is. A little treat
from me to me. I'm glad you noticed.
I did. But the guys won't.
They never notice that stuff.
And besides, everybody's all distracted
by the engagement.
- What? Who's engaged?
- Jensen and Lexi.
Lexi. I heard him mention her,
but I didn't know they were that serious.
Well, it was all very impulsive.
Tyler's in love with love.
His diary is going to be full tonight.
Hey!
Hey, congratulations.
She's getting a great guy.
- Thanks.
- She is. I hope she knows it.
She's very excited. I didn't know
everybody else was excited.
Living vicariously.
Exactly.
None of us have anything going on.
I can't even remember the last time
I saw a guy naked.
Okay.
- Hey, nice necklace.
- Thank you.
Davis?
Davis?
Oh, my gosh!
- Who put this all together?
- Harrison and I.
He was supposed to put a deposit down
on a nicer place, but that didn't pan out.
Well, there was a little hiccup
in the money situation.
But look, this way I get to set up your
gift right here. Come, look. Come here.
What...?
Pinch yourself. It's not a dream.
Oh. It's a hot tub.
Yeah!
Look, now, don't get too excited.
It's only rented for one night.
Davis, you let him bring this here?
I like the bubbles.
Just wait and see
how it rocks the party.
Okay.
Need to get this thing up and running.
He tripped a circuit breaker.
I'll call Maintenance.
Wait, don't bother, doc.
- It's a lot nicer this way.
- Ambience.
- Tru!
- Hey!
- Nice place.
- Yeah, it's morbid and strange...
...but we are happy to be here.
- Thank you.
Hey, come here,
I want you guys to meet.
This is my friend and boss, Davis. This is
Tyler and Avery from my anatomy class.
Right. We talked to Davis
when he invited us.
Oh, yeah, right. It's nice to meet you.
Oh, and this is my little brother,
Harrison. Avery, Tyler.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Harrison. That's a good name.
I like that.
- Thank you.
- Hey, did you guys see the hot tub?
My brother has me confused
with the cast of <i>The Bachelor</i>.
- I do now.
- I brought my swimsuit.
- Where can we change?
- First takers. Right. Come with me.
Davis, I love my party.
Thank you so much.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I got you a gift as well.
- So let me go get it.
- Awesome.
- Tru, hey, happy birthday.
- Hey.
- I don't think that you've met Lexi.
- Lexi, at last. Best wishes.
Thank you.
It's all a whirlwind right now.
You know, I'm just kind of waiting
for it to settle in.
I've never been in a morgue before.
This is absolutely fascinating.
There aren't any bodies here tonight,
but feel free to look.
Yeah? You wanna look around?
I swear you're gonna love this.
Okay. Yeah. I just don't wanna look
at anything in a jar.
- Have fun.
- Thanks, Tru.
Hi.
I don't understand
how it looks so nice in the store.
- They put it in a box first.
- Oh. Maybe I should put it in a...
No, don't you dare.
- It's hats.
- Yeah, it's two hats.
You know the expression
"wearing two hats"?
It symbolizes your two fields
of endeavor.
One for med school and one
for rewriting destiny here at the morgue.
Shoot. Carrie's here.
Okay, this is getting a little ridiculous,
don't you think? Come here.
- Hi, Carrie.
- Hi. Happy birthday.
Thanks.
- Could you excuse me one sec?
- Sure.
- Hey, Davis. Ask her to stay.
- No, you ask her to stay.
Davis!
Carrie, would you like to stay?
I would love to.
Great.
- Hey, how's it going in there?
- I'm just embracing life.
Is this safe?
- I cannot believe you'd do this!
- Tell him the truth.
- This is not your business!
- It is!
And if you won't tell him, then I will!
Let go of me!
- Everybody gather around.
- You have to tell him!
It's cake time.
Wow.
Happy birthday, Tru.
- What's that?
- It's just a circuit breaker.
Hey, take advantage of it, people.
Nobody's gonna know who did what
when the lights come back on.
Okay.
<i>Tru.</i>
- Harrison, is that you?
- What?
- Tru, what's going on?
- <i>Help me</i>.
Not what I wished for.
Help me.
Don't settle in, Harry.
I'm heading out.
Something happened,
and I don't know who it happened to.
I thought your birthday
was supposed to be giggles...
...and love for the people of the Earth.
- Yeah, I had that birthday yesterday.
You had a replay on your birthday? Huh.
Is there anything I should do,
or not do?
Did I screw up?
You threw me a party, which was
a really sweet thought, actually.
Give it up for the brother.
Just because you're my brother
doesn't mean you're the brother.
And this time,
don't throw me a party at the morgue.
Especially with a rented hot tub, which
does not count as my gift, by the way.
- Wait. I threw you a party at the morgue?
- It doesn't matter.
Just cancel the whole thing.
It wouldn't be a surprise anymore.
Lock up when you leave?
- Hot dogs, bottom shelf.
- Thank you.
So you couldn't tell anything
from the voice?
It was a loud whisper.
It was, you know, harsh.
But I couldn't tell
if it was a man or a woman.
It was dark.
You have no idea who asked for help?
There were no bodies for processing.
It wasn't you or Harrison.
- You guys were next to me.
- Then it was a guest.
Great. Come for the cheese cubes,
stay for the death.
- I am cursed. Am I like Typhoid Mary?
- Shh...
How many people
that I know am I gonna have to save?
Maybe it wasn't someone you know.
Maybe it was someone who
came with someone you know.
Aren't you a bundle of bright side.
Okay, well, let's just think for a minute.
Who was there?
You mean here. You, me, Harrison,
Carrie, friends from school, Jensen...
Wait, Carrie was here?
She came by,
and you asked her to stay.
- I did? Did she stay? Did she stay?
- You were masterful.
Oh, God, I hope she's okay.
I could never live with myself
if I was responsible for her being here.
Davis, odds are she's fine.
Let's just look at everyone
before we narrow it down.
All right, Tyler was in the hot tub.
And that was messing
with the electricity.
So maybe it was him
or the maintenance guy.
- Did you say hot tub?
- And it was really dark.
So anyone could slip
by the rinse basin.
- There was a hot tub?
- And before the lights went out...
...Avery was having a huge fight
with Lexi.
If you won't tell him, then I will!
- Okay, who's Lexi?
- Jensen's fiancée.
- Hey.
- I don't think that you've met Lexi.
It looked like
it was gonna get violent.
Lexi could've shoved her
or strangled her.
Avery was saying,
"If you don't tell him, I will."
I think she's the victim.
It sounds like Lexi's got a secret,
and Avery knows about it.
I guess I'd better find out too.
Harrison!
Look at you, man. You look great.
Robust. Like a man who's been
taking care of himself.
So my continuing to be alive
isn't bothering you?
Oh, you mean because it runs counter
to the plan of the universe...
...and every day you're setting in motion
consequences that can be damaging...
...to the entire human race?
Now, why would that bother me?
Later, Jack.
- Ass.
- Lucky Broad.
Lucky Broad, Kentucky Rascal,
Better Off Sailing.
Races five, six and seven.
Oh, and Rascal's a long shot,
so bet big.
What are you doing, man?
I haven't made a bet in months.
Why not? There's no rule against
profiting from a rewind, Harrison.
You know, Tru could make you
a millionaire if she wanted to.
It breaks my heart to see the way
that girl treats you.
That is so sweet. You remembered
those names just for me.
No, I remembered them for me.
Good deeds don't pay enough to live on.
But hey, if you're not interested,
forget I said anything.
Already did, man. Already did.
- Hey, Avery.
- Tru, happy birthday.
You must really like your birthday.
I'm just glad to see you, that's all.
So, what's with the commotion?
You'll never believe it.
Jensen and Lexi got engaged.
Really? Wow, I haven't met her.
What's she like?
Uh, she's good. I mean, she's crazy
about him, so I guess that that's good.
Huh. That was wishy
and at the same time washy.
That's not like you.
You usually lay it all out.
I know. I love that about me.
Yeah, I don't know. I guess I like her
fine. It just all seems a little fast.
Oh. It's all terribly romantic.
- Morning.
- Jensen, congratulations.
I'm taking you guys out
for a congratulatory lunch.
Right after lab over at Café Geneva.
All of us, plus Lexi.
It'll be my chance to meet her.
That's amazingly generous of you, Tru.
I'll call Lex. I'm sure she'd love to come.
Yeah, I'm in. I love their desserts.
I'm shaking hands with a small intestine.
Can we hold the food talk?
- They have key lime pie.
- I do like key lime pie.
You sure it was our client
you dropped at the airport?
Sure, I'm sure.
Look, he was late for a flight.
He's talking to his girlfriend on
the cell phone. She's at the airport.
So she's completely ticked off.
In fact, she's so angry...
...he promised he'd fly her to the
Caribbean just because she's mad!
Lucky broad
to find a sucker like that guy.
- Lucky Broad.
- Yeah.
Anyway, I drive like a madman,
I get him there on time...
...he still doesn't give me a decent tip.
So yeah, I remember the guy.
- Lucky Broad.
- Is that it?
Oh, yeah, that's it.
- You don't want me to sign something?
- No. That was great. That was great.
No, lab's still going.
I'm just ducking into the hall.
But the point is, I'm too soon. Whatever
Lexi's secret is, Avery doesn't know yet.
I got Jensen to invite Lexi to a lunch
so I can work on her and watch them.
<i>I'm hearing birds.</i>
<i>Where are you anyway?</i>
I'm hiding behind a tree.
I'm watching Carrie buy coffee.
- What? Davis, that's stalking.
- <i>No, it's not.</i>
I wanna make sure
she's not in danger.
<i>Davis, we have no reason...</i>
...to believe that she's involved in this.
- Are you Carrie Allen?
- I'll call you back.
I'm Jack Harper. I worked
at the morgue with Tru and Davis.
They've said such nice things
about you.
- They're good people.
- That they are. That they are.
I just wanted to say hi
and put a face with the name.
That was very nice of you to introduce
yourself. I'm sure I'll see you around.
- Excuse me. What was that?
- Davis.
I was just introducing myself.
I'm a friend of a friend.
Stay away from Carrie.
Stay away from her, okay?
Do you have a personal stake
in this, Davis?
Is this an affair of the heart?
That's adorable. It is.
I would protect anyone
I saw you talking to.
Funny, I was talking to my landlady this
morning. I didn't see you lurking then.
I just hope you know
what you're getting into.
See you around, doc.
Tru, everything has just changed.
Do you not get it, Tru?
Jack is hanging around.
He's staying close to make sure she dies
again. You've gotta get to the morgue.
I want to, but I can't right now.
I've gotta find out Lexi's secret.
Handle Carrie yourself until I get back.
Look, Carrie is gonna die
if we don't find out about her past.
- What is the motive, who is the killer?
<i>- You're right, we should do that.</i>
So here's an idea.
We could get Harrison.
<i>He follows people for a living.</i>
<i>He watches her while you research.</i>
Just hang on.
Can I get $2 to win on...?
Bosses, huh?
They never seem to leave you alone.
I can't reach him.
He must be on assignment.
Listen, you gotta...
I just can't do this on my own.
Yes, you can do this.
Look, just talk to her.
Find out if anyone
would have a motive.
- Look...
<i>- Avery was in danger at my party.</i>
Lexi was furious. I've seen people look
like that. I've gotta stick with this.
Okay, just get here
as fast as you can, okay?
Okay.
This was such a great idea, Tru.
It's such a pleasure to meet you.
Yeah, you too. The engagement
was the perfect opportunity.
Jensen tells me
you're from right here in town?
Yeah, I went to high school
at Adams High just down the street.
If those other girls could see me now,
huh? Engaged to a doctor.
- It's almost a cliché.
- I'm not a doctor yet.
And so you work here in town too?
I'm a receptionist
at a little insurance company.
But I'll probably quit now.
- Champagne!
- None for me.
I'm volunteering at the clinic later.
- You probably shouldn't.
- Yeah, no champagne for me either.
- Thank you.
- No champagne, Lexi? Are you pregnant?
- Avery.
- Oh. I'm sorry. I do that a lot.
I just kind of say things. I didn't mean
to sound blunt or anything.
But seriously,
are you like an alcoholic or...?
- Should we say?
- Yeah.
I mean, they're gonna find out
soon enough. So yeah, go ahead.
We are pregnant.
Wow, that's... Huh.
I guess congratulations.
I didn't want you guys to think
that's the reason we're getting married.
No. But it is why I said yes, so...
At least she's an amazing girl.
I knew this was where
we were gonna end up.
Excuse me, guys.
- What are you doing here?
- Look, they've got fondue.
Do you ever have one of those days
when you just want fondue?
Stay away from my friends.
Oh, yeah, I saw them in there.
I haven't met everybody yet.
Would you like to introduce me? No?
Okay.
This is some kind of birthday celebration,
isn't it? I almost forgot.
I wanted to get you one with some sort
of death and resurrection imagery...
...but they didn't have any. So I got you
a card with a picture of a cake on it.
I think it's time
for you to leave now.
Tru, you don't want me
to meet your friends...
...you don't want me to enjoy fondue.
Are you embarrassed by me?
Because if you are, it would almost
be enough to hurt my feelings.
Hi, Carrie.
How are you today? You look nice.
It occurs to me I don't know
a lot about your friends.
Like stringent enemies. Such a...
Carrie, you're...
I like your blouse, blouse.
Oh, my God!
- Carrie, what's wrong?
- Nothing.
I know we don't know each other
that well yet, but please just tell me.
It was a situation that you
never think you'd find yourself in.
An abusive marriage
with a problem drinker.
But I just kept hoping
that things would get better.
I'm so sorry.
The thing that amazed me...
...is how much I missed him...
...when he died.
- How did he die?
- He drowned.
He passed out in a bathtub,
of all things.
The police came,
and they asked a lot of questions.
And I slowly started to realize that
they thought I was somehow involved.
Involved?
Yeah.
He took these thyroid pills,
and afterwards nobody could find them.
So somebody came up with this theory
that I had spiked the bottle...
...with sedatives that I'd stolen
from the hospital where I worked.
What happened?
They never found the pills, so eventually
the police just dropped the investigation.
But his sister still thought
that I did it.
I left the suburbs, and I came here.
And I thought that I was safe...
...until today.
"I know that you did it."
They both say the same thing.
I found one of them this morning.
It was actually rolled up
into my newspaper on the front porch.
And the other one I found
right before you came in.
In my purse.
I think that maybe that I can help you.
<i>And Better Off Sailing</i>
<i>and Happy Clam are neck and neck.</i>
<i>Lost Cause is closing in on them...</i>
<i>... but it looks like Better Off Sailing may</i>
<i>pull this off, people! This is unbelievable!</i>
- <i>It's down to the final stretch! Here is...</i>
- Whoa! Yes!
Yeah! Oh...
I didn't know. I did know.
Davis, you weren't here,
and I couldn't reach you.
Listen, Lexi's pregnant,
and that's why Jensen's marrying her.
- And I think I know what the secret is.
- What?
Lexi, she's marrying Jensen
to make her way up in the world.
What could Avery find out that would
derail everything for a pregnant bride?
Well, what if the baby isn't Jensen's?
I mean, it's classic.
She would be determined
to keep that secret.
No, I don't think that's what happened.
Avery's volunteering at the clinic
this afternoon. And it's a theory...
...but I bet Lexi came in for an exam,
or Avery saw her medical records.
She knows about the baby's father.
- Tru...
- Anyway, I'm gonna go tag along...
...as a new volunteer, and maybe
I can keep it from happening again.
- Tru!
- What?
Carrie's husband died,
and she's got a sister-in-law...
...out in Rockville who blames her.
And I think she killed her.
And Jack's around
to make sure it happens again.
Jack's been hanging around Avery too.
They can't both be victims.
- So he's playing us.
- You assume that Carrie is the decoy?
- It could've just as well been Avery.
- Let's not do this, Davis, please?
I wish I could investigate both options,
I do. You're gonna have to handle this.
Yeah, so you can run off
and be with your new friends.
- What?
- I just don't think you're being objective!
What, and you are?
I know you like her, and I know what
it's like to lose someone you care about.
- But, Davis, you're just not being...
- No, Tru, you can't do this to me!
You can't make this
about poor funny little Davis...
...who always loses it when a girl smiles
at him. This isn't funny. This is serious.
And I've gotta go protect
this woman myself?
And if she dies because you
weren't there to protect her...
...I will never forgive you.
So how long
have you volunteered here?
Years. It's something Jensen got me
into when we were both pre-med.
- You've known each other a long time?
- Yeah, we used to...
Well, we used to have
a lot of classes together.
- You used to go out?
- A long time ago.
- What happened?
- We just became best friends.
It's really like 100 times
better this way.
- You take care of him.
- Yeah. And he takes care of me.
I mean, he would take care of me,
if I let him.
And that is my heart-to-heart limit
for one day, okay?
You got it. So, what's that?
This is the sign-in.
It's people with appointments.
Are you looking for someone?
I'm just trying to get a feel
for everything, that's all.
There's a little filing today,
so we should probably start here.
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Uh...
Looks like some records
just got sent over, so I gotta sort these.
I could do that too.
And spin plates and play the kazoo.
Take it easy, Tru, all right?
You're a superstar,
but you do not need to save the world.
I guess it just feels like that
sometimes.
Well, Alexandra Keely. That's Lexi's
file, Avery. You shouldn't look at that.
- I gotta go.
- No, wait, let's talk about this.
- You can't confront her.
- You don't know what's going on.
- Assume I do.
- Jensen's being lied to.
I know you wanna protect him,
but there's a better way.
- Let's talk to him together.
- Excuse me.
- Do you know if there's a sign-in sheet?
- Yeah. Over there. Excuse me.
Oh.
Davis, I found out why Lexi may have
wanted to kill Avery. The secret...
<i>... is that there is no baby.</i>
I saw her medical records.
She had a uterine myoma...
...and got a hysterectomy
two years ago.
- So she can't be pregnant.
- <i>It was a scam...</i>
...to get Jensen to marry her. No wonder
Lexi didn't want that to get out.
What, so you have a new theory?
You'll consider every point of view
except mine.
I'm not trying to ignore you.
I'm trying to prevent a death.
Listen, I gotta go, Tru. I have
an appointment with the real killer.
Thank you for the tea. It's very hot.
I'd do anything for the man
who's gonna reopen my brother's case.
Well, we don't exactly reopen cases
at the morgue.
We do like to educate ourselves
about what happened.
I understand that your brother
drowned in a bath?
Well, that's what she told everyone,
but it isn't right.
- It doesn't make sense.
- But he was a drinker, right?
Not so that he'd pass out in the tub.
And they never found that bottle of pills.
She destroyed it because
she knew they could link it to her.
But surely a small prescription bottle
could be thrown away.
No. She killed him.
I'm sure that she'll be punished
by the universe, not by human hands...
...because that would be wrong.
- No, my brother was a good man.
He never laid a hand on her,
and he never passed out in any bathtub.
And don't you tell me
about who dispenses justice.
I know that no one does
because I know what she did.
- What's going on?
- You're not safe here. Come on.
Come on in.
I know it's not much,
but it has central air...
...which is good because the morgue,
when the AC breaks down...
...sometimes we tend to walk around
naked and...
- Huh. That's beautiful.
- Yeah.
I got these in Mexico.
But you can't eat off them because
the glaze will cause severe brain damage.
- Would you like a Fresca?
- No, thanks.
- I like your apartment.
- Yeah.
I feel so safe here. I'm embarrassed that
I showed you these in the first place.
It's probably just some neighbor kid
playing a joke.
Yeah.
I don't think so. But you're safe here.
You're okay here.
I know.
She didn't even come back here
at all today?
- Avery? No. But she called in.
- She did? Great.
She said she was meeting up
with her friend Jensen and his fiancée.
Where? Did she say where?
Um... Standard Diner. Do you know it?
Surprise!
I knew you thought I canceled it.
I wasn't sure you'd get the message.
- I didn't.
- Well, you're here, so obviously...
Did you see Avery?
- Which one's Avery?
- Never mind.
Excuse me.
"Thank you, Harrison.
What a lovely surprise."
You're welcome, Tru.
- Hey, happy birthday again.
- Thanks. Have you seen Avery?
- I don't think Avery's here yet.
- Where's Lexi?
Uh, the bathroom, I think.
I don't know. Why, what's up?
Look, I don't wanna say this, but
there's something I have to tell you...
...and it's not...
- Tru?
I was at the clinic today...
...and Lexi's records were there.
- I moved them there.
I thought with the baby it'd be good to
have the best care. What is this about?
I saw the records, and there's something
she's not telling you.
- You saw the records?
- Yeah, I was there with Avery.
No, I don't care. I don't wanna know.
Whatever you saw is private.
- Lf she wants to, she'll tell me about it.
- Jensen, she isn't pregnant.
- What?
- She had a uterine myoma.
They performed a hysterectomy.
You needed to know.
Thank you for deciding
what it is that I need.
She's playing you.
She just wants to marry a doctor...
...and things are about to get bad.
- Loving the cheese cubes.
Hey, what's up with Jensen?
Hmm. Bold.
- I can't believe you'd do this!
- Tell him the truth.
- This is none of your business.
- Yes, it is!
And if you're not gonna tell him,
then I will!
Lexi, you have to tell him
that you're not pregnant.
- Look, shut up.
- Now it's a party.
Chick fight! Chick fight!
I love a chick fight!
I'm coming to your birthday
every year.
Ah, man, this is bad.
Lexi, he's going to find out.
I know.
I know he will.
When he does,
it's all gonna be ruined.
Oh. This is even hotter
than a chick fight.
But you see, the thing about this is,
Lexi is clearly alive...
...and an opportunist
and a big no-uterus-having crybaby...
...but I really don't think she's a killer.
Happy birthday.
Harrison!
This was a great party, man.
I knew you'd do the right thing
with that money.
You know, getting everybody here.
Jack gave me the names
of these horses, and I won...
...and I used the money for the party.
But I think
that he wanted you here so...
Instead of somewhere else.
But can you even build a canoe
out of concrete?
Yeah, of course.
With the correct engineering you can.
That's how I met my wife actually,
at one of those races.
Her team won, and then her team
dumped my team in the water.
I got a bacterial infection,
but I didn't mind.
That's actually very sweet.
It was a long time ago, though.
It doesn't hurt
to think about it anymore.
You know?
It'll be the same with you too.
You're already making it better.
Did you hear that?
There's someone in the hallway.
Go hide in my room.
Hey. Whoa! Davis, you were right.
It's not Avery. It never was.
It's Carrie.
And I am so, so sorry
I didn't listen to you. I really am.
- That's okay. You're here now.
- Is she here? Is she safe?
Yeah, she's in the other room.
She's safe.
Any more notes? Any other suspects
besides the sister-in-law?
No more notes. I don't think
the sister-in-law would do it herself.
I think she hired someone.
And the notes...
...are clearly an attempt
at a blackmail gone bad.
I'm still not sure.
Davis, stop.
You know who wrote these notes.
They were both decoys.
It wasn't Carrie or Avery.
The death is still on,
and it's happening in the morgue.
But there's no one there.
How can it happen again?
Because someone is there.
- And he was there on day one.
- Who?
The lights didn't go out because
of the hot tub. The wiring is bad.
And the maintenance man
is there right now.
No!
It's frustrating, isn't it?
- Jack.
- You could save him...
...if you could get to him.
I know you know CPR.
But those wires are live, Tru.
Barbecue Tru.
You say you're on the side of good,
and yet you stand there enjoying this.
You think I'm enjoying this, George?
George isn't talking.
You knew that was his name, right?
I don't think you did.
But maybe that's a good thing.
Maybe it's easier when it's someone
you don't know and care about.
No, it isn't.
I'm sorry it's a day late.
You don't have to act surprised.
Did I tell you about the symbology?
Two hats, two jobs.
- It seemed clever at the time.
- Yes.
And it's a wonderful thought, Davis.
But I'm starting to think
I can't handle med school and this.
Tru, we were both wrong.
It's just that now with Jack involved,
it's harder.
He's good.
He's better than good.
He knows stuff.
Jack wasn't at the party
before the rewind...
...and yet he knew
about Lexi and Avery's fight.
And he knew enough
to make Carrie look likely too.
How does he know this stuff?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Thanks for my hats anyway.
You're welcome. Go on, get to school.
Prove you can do both.
- Avery, hi.
- Hey, good party last night.
I looked for you after my little blowup
with Lexi, but I couldn't find you.
- How's Jensen? Have you guys talked?
- Yeah. I think I'm forgiven.
But you have to have
your own conversation with him...
...because we both looked at her file.
- Right.
Even though you did do
everything you could...
...to keep me from looking
at anybody's file.
There's no way I could've known
what was in there.
I know, but you did.
And when you miss class,
you know what we talked about.
Like details and who asked
what questions. That kind of thing.
I didn't realize that. Weird.
Yeah. It's cool.
I just wanted you to know
that I noticed.
So go. Talk to Jensen.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
I told you about what was in someone
else's records. That's not fine.
Lexi's the one that lied.
She wanted to marry a doctor.
And she settled for me...
...because I think I might be the last guy
in the country who marries a girl...
...just because she gets pregnant.
- I like that you're that guy.
I guess I'm happy that I found out
when I did, you know?
You don't look happy.
You look like you miss her.
No.
No, I don't think that's it.
I think that...
I think I miss the girl
that I was hoping she was.
Witty, charming,
that cared about what it is that I did...
...but also had her own stuff.
You know, things that she cared about.
Friends that she cared about.
You'll find that person.
We all have to believe...
...that there's someone
out there that...
The right person for us.
Sure.
There's the right person for everybody.
Okay. Well, as soon as I get that...
- Hey, you're leaving?
- No, I can talk for a minute.
Um, I wanted to thank you for last night.
I was really glad that you were there.
I was scared,
and you made me feel safe.
And that's a good thing.
About the kissing?
- I felt like I was crossing a line there.
- Davis, that was a good thing too.
- Really?
- Yes.
Oh.
- I'm sorry, I have to run.
- No. Yeah. No problem.
Okay.
You should know that I thank whatever
force in the universe brought me to you.
I like this place. It is a lot better
than the dive where we first met.
Anything is better than that place.
Stale peanuts and watered-down liquor.
- I got you a beer.
- Thank you.
- Long day yesterday?
- About 40 hours.
But it was easy.
All I had to do was a little misdirection.
- How about you?
- Not bad.
I got to know Davis a little better.
- A funny little man.
- And?
And he believes every word that I say.
Hey, Tru. Glad I caught up.
You got a full schedule for today?
Just chem lab.
Then the rest of the day is mine.
That is excellent, because I have
two tickets to the Blue Spot...
...the Scott Rogo Quintet.
- Uh, Jensen, I'm sorry, but I hate jazz.
- Me too.
- Lexi's the one that wanted to go.
- Oops.
Hey, tell you what, I bet you we could
get 50 bucks for them in the parking lot.
- I've never been scalping.
- Swing by after class.
<i>- Hey, Harr.</i>
- Guess what. Oh, you'll never guess.
Unless it's day two, in which case
you're probably gonna tell me about it.
- Harrison, I have class in 90 seconds.
- <i>Fine.</i>
One of Dad's clients says his partner's
ripping him off. We got a tip...
...the partner's guys are moving
a load of hot electronics tonight.
And he needs pictures.
I'm the shutter man.
- It's not dangerous, is it?
- Only if I screw it up.
You're not gonna screw up.
You're gonna be great.
Aw. That'd mean more to me
on a day two, but thanks for the effort.
Bye.
Okay.
I have waited a week,
so to the hell with the rules...
...somebody has got to ask
somebody out for a date.
How about dinner?
- Now? It's 9:30 in the morning.
- Actually, I was thinking of later tonight.
Yes. Oh, yeah, of course, yes.
And yes. Yes.
Great. I'll cook.
Can we use your place, though?
- Uh...
- My stove refuses to cooperate.
Okay, yeah, I just have to leave
a little early to tidy up.
- I'll see you at 7.
- Okay.
Seven o'clock.
I should probably leave now.
I always wanted to learn the guitar.
You know, I've seen you before.
A bunch of times, really.
You work around here?
- Uh, yeah. All over the city, actually.
- I'm not stalking you.
It's just...
I know this is kind of out of nowhere,
but, um, I'm playing hooky today.
And I have two tickets
to see this jazz quintet...
...at the Blue Spot tonight.
If you're not too booked up...
...maybe you'd like to come with.
I can't.
Work's a killer.
Maybe some other time.
Two tickets to the jazz festival.
Do I hear 20? Twenty?
- No, I don't hear 20.
- Do I hear 15? Do I hear 10?
Hey, we have the perfect date.
We just have to run...
We've got the perfect date?
- For $20. For two?
- Seriously, $5. I'll pay you.
Oh, you're back. No?
- You made all this in my kitchen?
- I did. Don't you cook?
Uh, I've made gazpacho a couple
of times, but nothing like this.
Mmm.
This is delicious. Mmm. What is this?
Tuna Provencal.
Mmm.
- What? What's wrong?
- Nothing.
It's just the mercury levels
are kind of high and...
It's probably what gives
it the extra tang.
- Wine's good. Yeah. That's good wine.
- Relax.
- It's just me.
- I know, I'm sorry, it's just...
I'm nervous. Nervous because this
is the first time that a woman...
...has cooked here for me,
and it's...
I totally get it.
But, you know, maybe...
...tonight'll turn out to be
an evening full of first times.
Oh.
Oh, God, I'm such an idiot.
I thought it was a dog.
<i>Coogan takes a hit. Then another.</i>
Smile for the birdie, suckers.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is not</i>
<i>the way it was supposed to go.</i>
<i>I bet Coogan wishes he hadn 't</i>
<i>bothered showing up tonight, Bob.</i>
<i>And he goes down. Coogan goes down.</i>
<i>It's all over.</i>
Billy.
<i>I tell you, folks.</i>
<i>Somebody... Somebody</i>
<i>should've seen this coming.</i>
<i>And it's official. Coogan is out,</i>
<i>and the challenger...</i>
You're kidding me, that's awful. What
did you do, just throw away the film?
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>
I've known Billy since high school.
If I didn't have a job with Dad...
<i>...I'd be loading the truck up with him.</i>
- What did you tell Dad?
I lied. I told him the light was bad
and the shots were underexposed.
Oh, God, he was pissed.
<i>Look, I don 't know if I can do it.</i>
<i>I'm taking pictures of my friend.</i>
You're doing great, Harrison.
Look, no one ever said it would be easy.
Oh, it doesn't have to be easy, Tru.
I just wish it wasn't so hard.
- I know.
<i>- Anyway, I gotta go.</i>
Bye.
- Six sugars, right?
- Seven, but I'll live.
Oh, it's fantastic, Avery.
Thanks for calling.
I just won a bunch of money on the
Coogan fight in the med-school pool.
- Ten bucks on Montez turned into 100.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- Boxing, scalping, gambling.
Don't let the GPA fool you.
I'm a gangster. Holler back.
Yeah.
Operation Seduce Davis
did not go as planned.
I don't know.
I think I may have come on too strong.
What happened?
I tried to let him know that I was
interested in him, you know, physically.
- And he didn't respond?
<i>- No, he responded.</i>
Like I goosed him with a cattle prod.
Some guys just need
a little warming up.
No!
- Call you back.
<i>- Okay.</i>
And I was thinking that
maybe you and I should, uh...
...you know, get together on Saturday.
And scalp <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> tickets?
Yeah, that's exactly
what I had in mind.
She jumped. I'll call 911.
I saw the whole thing.
She jumped from the very top.
Somebody call 911.
- Who was with her?
- She just jumped.
Jack.
Help me.
- What the hell was that?
- What the hell was that?
Help me!
It was different. It didn't feel
like a normal rewind at all.
- As bizarre as that sounds.
- No one asked for help, you're sure?
There were no corpses lying around
if that's what you mean.
- Well, maybe you didn't hear it.
- I always hear it.
Well, do you think maybe you died?
Okay, now you're just creeping me out.
Okay, what were you doing
when it happened?
I was about to...
...do something personal.
Okay. Describe the rewind.
What did you see?
Like I said, it was weird.
It was just, like, random stuff.
There was a painting.
There was a music poster.
There was a guitar case.
There were coins.
And there was a $20 bill, like a...
In the case. It was a street performer
or something.
There's always a bunch like
that at Atlantic Plaza.
That was the last thing I saw.
It was the clock on the Edison Tower.
It was 11: 15, and the clock,
it was moving away, like I was falling.
- Tru, I'm... This may be a little crazy...
- What?
Well, maybe that's how the victim died.
Falling off the Edison Tower. Maybe.
There is an observation deck.
But, Davis, we're not even
sure there was a victim.
- I wonder if anyone actually died.
- I hate this.
Right when I thought I had
the right approach to this.
The rules have changed.
I mean, we're in open water now.
This rewind...
...it felt bad.
Cold.
Like a part of me was dying.
All I know is I never wanna
feel that way again.
I never felt anything like it.
I don't know what to tell you. I've never
heard of anything like this before.
- She asked me for help.
- Don't get knocked off track here.
Doing the right thing is always harder.
But if the rules changed this time,
it's for a reason.
Your job has always been clear.
Make today end like yesterday.
What the hell am I supposed to do?
Your job.
Harrison, wait.
Oh, no, no. No, it's one of those days,
right, where l...
Relax. You don't die or anything.
- Oh, whew. Cool.
- I tried to call you on your cell...
...but I wanted you to know. Dad's
gonna give you some big assignment.
To photograph a crime taking place.
- Very cool.
- Your friend Billy's one of the criminals.
You take pictures, he could go to jail.
Not cool. Because if I don't,
then I'm gonna be in trouble with...
- Dad!
- Hey.
- What a pleasant surprise.
- Hey.
You feel all right, sweetie?
You look tired.
Well, you know how it goes,
Dad. I work in a morgue.
I only get a day off
if death takes a day off.
Carrie, it's day two
and here's the headline:
At your dinner tonight with Davis,
take it down a notch.
Go easy. Don't be easy. You
know what I'm saying? Call me.
You know, I've always wanted
to learn to play the guitar.
- Me too.
- I guess we still could.
Probably takes years, though, right?
Who's got that kind of time?
You know, um...
...my work threw me a curve ball
today and canceled all my meetings.
Do you wanna get some breakfast?
- I think I have time for that.
- Great.
You strike me as a traditionalist
when it comes to breakfast.
Oh, I don't know about that.
No. I go a little crazy.
Wow, a 20.
- Someone must really like your music.
- Actually, he liked the girl next to him.
- He was trying to impress her.
- Her?
Yeah, you just missed them.
Thanks.
So it must be a great job you have.
You can just show up when you want...
...not show up when you want.
Well, I'm sort of a troubleshooter. I try
to keep things from veering off course.
- You?
- I was a receptionist at St. Luke's.
- Yesterday was my last day.
- You quit.
- Mm-hm.
- So, what's next?
It remains to be seen.
But for today...
...I got a list.
- A list?
- Mm-hm.
- Why do I get the feeling...
...there's more to this story?
You mind if I took a look at that list?
No. It's private!
It's just some stuff around town.
You can live in Paris your whole life
and never go to the Eiffel Tower.
Mm-hm. What's number one to do
on the aforementioned list?
Are you inviting yourself along?
Only if I'm welcome, and only if it
doesn't involve opera or clowns.
You are. And it doesn't.
I just hope you like dead ducks.
It was the last thing he ever painted.
I majored in art history.
And my first big crush was
on Robert Vander Krawl.
I stayed up all night writing an essay
on this very painting...
...crying the entire time.
All he wanted was a normal life.
A wife, family.
He'd completed over 200 canvases...
...by the time he was 29
and never sold a single one.
He killed himself one night with poison.
He was completely alone...
...convinced that nobody cared
about him or his work...
...that he was worth more
dead than alive.
- Are you crying?
- Uh-uh.
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.
Hey, Jack!
Still haven't learned your manners?
I'm Tru Davies.
Megan Roberts. Nice to meet you.
So, what's new, Jack?
- Would you give me a minute?
- Mm-hm. Sure.
I know how you're getting
your inside information.
You see the victim's day
when you rewind.
Very clever girl, Tru. It only took
you six months to figure that one out.
Let me guess, you saw the painting?
Just my luck. This was
the first museum I tried.
She asked you for help, didn't she?
Wow. So obviously there's been some
kind of sick cosmic mix-up.
Maybe not. Maybe it happened
this way for a reason.
What are you saying,
you're gonna help her?
"Help me" doesn't always
mean "save me."
The hell it doesn't.
Why else would she ask you?
To be honest, I'm not sure yet.
But this much I do know:
She didn't ask you for help.
You've got no business here.
- Unless, of course, you intend to kill her.
- Oh, I wouldn't wanna step on your toes.
Actually, she's gonna
handle the hard part.
What are you talking about?
She's gonna kill herself.
And if she doesn't wanna live,
she's got no use for you.
Your guess was right, Davis.
Megan Roberts is definitely the victim.
<i>She jumped off the Edison Tower.</i>
Okay, let's see. Megan Roberts,
28, attended Reed College.
She, uh, graduated in 1997.
Currently lives here in town
at 1025 Birch Lane.
There's also a Wendy Roberts,
could be a sister or mother.
I don't get it. Why does someone
who wants to die ask for help?
Consider who she asked. Death himself.
Yeah, but she was already dead.
What would she need from Jack?
More importantly, what
does she need from you?
- Figured I'd find you here.
- Hey, man. Unbelievable.
- Hey, Billy. Hey, man, what is up, bro?
- Oh, you know, same old.
We call you every Friday night,
Ed Bone's poker game, you never show.
I know, man. I've been crazy busy.
- Yeah? What's her name?
- No. I got a job.
Yeah, I got a job. I'm working
for my old man.
That's great. I thought you were
too cool to hang out with us.
No. Hey, man, can I get two?
So how is everybody, man?
How's Larry doing?
Oh, Fat Larry, man, he's in jail.
- Oh, shut up.
- No, it's assault.
He's looking at, like, eight years.
- Wow.
- So, what, you came just to hang out...
...and get faced or what?
Well, you see it's a little
hard to explain, actually, um...
Oh, I know why you're here.
I know that look.
What look? What? What look?
The "I'm broke and I need
some cash," that's what look.
No. No, no. It's not that, man. It's...
Chill. Don't worry. Let your big brother
Billy front you, all right? Check it.
There's a job tonight. It's boxes
in the trucks. Easy-peasy. Hmm? Huh?
Mmm. Yeah... No. I got a better idea.
We get some beers, grab some pizza...
...and go back to my place
and watch that Coogan fight.
We'll just kick it old-school style,
me and you.
Not to worry, my brother.
You in. Come on.
Sit.
Hey. Wendy, right?
- Right.
- I'm Tru Davies.
Megan and I used to be
floor mates back at Reed.
- She does live here, right?
- Yeah, she does. Um...
So, um, when was the last time
you and Megan talked?
It's been mostly Christmas cards
the past couple of years.
Actually, I was starting
to get worried because...
...she hasn't returned
my last couple phone calls.
And the one time we did speak,
she sounded kind of distant.
Is everything all right?
Look, um...
Why don't you come inside.
We should talk.
- Working late?
- As usual.
Yeah. Me too.
So I was thinking, what do you say
that we have dinner here together?
- In the morgue?
- Sure.
It'll be fun. Like a picnic, only
with cold tile instead of warm sand.
- Hey, you go in. I'II, uh, meet you inside.
- Okay.
- I have to talk to Megan.
- Stay out of this.
She's dying.
I spoke to her sister.
She has leukemia.
You see, you don't have to do anything
tonight. She's gonna die anyway.
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah, I heard you.
Thank you.
Jack!
Whoa, whoa, where's your ticket?
I don't have one. How much are they?
We've been sold out for two weeks.
Good luck finding any.
Two tickets! I got two tickets for
the jazz. Anybody want two tickets?
- I'll take them.
- Hey.
Weird. I tried calling you earlier.
- How much you want for them?
- What, for these?
- Nothing, you really want them?
- For us, we'll go, it'll be fun.
No, I hate jazz, I don't wanna go.
Me too. But you know,
it's like lima beans.
You have to check in every once in
a while to see if your taste has changed.
Come on.
- Hey.
- Hey, you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Oh, don't tell me. You hate jazz.
- No, it's not that. It's just, um...
Is there maybe something going on
that you're not telling me?
Because I like you, Megan, and I think
we've been having a really great day.
- Then let's keep having it.
- I'd like that.
But I get the feeling
there's not gonna be another one.
Let's say I told you I wanted
to see you again this weekend.
What would you say to that?
- I'm not gonna be around this weekend.
- Where are you gonna be?
Six months ago...
...I found out I have leukemia.
The doctors give me a year.
The first symptoms
came on pretty quick.
My sister had to quit her job last month
to take care of me when things got bad.
From here on out, it only gets worse.
The good days...
...like today...
...will slowly dwindle away to nothing.
The pain will get worse.
Most people with
this kind of leukemia...
...spend the last few months
of their lives in a hospital bed...
...hooked up to machines and tubes,
completely helpless.
I will not die like that.
This list.
It's 10 things I wanted to do
before I died.
Only got around to four of them.
Procrastinator till the end, I guess.
Do the others for me, Jack.
One day I will see you again,
and you can tell me all about it.
This is your list.
You should do these things.
When I was in bed these last few
weeks, I made a promise to myself.
If I could get just one more good day,
I would take advantage of it.
I have an insurance policy through work,
good only in case of accidental death.
A hundred thousand dollars.
Mine's going to my sister.
- And you're gonna kill yourself?
- Not exactly.
I told you, the policy
doesn't pay on suicide.
It has to look like an accident.
Oh, I should've seen this coming.
This Tru, is she an ex-girlfriend
or something?
It's a long story.
Hey, you guys.
What a weird coincidence.
- Jack, Megan, this is Jensen Richie.
- Hey. I saw you at Tru's party.
- How you doing?
- Good.
First the museum, and now this.
We should all hang out together.
Or not. You wanna get a drink, Megan?
- Yeah, it'd be great.
- I'll get us something too.
Why don't you and Megan hang out.
We'll be right back.
- Okay.
- Okay, what is it with those two?
I don't know. But I'm sure
it's one hell of a story.
She has an insurance policy, $ 100,000.
When she died on day one,
everyone thought it was suicide.
Tonight it has to look like an accident.
That's the only way the policy pays off.
That's why she asked me for help.
- And you're gonna do it?
- She wants this, Tru.
She doesn't wanna suffer
through a long, slow, painful decline.
It's her life. It's her death.
It's her decision.
I'm gonna talk to her, Jack, whether
you wanna try and stop me or not.
Be my guest.
- Hey. Oh!
- Oh, God!
Tru, you have a really hard head.
Thank you. I mean, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
No, it's fine, I think. I thought
you were gonna get drinks.
I totally forgot. Um, would you mind
getting them for us?
Look, I know this is weird, but
kind of fun, in a weird way, right?
- Not really, but...
- Five minutes.
I need five minutes to talk to Megan,
and then we'll go get dinner. My treat.
Okay. I'm just gonna go
rinse the blood off my teeth.
- Fantastic idea.
- All right.
We gotta get going. I gotta tell
Kevin you're onboard tonight.
Oh, hey, look, about tonight.
Skip it.
- What're you talking about?
- Skip it.
We're gonna make, like, $300
in, like, half an hour.
Yeah. Or get nailed.
You just spent the day...
...telling me half the guys we grew up
with are locked up. They're in jail.
Billy, you have used up
about 10 of your nine lives.
You can't be lucky forever.
One day things are gonna go sour.
I just don't want it to be tonight.
- Right?
- So wait up.
Is that why you came by today?
To tell me to stop doing jobs?
I don't see you for three months
and suddenly you're my parole officer?
I'm just saying,
you don't have to do it tonight.
What? You want me to call my daddy,
like you? Maybe he can give me a job?
Here's the problem.
My daddy lives on a bench right
across from the bus depot, right?
Last time I saw him, he asked me for
a quarter. Didn't even know who I was.
We gotta do this less often.
- Hey, I'm trying to do you a favor, man.
- Step off.
I'm sorry about your father.
But take it from a friend.
Life, it doesn't hand you
too many second chances.
Now, you just got one.
Now, trust me on this, Billy.
Okay? Stay home.
I'll take it under advisement.
So...
...what's up with you and Jack, huh?
Love or hate?
I wish it were that easy.
But the two of you seem
to be hitting it off, though.
- Have you known him long?
- Just met him today.
Oh. It's funny how things
can change in a day, huh?
Oh, just so you know, Jack and I
are not together. We never have been.
So he's fair game if you're interested.
I'm not really thinking long-term.
Yeah, sometimes it's more fun not to.
Last year I had someone
I was real close to...
...and it took off fast
and heavy, and then, uh...
Well, and then he died.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I was so angry when Luc died.
I couldn't breathe.
After a while, I realized
how lucky I was...
...for the time I had with him.
And then the craziest thing happened.
What?
I had a great day.
Right when I thought
that I never would again.
Sometimes good stuff happens
out of the blue too.
So apparently Jack told you I'm dying,
I have a life insurance policy...
...and I don't plan on being
around for Christmas.
Look, I'm not trying to question
your motives.
I can't even begin to imagine
what you're dealing with.
But what if there was another
way to get that money?
A hundred thousand dollars?
Unless you're a bank robber,
I'd say you're crazy.
What if I could?
It's not just about the money.
I know.
But you had a great day.
I mean, you could set
your Plan B in effect any time.
Tomorrow or next week or next month.
It doesn't have to end tonight.
How you doing?
Better and better.
Anyways, guys, it was so great
to see you, but I've gotta go.
- Right now?
- Yeah. Just think about what I said.
Here.
- Where you going?
- To the Coogan fight.
Oh, you're ditching jazz to go
watch boxing? Oh, I am in!
Deal.
<i>Coogan takes a hit. Then another.</i>
<i>Norm 's hands just keep coming.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is not</i>
<i>the way it was supposed to go.</i>
<i>And he goes down. Coogan is down.</i>
<i>It's all over. I tell you, folks...</i>
Damn it.
<i>... somebody should've</i>
<i>seen this coming.</i>
<i>And it's official. Coogan is out.</i>
That's 50, 100.
- Hi.
- Thank you.
Okay, and that's $ 100,000?
I had a hunch.
- Uh, it'll have to be a cashier's check.
- That's perfect.
Could you make it out to
Wendy and Megan Roberts, please?
Okay.
Hey, you wanna see something
awesome? I just won $ 100.
Wow, that's great!
Okay, miss, I just need you
to sign right here and here.
I didn't know you made a bet.
- Yeah, I did.
- How much did you win?
- Um, a hundred bucks, like you.
- Nice.
- You know, you can get that in cash.
- Yeah, I know, but it's for tax purposes.
There you go.
Thanks.
Think I should've gotten mine
in a check?
- Oh, no, cash is so much more fun.
- Hmm.
Hmm. These are fantastic.
Harrison, you just won us this case.
I'm proud of you.
Umm...
- So, what's gonna happen to those guys?
- Jail, most likely.
Great job, son.
Right.
So how we doing on that list of yours?
We still got some time.
I know.
But right now, all I wanna do
is see my sister.
I hope she's still awake.
Wendy?
You're not gonna believe
what happened.
Your friend Tru stopped by.
She just handed this to me.
Some story about a special charity,
the Relive Your Day Foundation.
I mean, is this for real?
Apparently.
Do you have any idea what this means?
The best doctors, the best treatment.
- And that trip to Greece you wanted.
- Number 10 on my list!
Well, we're going!
- I love you so much.
- Me too.
Today was...
How do I put this?
I know, it was bizarre.
I know. I'm sorry. Sometimes
my life can be a little weird.
Yeah, I noticed.
- But having you there made it better.
- Better?
- Like, almost fun.
- Almost fun?
Wow. That is a ringing endorsement.
"Almost fun." Nice.
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.
Sometimes I can just go to dinner and
see a movie and be very, very normal.
I think maybe normal's overrated.
So...
...one weird day, huh?
You have no idea.
- We had a long talk, you know.
- You and your sister?
Me and Tru.
She made me think about
a lot of stuff.
I think maybe I've been pretty selfish.
- Stupid.
- How so?
Well...
...I tried to make it all about
the money...
...but now that we have it,
time seems more important.
I thought you didn't want
machines and tubes.
I don't.
But like Tru said, I can
always go to Plan B later.
If I've got just
a few more good days...
...with you...
...then I don't wanna miss
any of them.
I was gonna sort of take this
one-way trip tonight...
...but now, if you're willing...
...maybe we could both go.
When I was a little girl, my dad
worked at the Edison Tower.
He would take me up to the observation
deck, point out at the horizon and say...
...that everything I could possibly
dream of was just past that line.
He'd say, "Just picture it,
whatever your heart desires...
...and it's out there
just waiting for you."
He died when I was 10...
...but I've always gone back there...
...to look out over the city...
...and dream about the things
that I want.
If I look long enough,
I can usually see them.
Go with me tonight, Jack.
And what do you think we'll see?
Another day.
I'm gonna go get my coat.
- <i>Hello.</i>
- She was gonna kill herself.
All she wanted from me was to help
her make it look like an accident.
Congratulations. Easy day.
- She changed her mind.
- That's not an option.
- I'm not gonna kill her.
- That's not an option either.
- You know the rules.
- <i>Yeah.</i>
A body asks Tru for help,
and I make sure they stay dead.
But I'm not the one who changed
the rules this time.
So as far as I'm concerned,
it's dealer's choice.
Jack.
When fate gets messed with,
there are consequences.
<i>You ready to accept the responsibility</i>
<i>for those consequences?</i>
You have to be strong, Jack,
and you have to do your job.
Come on.
Let's make this a night to remember.
Who secretly led the Rohirrim through
the mountain pass to Minas Tirith's aid?
Okay, I know this.
- Oh, no, it doesn't look like it.
- Uh...
- Celebrimbor? No, that's not right.
- Oh, I got you.
It's Ghân-buri-Ghân.
- You gotta take your punishment.
- All right.
Saved by the bell.
Hello?
- Davis?
- No, it's Zoron. Of course it's Davis.
I need your help.
Have you been drinking?
Uh...
Just a little bit. I'm on a date with
Carrie, but I'm clear-headed, I swear.
At your service, go ahead.
I've covered all the bases
with Megan and Jack.
But I wanna be at Edison Tower
to make sure nothing goes wrong.
<i>Do you know how late</i>
<i>the observation deck stays open?</i>
The Edison Tower observation deck
stays open from 9 a.m. To midnight.
Okay, I'm gonna be a bit late to work.
I'm gonna stay till they close.
You go, girl.
Thanks, D. Take it easy on
the Bartles and Jaymes, okay?
Okay. Bye-bye.
I have to go to the little girls' room.
Okay.
<i>Yeah.</i>
Tru's headed to Edison Tower.
She wants to get there before you.
Got it. Thanks.
- Bad news?
- Work.
Scheduling thing.
- They always call this late?
- We never sleep.
- Well, I am glad you took the day off.
- Yeah. Me too.
Otherwise today would've turned out
very differently.
I'll tell you a secret. I, uh...
- I hate my job.
- Aw.
- Then why not quit?
- I'm not sure I'm strong enough.
Oh.
So you take some time off
and figure it out.
- It's not the end of the world.
- I hope not.
Well, you know, you've never told me
exactly what it is that you do.
I help people.
Although most of the time they don't
realize I am helping them, but I am.
I try to make sure their lives
go according to plan.
- Like a counselor?
- Yeah.
Sort of like that.
Helping people.
It doesn't sound so bad to me.
You know what we should do?
We should close our eyes...
...spin around, point a finger and
whatever direction it is, we go.
Car, boat, train, I don't care.
First thing in the morning.
That would be great.
It's funny.
I feel like I've been given
a second chance.
- You know that feeling?
- Yeah, I do.
Hey, Megan, um...
Your list.
You should keep it now.
- Megan, I'm sorry.
- I got it.
- No, wait a sec.
- Hey.
It's my list.
Megan, wait. Megan!
Ah! Jack!
- Jack!
- I got you. I got you.
Help me! Jack.
Look up there!
Jack, help me!
Jack!
Jack, help me.
Pull me up. Please, Jack!
Please.
- I can't.
- Ah!
I can't. I'm not strong enough.
Jack!
Jack! Please!
- Help me!
- I'm sorry. So sorry.
Jack.
Just hold on, man!
- Jack!
- Somebody call 911!
- She fell!
- She got too close.
- It was some sort of crazy accident.
- Oh, no!
I wish it were you.
That makes two of us.
Break.
Red dog, right! Red dog, right!
- Twenty-six!
- Come on.
Hut, hut, hut, hike.
Gotcha.
Nice. Bring it in strong.
Nicely done. Nice hands, Davies.
Thanks. Nice throw.
You two,
all day with the compliments.
Nothing wrong
with positive reinforcement.
Ah, yes. I'm sure that Montana
always got all starry-eyed...
...every time Rice hauled one in.
Kind of hard to tell
with the helmets and everything.
Okay, 48 red. Break.
Forty-eight red.
Hut, hut, hike!
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Ah!
- Are you okay?
- Ow.
- Penalty.
- I think I did something to my wrist.
Let me see. Let me see.
Well, it's not broken.
You know, you may have sprained
your radial carpal ligament.
Oh, check you out. That's good for
somebody who's just auditing med class.
Maybe you should sub out,
put some ice on it.
With just 10 short yards
between us and intramural glory?
- Not a chance. Let's do it.
- All right, tough guy.
Nice win, kids. Don't forget,
cram session later, the cadaver lab.
Nobody leaves till we make
the endocrine system our bitch.
- Oh, I'm gonna be late for work.
- I'm heading that way. Want company?
- Yeah.
- All right.
You swear you've never played
flag football before today?
- It was my professional debut.
- You're a natural.
And a hell of an upgrade over Tyler.
I swear this guy's got hands like stone.
- Tru?
- That bag.
- What?
- It's just like the one...
...Dr. Kendall used to have.
Our family doctor
back when I was a kid.
Whenever he made a house call,
he used to bring a bag like that.
- You knew a doctor that did house calls?
- Oh, he was the sweetest guy ever.
He was the first person who told me
I should be a doctor.
You should buy it.
I'm not a doctor.
I'm not even a real med student.
Yeah, but you will be, right?
Come on. Davis is probably
wondering where I am.
- Ow.
- Are you sure you don't want me...
...to put some ice on that wrist?
Yeah, thanks anyway.
I'm gonna run to the clinic.
Doing some volunteering this afternoon,
so I'll get some there.
Oh.
Hey, Tru, is that you?
- Uh, yeah.
- Oh, hi. Hi, Jensen.
Hey. Hey, Davis.
Uh, so I'Il... I will, uh... I'll see you
at the cram session tonight.
Yeah, you will.
- See you later, man.
- Bye.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
that you two were...
That's okay. Nothing happened.
Of course nothing happened,
because I walked in...
...at the worst possible time,
which is my greatest talent.
Hey, uh, Davis, can I ask you
kind of a personal question?
Yeah, go ahead.
Well, after your wife died, um, how long
was it before you...? You know...?
Starting dating?
- Uh, four years.
- Oh.
But that had more to do with
social deficiencies than anything else.
Look, I know it's been a few months
since Luc died, but you know...
...if you're starting to have feelings
about someone, you should accept it.
It just... It feels soon, is all.
Well, it's always gonna feel soon,
whether it's today...
...or tomorrow
or four years from now.
Well, how do you know
when you're ready?
You fall in love again.
Freeze. No one move.
Help me, Tru.
Please tell me...
Please tell me that you can fix this.
Ooh, what happened?
Uh...
Well, Dad made some comment
the other day about my hair.
He said, uh, "You look a little scruffy
to be an employee of a law firm."
So I said, "Hey, why don't I make
the old man happy...
...get a real haircut for once."
You can't get one of those
for less than 6 bucks.
Come on, Tru. You're a girl,
you read all those fashion magazines.
There's gotta be something
you can do, Tru.
Uh...
There. It's perfect.
There's a new suit?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I say, you know, what the hell,
might as well go all out.
Get myself some new threads.
Do you like?
It's very professional.
No, let's not kid ourselves, shall we?
We both know what they call a guy
like me wearing a suit like that.
- The defendant.
- Oh, come on, Harry. You're not...
I was crazy to think I could change.
I can't change who I am.
Let's face it, okay?
Hey, you can change.
You changed your hair.
- I'm just saying.
- Watch yourself.
Not now.
Listen, I gotta go.
- Thanks for the hat.
- Totally. You're welcome. Bye, Harr.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
Not funny. It's not funny.
Harrison, you forgot your...
Avery, what's wrong?
He's dead.
What? Who's dead?
Jensen.
Jensen's dead.
Help me.
- Tru, I'm... I'm so sorry.
- I'm not here for condolences, Davis.
I'm here to fix this.
Please, before he asks, tell me
what I need to know to save him.
Okay. According to the police report,
there was a holdup...
...and Jensen got in the way.
He was shot once in the chest
at approximately 5:30...
...and he died en route to the hospital.
Where was the holdup?
A consignment store on West Broadway.
<i>He went back for the bag.</i>
There was this doctor's bag
in the window...
...and he knew that I liked it,
so he must have gone back for it.
I guess I should've
seen this coming, huh?
How could you possibly
see this coming?
Typhoid Mary, remember?
Everyone I care about gets hurt.
Everyone I love is in danger
just for knowing me.
- You're wrong about that.
- Really?
Because my track record
says otherwise.
In the past four months,
I lost Luc and Jensen.
- Even Harrison died once.
- Yeah, but you saved him.
All that means is I'm one for three
when it comes to people I care about.
Tru? Davis told me the news.
I just wanted to let you know
how terribly sorry I am.
She's a grief counselor. I thought
maybe you would like to talk to her.
- We could go up to my office.
- I'm not going anywhere.
Not when he needs me.
Maybe we should talk outside.
Okay.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
No, you were right to call me.
She's clearly in denial over his death.
Yeah, but still,
we should give her some time.
Okay. Whatever you think.
- Hey. I'll be upstairs if you need me.
- Okay.
- It's Jack.
- It's me. I've got news.
How long has she been in there?
Four hours.
I should go. Jensen's parents' plane
lands in 30 minutes.
Gosh, you should've seen me earlier
when I called them to break the news.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some doctor I'm gonna be.
I can't even talk about death
without completely losing it.
I wish I could tell you it gets easier.
I'd better go, um...
- Take care of her.
- Yep.
Hey, I was thinking,
if you were hungry...
...maybe you'd like
to go down to the diner.
Not now, no.
- I've got things to do.
- Are you leaving?
It's been four hours
and Jensen hasn't asked for help.
Neither have any of the other bodies.
So it's time to face the facts.
If I want the day to restart,
I have to find some new dead people.
- How do you plan on doing...?
- Last time I checked...
...there were five other morgues.
I'll jog to every one if I have to.
- Yeah, but, Tru...
- I'm not gonna lose him, Davis.
Hi. Um, takeout for Davis, please?
That was fast. Thank you.
Word has it our girl hit every morgue
in a 20-mile radius tonight.
No need to fabricate a story, Davis.
I know about Jensen, and I know
exactly what she's trying to do.
The poor girl just doesn't have any luck
with boyfriends, now does she?
Yeah, thanks to you.
Oh, the Luc thing.
Yeah, that was my fault. I admit it.
But Jensen,
that's fate sending a message.
Well, lucky for him,
Tru has a knack for changing fate.
It's different this time.
She's not God, Davis.
She can't pick and choose
the people that she wants to save.
- They have to choose her.
- Why are you telling me this?
Two reasons. First and foremost,
I happen to think you agree with me.
Deep down inside, you know
what she's doing is wrong...
...but you're too damn loyal
to say anything.
Second, she won't listen to a word
I say, but she might listen to you.
You are right about one thing.
I am... I am loyal to Tru.
And if she needs help saving Jensen,
then she'll get it.
Fine. Just don't say I didn't warn you.
I know I can help you. I just...
I need a little more time.
Any luck at the other morgues?
I'm sorry.
- You're tired. You should go home.
- I can't.
Not until a body asks for help.
Tru, that could take days,
or even weeks.
I can wait.
Well, maybe you shouldn't.
- What?
- Look, I know you care for Jensen.
But the fact is,
is that he didn't ask for help.
Maybe we should assume
there's a reason why.
I don't care if there's a reason.
I can help him, and I will.
Maybe you're not supposed to,
you know?
Maybe it's a violation of some rule.
Aren't you worried about consequences?
I don't know about you,
but I didn't get a rulebook.
I didn't get a rulebook either, but that
doesn't mean there aren't rules, Tru.
City Morgue.
Yes. Okay.
- Someone just called for a pickup?
- Yes, Third and Ogden.
I know that it's difficult...
...especially with someone
with your abilities...
...but maybe you have to accept
the fact you can't help Jensen.
Is that what your favorite grief counselor
told you, that I'm in denial?
Well, she's right.
I am in denial. I deny this.
And you know what? I can.
Excuse me, I have a pickup.
The deceased escaped...
...from a work detail
at 11:30 this morning.
- He was a prisoner?
- Yeah.
He was doing the roadside work
on Route 101 when he busted loose.
Used a fork to unlock the monitoring
device on his ankle, and took off.
We lost him for a couple of hours...
...then he stole this SUV,
and a chase ensued.
I guess we know how that ended.
Was anyone else hurt?
The dinner rush hadn't started yet,
so the patio was empty. Thank God.
He was the only casualty?
Now he's all yours. Enjoy.
Tru, look, l...
I know that you're angry.
But if this body asks for help
and your day restarts...
...promise me you won't forget
what we talked about.
Don't worry, Davis, I won't forget.
Come on, please.
Save me.
Now, that's more like it.
- Hello?
- It's me.
You're lucky you caught me.
I was on my way to the morgue.
Good. I've got
an assignment for you.
Please tell me they caught the guy
that did this to Jensen.
- This is gonna be a tough one.
- Tell me about it.
Okay. Two bodies, two "help me's,"
two totally unrelated deaths.
Guess we've got our work
cut out for us.
How did it happen? Did one body
ask for help and then the other?
- Did they ask at the same time?
- Same time. It was like in stereo.
By the way, I'm sorry about Jensen.
I know you two were getting close.
Look, he's still alive, Davis,
and I am gonna save him today.
Oh, I know, I know. I'm gonna
make sure that that prisoner...
...doesn't escape that work detail.
Actually, I was gonna hand the prisoner
off to Harrison.
Foiling the escape means talking
to police.
Harrison's got a little more experience
in that department.
- Well, all right.
- While I'm with Jensen...
...find a way to close the consignment
store where he was killed.
Right. Make sure the store's not held up
so no innocent lives are in jeopardy.
- Thanks, Davis.
- Is that it?
That's it. If I need anything else,
I'll call you.
- Sorry.
- That's okay.
Hi. Wow, where's she off to
in such a hurry?
Um, she's gonna go play flag football
at the park.
She's, uh, quite the athlete.
- Yo.
- Harry, I need your help.
<i>Can it wait?</i>
<i>I'm about to get a haircut.</i>
Just because Dad called you scruffy
doesn't mean you're due for a makeover.
- So I take it someone's day restarted?
- Sure did.
- The haircut?
- Does not end well.
- <i>So, what do you need?</i>
- A prisoner's gonna escape...
...on Route 101
in less than an hour.
Later today, he dies in a car crash after
a whole big car chase with the cops.
Unless I put a whammy on it.
One problem. I never got his name.
I need you to point him out.
How do I do that
without looking suspicious?
<i>- Tru? Hey, Tru, are you there?</i>
- You'll think of something.
Just give me a description.
I'll see what I can do.
Break.
Forty-eight red!
Forty-eight red! Hut, hut, hike!
Sorry. Adrenaline.
You're out one play.
Remind me never to piss her off, huh?
That was nice, Davies.
Didn't know you had it in you.
Sometimes you gotta fight dirty to win.
You, of all people, should know that.
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
You're planning to save Jensen.
I'm here to talk you out of it.
Considering you only see the lives
of people who ask me for help...
...how'd you know he died?
- Oh, there's plenty of ways...
...to find out about a murder. Watch
the news, listen to the police scanner.
I relive days too.
You can save the speech
about preserving fate. I've heard it.
It's bad enough you save people
that do ask for help.
But saving people that don't?
You're taking things
to an entirely new level of bad.
This from a man who pushed a woman
with leukemia off a building.
There's a bigger picture here, Tru.
We may be on opposite sides...
...but each side has its rules.
You break those rules,
and the repercussions will be severe.
Not just for you, but for Jensen.
- Is that a threat?
- It's a guarantee.
Believe it or not,
I'm trying to do you a favor.
Let me put his death back on track
for both your sakes.
If there are rules, you broke them
when you killed Luc.
I'm willing to do the same
to save Jensen.
All right, keep moving.
- Can I help you?
- No, sir.
But I can most certainly help you.
You see, I'm with a law firm.
Davies, O'Donnell and Cross, downtown.
I'm sure you've heard of us.
No? Well, anyhoo, um...
Well, one of my less-fortunate clients
is currently serving a 10-year stretch.
Now, he's looking to shave some time
off his sentence by ratting out...
...one of your guys who's planning
an escape this very work detail.
- Which guy?
- Don't have a name, just a description.
Late 40s, light hair, and he's got
a tattoo on his arm that says "Mandy."
If you don't believe me,
just check the guy for a fork.
He's gonna use it to pop
that little LoJack gizmo...
...they've got on their ankles there.
Wait right here.
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.
Everything's under control.
- The prisoner's safe?
- <i>They're shaking him down as we speak.</i>
- Thanks, Harry, you're a lifesaver.
- Tell tell me something I don't know.
Drop it. Drop it!
Put it on the ground.
Now, get your keys out.
Take that thing off of my leg.
Now!
- Is that your car?
- Yeah. Actually, it's, uh...
- Come on!
- Aw, hey.
Trust me,
you don't wanna do this, pal, okay?
- Listen...
- Get in the car!
- Okay, man. Let's talk about this.
- Now.
Come on, move it.
Let's go!
Nice win, kids. Don't forget,
cram session later, the cadaver lab.
Nobody leaves until we make
the endocrine system our bitch.
Hey, I've got my car today,
so if you need a ride to the clinic...
How'd you know I was volunteering?
Avery mentioned it. She said you
were that much closer to sainthood.
Davis gave me the afternoon off, so
if you think you could use extra hands...
Yeah, always. I just have to warn you...
...it's mostly lab work and filing.
It can get pretty boring.
Believe me, I could use
a little more boredom in my life.
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.
Whew.
So, um, what are you doing?
The cops are gonna be looking
for this car. I gotta ditch it.
Right. Right, I hear you.
Good idea.
I'm sorry about the gun, by the way.
I hope I didn't scare you too bad.
Aw, I've been there, done that.
Actually, I hate guns.
- Never held one before today.
- Wow.
Could've fooled me.
Thanks for the ride, kid.
This your suit?
- Mind if I borrow?
- Just happy to be alive here.
It's all yours.
Okay, okay. Think, Harrison.
Think, think, think.
Okay, what would Tru do?
Here's the thing. No one is more
hooked up in this town than I am.
So whatever you need
to get a clean getaway:
- Fake IDs, passports, bus tickets...
- No, thanks. I take care of myself.
Ah, but you might change your mind.
In which case, I should stick around.
No. I won't, and you shouldn't.
I hear you. I'm hearing you.
But call me crazy, but l...
You know what I can't figure out?
I let you go, and you're not going.
Look, here's the thing.
Let's just say I'm not a fan
of the cops.
Besides, you seem like a decent guy.
Now, really,
let me do something, please.
Try to keep up.
You know,
you are an extremely weird kid.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
<i>This is Harrison. Leave a message.</i>
Hey, Harry, I haven't heard from you
since this morning.
I wanted to make sure you're okay.
Call me.
- How you holding up?
- A couple of paper cuts.
- But otherwise, good.
- Nice.
Jensen, I need you to take
a medical history in Exam Room 1.
- Patient's name is Stan Kirby.
- Stan Kirby. All right, no problem.
All right, Mr. Kirby, let's get started.
Well, you're not Mr. Kirby, are you?
I somehow seriously doubt
that you're here...
...because your sciatica is acting up.
It's good to see you again, Jensen.
Likewise, Jack. You mind telling me
why you're here?
First of all, let me apologize
for sneaking in like this.
I only did it because I didn't
want Tru to know I was here.
- Because...?
- Because I need to talk to you alone...
...about Tru.
She's been keeping something
from you. Something important.
And I think you deserve
to know about it.
Okay.
You see...
...she lost someone close to her
not long ago.
- It was a boyfriend. His name was Luc.
- I didn't know that.
Of course you didn't.
Tru didn't tell you.
I can't really say I blame her.
I mean, "My last boyfriend died"...
...isn't exactly a mood setter.
But the thing is...
...Tru never got over Luc.
And since he died, she really hasn't
been able to get close to anyone.
- She keeps sabotaging herself.
- What do you mean?
Haven't you noticed
how secretive she is?
How she's always running off but will
never tell you where she's going?
Look, I think Tru is a fantastic girl,
and I can tell she's crazy about you...
...and that's why I'm here.
I don't wanna see her screw this up.
I appreciate that, Jack. I do.
There's other things you need
to know...
...but I'm late
for another appointment.
Why don't you meet me later on,
and I'll tell you everything.
For Tru's sake.
Okay.
Great. I know the perfect place.
I don't believe this. I'm five minutes late,
and you give my appointment away.
- Just spell your name for me, sir?
- Stan Kirby. K-l-R-B-Y.
That's odd. I checked a Stan Kirby
into an exam room 10 minutes ago.
Well, I'm Stan Kirby.
So whoever you checked in,
it wasn't me.
And, uh...
This isn't the supply room.
Which is why they have a big sign
that says "Exam Room 1."
Sorry.
Um, that's all, Mr. Farmer. The doctor's
gonna be with you in a few minutes.
All right.
I thought the nurse asked you
to see a guy named Kirby.
Oh, well they must have given me
the wrong chart.
- It happens all the time here.
- Oh.
Um, listen, I'm gonna get going.
I'm gonna see you later?
I was thinking we could get coffee,
kill some time before you hit the lab.
Uh, I wish I could,
but I gotta go to the library...
...for books for the cram session.
- You should just come to the morgue.
Davis is like the endocrinology king.
He's got tons of books on the subject.
Yeah, I don't wanna put him out,
because he...
Trust me, he'd be happy to help.
Really.
What are we waiting for?
Let's go.
I've gotta tell you, I've seen my share
of fugitive-from-justice flicks...
...and, uh, not one of them had a scene
where a guy on the run...
...would stroll through suburbia
in broad daylight.
- Somebody I need to see.
- Oh.
- Hello, Barbara.
- Travis.
I thought you were still...
- What the hell did you do?
- You can read about it in the paper.
Oh, you're unbelievable.
- Tell me where the wedding is. I'll go.
- No.
I'm gonna go
to every church in this town.
- You know I will.
- Don't you dare, Travis.
Don't you dare ruin this day for her.
Who is he?
- Uh, hostage.
- Yo.
A hostage.
You brought a hostage to my house?
The place looks great, by the way.
David a good provider?
Better than you.
You look great, Barbara.
Touch that car
and I'm calling the cops, Travis.
No, no, no. No cops. Bad idea.
Last chance, Travis.
The cops will hunt Travis down
like an animal.
Now that he's got wheels,
there could be a chase.
Innocent people could get hurt.
Just give me some time to...
Let me talk to him...
...try to get him
to turn himself in peaceful.
That car better come back
without a scratch on it.
You have my word.
I'd like to report a stolen vehicle.
Hey. You okay?
Yeah. I'm just, uh, waiting
on a phone call from Tru.
The two of you are thick as thieves.
Yeah, we have
a pretty unique relationship.
Oh. As in, you used to go out?
- No. No. God, no. No.
- What is it?
Um...
There's, uh, something about Tru
that you don't know about.
No one knows it except me.
- It's okay.
- She's not properly insured...
...to drive the morgue van.
It's my fault, really.
I didn't do the paperwork.
Hi. Hope we're not interrupting.
No. No, no, no. Uh, have you...?
Have you...? Uh, Jensen, this is Carrie.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.
We were hoping maybe
we could borrow some books.
Yeah. Any particular subject in mind?
- Got something for me?
- <i>You should know...</i>
...that the boyfriend's here
at the morgue.
He's supposed to meet me.
He may need prodding.
If you see an opportunity
to seal the deal...
- I will take it.
- Good girl.
So I take it
that was your ex back there?
Yep.
That whole wedding you mentioned...?
My daughter's. Mandy.
So that's why you busted loose today
so you can go.
So, what the hell are you gonna say
to her when you see her?
Nothing.
Mandy doesn't know I'm her father.
Her mom married David shortly after
I started my sentence.
Mandy was a little baby.
They never told her about me.
- That's pretty cold, don't you think?
- David gave her a good life...
...with all the things that I couldn't.
I'm grateful for that.
That's why all I want is a glimpse
of my baby on her big day.
After that, I'm gonna turn myself in.
- What's that?
- It's receipt from a florist.
I found it under the seat.
It's a big order.
It's going to St. Augustine's today.
Guess we know
where that wedding is, huh?
So, uh...
...if you don't mind me asking, uh,
what did they lock you up for?
I was a getaway driver.
Bank heists, mostly.
I started when I was about your age.
So before you got busted,
you ever think of going straight?
You kidding me? All the time, kid.
I learned pretty quick, though,
a man can't change what he is.
Oh, of course he can.
I know it's hard to believe...
...but, uh, I was kind of a...
A small-time scammer.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. I'm serious.
And now I got a 9-to-5, and, uh...
Well, I'm kicking much ass,
I might add.
You'll slip up.
Guys like us always do.
Damn it. Hold on.
And last but not least,
<i>Ampoule's Modern Physiology</i>.
Oh, thanks. They're, uh, heavy. Good.
Can I have a word with you, please?
I'll just read these...
...books.
- Is something wrong?
- You tell me.
- You didn't check in with me.
- I didn't know I needed to.
I left you three messages.
You didn't call me back.
- Because I had everything under control.
- Two people asked for help last night.
That is a lot to handle, even for you.
If you're trying
to keep something from me...
...whatever it is, I can handle it.
I just wanna help.
Two people didn't ask for help
last night, Davis, only one did.
- And it wasn't Jensen.
- I don't understand. Jensen didn't die?
I'm saying he didn't ask for help.
Look, I'm sorry I lied.
I didn't think that you'd help me
if you knew the truth.
Tru, look, at the end of the day,
you're the one saving lives. I get that.
And if you ever needed me,
I'll always be here for you.
Especially today, Tru.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Oh, is Davis...?
- Outside talking to Tru.
Oh, great. I'm telling you,
once those two get started...
...it takes forever for them to stop.
Really?
You look like there's someplace
you need to be.
Yeah, I'm supposed to meet somebody,
but I don't wanna interrupt, you know?
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll just tell them you had to run.
I think there's another reason
you're keeping the truth from me.
I think, on some level, you think
there's something wrong with this.
That there's a reason
that Jensen didn't ask for help.
You think fate wanted him
to stay dead?
- Well, don't you?
- I don't give a damn what fate wants...
...because fate obviously
doesn't give a damn about me.
How can you say that,
you, of all people?
Look at my life, Davis.
Look at everything I've sacrificed
to do this job...
...to answer this calling.
I've lost friends, family, sleep, sanity,
you name it...
...all in the name of fate.
And how does fate repay me?
It takes the people I'm closest to.
First my mother...
...then Luc, and now Jensen.
I'm sorry, but enough is enough.
I'm not giving up Jensen
without a fight.
- Where's Jensen?
- Oh, he left.
He said he had to meet a friend.
Jack. It's gotta be.
The consignment store.
Jack must have sent him back.
But I talked the owner into closing it.
I even watched him lock up.
Well, knowing Jack,
he found a way to reopen it.
He was shot once in the chest
at approximately 5:30...
...and he died en route to the hospital.
All right, I'll try and cut him off.
In the meantime, keep dialing.
See if anyone's at the store.
- <i>City Morgue.</i>
- He's not here, Davis.
- The store's still closed.
- I figured as much.
- No one answered when I called.
- Jack's got him, I know it.
<i>Yeah, but the question is where.</i>
I know where Jack took him,
to the crash site.
Glad you could make it, buddy.
I saved you the best seat
in the house.
Well, might as well. Do you mind?
- I had a feeling it was you.
- Whatever you did, it didn't work.
That prisoner still escaped.
Now the police are after him.
Oh, yeah, well, I kind of got a front-row
seat, if you know what I mean.
- You're what?
- I'm in the car with the guy.
- How?
- I'd love to tell you the whole story...
...but I'm a little busy right now.
- <i>I'm five minutes away.</i>
Keep him away
from the Third Street Café.
That's where he lost control
of the car.
Oh, good news.
We're nowhere near Third Street.
Uh, you know that whole thing
about being nowhere near Third?
Scratch that.
Hey, before we get started,
would you like a beer?
- Yeah, actually, that sounds great.
- I'll take care of it. I know the bartender.
She always gives me free drinks.
You stay right there.
I can't seem to shake these guys.
Okay, how about we call it a day...
...and pull over for the nice policeman.
What do you say?
- My daughter's wedding. Not a chance.
- Okay.
Harry?
Harry, are you there?
Oh, God, watch out!
Oh, God! God!
Oh.
Harry!
Get out!
Jensen!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
What the hell are you doing here?
Call it fate. Just wait here.
I'm gonna go check on the driver.
Are you all right?
Yeah, just a couple bumps and bruises.
Nothing to write home about.
We should get you to the hospital,
get you checked out.
No, no, no. Maybe later.
Something me and Travis gotta do.
She is something, isn't she?
Yeah, she's a stunner.
No doubt about it.
The question is...
...is she worth it?
- What do you think?
Uh, time for me to go, kid.
Here's hoping I never see you
around the yard.
Like I told you...
...I'm not that guy anymore.
You know, I think you're right.
I thought you might wanna know
we're two for two today.
Come on, Davis, you gotta admit...
...I saved Jensen,
and the world didn't end.
So it's okay to admit
that you were wrong.
I still think my concerns were valid.
But, having said that,
if I were the one reliving days...
...and Carrie had died on day one,
I probably would've done the same thing.
Hmm.
Oh, and speaking of Carrie, um...
...I think it's time
we tell her the truth.
- About?
- About what we do here.
- We don't even know her.
- She... You know, I care about her.
And I think she would be
an important asset.
You know,
if she had known about Jensen...
...she wouldn't have let him
leave today.
Davis...
Okay. All right. I don't...
I didn't think you'd go for it.
I just had to ask.
Well, I gotta go. I'm gonna be late
for my study session.
See you tomorrow.
Hey, there she is.
Nice job.
- Nice to see you, too, Av.
- Thank you, Tru. Seriously, thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
I sort of let it slip
that you saved my life today, so...
If he had died...
I checked school policy...
...we all would've gotten A's for this
semester, which would've been nice too.
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying...
- Hey, you okay?
- Oh, yeah.
I think I sprained something
when you tackled me.
- Oh, God, I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay. Believe me...
...I prefer it to the alternative.
- Can I take a look?
- Yeah, go ahead, please.
- Ooh.
- What?
That's weird.
I'm getting this serious case
of déjŕ vu right now.
What, you feel like
we've done this before?
Yeah, but, like, exactly this.
Me, you, the wrist, everything.
- That's crazy, right?
- Crazy, yeah.
As long as she doesn't
find out about us.
I have other responsibilities, a wife, my
job. I shouldn't have to worry about you...
I gotta go. I'll talk to you later.
Can I help you?
Hey, Dad. I didn't wanna interrupt
your phone conversation.
No, it's just somebody about a case
I've been working on.
- What can I do for you?
- I've been thinking.
I've been putting in some long hours and
some extra work, and I was wondering...
...if I could have a raise. Also, they
raised my rent, and I've been kind of...
I've grown fond of living indoors.
I wish I could help you, Harrison...
...but such a quick pay bump,
and for my son.
- You understand how that would look.
- Yeah, I figured.
You can't blame a guy for trying, huh?
Right.
Okay, so you get eight days
of Christmas?
Tyler, for the last time,
it's called Hanukkah, all right?
If you call it Christmas one more time,
I'm gonna shove a menorah up your...
Secret Santas. We should
open up our nondenominational gifts.
Great idea. Um...
- Ave, you go first.
- Yes.
- Drum roll.
- I got...
...a comb.
And I'm gonna guess
that it's from Tyler.
Hey. What happened to the secret part?
FYI, buddy,
the "under 10 dollar" rule...
...that's actually not a contest to see
how far under 10 you can keep it.
I know these two are
going home for vacation.
If they survive the ride
to the airport together.
But what about you?
What are the Davies up to tonight?
Well, it looks like, as usual, my family
Christmas Eve will consist of me...
...my brother, Harry, and a toast to the
rest of the family who couldn't make it.
Well, on the bright side,
there's less cleanup.
- But more therapy.
- You know what?
Coal for you in your stocking.
That's all you'll get.
My people, we don't do the stockings.
None of that.
What is going on with you? Normally
you're all "bah humbug" and grinch-y.
This year, I'm all about the holiday spirit,
the tree trimming, the church.
- Hell, I might even sit on Santa's lap.
- Lucky Santa.
Lucky me. You know,
I mean, I shouldn't even be here.
But you saved me.
And I know it sounds dumb,
but every day is a gift.
Even a day like Christmas.
Dad's doing it again.
- It?
- It. It.
- He's having an affair.
- What? Why?
I don't know. I guess he's not
getting everything...
...out of his relationship with Jordan.
- Ew. No.
I mean, what makes you think
he's messing around?
Oh. Well, there's the
secret phone calls.
There's the long lunches
that are not on the calendar.
- And then there's the apartment.
- What apartment?
Okay, ever since Dad started acting
all suspicious, I started following him.
- Harry.
- What?
Three times a week he goes to this
place. He spends, like, half an hour...
...45 minutes, then he leaves.
Look, I know Dad's got
a less than stellar track record...
...in the fidelity department, but I don't
think we should jump to conclusions...
...until we have proof.
- I know.
I know. You're right.
I know what I'm bringing
for Christmas dinner.
- What's that?
- Proof.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Someone killed Santa?
I know. It's pretty creepy, huh?
But I think he died of natural causes.
He must be one of those gentlemen
from the mall or something.
I came by to grab something,
but do you need me to bag personals?
No. All he has
is a black bag of presents...
...that's already been processed.
We're lucky. The holidays is one
of the most violent times of the year.
- But he's our only fatality brought in.
- Lf he's the only dead guy in town...
...what are the odds Saint Nick's
gonna open his eyes and whisper:
"Ho, ho, help me."
- City Morgue.
- Hey, Davis, it's me.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna be
a little late for our dinner tonight.
- Is everything okay?
<i>- Yeah, I'm at the youth center...</i>
...for our department's
community relations program.
There you go.
And we hired a Santa to bring some
presents to the underprivileged kids...
...and the guy hasn't shown up yet.
<i>And the kids</i>
<i>are gonna be so disappointed.</i>
He's just gonna be another person
in their lives who's let them down.
Yes.
Carrie, I think I might know
what happened to him.
Really? What?
- He's probably stuck in holiday traffic.
<i>- Yeah, you're probably right.</i>
- Anyway, I'll get there as soon as I can.
- I'll see you later.
Well, hey, if it makes you feel
any better...
...you're welcome
to join me and Harry tonight.
No, that's okay. It's been a while
since I've spent the holidays with a...
With a woman, so I think I'll just...
I'll wait for her.
- All right. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
I wish I could make her understand,
but that's not possible.
If she finds out,
there's no telling what it'll do to her.
The most important thing
right now is that she trust me.
Hi, Dad.
Help me.
Harrison, you're late again.
And frankly, I'm running out
of expletives, so here's the deal.
I have the night off,
and I'm not spending it waiting for you.
So as un-festive as it sounds...
...you can find me at the lab,
catching up on work.
I'll be the one cutting out a spleen
and pretending it's yours.
Next time I talk to you,
you better have a good reason...
...for standing me up
on Christmas Eve.
Harrison, will you let me explain?
Jack. You work with Jack Harper.
I thought you were having an affair.
- What are you talking about?
- Those calls.
Those calls weren't about your wife,
they were about Tru!
Look, I heard Tru mention that this guy
Jack was harassing her.
So I'm trying to protect my daughter.
- Since when is that a crime?
- How about when it's a damn lie.
All right, you want the truth?
Well, it'd be a nice change of pace.
Jack Harper contacted me with some
very strange stories about your sister.
He told me she had this...
...gift. Then he told me
to meet him here today...
...and that's what I was doing.
- So that was the first time you met him?
- Yes.
I've seen you go to that apartment
three times this week.
Dad...
I always knew you were smart, son.
Tru was better with the books,
but you, you know people.
You have no idea
what you are dealing with.
Then tell me,
what am I dealing with?
Look, I wanna
be honest with you, son.
And I want you to understand...
...what is at stake here.
- But you gotta promise me one thing.
- What? What is that?
You will not mention to Tru
what I am about to discuss with you.
It'll be a cold day in hell
before I promise you.
I am so sorry to hear that.
Dad.
Harrison, I'm so sorry.
- Whoa. You scared me.
- A room full of corpses, and I scared you.
Sorry. What are you doing here?
I thought you were out decking the halls.
I was, and then it dawned on me.
Nobody should be alone on
Christmas Eve, not even our friend here.
You know, we haven't
had a chance to talk...
...about how you're feeling.
- About?
I just mean, sometimes
a near-death experience...
...can have a strange effect
on people.
Honestly, I feel great.
I feel better than great. It's like this
huge wake-up call for me, you know?
A chance to reevaluate my priorities.
- In what way?
- Having them, for instance.
I'm not gonna have priorities.
I'm gonna do everything.
You know? Do whatever I want,
devil-may-care.
I like this new Jensen,
but I gotta tell you...
...I never really saw you
as the devil-may-care kind of guy.
Well, maybe not everybody's
as they seem.
Come on, Tru. Come on, Tru,
answer the phone please. Come on.
Got a text from Avery and Tyler.
Their flights are cancelled.
They're spending
Christmas Eve at the airport.
Oh. That's probably my brother
with some lame excuse...
...on why he bailed on me.
<i>Help me.</i>
'Twas the night
before Christmas, again.
- Avery, it's Tru.
- <i>Hola, chica.</i> What's up?
I'm not gonna go to breakfast.
- Work emergency.
- Work emergency. Right.
You're gonna either need to get
a better job or a better excuse.
Right. But, hey, I was just thinking.
You and Tyler should call
the airline before you go...
<i>... in case they cancel your flight.</i>
No one wants to spend Christmas Eve
in an airport.
Yes, thank you.
Happy Holidays, Tru.
You too.
You woke me up yesterday too.
- Rough night?
<i>- No.</i>
Unless we're careful,
it's gonna be a rough day.
<i>- Harrison followed you to my apartment.</i>
- Thank God it's a new day.
The point is, just be careful around
your son today. Be nice to him.
Find out what he knows.
You know how this works, Richard.
We're not gonna get another chance.
- Hey, boss.
- Harrison.
What can I do for my boy?
Well, I've been thinking.
I've put in a lot of work, some
extra hours around the office and...
...I was wondering if I can get a raise.
- A raise?
- I really think...
- Well...
...you certainly deserve it.
Let me take it to the partners
and see what they say.
Hey. Wow.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
- Who killed Santa Claus?
- Natural causes.
Knowing you, he's gonna
open his eyes and ask for...
I told that joke yesterday.
He was supposed to deliver toys
to kids at the youth center.
- That's where Carrie is.
- I know.
She's gonna miss dinner trying
to keep from disappointing them.
- Lf he didn't ask for help, then who did?
- A cadaver.
- Which drawer?
- Not here. At school.
- Those bodies have been dead for...
- Six months. I know.
That's why I came here
to talk to you first.
I mean, I didn't rewind
to six months ago.
So why would a body
that's still dead ask for my help?
- One advantage to your predicament.
- What's that?
Well, the clues are always
on the body.
And for the first time,
you have a body to work with.
For the record, she was dead
when I got here.
- Duly noted. Now, get out.
- Already on my way.
Looks like I got the day off.
Because you're good, Davies.
But you're not that good.
Stale corpse, no clues.
Hey, what if I was to offer to help you
with your job today?
What if I was to offer
to help you kiss my ass?
That's funny. No, but really,
think of it as a holiday truce.
What harm could I do? There was
only one fatality yesterday...
...and that one already
"ho, ho" happened, am I right?
Come on, there's no one to save.
There's no one to fight over.
I might even be helpful.
Jack, there is no way
I would ever accept your help.
You try and be a nice guy...
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all good luck.
So you asked for my help.
Who are you,
and what do you want from me?
So you talk to them too?
You have this way
of catching me off guard.
Wow, so you blew off breakfast
for schoolwork.
When you said work emergency,
I just assumed that you meant...
I just feel I've been getting behind,
with all the classes I've missed.
Right, right, right.
Then why is it that you're working on
another group's cadaver instead of ours?
- Checking up on their work.
- I do the same thing.
You picked a good one too.
You feel that?
- It's like her skull is cracked.
- Exactly.
And you see the small pinpoint blotches
around her eyes?
- Petechial hemorrhage.
- And you said you were falling behind.
- So this woman died from asphyxiation.
- She was murdered by it.
Probably fell postmortem,
led to the cranium fracture.
A lecture the professor gave
one of the days you were gone.
He said it was pretty rare to find
a body that met an unnatural demise.
Well, not in my line of work.
Anyway, I've got some last-minute
shopping to do, but thanks for your help.
Any time.
Later.
Let me guess,
you think Dad's having an affair.
- I still hate it when you do that.
- Well, I hate it when you stand me up.
You didn't show last night.
What happened?
Well, it's hard to say
without me reliving the day and all.
<i>So, I guess we already talked</i>
<i>about Dad's phone calls...</i>
...and this thing with the apartment?
- Yep.
I think he knows I'm on to him,
because he's been way too nice.
- Like he's hiding something.
<i>- Relax, Harry</i>.
- Not everyone lives a secret life.
- Right, just you.
<i>Goodbye, Harr.</i>
Come on.
It's a black sack with presents in it.
Yes, I understand the irony.
Yes.
Can you just tell me when it's gonna
be released from processing, please?
- Uh... Okay, thank you. God.
- No luck?
You'd think being the medical examiner
that I'd have some pull around here.
I know you want
to help Carrie and all...
...but technically,
those gifts were his possessions.
Which he was gonna give to the kids.
I think that it would be easier if I told
Carrie how I know it's gonna happen.
Okay, sorry.
Any word on that cadaver?
All I know is the woman who asked
for help was murdered.
I mean, I don't even have a name,
not to mention that the identity...
...of all anatomical gifts
are confidential.
So to make a long story suck,
I got nothing.
You know, there is one person
that would be able to help.
Someone who saw
what the victim saw when she died.
No. No.
I mean, are you crazy?
- I can't trust him after what he's done.
- You said it yourself.
You have nothing.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Can be smart enough to not buddy up
with the Reaper.
Ordinarily, I would agree with you.
But since no one's gonna die today,
what harm can he do?
I'm sorry, Tru.
I'd love to help you. Really, I would.
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to hear
you say those two magic words.
- Please, Jack?
- Ooh.
Sorry. Those weren't the magic words
we were looking for.
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- Come on, Tru.
I just wanna hear
you say it one time.
- "Help me."
- Would you settle for "Bite me"?
Not if you want what's in here.
- Help me.
- I thought you'd never ask.
Come on.
I don't see why we couldn't carpool.
For someone who's dedicated
to saving lives...
...you should really take better care
of the environment, Tru.
I've got this thing about
not getting into a car...
...with a guy who kills people
for a living.
So, what are we doing here?
You wanted to know what I saw in the
victim's last day. Time for show-and-tell.
Most of it was pretty mundane. A sunrise
through a window, a taxi meter...
<i>... a young girl with pigtails.</i>
<i>Something that looked like curtains...</i>
<i>... with red flowers on them</i>
<i>blowing in the wind.</i>
And then this broken fence.
I figured what better place
to begin than with the end.
The last thing I saw
was falling off here.
Looks like we weren't
the first ones here today.
What's your money on,
coincidence or connection?
Only one way to find out.
Yes, hi. I just received the most
beautiful daisies, but the card fell off...
...so I have no idea who they're from.
I don't want the person to think that
I'm being rude by not saying thank you.
Yeah.
Ann Moore is the only person
who bought daisies so far today?
- Thank you so much. Okay, bye-bye.
- Impressive.
Thanks for your help, Jack.
That's it?
Well, I needed a place to start,
and now I've got one.
It's nothing personal.
Actually, it's completely personal.
Yeah.
- Hi. Ann Moore?
- Yes.
I'm from Hudson Medical School.
I'm doing a survey...
...of people who donated
a body to science.
- Now is not a good time.
- It'll only take a few minutes.
- I need to identify a cadaver recently...
- Honestly, this isn't something I want...
...to spend Christmas Eve talking about.
If you'll excuse me.
What my colleague failed to mention...
...is that we pay for this information.
Come in.
This money couldn't come
at a better time.
- Things have been awful tight.
- We're just glad to be able to help.
So you're here to ask me
about my sister, Allison?
Yeah.
This is her.
Do you mind if we ask
what happened to her?
She was murdered.
Six months ago,
by a man named Russell Marks.
They worked together and were
having a relationship on the side.
That is, until Allison
found out he was married.
That night, she went over
to tell him it was over.
It was the last time
anyone saw her alive.
I finished cleaning my room.
Okay, hon.
Go get ready for church.
That's the girl I saw in
the cadaver's memory.
- Pretty girl.
- Allison's.
My sister was a single mom,
so now I am too.
Miss Moore, if it's not too much, do you
know what happened to Russell Marks?
Well...
...he was arrested.
But the jury felt that there
was a lack of evidence.
"Reasonable doubt," they said.
I can't believe that he...
He gets to have a life...
...shop for presents,
trim the tree with his wife...
...while Allison's body lies
in some dark, cold room somewhere.
Where's the justice in that?
I'm sorry.
Is there anything else?
Cambria and I have to go to church.
Saint Matthew's is always
so crowded on Christmas Eve.
No, that's it.
Thank you very much.
I don't even get a thanks?
I was brilliant back there.
Does the fourth Horseman of
the Apocalypse need a pat on the back?
Whatever. The fact that I'm still here
means that you need me.
And that makes me feel
all warm and fuzzy inside.
Well, be careful. You wouldn't want
the ice around your heart to melt.
Cute. But seriously, what's next?
Since no one's life needs to be saved,
how do we help Allison Moore?
There are a lot of ways
to save someone's life, Jack.
- Stopping death is only one of them.
- That sister of hers seemed to have...
...a significant ax to grind
with Russell Marks.
- Maybe she was looking for payback.
- But no one dies, remember.
- No one has to.
- So you're saying attempted murder.
- Because if she got caught...
- Then Allison's daughter would be alone.
Thus, the "Help me."
We should find this Russell Marks today
and get there before Ann Moore does.
Hey, Tru, I gotta talk to you about...
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Nice to see you, Harrison.
Harry, it's okay, I got it under control.
What's up?
Come here a second.
Okay, I had a talk with Dad, asked him
point blank, "Are you having an affair?"
- And?
- He had an answer for everything.
Yeah. What did I tell you?
But then he said that that apartment
was where he meets his L.A. Partners.
But get this.
I got an old poker buddy.
He works for a car service
that handles the firm.
Those L.A. Guys aren't due till
next week. See, something is going on.
Tru, I can feel it.
I'm gonna give you two privacy.
You know, that would be just perfect.
What, are you crazy?
Why you all sleeping with the enemy?
There's no "sleeping."
He's helping me.
Bottom line, you can't trust him, Tru.
He's probably screwing you right now.
Richard, I hope you're getting this.
Your son is still suspicious.
You'd better get on this, or...
...we're both screwed.
Your brother was a tad frosty
to me back there.
Is everything okay with him?
You tried to kill him a few months back.
Were you expecting a hug?
A short memory,
the key to a happy life.
Ah!
- Can I help you?
- Hi, Mrs. Marks.
My name's Jack Harper. We're actually
looking for your husband. Is he at home?
Russell isn't speaking to the press.
I think he's made that perfectly clear.
We're not from the media. We're with
the Neighborhood Watch program.
We're actually just looking
for volunteers.
Oh. I'm so sorry.
We're newlyweds.
We just moved in down the block.
I'm sure Russell would love to help out,
but he's out doing last-minute shopping.
But then I'm meeting him
at Saint Matthew's.
If you're looking for volunteers, church
is always a good place to find people.
- She's right.
- Thanks for your advice.
- Maybe we'll see you there.
- Okay. Good luck.
- Guess who else'll be at church tonight.
- Something tells me we should be there.
That's kind of cute. That's nice.
I like it. Are those the eyes?
- Santa's not coming, is he?
- Yes, he is.
He is. It's just, you know
how those reindeer can be.
- That's very nice.
- Miss Allen, you promised us.
I know. I did.
It's just that sometimes things
can happen, even to Santa.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Who do you think that is?
- <i>Santa!</i>
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Davis?
- No, it's Santa.
- What are you doing?
- Explain later. Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Come on,
who wants to sit on Santa's lap?
Okay. Santa wants to make sure...
...that everyone's gone
to the bathroom recently, yes?
- Yes.
- Really?
Really? Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Are you even allowed in here?
I'm not the one screwing with
the big guy's plans.
If anyone's getting struck by lightning,
my money's on you.
Okay, so tell me the truth.
Why are you really helping me today?
As far as I'm concerned,
as long as the dead stay dead...
...there's no harm in giving
a little help to the living.
Or maybe I just didn't want
to spend Christmas Eve by myself.
There's our man.
Mr. Marks? We don't want
to cause any trouble...
...but we're friends of the Moores,
and you should know...
...that Ann and Cambria
are gonna be here today.
Look, Ann is still very angry
about her sister's death.
Rather than disrupt the services,
we thought we'd forewarn you.
Look, I appreciate what you're
trying to do, but I'm an innocent man.
- And I need to move on with my life.
- And what about Allison Moore's life?
- Thank you for your concern.
- Russell.
I'm gonna go enjoy the services
with my wife now.
Excuse me.
Well, that went well.
I'm starting to think the jury
was right about Marks.
- What makes you say that?
- If there's one thing I know, it's killers.
Once you take a human life, it's like
a smell that you can't wash off...
...no matter how hard you try.
And that guy...
...he ain't got the funk.
Ho, ho, ho.
What would you like for Christmas?
- A ferret.
- A ferret?
Okay, I don't think
I have any of those.
But have you ever considered
a bone saw?
To cut wood
for a really neat tree house.
- Thanks, Santa!
- Yeah. Ho, ho.
And what about you?
What would you like for Christmas?
A bone saw.
I think I'm all out of those.
But how about a splatter guard...
...to keep blood
from splattering on your face.
- You're the coolest Santa ever.
- Thank you. Ho, ho, ho.
And for you, there's a rib separator.
And how about some forceps.
I guess all I can do now is keep
Ann Moore away from him.
Yeah, well, if that's the case, then...
Showtime. There she is.
Come on, we're going home.
- That's it?
- Nothing happened.
- Maybe it hasn't happened yet.
- All right, we gotta split up.
One of us follows Ann,
the other stays with Russell.
Okay, I'll stay with Russell.
You follow Ann.
But if anything happens to her,
so help me, Jack.
Helping you is what I'm doing, Tru.
What do you mean, you can't stay?
Don't we have other things to talk about?
Hi, Dad.
- Harrison, what are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing.
Well, I guess you've already
spoiled the surprise.
- Surprise?
- I just signed the lease.
Merry Christmas, son.
It's all yours.
What? This place? What is...?
I may not be able to give
my new employee a raise.
But the partners can't say anything
about a father giving to his son.
I've been working on this for weeks.
But you almost blew the whole thing.
- I'm sorry. I was thinking...
- Forget it. Forget it.
It all worked out.
Oh, wow.
- Merry Christmas, Dad.
- You too.
Jensen.
Hey, stranger.
What are you doing here?
I guess I just wanted to see what it is
I've been missing out on all these years.
And pay my respects.
Who's that for?
That's for my uncle.
He died of a heart attack last year.
And that's for my cousin, who
passed away when we were little kids.
You know, think about this.
If things had gone differently...
...you might be lighting one for me.
- But things didn't go differently.
There but for the grace of Tru go I.
So...
...who's that one for?
Nobody.
I gotta get back to the lab, so I'II...
- I'll see you later.
- Hey, Jensen...
...Mr. Gorenstein doesn't need
the company tonight.
So I say you ditch the lab...
...and you join me and my brother
for Christmas Eve dinner.
You know, in the spirit
of doing something new each day.
Okay. I'll try.
Way of doing this.
- Hello.
- All right, I followed Ann home.
She's not doing much except
the crossword puzzle. How's Marks?
On his way home.
We must have missed something.
Maybe Allison Moore's "Help me"
had nothing to do with revenge.
Hold on.
Cambria!
Cambria!
Tru, I think I know who
Allison wanted us to stop.
It wasn't Ann.
It was her daughter.
Do you know who I am?
Of course.
From the trial, right?
That's how you know?
Is there anything I can do for you?
You can admit
what you did to my mom.
Look, Cambria, I think you should...
You think I should what?
Forgive you?
Or make you pay for what you did...
...before you have a chance
to do it to someone else?
Please, honey.
I loved your mother. I would never have
done anything to hurt her.
- No, that's not true!
- I was ready to give up everything.
My job, my marriage,
just for a chance to be with her.
Cambria, do you remember me?
I'm a friend of your aunt's.
This isn't what she wants.
She's angry. She misses
your mom just like you do.
But this isn't the answer.
We don't get to decide
who lives and who dies...
...who's guilty and who's not.
That's not the way it works.
- It's out of our hands.
- You don't understand.
He killed her and got away with it.
And nothing you do here
is gonna change that.
Look, it won't bring your mom back...
...and it won't bring your aunt
any more peace.
No one's gonna die tonight.
You're not even gonna hurt him.
You'll miss, and then the only one
who will pay is you.
What's going on?
- My God, what is this?
- Honey, go back inside.
Something that looked like curtains
with red flowers blowing in the wind.
Maybe it wasn't curtains.
You don't know what you're
talking about. I won't miss.
Okay, and if you don't,
then you've just killed someone.
That's something you're gonna
have to live with every day...
...for the rest of your life.
Isn't that right, Mrs. Marks?
What's she talking about?
L... I have no idea.
Cambria, don't make an innocent man
pay for someone else's crime.
I know this is a lot to ask...
...but hopefully you won't need
to press charges.
No.
I think she's been through
enough already.
You're just gonna let her go?
What about us?
Haven't we been through enough?
You're saying she should pay for trying
to take your husband from you?
- Exactly.
- Just like Allison Moore, right?
You need to talk to your wife.
Russell.
I did it for us.
Don't tell me.
Tell them.
Thank you for everything
you did today.
I would be more thankful if I understood
how you knew to actually do it, but...
Davis.
I've been thinking about what the best
thing is to give you for Christmas.
I think the best gift
I can give you is...
Is the truth about my life.
What do you mean?
You know how you were asking me how
I knew Santa wasn't gonna show up?
Yeah.
It's an interesting story, really. Um...
It's one that I'm not supposed
to talk about.
Davis, you know
that you can tell me anything.
Yeah, I know that. It's...
This is about Tru.
So I gotta ask,
why call the cops about Mrs. Marks?
The case was closed.
Why put the family through that again?
You know how you said if there's
one thing you know, it's a killer?
Well, I know victims.
I know what it's like to lose someone
and not know who took them from you.
I guess I owed a girl
who lost her mom.
I gotta tell you, it was cool
to wear the white hat for a change.
So you're admitting
that I'm the good guy?
Do you know why they gave the white
hat to the hero in the Old West movies?
It made them easier to light
for the camera.
The color of the hat
is not about right or wrong.
It's about what you choose to see.
- Well, I'm this way.
- And I'm this way.
- So I guess I'll be seeing you.
- Until the day you quit.
Or you do.
Well, it was fun while it lasted.
It was.
Merry Christmas, Tru.
Maybe I just didn't want
to spend Christmas Eve by myself.
Hey, Jack.
Okay, this doesn't mean
that I've forgiven you...
...and this changes
absolutely nothing between us...
...but I've always had this feeling that
no one should be alone on Christmas Eve.
Oh, look who finally showed up.
- Hey.
- Twice in one day. What a treat.
Relax, Harry, okay?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
What, pass up the chance
to meet all your friends?
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
- What was that? If it's a call for...
- Look... Merry Christmas, for now.
Okay?
- Hey.
- Hey.
I hope you don't mind.
I brought Moe and Curly.
Yes. We took your advice,
and we called the airlines...
...and our flights were cancelled. So...
We'd be spending
Christmas Eve in an airport.
Uh-huh. So Jensen is not the only one
who owes you one.
It was just a hunch.
Yes. Merry Christmas.
Hey! Davis, I thought you guys were
having your own holiday dinner.
We did. But then Davis said that Harrison
has a habit of standing you up...
...and we didn't want you to be alone.
- Are you okay?
You never called me to see
how things were with Jack.
- Oh, right. Yeah, how did that go?
- Fine.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. It's probably just the eggnog.
Well, we'll talk later, okay?
When are you gonna tell her
that I know the secret?
No, seriously, it's got cuffs.
Right here.
We have the best dad
in the freaking world.
He got me an apartment.
He got it pimped out, everything.
- Mighty generous.
- No, not generous, well earned.
Hey.
- Jack Harper.
- Hi.
Yeah, this is my dad, Richard.
Richard, Jack.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- You work with my daughter?
- A competitor, actually.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Long day?
Aren't they all?
In my endless pursuit
of the holiday spirit...
...there's one thing I haven't done yet.
- What's that?
Oh.
- Wasn't he supposed to be one of yours?
- Give it time.
And what about the mole?
She's got him.
Merry Christmas.
- I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.
There's the guy making out
with my sister.
Enough with the making out.
Don't you go all guardian on me now.
Come on, guys,
it's time to make a toast.
Précédemment dans Tru Calling
- Je revis des journées
- Tu revis des journées
- Voici Mr Harper, il postule pour remplacer Gardez
- Jack
Merci pour ton accueil, ce n'est pas facile
d'être le nouveau
- Tu aimes travailler ici
- Oui ça me plaît
- Je comprends
- C'est vrai ? Ce n'est pas le cas de tout le monde
C'est parce que la plupart pensent que seuls
les vivants ont besoin d'aide
Quand Jack a voulu se suicider
il pensait qu'il devenait fou
- Fou comment ?
- Il pensait pouvoir revivre des journées
- Comme moi ?
- Exactement comme toi
Allez, laisse-moi lui parler
Il était dans son monde
Sujet à des délires
Et je le serais aussi si j'avais dit à un docteur
que je revivais des journées
Qu'est ce qui te fait dire
qu'il n'est pas juste comme moi ?
Avec toutes les morgues de la terre
il est venu ici ?
- Je l'ai fait
- Tu y étais destinée
Peut-être que lui aussi, on ne le
saura pas sauf si je vais lui parler
- Et lui dire quoi ? Alors tu revis des journées ?
- Oui, pourquoi pas
Si c'est vrai, il sera soulagé de savoir
qu'il n'est pas le seul
Oh comme tu l'es ?
Ok, évidemment, c'est cool de pouvoir partager
les responsabilités avec quelqu'un
Et s'il le faisait depuis longtemps ?
- Il en sait peut-être plus que nous
- Et donc il faut forcément le croire
Voyons Davis,
Tu te méfies rien que parce qu'il s'est servi
du décaféiné dans ton mug
Le café est important pour moi
et tu l'es aussi
- Tu sais que je vais lui parler
- Je sais
Ep1-19 DOA
Oh Tru
Salut, tu dois être Randall
Je n'entends parler que de toi
Je ne peux pas rester
Je dois retourner au boulot
Mais je dois absolument te faire bonne impression
Que puis-je faire pour ça ?
Tu peux partir
pour que l'on parle de toi
- Au revoir
- Au revoir
Maintenant, tiens mon téléphone
Qu'est ce qu'il se passe ?
Tu te rappelles qu'on a dit que le jour où
quelqu'un nous demanderait en mariage
On appellerait l'autre et la première chose que
l'on dirait serait : ne lâche pas le téléphone ?
Et bien, ne lâche pas le téléphone
- Non
- Si
Il m'a demandé hier soir
Il veut se marier ce week-end
- Qu'est-ce que tu as répondu ?
- Que j'avais besoin de temps
- Tu l'aimes ?
- Je crois bien que oui
Est-ce que je suis folle ?
Ce n'est pas vraiment un étranger
On est sortis ensemble à l'université
Mais vous êtes ensemble depuis une semaine
Donc on est toutes les 2 d'accord
sur le fait que je sois folle
Non, pas si tu as demandé plus de temps
pour y réfléchir
C'est ce que j'ai fait
49
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,000
Je lui ai dit que je lui donnerai
une réponse à la fin de la journée
Salut, ça va ?
A part le fait d'être en retard
de 20 minutes, oui
En repartant, ne passe pas
par le centre ville
- Des travaux ?
- Non, un accident
La radio parlait d'une collision
avec le bus n°6
- On attend des corps ?
- Ça ne m'étonnerait pas
Tu as remarqué qu'on passait toujours
dans le couloir en même temps ?
Peut-être que cela a une signification
- En tout cas, je ne te retiens pas plus
- Oui, on se voit plus tard
Donc tu es sûrement au courant
Une jolie jeune femme revient vers moi
Vers son homme
- Harrison Davies
- De qui tu parles ?
De qui je parle ?
Lindsay, bien sûr
Elle m'a laissé un message
Elle veut qu'on parle
C'est le temps de la réconciliation bébé
On ne sait jamais Un message
peut vouloir dire beaucoup de choses
Ouais mais tu aurais dû entendre sa voix
A quel point elle semblait tenir à moi
- Harisson ?
- Oui
Elle pense se marier
avec quelqu'un d'autre
Allez, pourquoi tu dis ça ?
Il s'appelle Randall Thompson
et ils se voient depuis une semaine
Une semaine ? Elle vient à peine
de le rencontrer
En fait, ils se sont rencontrés quand
elle étudiait à l'étranger
Maintenant c'est un investisseur bancaire
à Burkes & Wales
Qu'est-ce qu'il recherche ?
Tout le monde ne cherche pas l'arnaque
Il est européen, n'est-ce pas ?
Je suis sûr que la Green Card
l'aiderait beaucoup
- Tu ne l'as même pas rencontré
- Je n'en ai pas besoin
Je devine bien le gars
Il prétend faire ce boulot ici
Nos avis importent peu
C'est à Lindsay de prendre une décision
Reste en dehors de ça
Docteur Frank Calvin, la quarantaine
victime d'une crise cardiaque
- Tombé dans une rue il y a quelques heures
- Heure de la mort ?
8h10 ce matin
Désolé de t'avoir réveillée hier soir
Pas évident de dormir dans ce sofa
Évite les canapés où tu seras
en plus sale état que moi ce matin
J'ai manqué un mémo ?
- Davis ?
- Ce n'est pas important
- J'ai la situation bien en main
- Tu es sûre ?
Tu sais, Davis est un gars intéressant
mais pourquoi est-ce que j'ai le sentiment
qu'en arrivant un matin, tous les corps seront
habillés pour prendre le thé ?
J'apprécie le silence comme tout le monde,
mais que se passe-t-il ?
Je ne peux même plus
t'enrager avec mes vannes
Tu veux la vérité
- Davis et moi, nous
- Épargne-moi les politesses
C'est au sujet de la lettre que j'ai reçue
du Centre Schenkman la semaine dernière ?
- En partie
- Je m'en doutais, écoute
- Je peux expliquer
- Tu n'en a pas besoin
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que je sais que ça peut être dur à expliquer
Jack, ce qui t'arrivait
ça m'arrive à moi aussi
On devrait aller boire un coup
J'avais des soupçons sur toi,
à t'enfuir tout le temps
La façon dont tu t'investissais
dans la vie des gens
- Pourquoi tu n'as rien dit ?
- Et toi ?
- Je ne peux pas croire
- que l'on soit deux, je sais
Je parle à quelqu'un qui ne pense pas
que je sois fou
- Comment ça rend malade d'avoir
- La même conversation encore et encore
Et devoir sembler surpris comme si on ne savait pas
<i>Oh mon dieu, Ce n'est pas vrai</i>
- C'est tellement intéressant
- Quand est-ce que ça a commencé ?
Ça a commencé il y a un bout de temps
Je me suis réveillé après une expérience de la mort
et je me suis rendu compte
que je revivais la même journée
Et maintenant, j'ai ce boulot à faire
Et toi ?
Ça va faire un an
Le jour de l'anniversaire de la mort de ma mère
Vraiment ? Ta mère ?
- Donc, les corps t'appellent à l'aide aussi ?
- Oui, pas beaucoup dernièrement
Maintenant je comprends pourquoi
Ils préfèrent te demander à toi
Je ne peux pas leur en vouloir
Tu dois admettre que c'est génial
Pouvoir sauver la vie de ces personnes
Changer les choses
Faire tout revenir dans l'ordre
C'est ce qu'on fait ?
Je me pose la question parfois
- A quel sujet ?
- Les conséquences, les effets secondaires
Comment ce que l'on fait
affecte les autres
Il y a un jeu de fléchettes
Allons jouer
Donc qui d'autre est au courant ?
A ton sujet
Je l'ai d'abord dit à Harrison
puis à Davis
- Tu l'as dit à Davis ?
- Il l'a un peu deviné par lui-même
- Il m'aide beaucoup
- Maintenant je comprends pourquoi tu es seule
Qu'est ce que ça signifie ?
- Tu l'as dit à Luc et il s'est enfui, non ?
- Premièrement, personne ne s'est enfui
Ça ne fonctionnait pas, c'est tout
- Deuxièmement, je ne le lui ai jamais dit
- Parce que tu avais peur qu'il s'enfuie, non ?
- Toi tu l'as dit à qui ?
- Moi ?
Personne
Ça rend les choses compliquées
J'ai un ramassage
En tout cas, merci C'est sympa
de savoir que l'on n'est plus seule
On se voit plus tard dans la soirée
Ou suivant le corps
peut-être qu'on se verra ce matin
- Hey Lindsay
- Je l'ai fait, j'ai pris ma décision
- Et ?
- J'ai dit non
<i>Et il a dit au revoir</i>
C'est un gars tellement bien
- C'était trop rapide
- Je suis sûre que tu as fait pour le mieux
Un jour tu me diras de ne pas lâcher le téléphone
et ce sera le bon gars, celui que tu attendais
- Tu crois vraiment ça ?
- Bien sûr, tu es une battante
- Merci Tru, bonne nuit
- Bonne nuit
- Tu as une démarche joyeuse
- La Tequila y est pour beaucoup
Mais plus important
J'ai parlé à Jack
- Et ?
- Il est tout comme moi
Il comprend tout ce que j'ai traversé
car il l'a fait aussi
- Tu lui as parlé de toi
- Évidemment
- Il était surpris ?
- Je pense
Tout est sorti
C'était libérateur, tu vois
Et il a parlé de quelque chose d'intéressant
Des effets secondaires de nos actions
A chaque fois que tu sauves quelqu'un
ça change le cours de l'histoire
Pas seulement la vie de cette personne
Mais aussi celle de tout ceux qu'elle connaît
Tru, le pouvoir que tu as est énorme
Changer l'histoire pour le mieux
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- C'est juste la façon dont il en parlait
Je ne suis pas sûre que Jack pense
que c'est toujours pour le meilleur
Vous pouvez m'aider ?
J'ai un corps, un suicide
Trouvé près du fleuve Chelsea
Et pour le bon docteur ?
Personne n'est passé, hein ?
C'est triste
- Oui c'est triste
- Quoi ?
Rien
- Tu lui as dit n'est-ce pas ?
- Tout va bien
Tu peux lui faire confiance
Laisse-moi t'aider avec le corps
- Attendez
- Quoi ?
Je n'ai rien dit
Nous y voila
Aidez-les
- Jack, c'est arrivé ?
- Ouais, On dirait qu'ils jouent notre chanson
- Donc de quoi te souviens-tu sur le docteur ?
- Plutôt grand, la quarantaine, cheveux blond foncé
Il est 8h02
Le Dr Calvin est mort à 8h10 ?
- D'après les témoins
- Tu te souviens de l'endroit ?
- Pour tout dire, pas vraiment
- Allez Jack
- 3rd et Cliffwood
- Est ou Ouest ?
- Est
- On se retrouve là-bas
- 3rd et Cliffwood, où est-il ?
- Je ne sais pas
C'est 8h09, il devrait être ici
Alors ?
C'était peut-être côté Ouest
Heure du décès: 8h10
Il est mort par ma faute
- C'est faux
- J'aurais juré que c'était côté Est
- On ne peut pas être parfaits
- Tu as déjà perdu quelqu'un ?
Oui,
je comprends ce que tu ressens
C'est difficile à croire
Dr Franck Calvin,
celui qui vous a appelés à l'aide ?
Oui
On est arrivés trop tard
Comment ça on ?
Jack et moi
Ensemble ?
Oui
Il n'y a rien entre nous
Vous avez parlé ?
J'oubliais, je te l'ai dit hier
donc tu n'es pas au courant
On a parlé,
et il est comme moi
Il a dit ça ?
C'est incroyable non ?
Oui, incroyable
Un instant
C'est Lindsay
Elle a rencontré Randall
qui lui a demandé sa main
Vas-y, réponds
Je la rappellerai plus tard
Dis-moi ce qui ne va pas
Je n'arrive pas a comprendre
que vous ayez échoué à 2
Jack s'est trompé de rue
Tiens donc
Ce n'était pas volontaire
Dis-moi, quand as-tu perdu
quelqu'un par erreur ?
- Pourquoi es-tu si dur avec lui ?
- Tu es très dure avec toi,
et tu trouves une excuse à Jack
Ce n'était pas de sa faute
Qu'est-ce qu'il t'arrive ?
Tu pourrais te réjouir de la situation,
mais tu préfères y voir un mauvais présage
C'en est peut-être un
Je ne peux pas accepter ça,
c'est une opportunité à saisir
Depuis quand perdre une vie
est-il une opportunité ?
Il a raison,
on a perdu une bataille
Je ne suis pas d'accord
Ça fait plaisir de voir
qu'on s'entend à nouveau
- Tu disais ?
- Rien n'est joué
Le Dr Calvin est mort d'une crise cardiaque
On n'aurait rien pu faire
Et il a dit <i>sauvez-les</i>
et non <i>sauvez-moi</i>
Son jour était peut-être arrivé ?
Intéressant
Toutes leurs demandes ont un motif
Nous devons trouver ce motif
Quelque chose à ajouter Davis ?
Je réfléchissais
Si ces demandes sont liées
à la vie de personnes,
il est probable qu'au moins une des relations
du Dr Calvin va mourir aujourd'hui
Le tout est de savoir qui
et d'y arriver à temps
On devrait commencer à chercher
dans son entourage familial
Lindsay, tu es ma meilleure amie
Je sais que tu prendras
la bonne décision avec Randall
J'étais comment ?
Trop surprise ou pas assez ?
C'était parfait
On aurait cru que tu avais peur qu'elle accepte
Pas aujourd'hui
Tu penses qu'on doit sauver
le fils du Docteur ?
C'est le seul proche
qui soit de la famille
Je peux vous aider ?
Vous êtes Marc Calvin ?
Oui
On est de la morgue,
et j'ai le regret de vous annoncer
que votre père est décédé ce matin
Une crise cardiaque
Cela devait arriver
Nous souhaitions que veniez
récupérer sa dépouille
Je ne préférerais pas
Merci de m'avoir averti
Mais vous êtes son fils
Nous n'étions guère proches
Vous devez vous en moquer, mais
il n'approuvait pas mon mode de vie
Franck Calvin ne m'a jamais accepté comme son
fils Je n'irai donc pas à la morgue
Essayez à son bureau,
c'était toute sa vie
<i>La vie et la mort
La destinée des âmes</i>
- Ça va Docteur ?
- Mon dieu !
Tru est ici ?
Elle bosse
Je peux prendre un message ?
Je voulais lui dire en personne
Remarque, je peux te le dire
J'ai eu des nouvelles de Lindsay
Elle le sait
Comment ?
Je viens juste d'avoir le message
Parce qu'elles parlent de lui
depuis une semaine
Lui ?
Celui que Lindsay veut épouser
Elle ne m'a jamais
Je n'ai jamais parlé mariage
C'est plutôt embêtant
Continue, parle
C'est qui ce mec ?
Thompson
Randall Thompson, je crois
Il est banquier
Il a un accent irlandais
Les femmes adorent ça
Je me demande pourquoi elles aiment ça
C'est un étranger
Il vit ici, et demande tout à coup
une fille en mariage
Ça ne te rappelle rien ?
Qu'il est impulsif et qu'il aime voyager ?
Le Dr Calvin m'a convoquée aujourd'hui
Bureau du Dr Calvin, ici Grâce,
attendez un instant SVP
Madame Casola, asseyez-vous,
il ne devrait pas tarder
Il a dit 10h,
j'attends depuis longtemps
Laissez tomber
Vos résultats seront prêts
cet après-midi, Madame Hoffman
Bonjour
Je peux vous aider ?
Je suis Jack Harper
Nous travaillons à la morgue
Je suis désolé de vous l'apprendre,
Le Dr Calvin est décédé ce matin à 8h
d'une crise cardiaque
Nous souhaiterions
qu'un membre du cabinet vienne l'identifier
Oui
Nous devons fermer le cabinet
Annulez tous les rendez-vous
Lily Elle doit l'attendre
Il faut l'avertir
C'est une serveuse au café d'en face
Elle est étudiante,
et Franck
était son tuteur
On s'en occupe
Tu penses qu'elle fait partie
des gens à sauver ?
Comme tu l'as dit, une mort peut avoir
d'énormes conséquences
Combien de vies dépendaient du Dr Calvin ?
Et si Davis a raison,
il faut trouver qui parmi eux va mourir
Mon dieu
Comment ça s'est passé ?
Une crise cardiaque
Il venait prendre son café ici tous les jours
Un jour il m'a vue faire
un exercice d'anatomie biologique
et il me l'a corrigé
Comment ça ?
Il m'a dit que le poumon gauche
était plus petit que le droit
Pour laisser de la place au coeur
Il m'a dit, c'est facile à retenir
car c'est comme la vie
Le coeur passe avant tout
Excusez-moi
Il ne ressemble pas
à ce que son fils nous a décrit
Généralement, on ne dévoile pas
ses sentiments entre membres de la famille
Lily a oublié son livre
Elle doit encore être à l'arrêt de bus
- Lequel ?
- N° 6
Ils ont dit à la radio
qu'un camion avait heurté le bus N°6
- C'est le lieu d'un accident
- Le bus de Lily ?
Il est là
Attendez !
Arrêtez-vous !
Jack tu es fou !
Quoi ? Tu n'as jamais stoppé un véhicule
pour empêcher un accident ?
Ça va ?
Oui
Vous avez oublié ça
Merci
Alors, Jack a stoppé le bus
Ça va
Je te pardonne d'avoir douté de lui
- Et maintenant ?
- Là est la question
Hier, on discutait
des conséquences d'une vie sauvée
Mais comment savoir si c'était vraiment
ce que m'a demandé le Dr Calvin
- Y a-t'il eu des morts dans l'accident du bus hier ?
- Luc n'a pas pu me le dire
- Jack pense que
- Et toi tu penses quoi ?
J'allais te dire que Jack et moi
avions discuté des conséquences
Tu discutes de ça avec Jack ?
Voyons, ce n'est pas top secret
Tu viens juste de m'apprendre
que tu lui as parlé de moi
Qu'est-ce qu'il te prend ?
Je me doute du soulagement que c'est
de se confier à quelqu'un
Mais on dirait que tu portes des oeillères
depuis que tu connais la vérité sur Jack
Et c'est exactement ce qu'il voulait
Tu es jaloux ma parole
Je ne suis pas jaloux
Je suis méfiant,
comme tu l'étais auparavant
De quoi veux-tu te méfier ?
Il a démontré qu'il voulait nous aider
- Vraiment ?
- Il a risqué sa vie pour arrêter un bus
Pour empêcher un accident
dont on ignore s'il aurait été mortel
Il faut se poser les bonnes questions
Pourquoi Jack est-il venu postuler à cette morgue  ?
Jack peut paraître un atout pour toi,
mais il y a quelque chose qui cloche
Quelque chose à son sujet
Tout va bien ?
Oui J'avais la tête ailleurs
Besoin de parler ?
Il faut que je m'assure que j'ai bien fait
selon les volontés du Dr Calvin
On a sauvé les gens du bus,
le boulot est fait
Il faut voir la vérité en face
Je veux m'en assurer auprès de son fils
- Attends, je viens avec toi
- C'est bon, j'y vais seule
Je ne vais pas te tracasser
avec mes états d'âmes
<i>- Pourquoi j'irais perdre mon temps ?
- Car tu es son fils</i>
<i>Ça ne m'oblige pas à simuler de l'affection</i>
Juste aujourd'hui, fais ça pour lui
Désolée de vous déranger
Encore vous
Le corps de votre père
n'a toujours pas été réclamé
Et personne n'est même venu l'identifier
Vous me sortez les même violons qu'elle ?
J'ai mes raisons
On n'est pas là pour juger
Vous ne le connaissiez pas
Il a réussi à convaincre un enfant de 15 ans
que sa vie était un échec
Car il ne voulait pas suivre
les traces de son père
J'ai mis du temps pour réaliser
qu'artiste n'était pas un synonyme de déception
Votre père n'était peut-être pas un bon père,
mais il aidait les gens
Il est même devenu tuteur d'une étudiante
Vraiment ?
Elle étudiait la biologie ?
Ou quelque chose dans le genre ?
Je vois
Papa était bon si on répondait à ses attentes,
mais dans le cas contraire
Disons que je sais l'effet que ça fait
de ne pas être reconnu par les siens
Je vous laisse
Il ne répond jamais à mes appels
Je voulais juste qu'il m'aide à choisir
la cérémonie, son habit de mort
Des choses habituellement faites par la famille
Je crois que je ferai ça toute seule
<i>Aidez-les</i>
Vous ne serez pas seule
- Je voudrais te parler
- Où est mon assistant ?
- Reste assis
- Qui êtes-vous ?
Harrison Davies
- L'ex de Lindsay
- Exact Écoute-moi bien
Si tu crois que tu peux utiliser cette innocente fille
pour avoir un permis de travail,
et lui briser le coeur
Peu importe où tu iras,
je te retrouverai et je te briserai
C'est la bague de fiançailles de ma grand-mère
Puis ce fut celle de ma mère
Je l'ai faite ajuster
pour que Lindsay puisse la porter
Quand nous rentrerons à Londres
Londres ?
J'ai eu une promotion,
je suis muté là-bas
Et je compte sur Lindsay pour m'accompagner
Comme femme
Je n'ai pas besoin de permis de travail
Juste d'elle
Je chantonne toute la journée
depuis que vous m'avez annoncé sa mort
C'est une période normale
Après la mort de ma mère,
je chantonnais aussi sans arrêt
Je pense qu'avec le temps ça passera
Mais si je ne veux pas arrêter ?
Des gardénias
Il me les avait offerts pour mon anniversaire
Je me mêle peut-être
de ce qui ne me regarde pas mais
Je l'aimais
Il le savait ?
Je n'ai jamais rien dit
Je me disais que rien ne pressait
Que je pourrai lui avouer
combien il comptait pour moi
Mais c'est trop tard maintenant
Vous voyez,
Franck faisait toujours ça
Il récupérait les cas désespérés de ses confrères
Donnait de l'espoir aux gens
Des cas désespérés ?
En phase terminale ?
Le taux de globules blancs était élevé,
ce qui signifie souvent un cancer
Mais le Dr Calvin a fait faire
des tests sanguins additionnels
Puis-je regarder ?
Selon ce bilan
la patiente a fait une fausse-couche
La grossesse fait grimper
le taux de globules blancs
Elle n'est donc pas malade
Franck voulait certainement l'avertir
Elle était au cabinet ce matin
Mais elle n'est pas restée
- Oui
- Donc elle se croit condamnée
Vous devez l'avertir
Le plus vite possible
Ça sonne
- Pas de réponse
- Laissez sonner
On dirait que tu es dans un bus
Besoin d'aide ?
<i>Je sais qui doit mourir</i>
Nadine Casola, suicidée
à cause d'un diagnostic erroné
Je vais à
<i>On a un corps
C'est un suicide du côté de Chelsea River</i>
C'est toi qui l'as récupérée hier
Et tu n'as rien dit
quand tu l'as vue au cabinet
Je ne l'ai pas reconnue
Tu sais lors d'un suicide
le corps est parfois méconnaissable
Une vie est en jeu
On discutera de ça plus tard
Attends un peu
Pourquoi n'as-tu rien dit ?
Je dois raccrocher,
je n'ai plus de batterie
C'est trop tard
- Je dois m'en assurer
- Pourquoi tu fais ça ?
- J'essaye de faire mon boulot
- Moi aussi
Tu ne veux pas que je la sauve
Tu veux la laisser mourir
Laisse-moi !
Enfin, réfléchis
Nadine Casola doit mourir
- Pourquoi tu veux changer ça ?
- Parce qu'on me l'a demandé
Ça ne suffit pas
Tu n'as pas idée de ce que tu fais
Il y a des conséquences
lorsqu'on sauve des gens destinés a mourir
Tu crois que je perturbe l'ordre établi ?
J'en fais peut-être partie
Et si on a besoin de moi,
j'irai aider
Et je ne t'en empêcherai pas
Cette fois-ci
Qu'avez-vous fait ?
Ça va aller
Restez éveillée
Ça va aller
Allez Nadine
Allô, j'ai besoin d'une ambulance
tout de suite
Que fais-tu là ?
Je ne t'avais pas rendu les clés
- Harrison, c'est pas trop le moment
- Je suis au courant de sa proposition
Et ?
Je suis allé voir qui il était
Ça doit t'énerver
Il faut que tu saches
Avant de faire une bêtise,
que tu regretteras toute ta vie
- Tu ferais mieux de partir
- Dis-lui oui
Dis-lui oui
C'est un bon parti
Bien meilleur que moi
Enfin pour l'instant
Et il t'aime vraiment
Dis-lui oui
Merci
Vous avez choisi le costume
Il l'a porté une fois à un concert
Il était très classe
Si vous avez besoin de quoi que ce soit,
n'hésitez pas
Bonsoir
Vous êtes Grace ?
C'est Lily
Je venais rapporter un livre
qui appartenait au Dr Calvin
Entrez
- Bonsoir
- Bonsoir
Merci
Franck vous estimait beaucoup
Il me disait pareil à votre sujet
Vous avez aimé les gardénias ?
Comment savez-vous ?
Il hésitait entre les roses
et les gardénias
Il a choisi les gardénias
pour leur signification
L'amour secret
Je le remettrai
dans sa bibliothèque médicale
J'ai été ravie d'enfin vous rencontrer
Je suis vraiment désolée que cela soit
dans de telles circonstances
C'est ironique
Franck voulait aider les gens
Et il n'a pas pu aider la seule personne
qui avait vraiment besoin de lui
- Vous pensez à qui ?
- Son fils
Franck ne savait pas comment lui dire
Merci d'être venu
Vous avez dit que
je n'avais qu'à signer un papier
Tout à fait
C'est la procédure normale
Vous ne serez plus embêté par la suite
Entrez
Grace, j'ai pas mal de boulot
Il les achetait dans des galeries
depuis des années
Il voulait être proche de vous
C'est comme ça qu'il s'y prenait
Je croyais qu'il ne m'aimait pas
Pourquoi n'a-t-il rien dit ?
Il pensait peut-être avoir encore le temps de le faire
Bonsoir monsieur
On se croise toujours ici
Vraiment ?
J'ai appris aujourd'hui
quelque chose d'important
On n'a jamais autant de temps
qu'on le croit pour faire les choses
Où veux-tu en venir ?
Je ne veux pas espérer qu'un jour
il se passe quelque chose
Je veux que ça marche entre nous
Je vois que tu es sérieuse
Mais il faut des changements
pour que ça marche entre nous
À moins que tu n'aies pris de nouvelles
résolutions, ou des aveux que tu refusais de faire,
je ne vois pas ce qui nous sortira
des problèmes qu'on avait auparavant
Cette fois, il y a du changement
Ce week-end je te dirai tout
D'accord
J'ai essayé de t'appeler,
mais tu n'étais pas là
J'ai sauvé une vie aujourd'hui
C'est bien, tant mieux
Jack a essayé de m'en empêcher
Tu avais raison, Davis
J'aurais dû t'écouter
Mais j'étais trop bornée pour le faire
Je suis vraiment désolée
Je m'excuse aussi d'avoir
Davis, écoute-moi
Tu dis que je suis différente
à cause de mon don
J'ai appris à l'accepter,
mais je refuse d'être seule
Je voulais tellement croire en Jack,
que j'en ai oublié mon meilleur allié
J'avais besoin de trouver
quelqu'un comme moi
Mais,
Jack est très loin de tout ça
En effet
Ce ne sont pas que des légendes
Ce sont des faits scientifiques
Ils ont tous la même conclusion
Chaque force a un équivalent inverse
J'aurais dû t'en parler plus tôt
mais je n'avais aucune preuve
Tu l'as dit: Jack est différent de toi
C'est ton opposé
Tu sauves des vies
Et lui
Tue les gens
Il est parti
Il a dû partir dès qu'il a su
qu'on était à sa recherche
- Oui, parti, presque
- A quoi penses-tu ?
Voilà la situation
Nous savons qui tu es
Tu es la vie, tu donnes une 2ème chance
à ceux qui sont morts trop tôt
- Et nous savons qui est Jack
- Mon opposé
- Mis à part son don
- Exactement
Il revit aussi les journées et s'assure
que ces personnes meurent
D'accord, on sait cela
Ce qui est le mieux à mon avis
La prochaine fois que la journée recommence,
Notre ami Jack Harper sera de retour
C'est pour ça qu'il est venu à la morgue il y a 2 mois
Son travail n'est pas terminé
Il est venu trouver son opposé
Et m'arrêter
3 jours plus tard
Salut c'est Tru
Laissez un message
<i>Salut c'est Lindsay
Je sais qu'il n'est pas encore 6h</i>
-<i> Je devais t'appeler ce matin</i>
- Il est 5h15
Je vais me marier aujourd'hui Tru
T'arrives à y croire ?
Ça ne me donne pas envie
de répondre au téléphone
Oh mon dieu ?
Vu que tu dois être accompagnée,
qui vas-tu amener ?
Sans importance,
je t'appelle plus tard
J'ai rendu des femmes alcooliques,
J'ai même réussi à leur faire accepter
des plans à 3
Mais je n'ai jamais conduit une femme à l'autel,
1 mois après qu'elle m'ait largué
J'adore Lindsay
Elle n'a jamais pu rester seule
Ça me tue
J'étais irresponsable, instable
Mais depuis que ce gars Randall est arrivé
j'ai décidé que je serai un meilleur homme
Quelqu'un dont on pourrait être fier,
dont tu pourrais être fier
- Je repars à zéro
- À zéro ?
Oui, il n'est jamais trop tard pour changer
En parlant de changement de comportement,
as-tu trouvé Jack ?
Non, j'ai rien trouvé, j'ai quadrillé la ville
comme tu me l'as demandé
- Bars, stripclubs
- Ça ne colle pas avec un nouveau départ
C'est une étape de transition
J'ai croisé quelqu'un dernièrement
Luc Tu l'as évité
La dernière fois que je lui ai parlé
Je lui ai promis de dire toute la vérité
Tant que je ne lui dis rien,
j'ai toujours de l'espoir pour nous deux
Dès que je le ferai
Tout ça va s'évanouir
Peut-être, mais peut-être pas
Tu ne le sauras jamais si tu n'essayes pas
Et si je peux démarrer un nouveau chapitre
N'importe qui le peut aussi
- Je dois te laisser, Wonderwoman
- Salut
- Salut, j'espère que je ne dérange pas
- Non, entre
Le processus est en cours, la chimie fait
son action Encore quelques secondes
C'est une vieille photo
Je ne l'ai jamais développée
- Elle me semble familière
- Oui, une ex petite amie
- Ça a l'air compliqué
- Oui ça l'est
Tout comme elle
- Je suis désolée si tu crois que je t'ai évité
- Je suis désolé aussi
Il paraît que je suis bon pour snober les autres
Écoute
Tu n'es peut-être pas douée pour les confessions
Rien ne t'y oblige
Que penses-tu de ce soir ?
- Ce soir ?
- Oui, viens au mariage de Lindsay avec moi
Et je t'expliquerai tout
à titre non-officiel ?
Je te vois à 18h
- Luc, souviens-toi, elle est compliquée
- Vrai
- Harrison
- Jack
- Que fais-tu ici ?
- Je suis venu voir un ami
Super, tiens-moi au courant quand il sera là
Écoute, je sais que Tru veut te faire croire
que je suis l'ennemi
Ce n'est pas le cas
Ta soeur et moi
on voit les choses différemment, c'est tout
Elle sauve les gens
et toi, tu les tues
Je ne suis pas un tueur
Quand une balle arrive dans la poitrine d'un homme
Je n'appuie pas sur la gâchette
Quand un homme ivre tue une famille
Je ne suis pas au volant
Mais quand ces personnes demandent
de l'aide à ma soeur
- Tu ne l'aides pas vraiment
- Harrison
La mort peut-être tragique
La mort peut-être injuste
Mais même si on a du mal à l'admettre
la mort est inévitable
- J'aide le destin à obtenir ce qu'il veut
- Et tu me dis ça parce que ?
Parce qu'elle t'écoute
Et tu l'aimes
Et je sais que tu arriveras à l'arrêter
L'empêcher de sauver la vie de personnes
qui étaient supposées mourir
L'empêcher de changer le destin
et l'empêcher de modifier l'ordre de l'univers
Oui, ok
Ne t'inquiète pas, je m'en occupe
Elle n'arrêtera jamais et je ne le lui
demanderai pas, alors fais-nous une faveur
Reste à l'écart de moi
et de ma soeur
Nous sommes ici aujourd'hui pour célébrer
l'union de 2 personnes, Lindsay et Randall
2 personnes qui se sont trouvées
dans un monde où
on ralentit rarement pour se trouver soi-même
Et pour célébrer cet amour
La mariée a demandé à son amie Tru Davies
de nous lire un poème aujourd'hui
Je porte votre coeur avec moi
Je le porte dans mon coeur
Je ne crains pas le destin
Car tu es mon destin mon chéri
Aucun paradis ne m'intéresse
Tu es mon paradis, le véritable
Tu es ce que la lune reflète
et ce que le soleil chantera toujours
Voici le profond secret
que personne ne connait
Excusez-moi un instant
- Ton portable était éteint
- Davis, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Ton frère
On lui a tiré dessus
- Blessure par balle
- Ça a l'air moche
Préparez la transfusion,
je veux du O négatif
Le coeur est touché
Appelez la Chirurgie
Emmenez-le en trauma,
on va essayer de le stabiliser
Oh mon dieu, Harrison
- Que lui est-il arrivé ?
- Ils l'ont trouvé dans une maison à Bank Street
Je t'appellerai
Je te promets que je t'appellerai
- Tu ne vas pas mourir, ça va aller
- Laissez-nous faire notre travail
- Une explication ?
- Non
Ça ira, c'est Harrison
C'est un battant, il ira bien
- Je suis désolée pour le mariage
- Le mariage peut attendre
Lindsay veut que tu y assistes
Bonjour, je cherche un patient
Harrison Davies
Il est toujours en chirurgie
Je suis la soeur d'Harrison
Vous le connaissez ?
Pas vraiment J'ai appelé le 911
On lui a tiré dessus
- Vous étiez avec lui ?
- Non, en fait, c'est mon ex
Il est tellement jaloux
Je suis vraiment désolée
Je n'aurais pas dû venir ici
Je voulais m'assurer de son état
Qui est votre ex ? Attendez
- Papa
- On m'a prévenu lors d'une réunion
Ils ont trouvé ma carte dans le portefeuille d'Harrison
Il est blessé papa, ce n'est pas bon
On ne sait rien encore
- Je vais chercher un docteur
- Il est encore en chirurgie
Ils m'ont dit d'attendre ici
Ok, on va attendre
Excuse-moi
Hey, je veux que tu t'en ailles immédiatement
Tu n'es pas le bienvenu ici
- Je suis venu voir mon ami
- Tu as quelque chose à voir avec ça
- Je sais que c'est le cas
- Ce matin, je suis allé chez ton frère
Notre conversation s'est mal terminée
Donc je l'ai appelé, pour arranger les choses
Un auxiliaire médical a répondu au téléphone
Je me suis inquiété
Si quoi que ce soit lui arrive
Je t'en tiendrai pour responsable
Tu comprends ça ?
Ça sera de ta faute !
Tru
Tru, chérie
- Non
- Ils ont fait tout ce qu'ils ont pu
Non il ne peut pas me laisser
Parle-moi
Parle-moi Harry
- Vous ne devez pas rester ici
- Il a besoin de moi
Tu l'as dit
Harry, tu avais dit que tu le ferais
Alors appelle-moi, je suis ici
Harry, demande-moi
Chérie, viens
Je t'attendrai à la morgue
Je ne te laisserai pas partir
Je serai toujours à tes côtés
Tru
Tu ne peux pas le laisser gagner
C'est Tru, laissez un message
- C'est Lindsay, je sais
- Merci mon dieu
- Je vais me marier aujourd'hui, tu peux le croire ?
- Espérons que oui
Je ne suis en retard que de quelques
- C'est bon de te voir aussi
- J'ai essayé de t'appeler toute la matinée
- J'ai appelé chez toi, sur ton portable
- Tu as dormi ou quoi ?
- Je suis allé chez toi, tu n'y étais pas
- Que se passe t-il ?
- Ce n'est pas ton jour aujourd'hui
- Aujourd'hui, je serai un meilleur homme
- Aujourd'hui, je vais
- Mourir
Donc laisse-moi résumer
Je suis mort, à l'hôpital, et je t'appelle à l'aide
Heureusement, oui
- Lindsay était présente ?
- Quoi ?
- Lindsay était à l'hôpital ?
- Oui elle a reporté le mariage dès que c'est arrivé
C'est super, Oui Les gens étaient tristes
Les larmes coulaient à flots
- Harrison !
- Quoi ? Allez
Combien de fois un gars peut mourir
et revenir ?
- Décris-moi la scène
- Je peux te décrire la scène
Ou je peux te garder en vie
Qu'est-ce que tu préfères ?
D'accord
- Tout d'abord, avec qui sors-tu ?
- Avec qui je sors ? Personne
Une fois de plus, il y avait une femme à l'hôpital
disant que son ex t'avait tiré dessus
Sur Bank Street Tu connais quelqu'un
qui habite là-bas ?
Non
Il n'y a pas de petite-amie, d'ex jaloux
ou de Bank Street
T'es sûre que c'est moi qui t'ai appelée
à l'aide hier ?
Ok, on ne sait pas pourquoi tu as été tué
mais on sait une chose : ta mort est évitable
Laisse-moi te demander ça
De combien de pleurs on parle ?
Harrison, tout ce que tu as fait hier
On doit le faire différemment aujourd'hui
- Donc on va où ?
- Dans un endroit où tu ne serais jamais allé
Comment peux-tu affirmer
que je n'étais pas là hier ?
Parce que le dernier livre
que tu aies lu était une bd
Bien vu
Je suis venu aussi vite que j'ai pu
Quoi ?
Je suis vraiment désolé
Toutes mes condoléances
Tu étais si jeune
Je suis toujours en vie
C'est hier que j'étais mort
Allons trouver un peu plus d'intimité
Je sais que c'est spécial pour toi
Mais tu peux y arriver
Je peux
Jack est venu à l'hôpital hier soir
Je te l'avais aussi dit hier,
Il était passé à l'appart d'Harrison le matin
Tu crois qu'il est impliqué ?
Non
- Mais s'il est mon opposé il fera
- que la journée se termine de la même façon
Il va s'assurer qu'Harrison meure
Désolé
Il a l'air de bien le prendre
Il m'a demandé une estimation
des larmes versées pour son décès
Ça va vous embêter, mais
je dois aller quelque part
Pas question
On a besoin de mon aide,
c'est important
Tu as certainement eu le même appel hier
C'était qui ? Et pourquoi ?
Je te rappelle que tu es mort hier
Ça peut vous sembler stupide,
mais depuis que Lindsay a rencontré Randall
Je me suis ressaisi
J'en ai marre d'être un raté
Il y a un centre familial près de mon appart
Ils aident les enfants en difficulté
J'avais besoin de monnaie
pour le parking alors j'y suis allé
Et quand je suis ressorti,
j'étais devenu le tuteur d'un de ces enfants
- Qui est cet enfant ?
- Ethan Mc Crane
Ses parents ont divorcé l'année dernière
Je ne sais pas ce qu'est un bon père
mais je sais comment vivre sans lui
C'était lui au téléphone
Il s'est fait choper en train de voler,
et il ne veut pas que sa mère le sache
Si on ne va pas le chercher,
il va être emmené au commissariat
- Où est ce magasin ?
- Entre Carven et la 5ème
C'est à plus de 3km de Bank Street
Bon, vas-y,
mais je t'accompagne
À bientôt mon cher
- Tu viens ?
- Non
J'ai un truc à régler
T'as pris ma place
J'étais assis là, hier
C'est bien ce que j'avais cru entendre
Sacrée Tru
Elle ne baisse jamais les bras
Dis-moi ce que tu veux ?
Je suis venu l'entendre de vive voix
- Entendre quoi ?
- Qui tu es
Tes objectifs
Comment tu peux te regarder en face
Je te respecte, Davis
Tu es un scientifique,
tu veux du concret, du tangible
Alors voilà :
je protège l'ordre établi
en accompagnant le cycle de la vie
Tu n'es en aucun cas
le garant du destin
C'est Tru ?
C'est là que le bât blesse
Si Tru est la garante du destin
Pourquoi le destin m'appelle-t'il aussi ?
- Elle les aide à vivre !
- Ils sont supposés mourir !
Tu ne comprends pas ?
- Elle ne peut pas lutter
- C'est faux
Je l'ai vue à l'oeuvre,
elle peut y arriver
Oui
Tu l'as vue empêcher des meurtres,
ce qui n'est pas une mince affaire
Mais si tu crois que ça s'arrête là,
tu sautes un chapitre
Quoi exactement ?
Je t'en dirai plus une autre fois
Je ne veux pas tout dévoiler d'un coup
Content de t'avoir vu
Dis à Harrison que je le verrai plus tard
- Si je le revois ici, j'appelle les flics
- Oui, monsieur
Ça ne se produira pas
Allez, viens avec moi
Si tu as faim, appelle-moi
Je connais les meilleurs restos
Oublie les sucreries
Je parle de steak-frites
C'est ma soeur
Elle est cool
C'est elle qui veille sur moi
Un peu comme je fais pour toi
- Salut Ethan
- Salut
- Tu ne diras rien a ma mère, pas vrai ?
- Non, t'en fais pas
- Tu le feras
- Quoi ?
On te raccompagne
C'est où ?
C'est pas loin,
je peux y aller seul
Allez, dis-moi où c'est
Très bien
J'habite à Bank Street
Mais ma mère travaille
Où as-tu dit ?
- Bank Street ?
- Oui, au n°95
Ta maman pourrait venir
te récupérer à mon bureau ?
Attendez-moi à la réception
jusqu'à ce qu'elle arrive
Tu vas où ?
Je vais jeter un oeil à la crypte
J'ai cru y entendre Davis
- Et ne touche à rien
- Promis
Je parlais à Harrison
Désolé de te décevoir
Je passais remettre ma lettre de démission
Davis s'est déjà chargé de ça
quand il a su que tu étais la mort
Je ne suis pas la mort
Je ne décide pas du sort des gens
Je ne fais qu'assurer le bon cours des choses
Tu veux donc t'assurer
que mon frère meure aujourd'hui
Ça ne m'enchante pas de le faire
C'est ça
À plus tard
Et si je le laissais vivre ?
Tu disais que tu n'étais pas la mort
si je me souviens bien ?
J'aime bien ton frère
Je trouverais dommage de le voir mourir
Je n'aimerais pas te voir le pleurer,
une nouvelle fois
Les ruses de la mort :
Promettre d'épargner un proche
Je déteste revivre les jours
C'est marrant au début,
mais après
c'est gonflant
Autre ruse :
dénigrer son boulot
Tu sais ce que je déteste
le plus au monde ?
La façon dont tu me regardes
Donc, je ne t'empêcherai pas
de sauver Harrison
Si ?
Si tu cesses
La prochaine fois qu'on te demande de l'aide,
fais semblant de rien
Si ton jour recommence, amuse-toi
Mais ne change pas le destin
de personnes qui doivent mourir
- Réfléchis à ça
- C'est tout réfléchi
Je peux sauver mon frère ainsi que
tout ceux qui me le demandent
Tu crois que c'est aussi simple ?
Chaque fois que tu sauves quelqu'un,
il y a des répercussions
La comptabilité de l'univers est bien tenue
et toi, tu viens la bousiller
Alors, si tu sauves Harrison,
une chose est sûre
Quelqu'un d'autre mourra
à sa place aujourd'hui
Tu te trompes
On verra bien
Plus que 12h avant minuit
Et je trépigne car je sais
que quelqu'un va mourir aujourd'hui
N'importe qui
- Peut-être toi
- Ou toi
- On verra bien
- Oui
Dis au revoir à Harrison de ma part
Tu choisiras comment lui annoncer
Très bien
- Maman
- Tu es là
Tu peux m'appeler
n'importe quand, tu le sais ?
Bonjour, Harrison
On s'est parlé au téléphone
Enchantée
Je vous remercie
Y'a pas de quoi
Emma
- Bonjour, On se connaît ?
- Non
Je suis la soeur d'Harrison
Tu peux nous laisser un instant ?
Bien sûr
Des trucs de filles
Il adore votre frère
Harrison par ci, Harrison par là
- Ça doit être difficile de l'élever seule
- Oui
On a rompu il y a 6 mois avec son père
Harrison est son premier modèle
d'homme stable à suivre
Ce n'était pas le cas de son père
- Comme modèle ?
- Non, Comme exemple de stabilité
Veuillez m'excuser
Ça doit être son ex qui est jaloux de Harrison
Mais ils ne se sont vus qu'aujourd'hui pourtant
- Il a dû raccompagner Ethan chez lui
- Au mauvais endroit, au mauvais moment
Tu te débrouilles bien
- Empêcher Harrison d'aller là-bas
- Et eux alors ?
Ils n'ont rien a craindre
Seul un homme pourrait être sa cible
Il vaut quand même mieux surveiller la maison
Tu vas le faire ?
Depuis l'autre coté de la rue
Si ça chauffe je t'appelle,
c'est pas mon job
À plus tard
Tu es formidable
Tu m'as sauvé
Je savais que tu le ferais
Rien n'est assuré
Tu l'as dit toi même
Si je ne vais pas là-bas je ne risque rien
Et maintenant ?
Je meurs de faim
Toute cette histoire ça m'a creusé
Écoute un peu
Tu ne te souviens pas ce qu'il s'est passé hier
Moi si
J'ai vu ton cadavre
et je ne te perdrai pas à nouveau, tu entends ?
Oui
Allons-y
Je t'emmène dans un endroit sûr
Sûr ?
Plus sûr qu'une morgue ?
Nous sommes ici pour célébrer une union
Sacré choix
Entre mourir et assister
au mariage de mon ex
Je préfère la mort
et pour célébrer cet amour,
vous avez désigné Tru Davies,
pour nous en lire un passage
- Je reviens
- Je ne bougerai pas
<i>- C'est quoi son nom ?
- Arrête Donnie</i>
C'est toujours la même rengaine
Ça fait a peine 6 mois qu'on est divorcés
et tu m'as déjà trouvé un remplaçant ?
Tu te rends compte de ton délire ?
- Qui est-il ?
- Il n'y a personne
Je ne suis sortie avec personne
depuis le collège et c'était avec toi
- Ne me mens pas Emma
- Mon dieu
Arrête ça tout de suite
- Mon pote l'a vu
- Papa ?
Je savais pas que tu étais là
On parlait avec ta mère
Tu devrais partir, Donnie
Tout de suite
Oui
Écoute, je reviendrai très bientôt
Je retrouverai ce gars,
coûte que coûte
Au revoir Donnie
Mon chéri
Regardez où vous mettez les pieds
Je sais ou je mets les pieds
mais c'est pas ton cas
Tu me cherches ?
Donnie ?
Donnie Mc Crane ?
Oui
Jack Harper
On s'est vus au championnat de basket
J'étais stadier
Non je ne vois pas, Jack
Désolé pour ton divorce
Entre mecs, on discute
Je suis passé par là aussi
Ça te flingue pas vrai ?
On est là avec une pension au cul,
pendant qu'elles ont trouvé un plus jeune
Mais faut pas se laisser abattre
Tu es bien mieux que lui
Tu le connais ?
- Tu connais le gars avec qui Emma sort ?
- Si je le connais ?
Pas seulement
Je pourrais même te dire
où il est en ce moment
Tru, décroche
- Désolé Davis
- Rends-moi ça
C'est entre Tru et moi
C'est le secret ignoré de tous
Celui qui réunit les âmes
Je porte ton coeur
Je le porte dans mon coeur
- Je suis surprise de te voir ici
- Lindsay a appelé
Elle a dit qu'elle n'avait pas pu te joindre
Qu'elle avait peur que tu viennes seule
C'est pour ça qu'elle est ma meilleure amie
Elle sait ce que je veux
Ça ne doit pas être facile pour lui
Voir Lindsay avec quelqu'un d'autre
- C'est la bonne alternative
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- C'est une longue histoire
- Je ne vais nulle part
Tu n'as pas encore entendu l'histoire
Ok, je t'ai promis des réponses
Des explications que je te dois depuis longtemps
Je me lance
Harrison est ici aujourd'hui
parce que je lui sauve la vie
Tu lui sauves la vie
Hier, on lui a tiré dessus et il est mort
Il a demandé mon aide et ma journée a recommencé
Et donc je l'aide
Parce que c'est ce que je fais
J'aide les personnes qui ne sont pas
prêtes à mourir à vivre
Et quand on était ensemble
Si je suis partie sans raison, ou agi bizarrement
C'était parce que quelqu'un avait
besoin de moi
- Parce que quelqu'un avait besoin de
- Ton aide
C'est ça
Et je ne te l'ai jamais dit
Parce que je sais que ça parait fou
Je peux faire toutes ces choses
Excusez-moi
Avant que nous commencions à manger
J'aimerais porter un toast
A ma magnifique mariée, Lindsay
Luc, Luc
Je vous le répète
Je n'ai pas couché avec votre femme
- Ce n'est pas ce que j'ai entendu
- Je vous dis la vérité
- Demandez à n'importe qui, demandez à
- Votre fils
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Quelqu'un qui en sait autant qu'Ethan
Mon frère a rencontré votre ex-femme
pour la première fois aujourd'hui
Vous ne me croyez peut-être pas
mais vous devez croire votre fils
Je comprends que tu dois être enragé
Je viens moi même d'assister
au mariage de la femme que j'aime
Je sais ce que vous ressentez
mais je ne suis pas le gars que vous cherchez
Vous avez intérêt à me dire la vérité
Ça va ?
Rends-moi service, garde un oeil sur lui
Je dois encore faire une chose
C'est un peu extrême non ?
Je n'en suis pas sûr
Laisse-moi deviner
Elle est amoureuse de quelqu'un d'autre
Si ça pouvait être aussi simple
- Tu as besoin d'être seul donc
- Elle semble si normale au premier abord
Elle est jolie et intelligente et
Tu sais quoi, oublie ce que j'ai dit
- Désolé pour le dérangement
- Que penses-tu de ça ?
Et je ne peux pas croire que je le répète
Elle pense que des morts lui parlent
- Elle pense qu'elle
- Revit des journées
- Comment tu sais ça ?
- Elle me l'a dit aussi
Ce matin, c'était un entraînement
avant toi je pense
- Et ça semble dingue au début
- Ouais
Jusqu'à ce que l'on ait des preuves
Et soudainement
Ça ne semble plus dingue
Ça semble miraculeux
- Tu as eu des preuves
- Oh oui
Tru m'a envoyé voir cette femme, Emma
Elle habite au 95 Bank Street
Et qu'est-ce qu'elle t'a dit ?
Cette Emma
Je ne suis pas certain de lui rendre
un service en faisant ça
En tout cas elle a les réponses
à toutes les questions
- Va lui parler toi-même
- Je ne sais pas
- Bank Street ?
- Oui
Oui, pourquoi pas
Les choses que l'on fait par amour
Cette Emma la joue à l'ancienne
Elle sera plus communicative
Si tu n'y vas pas les mains vides
Tu vois ce que je veux dire
D'après mon expérience
Des fleurs, pas des bonbons
Les femmes
- Ok, merci Jack
- Pas de quoi
- Donc ton frère va vivre
- Oui c'est le cas, pas grâce à toi
- J'en suis heureux
- Je m'en fous
- Malheureusement, quelqu'un d'autre doit mourir
- Épargne-moi ce ton faussement triste
Je suis désolé Tru
Comme j'ai dit
Il y a des aspects de mon job qui
ne me font pas me sentir bien moi-même
- Qu'est ce que tu lui as fait ?
- Je n'ai rien fait
Tu l'as fait
Tu lui as dit qui tu étais
Je lui ai indiqué où il pouvait
avoir des preuves
Emma, allez, ouvre-moi
Écoute, je suis désolé
Nathan ?
Vous êtes à la maison ?
Donnie, nous serons de retour quand tu te seras
calmé En attendant, nous sommes en lieu sûr
En lieu sûr ?
- Je peux vous aider ?
- Oui, je cherche après Emma
Elle n'est pas là pour le moment
Vous êtes ?
Je suis Luc
Ces fleurs
Vous êtes un ami d'Emma, Luc ?
Non, on ne s'est jamais rencontrés
Ok maintenant tu me dis la vérité
Es-tu un ami de ma femme, Luc ?
- Ça doit être une erreur
- Oui, et tu l'as faite
Ça valait le coup, parce qu'elle est bonne,
mais vaut-elle ta vie, Luc ?
Je comprends votre colère mais je vous jure
Je n'ai jamais rencontré votre femme
Pourquoi est-ce que je vous vois tous les 2
dans mon lit ?
- Et ça me rend malade
- Non, Donnie
- Baissez votre arme, SVP
- Il couche avec elle
- Non c'est un malentendu
- Tru, vas-t'en
- Donnie, écoutez-moi, on peut
- Je suis désolé, je ne peux pas
- Je peux gérer ça, Tru
- Ne faites pas ça
- Tru vas-t'en, pars
- Je suis vraiment désolé
SVP, Donnie, ne faites pas ça, non
- Oh Luc, regarde-moi, ça va
- Je suis désolé de ne pas t'avoir crue
Non Luc, tout va bien se passer
Reste avec moi, regarde-moi
- Je t'aime, Tru
- Non STP, ne fais pas ça
Reste avec moi, tu vas bien aller
Regarde-moi, STP, Luc
Luc, STP, non, non
Et un certain espoir en la résurrection
pour la vie éternelle près de notre seigneur
Il a appelé notre frère Luc Johnston
Et nous mettons son corps en terre
Tu es poussière et à la poussière tu retourneras
Que dieu te bénisse
et te protège
Dieu nous permet de lui rendre hommage
Et il entend nos prières
et lui donne la paix
Je te dois la vie
Merci
Est ce qu'il y a une chance
pour qu'il demande
Je ne sais pas
Je ne pense pas
- Attends ici
- N'y vas pas Tru
- Je n'y prends aucun plaisir
- C'est à mon tour de parler, alors écoute-moi
Ma mère avait cette vocation
et elle me l'a transmise
Si tu penses un seul instant que je vais arrêter
tu as tort
Donc reste sur tes gardes
parce que c'est la guerre
Tu dois savoir une chose
C'est plus important que tu ne penses
Et tu dois savoir une chose
Tu n'as aucune idée de ce que tu as commencé
Je t'aime aussi
Monte
- Donc dis-moi, que sait ma fille ?
- Content de vous voir Richard
Je commencerai par ce qu'elle ne sait pas
que vous faisiez ce que je fais
Elle est forte, ça ne sera pas facile
- Tout comme je l'ai fait avec sa mère
- Vous avez gagné cette partie n'est-ce pas ?
En plus, j'aime les challenges
Et bien Jack, Je crois que tu en as un

- Je m'en vais, papa.
- Mais écoute-moi au moins.
Ma petite chérie.
Reste, je t'en prie.
Paige, je n'aurais jamais fait de mal
à mon petit bébé.
Je ne suis pas un bébé.
Ni ta chérie d'ailleurs.
Ne me touche pas.
Tu n'as pas envisagé la possibilité
qu'il ne se soit rien passé ce jour là.
Que c'était le fruit de ton imagination.
Je ne pense pas être folle.
Bientôt j'en aurai la preuve.
Et je ne serai pas la seule
à devoir faire face à la réalité.
Ce sera ton tour, papa.
Question subsidiaire. Tu es prête ?
Vas-y !
Complète ma phrase:
Ces ligaments contrôlent le glissement du condyle.
Ils régulent donc l'extension
et la rotation du genou.
Ils sont appelés ligaments croisés antérieurs.
Ça te va comme réponse ?
C'est bon tu es incollable.
Tu es fin prête pour
le concours d'entrée à l'école de médecine.
Davis, attends !
On a même pas vu le système nerveux sympathique.
Pour réussir le concours d'entrée,
il faut arrêter le bachotage.
Rentre chez toi et repose-toi, Tru.
Je suis trop impatiente.
Si demain je réussis le concours d'entrée,
Je serai admise à la fac de médecine.
Ensuite je pourrai devenir médecin,
et enfin dire adieu
à la morgue ?
Je ne voulais pas dire ça.
Y'a pas de mal.
Ça n'arrivera pas.
Tu crois que je vais me planter ?
J'ai fais un sans faute.
Ce n'est pas ce que je voulais dire.
Tu réussiras sans problème.
J'ai juste l'impression que certaines personnes
ne sont pas faites pour rester ici.
Et d'autres le sont.
Et je suis dans quelle catégorie ?
Cet endroit est fait pour moi ?
D'après toi ?
<i>Coucou ma poule !</i>
C'est Lindsay.
J'avais deviné.
<i>Devine quoi ?</i>
J'ai trouvé un mec.
- Quelle surprise !
<i>- Pas pour moi, pour toi.</i>
Je ne l'ai pas encore vu.
Il s'appelle Jeremy. C'est ton type de mec.
Comment tu le sais si tu l'as pas vu ?
J'ai du flair pour ça. Fais-moi confiance,
et mets la robe noire que je t'ai offerte l'an dernier.
On en a déjà discuté.
Je ne cherche pas de mec.
Et je passe mon exam cet après-midi.
<i>Parfait, tu peux y aller après</i>
Et ne t'en fais pas, je serai ton chaperon.
<i>Dis-moi que tu y seras.</i>
- J'y serai.
- <i>Bien.</i>
- Bonne chance pour ton exam.
- <i>Merci.</i>
Ne le prends pas mal, mais
t'as vraiment une sale tête.
Merci Harrison.
C'est sympa.
J'ai révisé toute la nuit,
parce que dans 45 minutes,
Je dois passer l'examen
le plus important de ma vie.
- Ah ouais, le TopCat.
- MCAT.
Dis-moi que tout va bien.
En dehors du fait que je stresse pour l'exam,
je vais bien.
Tout va comme tu veux alors.
Tu t'éclates.
Tu me connais.
J'adore prendre soin de toi.
Je sais que pour toi c'est pareil.
- Qu'est que tu veux ?
- Rien.
Je veux juste prendre des nouvelles de ma soeur.
Ça me vexe.
Comment tu peux penser ça de moi ?
C'est ce que je t'ai dit l'autre fois,
sur ce que je peux faire.
D'abord je n'y crois pas.
Et pour y croire il me faudrait des preuves tangibles.
Le journal des courses.
Tu veux que je te croie.
Alors montre-moi.
Je regarde l'arrivée.
Je te donne le nom des chevaux.
Et demain, tu fais ton truc vaudou.
Et c'est toi qui rafle la mise.
Ouais.
Ça ne marche pas comme ça.
Rien n'est certain.
Mais qui ne tente rien n'a rien.
T'es d'accord ?
Ou il faut que je bosse pour gagner ma vie ?
Je verrai ce que je peux faire.
- Je dois y aller.
- J'adore ma soeur.
Va passer ton exam.
T'es la meilleure.
Merci.
C'est l'heure.
Posez vos stylos et rendez vos copies.
À ma meilleure amie, Tru
qui vient de passer son exam de médecine.
Et qui sera un excellent docteur.
- Santé
- J'ai pas fini.
Et qui me soignera sans rendez-vous
quelle que soit ma mutuelle santé.
Bien entendu.
- C'est lui ?
- Sans doute.
Je vais le chercher.
Jeremy ?
- Oui
- Salut.
Jeremy.
C'est bien moi.
Tu es magnifique,
Et j'en suis tout Tru blé.
Mon prénom facilite les jeux de mots.
J'y ai réfléchi toute la journée.
Ça te dérange ?
Je ne tente pas ce genre de rencontres d'habitude,
de peur d'avoir une mauvaise surprise.
Quand je t'ai vu, j'ai pensé:
Elle est bien trop canon pour bosser dans une morgue.
Tu devrais changer de boulot,
faire des téléfilms par exemple.
Je dois y aller.
Ok, je vois, t'es de nuit en plus.
C'est flippant.
On s'appelle ?
Tu ne m'as pas donné ton numéro.
- Luc, salut.
- Salut.
On s'est déjà rencontrés ?
Oui
mais pas physiquement.
J'ai entendu parler d'un photographe.
C'est moi.
- Luc.
- Tru.
- Pourquoi cette belle robe ?
- Pour sortir avec un inconnu.
Un échec total.
Il y en a eu des meilleurs je suppose.
Mon amie Lindsay ne pense qu'à me caser.
Elle a peur que vous ne trouviez pas un mec bien ?
Tout simplement un vivant.
Elle ne devrait pas s'inquiéter.
On est dans le même cas.
Pourquoi ? Vous avez quelqu'un pour moi ?
Dans quelque temps peut-être.
Je dois filer.
J'ai de la famille qui m'attend.
Enchanté d'avoir discuté avec vous.
C'est moi.
J'ai dans les mains, la clé de la richesse.
Un nouveau boulot ?
Très drôle.
J'ai les chevaux gagnants de la dernière course.
Tu m'étonnes.
C'est à 40 contre 1, alors note bien.
Le tiercé gagnant est:
<i>Cherry Top, SkyMarker</i> et <i>WhirlyGig.</i>
Je ne sais pas pourquoi j'entends ces voix,
mais c'est pas pour noter des noms de chevaux.
<i>- Dis-moi que tu as noté</i>
- J'ai noté, t'es content.
Non, mais demain sûrement,
si ma soeur dit vrai.
je dois y aller.
Je t'aime.
Davis, je ne t'avais pas entendu.
J'ai reçu un appel des archives aujourd'hui,
au sujet d'un rapport d'autopsie
que tu aurais demandé.
Oui, c'est
celui de ma mère.
Il y a un problème ?
Si j'avais su ça, je l'aurais autorisé.
Mais comme je ne savais pas
C'est pas grave. J'attendrai demain.
L'archiviste est parti en congés pour quinze jours.
Il faudra attendre son retour.
C'est pas grave.
J'ai attendu 10 ans,
c'est pas deux semaines qui vont me tuer.
Je me demandais
Que comptes-tu trouver dans ce rapport ?
Pourquoi tu
Viande froide.
Elle s'appelle Paige Sanders.
Étudiante en médecine à Hudson.
Du moins jusqu'à 16H31 aujourd'hui.
Hudson, c'est la meilleure
fac de médecine de l'état.
En tout cas,
ça ne lui a pas servi à grand chose.
Comment est elle morte ?
Voilà un indice.
Dans le monde des étudiants où la compétition règne.
Je dirai qu'elle fait partie des meilleurs.
Mais ça lui a coûté cher.
Overdose.
Ça n'a pas de sens.
Hudson prend les meilleurs,
elle avait tout pour réussir.
Je peux juste te dire que
certains supportent la pression.
Mais d'autres pas.
- Mais pourquoi ?
- Ne te pose pas tant de questions.
Calme-toi.
 Tu ne peux plus l'aider.
Davis, dis-moi en plus.
On peut remarquer des pétéchies
sur son globe oculaire.
Généralement c'est une séquelle de traumatisme.
Ça pourrait venir de la prise de drogue ?
Toux, vomissements, pression sur les organes internes.
On dirait que tu as bien bossé pour ton concours.
Pour en être sûr,
préparons le corps pour un examen toxicologique.
Je veux savoir quels produits elle a absorbé.
Au boulot Davis.
Tu ne sais pas la chance que tu avais.
Sauve-moi !
Coucou ma poule ! C'est Lindsay.
<i>Tu as 2 minutes ?</i>
<i>J'ai trouvé un mec, il s'appelle Jeremy.</i>
C'est exactement ton type de mec.
Bonjour.
Ça t'est déjà arrivé
d'avoir passé une super journée, vraiment extra.
Et d'un coup réaliser que tout a été effacé ?
Tu supposes donc que j'ai déjà eu une super journée.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Je vérifie un truc.
On a reçu une étudiante en médecine hier, non ?
À part toi, je ne pense pas.
Et dans 2H tu as un concours de médecine à passer.
Je l'ai passé.
Euh, je vais le passer.
Je dois juste vérifier un truc d'abord.
La vie est dure, n'est-ce pas ?
Malheureusement, oui.
Davis, si l'archiviste appelle,
c'est pour moi, je veux ce rapport.
Oh mon dieu. Luc.
Je suis désolée.
- Laisse-moi t'aider.
- Non, merci, ça ira.
Pourvu que ça soit réparable.
J'aimerais bien.
Mais ça serait mentir.
Comment tu connais mon prénom ?
Comment ?
Tu m'as appelé Luc.
Et on ne s'est jamais rencontrés.
J'ai deviné.
Enchanté de s'être percutés.
Dites-moi que cette journée sera meilleure.
Vérifiez encore.
Mon dossier doit y être.
Vous êtes sûre de savoir vous en servir ?
<i>Tru. Ou es-tu ?</i>
Mince, Harrison, le petit-déjeuner.
Pourquoi tu m'as posé un lapin ?
J'attends depuis 30 minutes.
C'est ma faute, c'est encore une de ces journées.
Donc, on a déjà eu cette conversation ?
- Tu as le journal des courses ?
- Cela ne prouve rien, sauf que
si tu es dans un de tes jours de chance,
tu connais l'arrivée du tiercé.
Je ne m'en souviens pas.
Quoi ?
C'était des noms de chevaux.
Comment veux-tu que je m'en rappelle ?
<i>Tu vois</i>, je savais que c'était du vent.
<i>J'en étais certain.</i>
<i>À bientôt</i>
C'est Hanson, Jessica Hanson.
Mon dossier a été transféré
il y a quelques heures depuis Harvard.
Je vous tiens au courant
dès qu'il y a du nouveau.
Faites-le.
Bonjour.
Quand vous recevrez son dossier,
vous devriez le retourner à Harvard juste pour plaisanter.
Je ne sais pas ce qui me retient de le faire.
Que puis-je pour vous ?
Je voudrais faire une surprise à mon amie, Paige Sanders.
Elle est étudiante ici.
Vous savez ou je peux la trouver ?
Je ne peux pas donner ce genre de renseignements.
Je comprends.
Tant pis
Elle vient de décrocher
un poste de résident à la clinique,
Et j'aurais voulu voir la tête de la cruche de Harvard
quand elle l'aurait appris.
Elle est au Bâtiment C.
- Mais je ne vous ai rien dit.
- Je ne vois pas de quoi vous parlez.
Mr Taghert, pouvez vous expliquer
ce que vous faites au coeur de ce pauvre homme ?
Comme vous nous l'avez enseigné
 je pratique une incision
- Partant de la veine cave
- Vers où ? Qui peut me répondre ?
- La valve aortique, monsieur.
- Bien.
Il faut prendre soin d'éviter
Mademoiselle Sanders.
- Elle s'appelle Paige Sanders
- Sauve-moi !
- Mlle Sanders ?
- La
Les bords antérieurs.
- Euh
- J'attendais <i>bords antérieurs</i> comme réponse.
- Je savais la réponse.
- Nous la connaissons tous, Mlle.
Il fallait être rapide.
C'est primordial en médecine.
C'est le temps qui distingue la vie de la mort.
Le temps nous est précieux, Mlle Sanders.
Ne gaspillez pas le nôtre, s'il vous plaît.
Pour ceux qui souhaitent devenir médecins,
sachez que notre cerveau est un outil primordial.
Nous devons donc le garder éveillé tout le temps.
Merci.
À la semaine prochaine.
Vous pouvez prendre vos notes.
Le cerveau, un outil primordial.
Moins primordial que son gros nez.
Je déteste quand il se prend pour Dieu.
Il pourrait au moins voir les choses en face.
Il n'est pas un Dieu.
Mais moi, oui.
Sanders !
Tu as été efficace.
Je suis impressionné.
Lâchez-moi, les mecs.
Je suis pas d'humeur.
On ne peut plus déconner entre amis ?
Salut.
Vous êtes bien en 2ème année ?
En effet.
Qui ça intéresse ?
Je m'appelle Jessica Hanson.
Je viens d'arriver de Harvard.
Je t'ai aperçu en classe.
Oui, tu nous observais.
Désolée.
Je suis de nature curieuse.
C'est bien.
Bienvenue à Hudson.
Tu as aussi pu constater que les 2ème années
ont un emploi du temps chargé.
C'est vrai ce qu'on dit à votre sujet ?
Je ne sais pas.
Qu'est-ce qui se dit sur nous ?
- Que vous êtes doués.
- Ça doit être vrai.
Ils disent quoi d'autre ?
Que vous faites les meilleures soirées.
Vous connaissez du monde,
et que vous êtes les premiers sur les bons coups.
Mais il doit y avoir d'autres choses.
Je me trompe ?
Je ne suis pas une emmerdeuse.
Je veux rencontrer des personnes
qui sortent de l'ordinaire.
Tu as peut-être vu juste.
À moins que tu te trompes.
Juste une petite question.
Qu'est-ce que ça t'apporte ?
J'essaie de me faire des amis, voilà tout.
Tout à l'heure, ce prof a été odieux avec toi.
Je m'appelle Paige, et je sais me défendre.
J'en suis certaine.
Pour tout vous dire, je suis un peu paumée.
Je viens d'arriver en ville.
Une âme charitable pourrait me
faire visiter le campus.
J'offre le repas.
Désolé
- On a du boulot.
- Vous bossez sur quoi ?
Rien qui te concerne.
Vas-y Paige, bon appétit.
On t'attendra.
Pour être franche,
mon dernier vrai repas à table remonte à loin.
Une petite pause ne fait pas de mal.
Surtout avec l'exigence qu'il faut s'imposer
quand on fait ces études.
C'est vrai que je fais
tout mon possible pour suivre.
Tu as l'air de t'y investir à fond.
Comme chacun de nous.
C'est la fac de médecine qui veut ça.
Tu réussis ton concours d'entrée à la fac,
les mecs t'obligent à te surpasser.
Ça doit être sympa.
J'ai encore du mal à réaliser ou j'en suis.
On n'a pas tous la chance d'avoir été reçus.
Dis moi,
les mecs sont tous
comme tes deux copains ou plus cool ?
En fait, ils sont cool.
Mais tu connais les effets de la compétition.
Bien sûr.
Mais ça n'implique pas de nous mettre en danger.
Je ne comprends pas.
Excuse-moi.
Maintenant ?
Non, j'y serai.
Merci pour le repas.
Je dois y aller.
Je suis au courant.
Au courant de quoi ?
Au sujet de la drogue.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi tu en prends mais
La drogue ?
Mais de quoi tu parles ?
T'es cinglée ou quoi ?
- Là, je ne comprends pas.
- Ne me touche pas
Garde tes distances.
Je ne veux rien savoir de plus.
Va te faire voir.
Et ne t'approche plus de moi.
- Enfin.
- Ouais, ça roule.
Mes félicitations Docteur.
On a réussi.
Il est mort.
Tout va bien.
Attends un peu.
- Combien ça fait ?
- 8 secondes.
Du calme Steeve.
12 secondes. On y est presque.
20 secondes ça ira.
On dégage.
Toujours rien.
Comment j'étais ?
Quel trip.
Et pour toi c'était comment ?
J'ai une meilleure question.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait ici ?
Je pourrais vous retourner la question.
Vos réponses ont l'air plus intéressantes
que les miennes.
Devine.
Avec ce que j'ai vu, je peux vous faire exclure
définitivement de la fac de médecine.
Ou on discute.
Donc si je comprends bien,
Vous passez votre temps à vous entre-tuer.
Un peu réducteur, mais vrai.
Et puis vous vous ranimez.
C'est bien ça.
Dans quel but ?
Quand on revient de là,
on n'est plus le même.
Ce qu'on dit à propos de la mort.
Voir défiler toute sa vie en quelques secondes.
C'est vrai.
Les souvenirs.
Vous revoyez votre passé.
Et que sont les souvenirs
des substances chimiques
situées entre le sillon occipital et le lobe temporal.
Elles sont stockées là.
Et ne demandent qu'a être utilisées.
Vous êtes doués.
C'est dommage que vos expériences vous tuent.
Pour un instant seulement.
J'ai vu le visage de mon père, aujourd'hui.
J'avais 2 ans quand il nous a quittés.
Et là c'était clair comme
Disons que ça vaut le coup de défier le destin
pour avoir des souvenirs nets et précis,
de ce jour là, et bien plus encore.
Je suis la prochaine.
Non.
Paige, tu ne dois pas le faire.
Pour raviver des moments passés
 il y a d'autres moyens.
Tu peux y arriver.
Va à la source du problème.
Trouve la personne en question.
Et puis discuter avec ?
Écouter leur opinion.
Essayer de s'entendre.
J'ai déjà essayé figure-toi.
Il n'y a pas d'autre solution.
Puisque tu es si forte.
Va parler à mon père.
Rien ne m'en empêchera.
J'aurais besoin d'un autre service.
Mr Sanders ?
Presque.
C'est en face. Juste là.
- Merci.
- Je vous en prie.
Vous êtes qui ?
Une amie de Paige.
De la fac de médecine.
Je suis très inquiète.
J'ai peur qu'elle se fasse du mal.
Jamais ma fille ne ferait ça.
J'aimerais vous donner raison,
mais j'en doute.
Vous seul pouvez la raisonner.
Et pourquoi ça ?
Vous êtes son père.
- Vous avez un passé en commun
- Écoutez,
Ce qu'elle vous a raconté sur moi, est faux.
Jamais je ne toucherais ma fille.
Et le pire, c'est que Paige
ne s'en souvient même pas.
À part son histoire de lune et d'étoiles.
La lune et les étoiles ?
Ça signifie quoi ?
C'est a vous de me le dire.
Vous êtes son amie, non ?
Tru Davies.
Tru Davies est elle présente ?
<i>Je croyais que tu passais ton exam.</i>
J'y vais.
je suis juste en retard.
Je dois retrouver quelqu'un d'abord.
<i>Tant mieux.</i>
J'ai besoin de toute ton attention.
Les chevaux gagnants sont
Harisson, je te l'ai dit.
Je ne m'en souviens plus.
- Je suis désolée.
- Hanson !
- Je dois te laisser.
- Tru !
Tu as parlé à mon père ?
C'est quoi ton problème ?
Pas assez de t'incruster dans ma vie,
tu vas même chez moi.
Quel genre de personne es-tu ?
Je sais que ça te semble louche.
 Mais laisse moi t'expliquer.
Je t'écoute.
- J'avais 12 ans quand ma mère est morte.
- Tu étais une enfant à l'époque.
Je l'ai vue mourir devant moi.
Je ne pourrai peut-être jamais
connaître la vérité sur sa mort.
Même si ça m'intrigue,
je n'en donnerai pas ma vie pour une réponse.
Pourquoi tu crois que je vais mourir ?
J'ai étudié la question.
Si ce n'est pas le coeur qui lâche, ce sera le cerveau.
Il y a des chanceux qui s'en sortent,
mais ils sont rares.
Et tu n'en fais pas partie.
Pense aux tiens.
Ne le fais pas, c'est du suicide.
Ce ne sont pas que des impressions.
J'ai des doutes sur mon passé,
et je ne vois que cette solution.
Il faut en parler avec ton père.
Ou à un psychologue, peu importe.
Mais surtout ne tente pas l'expérience.
D'accord. Je ne le ferai pas.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi je t'écoute,
mais je te crois.
- Je vais le dire aux mecs.
- C'est très bien.
Tu ne peux pas imaginer comme ça me soulage.
Harvard !
Comment ça va ?
Dan, justement je voulais te dire quelque chose.
Bien sûr.
J'ai rencontré quelqu'un
à l'inscription
au cours de biologie moléculaire.
Vous devriez la rencontrer.
Jessica Hanson ?
C'est elle ?
Voici la vraie, l'unique:
Jessica Hanson.
- Je ne comprends pas.
- Paige, je peux tout expliquer.
Moi d'abord. Je suis Jessica Hanson,
je viens de Harvard.
Et cette fille est un imposteur.
Désolée ma chérie, mais la mascarade est finie.
Et voilà.
Tu nous dis qui tu es ?
- Paige.
- Non.
Tout ce que tu m'as dit
 n'est qu'un tissu de mensonges.
Je parie que tu n'es même pas
étudiante en médecine. Je me trompe ?
Paige, attends.
Plus que 2 heures.
Steven.
Attends.
- Quoi encore ?
- Tu dois l'empêcher de faire ça.
Pas question.
- Elle va y rester.
- Mais non. Regarde-moi.
Je ne me suis jamais senti aussi bien.
On a tous des questions sans réponses.
Paige risque de faire l'erreur de sa vie,
à moins que tu ne la sortes de là.
- C'est trop tard pour ça.
- Pourquoi ?
Elle est en train de le faire.
Prête pour le retour.
Allez.
Je n'y arrive pas.
Elle ne réagit pas.
Tu as de la Dobutamine,
de la Dopamine alors ?
J'ai que dalle.
Ça fait trop longtemps.
C'est foutu.
Étonnant non ?
La ligne qui sépare la vie et la mort est fragile.
La diversité des capacités de survie.
C'est dans cette optique que j'ai disposé
C'est bien beau Dan,
mais si je n'avais pas été là, qu'aurais-tu fait ?
Comment ça va ?
Tu m'as sauvé la vie.
Et si tu nous disais qui tu es réellement.
Bien sûr.
Je dois faire un truc d'abord.
Vous avez 3 heures de retard.
Je peux quand même le passer ?
Merci.

À. Maladies auto-immune</i>
<i>pétéchies</i>
<i>On peut remarquer des pétéchies

<i>Généralement c'est une séquelle de traumatisme.</i>
Mon dieu.
Ce n'est pas l'expérience qui l'a tuée.
Je reviens.
Si vous quittez la salle,
c'est terminé pour vous.
Vous comprenez ?
Terminé pour vous,
 votre examen et votre futur.
Désolée, je dois y aller.
Mais je pourrai repasser l'examen ?
Bien entendu.
Présentez vous à l'heure,
disons
l'année prochaine.
Alors à l'année prochaine.
Elle a réussi à voir son passé,
n'est-ce pas ?
Oui, mais c'est pas tes oignons.
Paige va bien, c'est l'essentiel.
Tu n'es même pas étudiante en médecine.
Dans peu de temps tu seras comme moi,
à moins que tu me dises où elle se trouve.
Tu veux jouer les durs ?
Je ne suis pas étudiante en médecine,
je n'ai donc rien à perdre.
Ce qui n'est pas ton cas.
Surtout avec ces belles traces sur ton bras.
Où est-elle ?
Je n'en sais rien.
Elle ne se souvient que d'un homme,
Il lui a fait du mal et a abusé d'elle.
Elle n'est pas rentrée dans les détails.
Et puis elle a parlé d'étoiles et de lune.
Je ne sais pas ce que cela signifie.
Moi si.
Où est-elle ?
Je vous ai déjà répondu.
Elle n'est pas ici.
Je dois absolument la trouver.
Je vous aurais prévenu.
C'est du harcèlement, j'appelle la police.
Elle est en danger.
Vous ne m'écoutez pas.
Paige a fait une bêtise ce soir.
Comment ?
Une expérience stupide où elle a failli y rester.
Mais cela lui a fait resurgir tous ses souvenirs.
Vous croyez que ça va me la ramener ?
Sa voiture est garée dans l'allée.
Vous avez parlé d'étoiles et de la lune.
Cela a forcément une signification.
Partez.
Allez-vous en !
Ça n'a pas de sens.
Tu n'aurais pas oublié ton rendez-vous surprise ?
Lindsay, je n'ai pas oublié.
Je ne pourrai pas venir cette fois.
Pourquoi ?
D'habitude tu peux venir ?
Désolée.
Bon, je m'en occupe.
<i>T'es la meilleure.</i>
Bonsoir Jeremy.
Désolée, mon amie ne pourra pas venir.
Tu n'es pas Tru.
Pourtant
Tu m'as bien Tru-blé.
Tu viens de trouver ça à l'instant ?
C'est hilarant.
La lune et les étoiles.
C'est le voisin.
- Tu divagues.
- J'arrive exactement à m'en rappeler désormais.
Tu as toujours été une gentille fille.
Ne gâche pas tout.
J'étais qu'une enfant, espèce de salaud.
J'avais 9 ans.
C'est ridicule.
Je vais appeler ton père.
Vas-y ! Fais-le.
Appelle qui tu veux.
Je vais porter plainte.
Et tu vas payer pour ce que tu m'as fait.
- Tais-toi, s'il te plaît.
- Ne me touche pas.
- Silence !
- Lâche-moi !
J'ai dit silence !
De toutes façons, personne ne te croira.
Je la crois.
Va-t-en !
Allez-vous-en.
C'était il y a des années.
Vous ne pouvez rien contre moi.
Allez le dire à qui vous voulez.
Personne ne vous croira.
Papa, excuse-moi.
Comment te sens-tu ?
Je pensais que la vérité effacerait tout.
Mais ce n'est pas le cas.
C'est juste le commencement.
Pour bien commencer
il ne faut pas être triste.
Alors, qui es-tu réellement ?
Ne me dis pas Jessica Hanson.
J'ai dû emprunter son nom
pour pouvoir te parler.
Si je t'avais dit que je préparais
mon concours d'entrée à l'école de médecine
et que je travaille dans une morgue.
Tu m'aurais écoutée ?
Peut-être que non.
Pourquoi tu m'as aidée ?
Je ne sais pas trop.
Parce que ça fait partie de mon boulot.
Si tu arrives à le savoir,
tu sais où me trouver.
Ça me ferait plaisir.
On se sent vite seul à la fac de médecine.
Je te prends au mot.
Bonne chance.
Au fait, Tru.
Tu feras un excellent médecin un de ces jours.
Un de ces jours, oui.
<i>Alors, comment s'est passé l'exam ?</i>
Je n'y suis pas allée.
Comment était mon rendez-vous ?
<i>Pas mal.</i>
Jusqu'au moment où il a dragué la serveuse.
<i>Tu n'as pas manqué grand chose.</i>
Je m'en doutais.
Ne dis pas de bêtises.
Le mec parfait existe,
<i>tu ne l'as pas rencontré, c'est tout.</i>
Si ça se trouve je l'ai déjà croisé plusieurs fois.
<i>Exactement.</i>
- Comment ça ?
- À bientôt Linds.
Re-bonjour.
Salut.
Je vais essayer
d'éviter tout choc cette fois.
Je ne veux rien casser.
En y pensant,
ce n'est pas si négatif que ça.
Sinon on ne se serait pas rencontrés.
Et je suis heureux qu'on l'ait fait.
C'est vrai. Moi aussi.
Cette fois tu ne m'oublieras pas.
Je ne crois pas que je pourrais t'oublier.
Bon, je dois y aller.
À suivre ?
Absolument.
Et tes parents ?
Je te l'ai dit, je devine beaucoup de choses.
Harisson, je t'ai dit que je ne me souvenais pas
du nom des chevaux gagnants.
Écoute.
Je ne suis pas allé au champ de courses finalement.
Et tu sais quoi ?
J'ai eu une journée fantastique.
- Vraiment ?
<i>- Oui !</i>
<i>Je me suis amusé,
j'ai même lu un livre,</i> tu te rends compte ?
En plus, j'ai fait d'autres choses.
<i>Tout ça pour te dire
que j'ai réussi à passer une bonne journée,</i>
et cette fois, sans avoir besoin de l'aide
de ma grande soeur préférée.
Je suis fière de toi.
Tu vois quand tu crois en toi.
Je t'aime, tu sais ça ?
Moi aussi.
Bonne nuit Harisson.
Je n'ai pas besoin de ça.
Tu avais raison.
L'archiviste a appelé.
C'est le dossier de ta mère.
Lis le quand tu seras prête.
Merci Davis.
Tu ne l'ouvres pas ?
Plus tard.
J'ai besoin de rester encore un peu dans le présent.
Désolé pour l'examen.
Tu vas devoir rester ici plus longtemps que prévu.
Ce n'est peut-être pas si mal.
J'ai rencontré une fille aujourd'hui.
Elle voulait juste comprendre.
Comprendre ce qu'elle ressent.
Peut-être c'est ce dont j'ai besoin.
Juste comprendre.
Et ce n'est pas le cas ?
À vrai dire, non.
Ce n'est pas facile, hein ?
Porter un tel fardeau.
Pardon ?
Certains appellent ça une bénédiction.
D'autres y voient une malédiction.
Je verrais plutôt ça comme une vocation.
J'en sais plus que tu ne le penses.
Sur ce que tu peux faire.
Comment tu aides les morts.
Quand tu leur donnes une seconde chance.
Assieds-toi.
Je dois te dire ce que je sais.
Sous-titres fait par Stinc3 & relus par Van pour
<i>Dossier Tru Calling</i> - http://trucalling.free.fr
Tu ne peux pas continuer de m'éviter.
Je m'en sortais pas mal jusqu'ici.
Je sais ce que tu peux faire.
Ça, je l'ai bien compris.
Mais ça ne me fait pas rire.
Ce n'est pas un hasard s'il ya
moins de morts depuis que tu es ici.
Je ne vois pas de quoi tu parles.
Je t'ai observée.
Je vois bien ce qui se passe.
Tu peux faire des choses
que personne ne peut faire.
Je ne sais même pas
Tu peux tout me dire.
Ils me demandent de l'aide.
Puis je me réveille,
c'est la même journée et
Tu les sauves.
J'essaye.
Parfois je n'y arrive pas.
Tu crois que je suis folle ?
- Et toi ?
- Ça m'arrive.
Tu n'es pas folle.
Ça ne t'effraie pas ?
J'ai vu beaucoup de choses étranges.
Il en faut plus pour m'effrayer.
Ça ne peut plus durer ainsi.
Je mens à mon entourage,
je n'ai plus de vie privée.
Tu sauves des vies,
c'est un vrai cadeau.
On peut offrir des bougies,
des bottes ou du sel de bain en cadeau.
Mais ça,
je ne sais pas ce que c'est, et toi ?
Pas vraiment, mais dis-moi
Ça te fait quoi de savoir que quelqu'un
qui va mourir, va te demander de l'aide ?
Je suis prête.
Je sais qu'on n'a pas le choix.
Je t'aime aussi.
<i>- Qui crois tu que je suis ?
- Tu es peut être ma moitié, ça ne te plaît pas ?</i>
<i>Tu es bien sûr de toi.</i>
<i>Je n'y peux rien.
C'est ce que je ressens.</i>
<i>- Allons nous promener.
- Je ne tomberai pas amoureuse.</i>
<i>Tu es amoureuse, c'est certain.</i>
Ça ne se passe jamais comme ça dans la vie.
Il n'y pas eu de fond musical
 pour ton dernier baiser.
C'est déjà bien
si tu trouves un mec qui donne l'heure.
Je ne demande pas grand chose, Linds.
Juste un gars convenable,
avec de la conversation.
Quand il sourit,
il a cette petite fossette au dessus des lèvres.
Mais qui-est-ce ?
Il s'appelle Luc.
Il est photographe.
Mais à quoi bon.
Avec le boulot, on ne se verra pas beaucoup.
Tu veux rompre avant même d'avoir été avec lui.
Tu sais ce que tu veux,
alors suis ton instinct.
Moi, je veux monter en grade au boulot.
Donc, ce soir je vais en discuter avec le grand patron
devant un petit verre.
Je veux un rencard, pas une promotion.
Comme tu veux.
Mais si tu cherches une histoire à l'eau de rose.
Suis mon conseil :
reste mystérieuse.
Les films, c'est pas la vraie vie, désolée.
J'espère que mon travail te plaît.
Voyons ça.
Tu as bien bossé.
- Bon boulot.
- Merci.
C'est ce genre de comportement qui te fera avancer.
Savoir ce que l'on veut et aller le chercher.
J'ai dit la même chose à mon amie aujourd'hui.
Je viens de récupérer un corps,
alors nettoie bien les traces dans le camion.
- Pas de problème.
- Bien.
Tu fais quoi ici ?
D'abord je travaille ici.
C'est vrai, et ensuite ?
On s'est beaucoup croisés par ici,
ces derniers temps.
J'ai pensé qu'on pourrait se voir en dehors,
pour changer.
C'est pas vraiment le bon endroit
pour te demander ça mais
Ça t'intéresserait
qu'on sorte ensemble un de ses jours ?
Ce n'est pas vraiment le bon endroit pour dire oui mais
J'aimerais beaucoup.
Demain ça te va ?
Demain ça risque d'être difficile.
Mes journées sont imprévisibles ces derniers temps.
Tu as 1 heure devant toi.
Tu devrais en profiter.
Je m'en occupe, ne t'en fais pas.
Je vous vois faire depuis un moment,
passez à l'étape suivante.
- Tu as une heure de libre ?
- Et comment.
Merci.
Tu aimes prendre des photos des morts ?
J'ai grandi avec des personnes
qui faisaient des photos de cadavres.
On est venus un peu tard.
Je comprends.
Quoi ?
J'ai dit : <i>je comprends</i>.
Quoi ?
J'ai dit
Laisse tomber.
Pourquoi es-tu toujours célibataire ?
Mon amie Lindsay dit toujours que je tombe sur les mauvais gars.
Pas maintenant, je ne parlais pas de toi.
Désolée.
Un fiasco énorme.
Ne m'en parle pas.
Je viens d'être mutée au standard.
Tu rigoles, pourquoi ?
Je n'ai pas aimé ses avances et il m'a dit
que je préférerais sûrement répondre au téléphone.
On résoud ça plus tard, promis.
On s'éclate non ?
Oui.
C'est bon.
Gardez t'attend pour récupérer 2 corps.
Ça fait partie de mon boulot ?
Génial.
Surprise.
Quelle belle soirée.
Désolée.
Alors ce rendez-vous ?
Une de ces soirées
qu'on aimerait vivre sans en voir la fin.
C'était bien alors.
Désolé qu'on t'ait appelée si tôt.
On dirai que la glissière de sécurité a lâché.
Un ou 2 conseils pour une débutante ?
Merci.
J'en ai un: évite de cogiter.
Une théorie ?
Jeunes amoureux,
c'est souvent à cause de l'amour.
Tu vois ce collier ?
Elle ne se l'est pas acheté.
Il a dû lui offrir.
Qui sont-ils ?
Lui c'est Adam Whitman, lycéen à Highland.
Elle c'est Jen DeLuca, idem.
Tu vois ce tatouage ?
Il signifie <i>ambition</i>.
Maintenant, il aura du mal à en avoir.
Ils sont salement amochés.
On a besoin de sacs.
Je reviens.
Amoureux, n'est-ce pas ?
Aide nous !
Donc hier, 2 jeunes sont morts
dans un accident de voiture ?
Je portais cette chemise ?
Hélas, oui.
Le numéro de plaque était
689TYH
Tu retiens les numéros de plaque ?
Je retiens le maximum.
Je n'ai pas leurs corps pour m'aider,
chaque indice a son importance.
La voiture appartient à Adam,
commençons par lui.
Il va falloir que je retourne au lycée.
- Doucement.
- Je suis pressée.
On se croise souvent ici.
Oui c'est marrant.
Ça serait bien de se voir en dehors.
Luc, je dois y aller.
Ça serait sympa.
Oui, j'aimerais beaucoup,
mais pas maintenant.
Je te rappelle.
Les clés !
Prends soin d'elle.
Je sais, tu l'as gagnée au poker.
Vite, je suis pressée.
Minute.
C'est l'une de tes folles journées ?
Harrison, les clés.
Je veux la revoir.
Je ne vais pas la crasher.
Pas la voiture.
Ma soeur.
T'es où ?
Désolée Lindsay, j'ai eu un empêchement.
Appel en provenance de "Planète Garce".
Harrison te dit bonjour.
C'est jour de visite en prison.
Elle t'envoie de gros bisous.
On peut se voir plus tard.
Non, j'ai un rdv avec mon patron.
Pour lui montrer mes travaux.
Je suis standardiste maintenant.
Tu devrais annuler, Linds.
Merci Tru, mais je vais vraiment l'impressionner.
Je te rappelle plus tard.
Harrison, encore une petite chose.
Je ne fais pas mes 17 ans.
SVP, je cherche Adam Whitman.
Merci.
Tu sors avec la plus belle fille du lycée,
et tu n'es pas content.
Je ne sors pas avec elle parce qu'elle est bonne.
Allez.
Tu sais. Laisse tomber.
Quoi ?
Tu crois que j'ai pas compris Hamlet ?
J'ai eu un C+ à la dissert.
Ambition.
Joli.
Pas de marques.
C'est du bon boulot.
Impressionnant, tu es nouvelle ?
Je jette un oeil, je vais emménager dans le coin.
Sauve-toi, ne reste pas coincée ici comme nous.
C'est si terrible ?
Pas avec la bonne personne.
C'est ma copine, Amy.
Ta copine ?
Jeunes amoureux.
Voici Tru.
Future lycéenne.
Amy, enchantée
On va déjeuner ?
Oui comme tu veux.
Avant de choisir de m'installer,
j'aime voir comment sont les étudiants.
Une fille curieuse.
Tu peux venir.
D'où viens-tu ?
C'est important ?
Pas pour moi, mais pour certains.
La plupart paient pour être ici,
mais certains ont une bourse d'études.
Et alors ?
C'est vraiment nul.
On se croirait dans un vieux film.
Les 2 groupes ne se mélangent pas.
On les évite et eux font de même.
C'est marrant de grandir au milieu d'un cliché.
Laisse moi payer.
Je réserve une table.
Tu la connais ?
Qui ?
À la caisse
Pas vraiment
C'est une boursière.
On ne se mélange pas.
C'est une sorte de Roméo et Juliette
2 mondes :
 un riche, une pauvre.
Ça serait mal vu qu'ils soient ensemble.
Ils le sont ?
<i>Je ne pense pas.</i>
En plus il a déjà une copine.
C'est sympa de travailler en équipe
Une équipe ?
Comme les <i>4 fantastiques</i> sauf qu'on est pas 4
et que je n'ai pas de pouvoirs
Je dois y aller, pour surveiller Roméo et sa Juliette
Bonne chance, tu sais comment ça finit
Pardon. Je suis un peu perdue
Qui ne l'est pas.
Tu n'aimes pas cet endroit ?
Aimer le lycée ?
Je comprends.
Tu étais à la cafétéria
- Tru
- Jen
DeLuca, j'ai vu ton badge
Adam m'a fait visiter,
il a du succès auprès des filles
Ouais on dirait
C'est pas mon genre
Ni celui de mon frère
Il me file la migraine, celui-là.
Ton frère n'aime pas Adam ?
Non, Derek n'aime personne
Tu poses beaucoup de questions
À plus.
Qui est ta nouvelle amie ?
La ferme et conduis
<i>Gardez, j'ai besoin d'une info</i>
Un inconnu a abimé la voiture de mon frère
Il s'appelle Derek DeLuca
Il t'a donné son nom ?
J'ai pas le temps
Minute
Derek DeLuca.
Plusieurs PV pour excès de vitesse
ya une adresse ?
Tu es la fille de tout à l'heure ?
Ouais, je visite le coin et je t'ai aperçu
Tu travailles sur quoi ?
Je bricolais le filtre à air.
Pourquoi tu n'es pas au lycée ?
T'as vu les nazes.
C'est pas vraiment mon style.
Le genre jeunes riches avec des voitures de luxe ?
Pas mon genre.
Des voitures de luxe ou des jeunes conducteurs ?
Comme Adam Whitman
Tu n'es pas une de ses amies j'espère ?
Non, pas encore du moins
C'est quoi le problème ?
Son père dirige une usine de verres.
Il a viré 300 personnes le mois dernier
dont mon père
Tu vois où je veux en venir ?
Avec les licenciements,
il fera de belles économies.
Le problème c'est pas la voiture n'est-ce pas ?
Mais le conducteur
A ce soir
Pourquoi ?
La course contre Adam.
Tu n'as qu'à venir voir.
Une course de voitures
Où ?
Lakewood Cliff, dans 2 heures.
Je sais où mais pas comment
La course explique la mort d'Adam
mais pas celle de Jen.
Comment ont-ils fini dans la même voiture ?
C'était peut être pas le cas
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Ça ressemble à un accident
mais ça n'en est pas forcément un
Tu devrais le savoir,
les apparences sont trompeuses.
Merci Davis,
Je n'avais personne pour m'aider avant.
Je n'avais personne à aider.
Une table tranquille, nous devons travailler
Suivez-moi
Lindsay, est-ce bien toi ?
Harrison ? Quelle surprise !
Tru m'a prévenu de ta venue.
C'est bon de te voir.
Ça va, mec ?
Harrison Davies, un vieil ami de Lindsay
Ah bon !
Vous allez manger ?
Parce que je meurs de faim
Ils ont des crevettes
Je les adore.
Quand je me suis arrêté,
ils étaient tous trempés.
De la tête au pieds.
Ils me fusillaient du regard.
Comme si j'avais fait exprès.
Je n'ai jamais autant vomi depuis.
Et toi Gregors ?
Excusez-moi.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Tu sabotes mon RDV
En fait, je fais ça pour toi.
Tu ne fais que l'encourager à me fuir.
Non pour te protéger de lui.
Je fais mon devoir.
Harrison, je te jure
Disons que j'ai une amie
Tu as des amis ?
Disons l'amie d'une amie.
Elle a travaillé pour Gregors et elle a compris
que les RDV boulot étaient plutôt pour la drague

Nous sommes ici pour travailler
C'est toi qui voit
Combien t'as sous le capot ?
425 Chevaux.
De 0 à 100km/h en 12 secondes.
Tu n'as pas à le faire
Ça sera vite fait.
On aura toute la soirée pour nous.
Tu as une minute ?
Je ne savais pas que tu venais.
Tu ne dois pas faire cette course
Tout ira bien.
Non tu as tort
Ça va mal se passer, Derek en veut après toi
Il ne s'agit que de Derek ?
Ça va aller je te dis
Prêt à y aller
Dès qu'on aura nos assurances.
Assurances ?
On prend chacun un de nos amis avec nous.
Pour éviter les débordements.
Bien, je prend lui
Je prend elle
Tu ne peux pas faire ça, sérieusement
Regarde et apprécie
Tu sembles inquiète
Quelqu'un que j'aime fait quelque chose de stupide
Je ne peux pas regarder
Prête pour le rodéo de ta vie ?
Vas-y Derek, c'est ton anniversaire
Attention !
Mais qu'est-ce qu'elle fout.
Elle est folle !
Il m'a coupé la route
Tu surgis au milieu de la route en pleine course.
Tu es folle ?
Je n'allais pas aller dans le ravin
Tu es en vie et tu as gagné.
Je suis contente et toi aussi.
Tu as vu Amy, elle est partie.
Un indice : dans les films,
les filles aiment les mecs pour leur voiture
Dans la vraie vie,
elles aiment les gars pour ce qu'ils sont
Merci
Où vas tu ?
Dans la vraie vie
Tu as un moment de libre ?
Joli travail cette table,
d'habitude on est collés à la cuisine
Je me débrouille
On a peu de temps, donc on ne parle pas du travail.
Tout, sauf le boulot.
Bien dit
Un moment, je coupe mon téléphone.
Je commence.
Sport favori ?
La course, et toi ?
Le baseball
Tu es Red Vines ou Twislers ?
Twislers bien sûr.
Je supporte uniquement les Red Vines
- C'est sans issue.
- Horrible, je sors avec un fan des Red Vines.
À mon tour.
Premier baiser ?
Mandy Banks, en 6ème.
Pire cadeau offert à une fille ?
Adriane O'Malley, à mes 13 ans.
Je pensais qu'un collier en or
me coûterait moins de 3,95 $
Un collier
Tu vois ce collier ?
Elle ne le portait pas.
Pas après notre dispute à ce sujet.
Ça n'a pas de sens mais je dois y aller
Ça va ?
Non, je suis folle.
Car je gâche un RDV qui se passe très bien
Mais j'ai une urgence.
Maintenant ?
Ça arrive souvent en fait.
J'aimerais pouvoir t'expliquer.
Mais ça serait très compliqué.
Promis, je t'appelle plus tard,
si tu veux ressortir c'est super,
sinon, je comprendrais très bien.
Non ce n'est pas vrai, je serais détruite.
Merci, j'ai passé un bon moment
- Où est Adam ?
- Quelque part par ici.
et Jen ?
Je l'ai vue là-bas y a un instant
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Amy
Mais
Adam, je suis désolée.
Ce n'était pas parfait entre nous, mais
Comment peux-tu ?
Ferme-la !
Je voulais t'en parler.
Je ne savais pas comment
T'as réussi on dirait.
Je suis si désolée
De quoi ?
Ils vont tous le savoir.
Tous
On fera avec.
On doit faire ce qu'on a dit
si la vérité éclatait.
Je ne sais pas.
J'ai toujours vécu ici.
Tout est foutu maintenant.
Tu te rends compte
de ce qu'on va devoir supporter ?
Ça ne marchera pas.
Nous ne pourrons pas vivre ici.
Il faut qu'on parte, Jen
Rentre chez toi et prépare toi,
je passe te prendre dans 30 minutes.
Tout va bien se passer
Davis, j'avais tort sur le Roméo et Juliette
En fait c'est
Juliette et Juliette
Tu rigoles ?
Non, Amy et Jen, sont amoureuses.
<i>Ils ne sont pas morts pendant la course</i>
Je ne sais pas ce qui va se passer
Je dois y aller.
C'est moi qui régale cette fois.
Non merci
Garde ma place
Je suis désolée,
ce n'est pas ce que j'avais prévu
Moi non plus
On a quelques minutes,
j'ai quelques propositions
Dans ce cas-là, écoute
Autant éviter de parler boulot.
Il avait raison ?
- Tu
- Tu devrais annuler ta soirée.
Il se fait tard, et vu ton poste,
il faut être en forme demain au bureau.
Tu as raison
À demain Lindsay
Gregory, n'oubliez pas ça
On en discute demain au bureau
Bonne nuit
C'est une première
Merci Harrison
Prête ?
Oui, prête
<i>- On doit le faire</i>
- Je t'aime
Je t'aime aussi
J'arrive, attends moi dehors
Tu fais quoi ?
- C'était qui ?
- Personne
Tu as dit : Je t'aime
Ça ne te regarde pas
- Où tu vas ?
- Vas t'en !
C'est Adam n'est-ce pas ?
Je l'ai su quand il t'a choisi.
Tu dis n'importe quoi.
Il m'a choisie parce que je suis ta soeur
Dis moi où tu vas.
Que fais tu ici ?
- Monte STP.
- Pas question
Monte, je veux juste te parler
De quoi ?
Je ne trouve pas Amy.
Tu me dois une explication
Une minute.
J'en étais certain !
Merde Harrison,
change ton huile de temps en temps.
Derek !
Je suis pressé
Ta soeur est avec Adam Whitman,
on doit l'arrêter
C'est ce que je fais.
Monte !
Il est en colère, quelque chose peut arriver
Tu veux juste parler, ne roule pas si vite
Depuis combien de temps ça dure ?
Quelques mois.
Quelques mois !
Je voulais qu'elle te le dise
Je n'en reviens pas qu'il sorte avec ma soeur
Elle ne couche pas avec lui.
Tu crois qu'ils jouent aux cartes
Adam, ralentis
Quelques réponses, c'est tout
Je suis montée pour ça
Parlons rapidement
Ce n'est pas ta faute
Vraiment, Adam.
Elle ne savait pas comment l'avouer
Elle t'aime
Mais elle est amoureuse de toi
Le collier.
Elle n'arrêtait pas de le regarder en vitrine,
alors je le lui ai offert.
Je sais pourquoi maintenant
Elle voulait te le donner
Tu es son meilleur ami, Adam
C'est pourquoi c'était si dur
Elle ne voulait pas te blesser.
C'est dur hein ?
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Je fais peur à ma soeur.
- Sors !
- C'est coincé !
- C'est ta soeur, Derek. Arrête !
- La-ferme !
Tu vas la tuer !
Elle n'aura rien.
Je veux juste l'effrayer.
Arrête, tu vas les envoyer dans le ravin.
Je les tamponne un peu c'est tout.
Ça ne tiendra pas.
La glissière a cédé.
Arrête !
Ça ne va pas tenir.
- Pauvre fils de riche.
- Derek, ta soeur n'aime pas Adam.
Elle aime Amy
C'est avec elle
qu'elle veut s'enfuir.
Quoi ?
J'ai vu la voiture de Derek.
Donc, hier à la même heure,
Tu étais sur les lieux du crash ?
C'est exact.
Les filles se sont enfuies ?
Non.
Le fait de fuir n'arrangera rien.
Elles devront quand même faire face à la situation.
Grâce à toi, elles ont cette solution.
Grâce à nous
Parfois, c'est plus facile quand on peut en parler
Pour qui sont-elles ?
Amy et Jen me les ont données
pour les avoir aidées avec leur secret
Et je te les donne
Pour ton aide avec le mien
<i>Frérot</i>
Tru ? ça va ?
<i>Bien.</i>
Tu ne me demandes rien sur ton bébé ?
Quel bébé ?
<i>Ta voiture,</i> le plus important pour toi
Ah oui,
 je suis un peu occupé
Dis moi juste comment ça s'est passé avec Lindsay ?
Super, pas de problèmes
Mission accomplie
Tu vas bien ?
Oui je vais bien, où es tu ?
Mon appartement
Ton appartement.
Je ne crois pas que ce soit
une bonne idée.
Oh mon dieu !
Harrison !
Généralement c'est mauvais signe
quand une fille s'enfuit d'un 1er RDV
J'ai dit que je t'appellerai.
Je croyais que tu parlais de mardi
Ça risque d'arriver encore,
tu pourras gérer ?
Je crois, oui
Je ne cherche peut-être pas
une fille normale de 22 ans
Tu es libre toute la nuit ?
Aucun rendez-vous surprise.
Je suis toute à toi
Une de mes amis disait:
la vraie vie c'est pas comme dans les films
Parfois,
c'est mieux de garder le mystère.
À quoi sert un mystère s'il n'est pas découvert ?

Donc, tu y es parvenue
39 jours de boulot et enfin
un premier jour de repos
- Il fallait que je voie ça
- J'ai frôlé le record
J'ai apporté de quoi fêter ça
avec un petit déjeuner
C'est ridicule.
J'ai 50 invités ce soir
Et je n'ai qu'un bocal d'olives
et des chips au bacon pour l'apéritif.
Là, je ne comprends pas.
Ça fait 6 mois que tu as emménagé
et c'est seulement ta première soirée.
Que veux tu que je te dise ?
Je n'ai pas eu de temps libre.
Tu es anxieux ?
Pourquoi ?
Ce soir, tu vas rencontrer mes amis
pour la première fois... et mon frère.
Tu m'as déjà étudié sous toutes les coutures.
Pourquoi veux-tu que je stresse ?
Tu seras parfait
C'est moi. Ça ne fait que 2 mois.
Ne me dis pas que tu m'as déjà oublié.
Marc
<i>Écoute, tout est de ma faute</i>
<i>Tu as toutes les raisons de me haïr</i>
Je pense à toi sans arrêt.
Je veux que tu reviennes
Tu es là ?
Oui,
mais c'est pas trop le moment
Je pourrais passer plus tard,
qu'on en discute un peu
Écoute.
Je te rappelle au passage que tu m'as trompée
C'était la pire erreur de ma vie.
J'en suis conscient
Il fallait t'en rendre compte avant.
À ce sujet
J'ai rencontré quelqu'un.
Il est formidable
Je t'en supplie.
Ça ne se reproduira plus
Là, tu as bien raison
<i>Je dois te laisser, Marc</i>
Tout va bien ?
Oui, pourquoi ?
Tu semblais un peu troublée au téléphone
J'ai eu peur que ce soit une mauvaise nouvelle
À vrai dire,
c'était mon ex
Et il voulait me voir
J'imaginais autre chose, mais...
Si c'est ce que tu veux...
On ne se connaît que depuis peu
Je lui ai dit non
Tant mieux
Désolée, je n'aurais pas dû t'en parler
Au contraire, tu as bien fait
Si on n'est pas franc entre nous,
à quoi bon continuer
Tu veux certainement savoir
pourquoi je t'ai donné rendez-vous ici
On se voit toujours ici.
Bref
C'est au sujet de Lindsay
Depuis l'autre soir
Je n'arrête pas de penser à elle
- Tu te fous de moi là.
- Même si ça semble fou
je suis sérieux
Tu me connais,
je ne la supporte pas
Je n'ai jamais pu
Et là, c'est devenu une vraie obsession
C'est troublant
Et tu me parles de ça pour...
Elle est invitée à ta fête, non ?
Tu pourrais en discuter avec elle
pour voir si elle est intéressée.
Entre filles vous le faites
Allez, c'est pour moi
Je veux juste savoir si c'est oui ou non
Peut-être
- Peut-être intéressée ?
- Il est mignon, mais...
C'était bizarre, il semblait embarrassé.
Tu vois le genre de truc que les mecs font
- Il était sûrement nerveux.
- Généralement on donne un coup de fil,
ou on envoie des fleurs
De quoi se sentir aimée
On n'a pas besoin de ça
Et avec quoi on coupera les citrons ?
En plus il est en promo
Oh mon dieu ! Les Pez !
J'ai oublié les Pez
Toi et tes bonbons
J'adore ces petits bonshommes.
Ils sont trop mimi
Tu es sûre de vouloir te reposer aujourd'hui ?
Oui, et c'est mon dernier mot
Mais si un corps demande de l'aide,
je fais quoi ?
Il ne te parlent pas à toi de toute façon
<i>et ils ne demandent pas d'aide chaque soir.
Ça ne marche pas comme ça</i>
Viens 5 minutes,
et si personne ne te demande de l'aide,
tu rentres chez toi
<i>Tu ne m'écoutes pas</i>
J'ai travaillé 8 jours cette semaine
<i>- Oui, mais je veux juste dire...
- Davis</i>
J'ai besoin de repos
À demain alors ?
À demain
Des biscuits apéritifs, de la bière.
Ya de la fête dans l'air
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Rien.
Je suis surprise, c'est tout
Sacrée coïncidence
Souviens-toi, j'habite juste à côté
J'y fais mes courses
Je ne te suis pas
Je voulais aussi en profiter
pour m'excuser
Car ce matin, j'ai été trop pressant avec toi
C'est oublié
En tout cas...
J'étais content de te revoir
Et dire que j'ai manqué ça
Il ne s'est rien passé.
On s'est croisés par hasard
Je te dis qu'il te suivait
Ils font comme si c'était par hasard,
puis ils t'attendent devant chez toi
Ils te coupent la tête
et la mettent dans un sac plastique
Je trouve juste étrange qu'il t'appelle
et qu'il te croise juste après
<i>Alors ? Elle a dit quoi ?</i>
En fait, je suis déjà équipée
Qu'est-ce tu racontes ?
Peut-être une autre fois
Elle est avec toi
C'est ça
Un vendeur
Donne moi un indice au moins
Si vous voulez que je sois une de vos clientes,
vous devrez me faire une offre plus intéressante
<i>Plus intéressante...
Un cadeau ça irait ?</i>
<i>- C'est un début.
- Mais quoi comme cadeau ?</i>
Elle est déjà équipée, merci
C'était la seule solution pour t'en sortir
Tru ! Super fête !
Content de te revoir
Merci
Mais qui est ce mec
- Marty est à l'heure, je ne le crois pas.
- C'était Marty
- Ce couteau est fourni avec une notice d'utilisation.
- Pour un couteau ?
- Il peut couper un bottin.
- C'est bon à savoir
Merci.
Merci beaucoup
- Sam.
- Tru je suis désolé
Ce n'est rien.
Les vases finissent tous comme ça
À part ça, comment ça marche en médecine ?
Tu es à Hopkins, non ?
En fait, j'ai planté l'exam
Un problème familial,
j'ai pas pu me présenter pour l'exam.
Et ce prof débile m'a refusé la session de rattrapage
C'est dommage
En attendant la prochaine session,
je vends des chaussures à la boutique de mon père
Et toi ?
Je fais la préparation des corps à la morgue
Et bien
Moi qui pensais être mal barré
Elle est magnifique
C'est juste un petit cadeau pour toi
En fait c'est...
<i>De la part de Bill pour Sally</i>
Quoi ?
C'est gravé dessus
<i>De la part de Bill pour Sally !</i>
Ça ?
On peut le faire enlever
Ça vient d'un prêteur sur gage ?
Ça te gène ?
Joyeuse pendaison de crémaillère
Merci
Suis moi
Alors, ce qu'on dit à ce sujet est faux.
Comment on dit ?
C'est l'intention qui compte
Ça compte si ça vient de toi
Il se trouve que ce truc est à Bill
Salut, tu dois être Luc.
Moi c'est Lindsay
Enchanté
C'est mon frère, Harrison
Tu voudrais me donner un coup de main STP ?
Je peux te poser une question ?
D'homme à homme
Tu veux acheter une montre ?
Ton frère est désespérant
Une montre d'occasion.
Quelle classe !
Harrison est comme ça
Il est ringard
Désolée, on change de sujet
Ton petit copain...
est canon
Ça suffit.
On est là pour s'amuser
Tu as raison
À ta santé
J'ai déjà abusé, je devrais ralentir un peu
C'est rare de s'amuser comme ça.
Surtout avec ton boulot
Santé
Ya un voisin assez nerveux devant la porte
Coupez cette musique ou j'appelle la police !
Il suffisait de demander, Brian
Je n'ai rien à demander.
Coupez la musique !
Très bien
Ya intérêt !
Leonard est mon pote
et si je lui dis,
vous n'aurez plus de place de parking
Je n'ai pas de voiture
C'est pour vous avertir
Pourquoi tu ne l'as pas invité?
Tu plaisantes. C'est un malade
Raison de plus.
Si il est avec nous, il ne peut pas se plaindre
Je le saurai pour la prochaine fois
Au revoir.
On s'appelle
Il faut qu'on parle
Je sais que je ne devrais pas être là
Mais il fallait que je vienne m'excuser
Sors d'ici tout de suite, Marc
- Parle moi.
- On a assez discuté
Je demande juste 5 minutes
5 minutes, et je m'en irai
D'accord, mais pas ici
Sur le toit
Tu me promets ?
Attends-moi là haut
C'était qui ?
C'était celui qui m'a appelée ce matin
Ton ex ?
Il s'est pointé comme ça.
Il veut me parler
Va lui parler
Ça ne t'ennuie pas ?
J'ai confiance en toi
Merci
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Notre premier baiser était sur ce toit
Et je me suis dit que peut-être...
Reste.
Parle-moi
Dis-moi qu'entre nous c'était génial
Rentre chez toi
Et ne t'approche plus de moi
Génial
Rentrez-bien
Je t'appelle un taxi, Sam ?
Non, j'ai envie de vomir.
Je peux faire ça où ?
En bas des escaliers, à droite.
Dans le caniveau
Merci, t'es la meilleure
Ça va ?
Oui.
Ils sont tous partis ?
Ils n'avaient pas envie de s'amuser sans toi
Et puis, il n'y avait plus rien à boire
Tout s'est bien passé avec le rabat-joie ?
Oui
Fatiguée ?
Le punch de Lindsay m'a retourné la tête
Couche-toi.
je m'occupe du nettoyage
- On fera ça demain
- Allez, au lit
Merci pour tout.
Je me suis bien amusée ce soir
Moi aussi
Tu veux rester ?
J'aimerais, mais tu dois te reposer
Alors, je te dis à demain
Et comment
Bonne nuit
Luc ?
Tu devais rentrer, non ?
<i>Les urgences.
Puis-je avoir votre nom et votre adresse SVP ?</i>
Tru Davies, 1723 York.
Il y a eu un meurtre
<i>Que s'est-il passé ?</i>
je viens de me réveiller et il était allongé.
Je ne sais pas comment
<i>Mademoiselle ?
Êtes-vous là ?</i>
Tru
J'ai besoin de toi
Donc, tu y es parvenue
39 jours de boulots et enfin
un premier jour de repos
Il fallait que je voie ça
Là, je ne comprends pas.
Ça fait 6 mois que tu as emménagé
et c'est seulement ta première soirée.
Pardon, tu disais ?
<i>C'est moi.</i>
Marc
<i>Content que tu te rappelles</i>
Je voudrais te dire quelque chose.
Mais pas par téléphone
<i>- Au Standard Dîner, dans 1 heure.
- Bien</i>
C'était Davis. Il a besoin de moi
Tu plaisantes là ?
Prends au moins ton petit-dèj
Il a dit que c'était urgent
Dis moi que tu n'es pas furieux
Ça me déçoit pour toi
Tu ne peux jamais te reposer
- On se voit ce soir.
- Oui
Il y avait une seule plaie.
Juste sous le coeur
J'ai appelé les urgences mais
il m'a demandé de l'aide et me voilà
Si j'ai bien compris,
Tu as fait une fête et je n'étais pas invité
- Je croyais qu'on était amis.
- On est amis
Seulement quand tu te retrouves
à coté d'un cadavre
Je m'en excuse.
Ce n'est pas le moment
Tu ne sais pas comment
Mike s'est retrouvé sur ton lit ?
C'est Mark.
Non je n'en sais rien
- J'ai pas mal bu hier soir.
- Des suspects ?
- Je n'en vois qu'un.
- Qui ?
- Moi.
- Voyons, Tru
Mark avait un comportement étrange.
Il m'a peut-être agressée
Et j'ai riposté
- Tu ne peux pas l'avoir tué.
- Qu'est-ce que tu en sais ?
Parce que tu sauves les gens,
tu ne les tues pas
N'y avait-il pas d'autre blessure que celle au thorax ?
Il avait la main droite bien entaillée
Quoi d'autre ?
Du sang sur les murs à coté du lit
- Une traînée de sang.
- Intéressant. D'autres traces ?
je viens de me réveiller et il était allongé.
Je ne sais pas comment
Oui, sur la poignée de la porte
- Et le couteau était sur le sol.
- Au pied du lit
Il n'y avait du sang que sur le bout de la lame
Signe de blessure peu profonde
- Tu penses à un suicide ?
Pas avec une entaille sur la main
Il essayait de se protéger
Il s'agit donc d'un meurtre
Viens voir
C'est un logiciel de criminologie
Il recrée les lieux du crime.
Très utile lorsqu'ils ont été détruits ou altérés
Tu va reconstituer mon appart dans l'ordinateur ?
Une fois les paramètres définis,
J'aurai le profil physique du meurtrier
- Un profil précis ?
- Poids, taille, sexe...
Ça prendra environ 2 heures
J'ai rendez-vous avec Mark dans 15 minutes
Tu n'oublies rien ?
Je suis invité à la fête, n'est-ce pas ?
- Il n'y aura pas de fête.
- Il doit y en avoir une
Il le faut !
Pour le sauver,
les circonstances doivent être
exactement les mêmes qu'hier
Et pas seulement la fête
Tu dois t'assurer qu'il vienne
comme il l'a fait hier
Sinon le meurtrier pourrait frapper ailleurs
Et tu ne pourras pas le sauver
Très bien
Désolée Harrison,
On remet ça à demain
En fait, je voulais te parler d'un truc
Lindsay
Oui.
Comment tu...
Pour qu'elle t'apprécie,
montre lui qu'elle compte pour toi
Comment je fais ?
Je ne sais pas.
Des fleurs, un resto...
Un cadeau, ça irait ?
Oui, mais évite la montre
avec un autre prénom que le sien gravé dessus
Voyons, je ne ferais jamais ça
À moins que je l'aie déjà fait
Je l'ai fait ?
Tu crois que je peux re-vivre des jours maintenant ?
Non
J'aimerais bien.
Ne change pas de sujet
<i>Je veux juste un conseil</i>
Pense à ses goûts avant tout
Ses goûts avant tout
Ça fait un bail
Ça va ?
Tu as l'air...
Oui ça va.
Ce n'est rien
Ça te fait bizarre de me voir, hein ?
Un peu
- En fait, je t'ai appelée...
- Tu deviens quoi ?
Moi ? Comme d'hab.
Les cours, les copies...
Quoi d'autre ?
Dans ta vie
J'étais avec quelqu'un
Mais ça n'a pas duré,
si c'est ça qui t'intéresse
Une étudiante ?
Oui
Je n'en suis pas très fier
Je la connais ?
À vrai dire,
je ne comptais pas parler de ça
Elle s'appelle Julie Spence
Elle a été diplômée l'année dernière
Elle travaille maintenant à la mairie
Comment a-t-elle réagi ?
Réagi à quoi ?
À la rupture
En fait, elle a très mal réagi.
Elle a crevé mes pneus ce soir-là
Rien de bien intéressant
Je suis vraiment content de te revoir
Oui
Moi aussi
C'était bien.
Un peu bizarre, mais bien quand même
C'était bien de se revoir
On a tellement discuté à table,
que je n'ai pas pu te dire
Pourquoi je t'ai appelée
J'ai beaucoup pensé à toi
À nous deux.
Comme on était bien ensemble
Tu me manques énormément.
Reviens, je t'en prie
- Mark
- Je sais qu'on a du pain sur la planche
Mais je ferais l'impossible pour toi
Je suis avec quelqu'un d'autre
Ça peut te sembler étrange.
Mais, je veux qu'on reste amis
Amis.
J'ai déjà entendu ça
Je le pense vraiment.
Je fais une fête chez moi ce soir,
Passe y faire un tour
On pourra encore discuter,
de ce que tu veux
Ok, ça me va
Je finis tard mais j'y serai
Davis n'avait pas besoin de toi finalement
Que fais-tu là ?
Je vais à la morgue.
Tu devais y être si je ne me trompe
C'était mon ex.
C'est lui qui a appelée ce matin
C'est pour lui que tu n'as même pas déjeuné ?
Pour pouvoir le rencontrer ?
- Il a des problèmes, il a besoin d'aide.
- Quel genre de problèmes ?
C'est difficile à dire.
Crois-moi
Comme ce matin quand tu es partie
Tu sais quoi ?
Amuse-toi bien à ta fête ce soir
Luc, attends !
Je suis venue pour voir une pastèque ?
Comment cela peut nous aider
à résoudre ce meurtre ?
Regarde
Tu vois ?
Cela ne gicle pas
Le couteau empêche l'écoulement
Mais quand on le retire
Cela ne te rappelle rien ?
- Tu veux dire que Mark s'est retiré le couteau.
- Ce n'est pas tout
Le sang sur la poignée,
indique qu'il a ouvert la porte
avec sa main blessée.
Il a donc été poignardé en dehors de l'appart
J'en conclus que:
Mark Evans se fait poignarder.
Laissé pour mort et blessé à la main gauche,
il se dirige vers ton appart
Il ouvre la porte avec sa main blessée
Il arrive au pied du lit
- Porte sa main sur le couteau
- Et il le retire
Exactement
Il aurait réussi à marcher
avec un couteau enfoncé dans le coeur ?
Le couteau bloque l'hémorragie
Il a perdu très peu de sang
pendant ce temps-là
Alors pourquoi le retirer ?
Il était en état de choc
Contrairement à ce que tu penses,
rien ne prouve que tu sois coupable
Rien ne prouve que je suis innocente
En ce moment,
je devrais être en train de préparer la fête,
me détendre et m'amuser un peu
Tu savais que ce n'était pas un boulot facile
Je ne pensais pas
que ça serait si chiant que ça
Tu n'es pas seule
On va y arriver
Coupez cette musique ou j'appelle la police !
Brian, je fais une fête ce soir.
Tu es invité
- Vraiment ?
- Oui
On ne peut pas s'amuser sans ses voisins
- C'est vrai.
- À ce soir, alors ?
Entendu.
Je suis toujours prêt pour faire la fête
Super
Julie Spence
Tru.
Enfin un peu d'aide
Tu es passée au salon de thé ?
- J'aurais pu si on ne m'avait pas posé de lapin.
- Désolée
Combien je te dois ?
140 $ et des poussières
Ne me regarde pas comme ça.
Il était soldé
Tu me fais venir pour te débarrasser d'un couteau
Un couteau neuf, en plus
Débarrasse-moi de ça.
Débrouille-toi
Et pour le cadeau de Lindsay,
je fais comment ?
J'aurais bien acheté des bougies
ou un truc dans le genre
Mais Lindsay a des goûts bizarres
Trouve lui un truc dans son genre.
Et surtout...
Je sais:
je me débarrasse du couteau
Un truc dans son genre...
Excusez-moi, Julie
Salut.
On ne se connaît pas, je m'appelle Tru Davies.
Je suis une amie de Mark Evans
Je vois très bien qui tu es
Mark parlait sans arrêt de toi
- C'est vrai ?
Même quand on était ensemble,
tu l'obsédais
Tu es venue pour jubiler ?
- Pourquoi ?
- Tu l'as récupéré
- Je savais qu'il ne pensait qu'à toi.
- Je ne l'ai pas récupéré et je ne le veux pas
Alors, que veux-tu ?
T'avertir.
Tu ne dois pas te venger de lui
De quoi tu parles ?
Il m'a dit que tu as crevé ses pneus,
le soir ou il t'a quittée
Ce n'était pas moi
Peu importe qui l'a fait.
Je suis sûre que Mark le méritait
- Ne t'approche pas de lui.
- Tu es son garde du corps ?
Je suis inquiète pour lui, c'est tout
De toute façon ce ne sont pas tes oignons
Je ne pense pas
- Je règle toute seule mes problèmes avec mes ex
- C'est bien ce qui m'inquiète
J'ai compris pourquoi vous alliez si bien ensemble.
Vous êtes deux malades !
Entrez
Je pensais te trouver là
Un photographe dans une chambre noire.
Logique
Je suis désolée de t'avoir menti
J'ai rencontré Mark car il me rendait soucieuse.
Cela n'arrivera plus
Tu m'avais averti que tu devrais
souvent t'enfuir sans donner d'explications
Jusqu'à aujourd'hui,
cela ne me dérangeait pas
Maintenant je me pose des questions.
Où vas-tu quand tu disparais ?
Allez, réponds.
Tu m'as dit que tu serais franche
- Je le serai.
- Alors, dis-moi
Pourquoi tout ce mystère ?
Tu mènes une double vie ?
Tu as un amant ?
- Bien sûr que non !
- Alors Pourquoi me cacher la vérité
Je vois
Ça c'est de la franchise
On n'est ensemble que depuis peu de temps.
Il vaut mieux que ça arrive maintenant
Écoute, si tu cherches la simplicité,
tu as raison de vouloir arrêter
Mais si tu es capable de gérer
quelque chose d'un peu plus complexe
N'abandonne pas.
Tu ne le regretteras pas
<i>Viens, tout de suite</i>
Je dois y aller.
Davis à besoin de moi
Je vois.
Je connais la musique
- J'ai rentré tous les paramètres.
- Et ?
Selon les mensurations de la victime,
et son type de blessure
Le meurtrier mesure 1m65,
il est droitier et plutôt frêle
C'est le profil d'une femme.
Qu'en penses-tu ?
On dirait que tu viens de me décrire
Tu exagères.
Ce n'est pas toi la coupable
1m65, droitière.
Dans mon appart avec mon couteau
Qui veux-tu que cela soit ?
Je règle toute seule mes problèmes avec mes ex
- Julie
- Qui ?
L'ex de Mark.
Elle a la même corpulence que moi
Tu n'as plus qu'une chose à faire.
Surveiller Mark à la fête
Et si son ex se pointe,
on sera là pour l'arrêter
Et si c'est moi qui le tue ?
Je ferai mon possible
pour que tu ne le tues pas
Tru ! Super fête !
Content de te revoir
Merci, Marty
Hé voisine. Super fête !
Merci, voisin
Tu sembles préoccupée
- Ma dernière fête à été un désastre, donc...
- Je vois
C'était avant que j'emménage alors.
Ne t'en fais pas, si la fête se ramollit
J'apporterai mon karaoké.
Tout le monde adore ça
C'est juste un petit cadeau pour toi
Je sais que tu en as déjà beaucoup.
Celui-là est assez rare
Mon dieu.
Un Popeye de 1952 avec chargeur bleu
Il n'existe que 2 000 exemplaires
- Comment tu savais ?
- Je t'ai entendue parler de ta collection
Comme quoi, je t'écoute des fois
Regarde ce que ton frère m'a offert
Désolée.
Il voulait bien faire
- Tu plaisantes. J'adore.
- Ah bon ?
Oui.
Peut-être je me trompais sur son compte
Il est spécial
Tu as vu Mark ?
Ton ex ?
Pourquoi veux-tu qu'il soit là ?
Je l'ai invité
Quoi ?
Pourquoi faire ?
Et Luc alors ?
Je t'expliquerai
Tu sais ce qu'il te faudrait ?
Mon punch maison
Merci, mais pas ce soir
Comment ça se passe ?
Pas de Mark ni Julie à l'horizon
Mais il est encore tôt
Contente de te voir.
Ça fait plaisir à entendre
Où devrais-je me placer ?
Où est le couteau que j'ai acheté ?
Besoin de quelque chose ?
C'est pratique, j'habite juste en face
Un couteau, c'est possible ?
En attendant, je vends des chaussures
à la boutique de mon père
Et toi ?
Excuse-moi un instant
- Où as-tu trouvé ce couteau ?
- C'est à ton voisin
Je n'ai pas trouvé celui que j'avais acheté.
Tu sais où il est ?
Non.
Sois prudente
Soeurette, t'as un moment ?
Lindsay m'apprécie ?
Elle a apprécié ton cadeau
Je m'en doute.
Je l'ai dans la peau
C'est une phase critique
Je peux regarder quelques scores à la télé ?
Vas-y
- Tu as réussi à venir
- Désolé pour le retard
- Mon cours a duré un peu plus que prévu
- Pas grave. L'essentiel c'est que tu sois là
Exactement.
Tu as un moment ?
Oui
C'est un peu bruyant ici.
On peut aller sur le toit ?
Je suis l'hôte ce soir,
je ne devrais pas
Juste quelques secondes
Je croyais que tu avais un petit ami.
Où est-il ?
Non, il n'est pas là
- Querelle amoureuse ?
- En quelque sorte
C'est un fou,
de laisser seule une fille comme toi
Et je sais de quoi je parle
Merci
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Désolé
- Tu m'as invité, je pensais...
- Je te l'ai dit
Je veux qu'on soit amis
Cela ne me convient pas.
Je n'abandonnerai pas
Pourtant, il le faut
Il m'a peut-être agressée.
Et j'ai riposté
Écoute.
Ne t'approche pas de moi
C'est pour ton bien
En bas des escaliers à droite.
Dans le caniveau
T'es la meilleure
- Ton frère m'a laissée seule.
- Vraiment ?
Il a parlé d'un tournoi de poker,
et il s'est tiré
T'as besoin de la poubelle ?
Ton vase a été cassé
Je n'aurais pas dû les laisser boire autant
Il était plus nerveux que saoul à mon avis
Où tu veux en venir ?
Il était furieux contre un prof qui l'a empêché
d'intégrer la fac de médecine
Et ce prof débile m'a refusé la session de rattrapage
Environ 1m65, droitier
Rendez-vous sur le toit
Sam
Hopkins, la fac de médecine
la plus prestigieuse des États-unis
- Et je n'y suis pas admis.
- Je peux arranger ça
C'est trop tard maintenant
Cela m'a pris des mois pour oublier.
Mais j'ai passé le cap
Et voilà que tu te pointes à une fête
Je m'en doutais.
C'était la seule solution
- Pose-le, Sam !
- Tru, c'est le type dont je te parlais
Tu es saoul.
Tu ne veux pas faire ça
J'avais ma voie toute tracée
J'avais une chance de réussir
Et il me l'a prise
Alors reprends-lui
De quoi tu parles ?
Les choses n'ont pas bien tourné
la première fois alors il faut réagir
- C'est ce que je fais !
- Non ! Là tu abandonnes tout
Si tu le tues, ta vie sera gâchée
Tu passeras 20 ans derrière les barreaux
avec des remords. C'est ce que tu veux ?
Je ne sais pas comment te remercier
En me disant au revoir
Un de ses anciens élèves,
avec un couteau, sur le toit
Le simulateur n'aurait jamais trouvé ça
Je ne comprends toujours pas
comment il a réussi à descendre mourir ici
Il t'aimait,
ça peut donner des ailes
J'arrive un peu tard ?
On se voit tous demain au boulot
Alors.
J'ai bien réfléchi
À quoi ?
Les bonnes choses de la vie
ne viennent pas facilement
Si je dois faire des efforts pour te garder,
j'assumerai la tâche
Tu le mérites.
Et si je dois partir soudainement ?
Tu assumeras ?
On verra bien
Pardon d'avoir manqué ta fête
Elle n'est pas encore finie
- Ah bon ?
- Non
En tout cas la soirée n'est pas terminée
<i>Sous-titres fait par Stinc3 & relus par Van pour
Dossier Tru Calling - http://trucalling.free.fr</i>
Tu as l'air heureuse ?
Pourquoi pas ?
J'ai 22 ans, je suis en bonne santé
Je travaille avec un gars sympa
Moi ?
Oui, toi Davis
J'ai des amis super,
un petit-copain mignon
Et chaque semaine
un corps m'appelle et
Tu revis la journée
Ça serait cool si je pouvais le faire quand je veux
Si la journée est mauvaise,
on la recommence
Si ma tenue ne plaît pas,
changement de garde robe
- Mort prématurée
- On l'empêche d'arriver
- Tu n'as rien à envier à Wonder Woman.
- Tu oublies son avion invisible
Content de voir que tu acceptes
si bien ce qu'il t'arrive
Soyons honnête
Je me vois mal
refuser de l'aide à ceux qui m'appellent
Juste par curiosité
Qui d'autre est au courant ?
Mon frère uniquement.
Il ne me croit toujours pas
Sauf quand il s'agit de tricher aux courses
Personne d'autre ?
Non
Ni ma soeur, Ni Lindsay
Et sûrement pas Luc
C'est déjà compliqué sans le lui dire
Et ton père ?
C'est dur de parler à quelqu'un
qui ne veut pas écouter
C'est marrant
Je peux sauver des vies, mais
 je ne peux pas exister aux yeux de mon père
Je sais, trop d'infos
C'était juste pour dire qu'un don
comme le tien est difficile à gérer
Mais sache qu'il y aura
toujours quelqu'un pour apprécier ce don
Peut-être aujourd'hui
Jake
On vient de me communiquer
les résultats de ton scanner
Et ?
Et, j'aimerais qu'on en discute
Jake,
Pourquoi n'es-tu pas dans ton lit ?
Et ton uniforme ? Tu sais que
tu dois rester en blouse
Non, tu connais les règles
Je dois sortir d'ici
Jake, je suis désolé
Le docteur t'a dit de te reposer
Je reviens dans quelques heures
J'ai une chose à faire
Reste à l'intérieur
Tu ne dois pas être ici
Jake, ça va ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Ne fais pas l'idiot
Je t'ai dit, je dois sortir
Écoute moi
Je viens de parler au docteur et
Je serai de retour dans 1h ou 2
Personne ne s'en rendra compte
Mais qu'as-tu fait ?
Il avait une arme
C'était Jake, seulement Jake
Il est mort
Ep 1-08 - Closure
<i>Salut, c'est Tru. Laissez-moi un message</i>
<i>Bonjour Tru, c'est ton père</i>
<i>Ça fait longtemps mais
j'aimerais te parler</i>
<i>Tu sais où me joindre, au revoir</i>
Il t'a aussi appelée ?
- Ouais, toi aussi ?
- Oui et Harrison aussi
Tous les 5 ans, même s'il est occupé
Il lâche tout et nous appelle
- Qu'est ce qu'il a dit ?
- Des choses qui font plaisir
T'as pas encore trouvé un boulot ?
T'as pas encore trouvé de mari ?
Ça c'est le vieux.
La courtoisie est sa devise
Qu'est ce qu'il t'a demandé ?
- Rien
- Rien ?
Je ne l'ai pas encore rappelé
Je vais le faire, un peu plus tard
C'est incroyable
Il nous ignore pendant des années
et quand il se pointe,
ce n'est que pour critiquer
Je ne sais pas ce qu'il va me dire
- Tu travailles dans une morgue
- Et tu n'es pas encore médecin
Ça s'annonce mal
- Le bon côté de la chose, c'est que tu as un boulot
- Et un copain
- Allo ?
- Salut, c'est moi
Comment va ta grand-mère ?
Et Rochester, c'est comment ?
Elle se remet.
Par contre je me sens bien trop loin de toi
Devine quoi ?
Je me suis arrangée avec Davis
On pourra enfin avoir une soirée pour nous
- C'est cool
- Mais ?
Mais il y a un problème
Ils ont bloqué la gare
à cause d'un train qui a déraillé
- Super
- Ne t'inquiètes pas, je m'en sortirai
Il faudrait bien plus qu'un train qui déraille
pour m'empêcher de te voir
<i>Agence Immobilière
 recherche collaborateur</i>
Pourquoi pas, après tout
Vous n'avez pas de CV
Soyons honnêtes,
tout le monde sait ce qu'est un CV
Une liste de boulots qui ont foiré
Non, sérieusement,
je suis un fonceur
Je regarde toujours vers l'avenir
Jamais en arrière
Quelles sont vos qualités
qui pourraient faciliter votre intégration ?
De l'humour.
Beaucoup d'humour, Marjory
Je peux vous appeler Marjory ?
Pas si effrayant que je le pensais
Meredith ! Quelle surprise !
J'avais un jour de congé,
alors je viens un peu te voir
Je voulais t'annoncer que notre frère
a passé un entretien d'embauche aujourd'hui
On dirait que papa l'a convaincu
Pas suffisamment.
Il a saboté l'entretien
Pourquoi ?
Il s'est passé quoi ?
Comme d'habitude. Il y est allé en jean et blouson,
 il a fait son numéro et bien sûr sans CV
- Il n'est pas du genre à bosser dans un bureau.
- Tu es venue me dire ça ?
Non en fait, je voulais savoir ce que papa t'a dit
Je ne sais pas, je ne l'ai pas encore rappelé
- Mais tu vas le faire ?
- Pour quelle raison ? pour qu'il me juge aussi ?
Regarde dans quel état il vous a mis
toi et Harrison
Il a refait sa vie avec une nouvelle femme
en nous ignorant totalement
Et on devrait se prosterner
parce qu'il nous appelle tous les 5 ans ?
Il est toujours notre père
Oui, <i>Notre Père qui êtes aux cieux.</i>
À Greenitch, Texas, plus précisément
Qui c'est ?
Davis, mon patron
Mignon
Même si ce n'est pas du tout mon genre
Je sais ce que papa t'a dit au sujet du mariage
mais ne me dis pas que...
- Il est médecin, n'est ce pas ?
- Oui, mais...
Je vais déjeuner
Désolé, je pensais que tu étais seule
Salut, je suis la soeur de Tru, Meredith
Tru ne m'a pas parlé de sa jeune soeur
En fait, je suis son aînée
Je suis surpris,
l'élasticité de votre peau est parfaite
Je n'ai rien mangé de la journée
Je peux déjeuner avec vous
si cela ne vous dérange pas
Vraiment ?
Le muscle entourait son ventricule gauche
Je n'avais jamais vu ça
Sans oublier que sa veine cave,
ce qui est intéressant car
Est-ce qu'on peut arrêter
de parler d'autopsies ?
- Bien sur
- Super
Est-ce que vous aimez
Le <i>Seigneur des anneaux</i> ?
Non, désolée
Je peux finir mon histoire sur l'autopsie,
elle est vraiment
Non, merci
Mais c'est Billy, de la cour de justice
Je reviens
Jim, Quelle surprise !
<i>Je ne t'avais pas reconnu</i>
- Elle t'a laissé tomber ?
- Pas tout à fait
En fait c'est le cas.
Elle a repéré un mec qu'elle connaissait
Puis il l'a emmenée sur sa moto
Je suis vraiment désolée,
elle est imprévisible parfois
Surtout avec mon père qui nous influence
bizarrement aujourd'hui
Cela m'est déjà arrivé,
 mais jamais aussi vite
J'aurais dû deviner qu'une telle fille
ne pouvait pas s'intéresser à moi
Morgue
- Tu es où ?
- Environ 80 km à l'ouest d'où je devrais être
- Que s'est-il passé ?
- L'agence de location m'a donné un itinéraire
- Ce n'était pas le bon ?
- Pas celui pour aller à Cleveland
Je sais qu'on devait passer la soirée ensemble,
mais je ne serai pas là à temps
- Ça nous apprendra à faire des projets.
- On aura bientôt notre soirée, c'est promis
Chaud devant !
Je dois y aller, sois prudent
Caporal Jake Voight, 21 ans.
Il était rentré du Proche-Orient depuis peu
Que s'est-il passé ?
Trouble de l'ordre à l'hôpital militaire.
Un des militaires a eu la gâchette facile
Heure de la mort ?
10h pile.
Il arrive tard à cause d'un retard
au niveau administratif
L'impact est net,
il est probablement mort sur le coup
Le retour au pays est plus dur qu'on ne le croit
Il a été rapatrié du Fort Mc Callister
il y a 18 mois
C'est un blessé de guerre.
Atteint par balle à la cuisse.
Il a été démobilisé après l'opération
Il était un héros pour toute son escouade
en Afghanistan
- On sait autre chose sur lui ?
- Tu veux écrire sa biographie ?
Ou carrément la réécrire
- Il a de la famille ?
- D'après son dossier, personne
Aucun proche non plus
C'est dommage de finir comme ça.
Sans personne
Emmène-le en salle 2
Je ferai une autopsie ce soir
<i>BRIDGET ELKINS S'ADRESSANT
AUX DIPLOMÉS DE LA PROMO 2002</i>
J'ai besoin de toi
<i>Salut, c'est Tru. Laissez moi un message</i>
<i>Bonjour Tru, c'est ton père</i>
<i>Ça fait longtemps mais
j'aimerais te parler</i>
Je ne pourrai pas déjeuner avec vous
La prochaine fois, préviens moi la veille
que je n'aie pas à me lever si tôt
Désolée, je ne pouvais pas prévoir
- A propos, j'ai eu un coup de fil intéressant ce matin
- Ouais, moi aussi
<i>Tu sais ce qu'il m'a demandé ?</i>
Si j'allais enfin avoir un boulot
Aucun d'entre nous ne sera assez parfait
pour lui
Tu crois que je ne le sais pas ?
J'ai arrêté de l'écouter dès mes 14 ans
Les patrons apprécient les CV,
les candidats bien habillés et motivés
- Tru, de quoi tu parles ?
- Rien du tout
<i>J'oubliais</i>. Assure toi que Meredith
 ne passe pas à la morgue aujourd'hui
Comme tu veux
- C'était qui ?
- Tru, elle ne peut pas venir
Je ne suis pas surprise
Et elle a dit que tu ne passes pas
à la morgue aujourd'hui
Passer à la morgue ?
Pourquoi je ferais ça ?
Et moi, pourquoi j'aurais besoin d'un CV ?
Non je suis sérieuse
- Un train a déraillé ?
- Tu n'as pas vu les news ?
Heureusement que tu me le dis
Je ne voudrais pas être coincé à Rochester
Pourquoi tu ne prends pas le bus ?
Il y en a un dans 1/2h
Impressionnant,
étrange mais impressionnant
Je n'aime pas trop le bus
Je vais sûrement louer une voiture
Tu ne veux pas me voir ?
Bien sur que je le veux, je veux être sure
que tu aies le bon itinéraire
Je parie que tu vas me le donner
Bonjour, Jake Voight ?
- Au fond du couloir, Chambre 248
- Merci
J'ai besoin de toi
- Bonjour, j'aimerais voir le patient
- Désolée, les visites commencent à midi
- Midi
<i>- Heure de la mort ? - 10h pile</i>
Midi, c'est trop tard.
Je n'ai que peu de temps devant moi
- Jake est un vieil ami, j'ai su qu'il était ici
- Désolée, vous devez encore attendre 2h
- SVP, vous ne comprenez pas
- Je comprends très bien, revenez plus tard
Jake
On vient de me communiquer
les résultats de ton scanner
- Et ?
- Et, j'aimerais qu'on en discute
VESTIAIRE DES INFIRMIÈRES
Jake
Pourquoi n'es-tu pas dans ton lit ?
Et ton uniforme ? Tu sais que
tu dois rester en blouse
<i>Pardon. Infirmière ?</i>
Ce patient veut un 2ème avis.
Il va bien excepté sa jambe qui est enflée
Cela m'est déjà arrivé
Je dois voir un médecin
- Fumeur ?
- De temps en temps
Peut-être une phlébite.
Il serait bon de faire une échographie
Je dois y aller
Je suis désolé Jake
<i>Finalement, vous devrez rester avec nous</i>
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Ne sois pas stupide !
Je te l'ai dit.
Je dois partir
- Je viens de parler au médecin
- Jake, baisse ton arme STP
Écoute la, Jake
Je serai de retour dans quelques heures.
Personne ne s'en rendra compte
Non, ne tirez pas !
- Jake, lâche là
- Je dois sortir
Calme toi
Désolé, je ne voulais pas vous faire peur
- Dis leur que je reviens dès que je peux
- Attends, où vas-tu ? Jake !
- Vous allez bien infirmière ?
- Oui, ça va
Tout comme Jake
Je n'en suis pas si sûr
Pourquoi ?
Si on ne le retrouve pas vite, la prochaine fois
que vous le verrez, il sera mort
Jake a été blessé à l'étranger
Le médecin lui a retiré la balle et
l'a envoyé se reposer ici
Il y a 2 semaines, nous avons détecté qu'un fragment
de la balle s'était fixé sur une artère pulmonaire
- Vous avez retiré le fragment ?
- Nous avons essayé,
- mais il a fait une hémorragie pendant l'opération.
- Quand comptez vous recommencer ?
- Rien n'était prévu, jusqu'à ce matin.
- Que s'est-il passé ?
Le scanner a révélé la formation d'une embolie.
Nous devons l'opérer au plus vite
- S'il y a embolie,
- C'est la mort assurée
Ce môme a une bombe prête à exploser en lui
Espérons qu'ils le retrouvent rapidement
C'est à n'y rien comprendre, je sauve un gars
 et j'apprends qu'il mourra d'ici la fin de la journée
Malheureusement, d'après ses symptômes:
transpiration, souffle court
Il n'en a plus pour longtemps
Même si je le trouve à temps, il ne survivra
peut-être pas à l'opération
Réfléchissons
Tu m'as dit que Jake
voulait se rendre quelque part
C'est ce qu'il a dit au garde
S'il ne te restait que quelques heures à vivre,
tu ferais quoi ?
Je ne sais pas, pleurer, me saouler
faire mes adieux
Mais Jake n'a ni famille, ni proches
Une photo, dans son portefeuille
la photo d'une fille
Elle s'appelle Bridget Elkins
Elle semblait avoir moins de 20 ans
Pas de Bridget, mais un George Elkins
567 Charleston Road, peut-être son père
- J'y vais, merci.
- Au fait
- Ta soeur vient de passer.
- Elle est venue ici ?
Vous n'avez rien prévu j'espère
Vas-y, je suis prêt
Elle t'a planté pour faire un tour en moto
J'adore ma soeur
mais elle est compliquée
J'aurais dû deviner qu'une telle fille ne pouvait pas
s'intéresser à moi
Tu l'apprécies vraiment ?
Je vais m'en vouloir mais je vais te dire
tout ce que tu dois savoir sur ma soeur
Londres est pas mal
mais ma ville préférée est Dublin
- J'ai étudié là-bas pendant un an
- C'est génial
Ne me dites pas que vous aimeriez
vous y installer, car moi aussi
C'est étrange
- Une connaissance ?
- Non, sans intérêt
Je ne vous ai pas dit
que j'adore aussi tous les animaux
Chiens, chats...
Et surtout les chevaux
Je vois,
Tru a fait du bon boulot
En vous disant tout sur moi
Mais elle ne sait pas tout.
Je ne cherche pas mon double masculin
Je veux un gars qui reste lui-même.
C'est ce qui compte le plus à mes yeux
Que je sois naturel ?
- Je peux le faire
- Super
Donc,
vous aimez le <i>Seigneur des anneaux</i> ?
567, Charleston
Ça va ?
Elle n'est plus là
Ils sont partis
- Vous êtes l'infirmière de l'hôpital
- Tout va bien, je suis seule
Il faut y retourner
Sans opération, tu vas mourir
J'ai peu de chance d'y survivre
De toute façon
Je n'y retournerai pas avant de l'avoir retrouvée
Bridget ?
J'avais 18 ans,
et j'habitais juste à côté
Elle passait son bac
Tu étais amoureux
Oh que oui
Un amour fou.
Dès que je l'ai aperçue
J'ai su que c'était elle
Par chance, c'était réciproque
C'est ce que je pensais
Que s'est-il passé ?
Je ne sais pas, c'est comme ça
J'avais 48h avant l'embarquement
Les 2 plus beaux jours de ma vie
Juste moi et Bridget
Puis je suis parti
Et j'ai reçu un télégramme
Elle ne voulait plus jamais me revoir
Tout était fini
J'ai appelé, mais ils avaient changé de numéro
J'ai écrit, le courrier m'a été retourné
Si je peux me permettre,
pourquoi la voir maintenant ?
Ce serait plus simple d'oublier.
Mais je n'y arrive pas
Cette guerre
Voir mes potes tués dans le désert
à 15000 km de chez nous
Mais la seule chose
dont je ne me souviens pas
Je m'étais juré de ne jamais l'oublier
Son visage
C'est tout ce qu'il me reste
Je peux mourir
Pendant l'opération ou maintenant
- Et si c'est le cas
- Tu n'en sais rien
Et si c'est le cas
Je ne veux pas fermer mes yeux
Sans avoir vu son visage
Elle est partie maintenant
Je ne la retrouverai jamais
Il existe beaucoup de méthodes
pour retrouver une personne
Si je t'aide, promets moi de te faire opérer
Pas de problème
Mais je ne vois pas
comment on va la retrouver
La maison est vide.
Ils ont déménagé.
Il ne reste que des bibelots
et de vieux magazines
Des vieux magazines ?
Bonjour, je suis Bridget Elkins
Comment je vais ?
Pas très bien à vrai dire
J'ai appelé 3 fois pour vous signaler
que je n'ai toujours rien reçu à ma nouvelle adresse
Juste pour vérifier
Pourriez-vous me confirmer que vous avez
ma nouvelle adresse ?
4963 Danson, c'est bien ça
Merci beaucoup
Vous n'avez aucune idée du nombre de personnes
qui se présentent sans CV
Mais si
Rien qu'avec ça vous êtes
un des candidats les plus sérieux
Vous n'avez pas inscrit d'expérience en immobilier
En fait, je n'en ai aucune.
Mais écoutez
La vente, je fais ça depuis mes 16 ans.
J'y ai appris une chose essentielle
Si on est à l'écoute du client
Peu importe le produit.
La vente est quasi assurée
Quelles sont vos qualités
qui pourraient faciliter votre intégration ?
De l'humour.
Beaucoup d'humour, Marjory
Mais sérieusement, la passion
La sincérité et bien sûr la persévérance
Ces qualités n'ont rien d'exceptionnel
Mais c'est ce dont votre entreprise a besoin
Nous y voilà
Monsieur Elkins gagne bien sa vie on dirait
- De quoi j'ai l'air ?
- Super
- Pas trop mal pour un homme mort
- Ne dis pas ça
Tu transpires
D'après ses symptômes: transpiration, souffle court
Il n'en a plus pour longtemps
Reste ici, je vais la chercher
- Dès que tu la vois, c'est retour hôpital
- Oui, juste une chose
Si c'est son père qui ouvre
ne parle pas de moi
Pourquoi ?
Bridget est intelligente, il veut la protéger
surtout de tomber amoureuse d'un soldat
On ne peut pas lui en vouloir
- Ton père apprécie tes petit-amis ?
- Il ne les a jamais rencontrés
Désolé, il est mort ?
C'est tout comme
- Bonjour
- Bonjour, Bridget est là ?
Pas en ce moment
- Vous savez où je peux la trouver ?
- Désolé, vous êtes ?
Une de ses amies, du lycée
- Vous ne me reconnaissez pas, Tru Davies
- Je ne me souviens pas
J'ai fait refaire mon nez et j'ai perdu 10 kilos.
Ne soyez pas embarrassé, je suis habituée
Ça y est, Tru !
Je m'en souviens
Entrez un instant
Qu'y a t-il d'urgent ?
Je ne suis là que quelques heures
Je devrais être en route pour l'aéroport
- Et si je ne vois pas Bridget
- Elle est à l'école tout l'après-midi
- Je lui dirai que vous êtes passée
- Ou je peux me rendre sur le campus
Elle sera de retour du lycée dans quelques heures
Le lycée ?
Avec ses qualités
elle aurait pu devenir médecin
Allez Jake, on retourne à l'hôpital
Qui êtes-vous ?
Vous avez amené Jake ?
- Il doit voir Bridget
- Sortez de chez moi
Ne vous approchez pas de ma fille
- Vas avec eux
- Je n'ai pas vu Bridget
Je sais où elle est, je vais la trouver
STP, retourne à...
Mon dieu
- Vite, ramenez le
- Allez on y va
Tu n'aurais pas du t'enfuir avec la jeep
Je vais la trouver
Je ne sais même pas
comment tu t'appelles
Tu n'es pas vraiment une infirmière
n'est ce pas ?
Qu'est ce qui te le fait penser ?
Tu es une sorte... d'ange
Je peux vous aider ?
Je cherche Bridget Elkins.
On m'a dit qu'elle était ici
Elle est partie il y a 5 minutes
Vous savez où elle est maintenant ?
Elle a des problèmes ?
C'est au sujet de sa grand-mère,
rien de grave. M. Elkins m'envoie la prévenir
Elle doit retrouver Philip après le cours
- Philip ?
- Ils sont bien connus sur le campus
- Elle doit être au Metzler Building, 212
- Merci
Merci Virginia.
Dis au revoir Philip
- Bridget ?
- Oui
- Vous avez un fils magnifique
- Merci
Tout comme son père
- Quoi ?
- Je suis une amie de Jake
- Il a besoin de vous voir tous les 2
- Quoi ?
- Il n'a pas donné de nouvelles depuis 1 an 1/2
- Il ne sera peut-être plus parmi nous demain
C'est trop d'un coup. Aucune nouvelle
pendant 18 mois, puis vous apparaissez
- Il n'est pas au courant pour Philip
- C'est une accusation ?
Non, pas du tout
J'ai su que j'étais enceinte
le jour il a embarqué
J'ai essayé de le contacter, sans succès,
je ne l'intéressais plus
Vous lui avez envoyé un télégramme
pour dire que tout était fini
Quoi ? Un télégramme, c'est n'importe quoi
C'est fini, je ne devrais pas être aussi énervée
Il veut vous voir avant l'opération
On peut y être en moins d'1h
J'ai perdu un être cher il y a 10 ans
Et si j'avais eu la possibilité
j'aurais aimé la voir une dernière fois
- Vous avez cette possibilité, Bridget
- Je suis désolée
Je ne peux pas, je l'ai perdu une fois
Je ne peux pas le perdre encore
Ange gardien ou espionne ?
A toi de choisir
J'étais dans le quartier
- Comment tu te sens ?
- Je me ferai opérer dès que je serai stable
Et après ça, l'avenir nous le dira
- Je suis vraiment désolée
- De quoi ?
J'étais censée t'aider, tu voulais la voir
et je n'ai pas réussi
Ne dis pas ça
- Tu as essayé
- J'ai échoué
Non tu n'as pas échoué
Pourquoi es-tu si dure avec toi-même ?
Je sais où elle habite
Elle continue ses études
Elle a l'air heureuse, en forme
J'en sais plus sur elle que
pendant ces 2 dernières années
Tu n'as pas à t'excuser
J'ai cru qu'il ne s'endormirait jamais
- Tu as faim ? Je peux...
- Non merci
Il s'est passé un truc étrange aujourd'hui.
Cette femme est venue
et a dit que Jake voulait me voir
Vraiment ?
Elle semblait convaincue que j'avais envoyé
un télégramme de rupture
Il y a beaucoup de personnes étranges.
Il ne faut pas les écouter
S'il te plaît,
dis moi qu'il ne venait pas de toi
- Chérie
- Dis moi que tu ne l'as pas signé de mon nom
Que tu ne l'as pas posté
- Écoute.
- Pas avant que tu me l'aies dit
Parce qu'il est malade
Il peut mourir
Tu avais le monde à tes pieds
Princeton, Stanford, tu peux aller
n'importe où
Mon dieu,
je le savais
- Tu t'es faite engrosser par un soldat.
- Je l'aimais
Et où cela t'a menée ?
Tu passes ton temps entre la garderie et le collège
Tu aurais pu être la meilleure.
Tu es censé m'aimer quoi qu'il advienne
Tu ne t'es jamais demandée
comment toute une vie pouvait basculer
sur un simple choix ?
- Tout le temps
- Si je n'avais pas rejoint l'armée
Tu n'aurais jamais été affecté ici.
Et tu n'aurais pas rencontré Bridget
Peut-être ça se serait passé ailleurs
J'irais au bureau tous les matins,
j'aurais une maison et des enfants
On aurait eu de beaux enfants
Jake, écoute
Je suis sûre que ça aurait été le cas
Excuse moi
- Viens me voir pour fêter ça
<i>- Je ne peux pas ce soir</i>
- Félicitations Harry
<i>- Je ne sais pas comment tu as su</i>
Mais, merci. Grâce à toi,
j'ai eu une proposition immédiate
<i>Super</i>.
Je suis contente pour toi
Et heureusement,
j'ai refusé l'offre
Qu'il aille se faire voir,
<i>il n'a qu'à m'aimer pour qui je suis</i>
<i>À plus</i>
Tu es venue
Mon Dieu, regarde-toi
Tu es
magnifique
Je veux te présenter quelqu'un
Tu as un fils ?
Nous avons un fils
Philip, dis bonjour à papa
Comment avons nous pu faire tout foirer ?
- Ne parle pas
- Sommes nous trop fiers ?
Trop stupides ?
On y va, caporal
Tout ce qui importe
c'est que je suis là maintenant
Quoiqu'il arrive,
je veux que tu aies une belle vie
Que tu te maries,
que Philip ait un père
Il a un père
Profite de la vie,
sois heureuse Bridget
- Promets moi
- Tout va bien se passer
Promet moi Bridget
Prenez soin de lui
C'est si long
- C'était risqué
- Quoi ?
Oh mon dieu
Désolée
- Je l'ai perdu
- Tu ne l'as pas perdu, Tru
Son heure était arrivée
Jake savait qu'il ne survivrait pas à l'opération
C'est pourquoi il a demandé ton aide
Mais, mon boulot c'est d'empêcher la mort
Sauver des gens. Tout ça
Et bien, peut être que Jake n'était pas
celui qui avait besoin d'être sauvé
Peut être que tu as sauvé
la bonne personne
Bridget
Tu l'as laissée faire ses adieux.
Hier elle n'aurait pas pu les faire
- Cette quête est parfois déroutante
- Je sais
Mais c'est pourquoi je suis là
La fin justifie les moyens
- Tu as réussi
- Tu doutais de moi ?
Non, jamais
- Ça va ?
- Mieux maintenant
Repose toi, je dois faire une chose
<i>Laissez un message après le signal</i>
Hey papa, c'est Tru
On ne s'est pas parlés depuis un moment.
Je veux que tu saches que je vais bien
J'ai un nouveau job.
Je crois qu'on peut dire
que j'aide des personnes
Parfois si j'ai de la chance,
elles m'aident aussi
C'est la raison de mon appel
Parce que je sais combien il est difficile
pour 2 personnes de se trouver
Surtout quand l'un des 2 ne veut pas être trouvé
Donc, bonne nuit papa
J'espère que tu es heureux
parce que moi je le suis
Et désormais, tu n'auras plus
besoin de me retrouver
Car je ne me sens plus perdue
Désolé
Longue journée
Tu m'en diras tant

Dossier Tru Calling - http://trucalling.free.fr
Et puis ils ont fait jouer un pigeon
Et à partir de là, j'ai tout raflé
C'était pas plus mal.
Parce que j'étais à sec
Je crois que je vais me faire piercer la poitrine
C'est génial, Harrison
Ya quelqu'un ?
Tu ne m'écoutes même pas
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Rien de bien intéressant, crois moi.
- Mais si ça m'intéresse
Je veux savoir
Mais qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Vous êtes cinglée ?
Vous n'avez pas vu la voiture
qui vous fonçait dessus ?
Vous m'avez harcelée toute la journée.
Vous m'espionnez ?
J'essayais juste de vous aider
Donnez moi vos coordonnées,
cela aidera certainement mon avocat
Mrs Johnson, ça peut vous paraître étrange,
mais je ne faisais que vous aider
Je n'ai pas besoin de votre aide
<i>Oui, je le veux</i>
Oui, je le veux
Entrez
Mais qu'est-ce que... ?
Épisode 1-09  <i>Murder in the morgue</i>
Mon dieu !
Mais tu es malade !
Il faut qu'on parle
- On en a déjà parlé.
- Pas suffisamment
Tu aurais dû te voir l'autre jour.
Comment les gens t'ont regardée
Je sauve des vies.
Peu importe les regards
Il y a quelque chose qui m'échappe.
Et je veux une vraie explication
Et pas d'histoires de jours qui recommencent
Tu sais comme moi que c'est impossible
Et là, tu mets ta vie en danger
pour des gens qui s'en tapent
et pour un truc qui n'existe même pas
Mince alors !
Vous avez vu le gars qui était assis là ?
Désolée
Qui peut être assez mesquin
pour laisser une ardoise de 7$ 32 cts ?
Écoute, on en a parlé plusieurs fois
et maintenant ça suffit
Apparemment, rien ne te convainc
Donc je te prouverai une fois pour toutes,
que je n'invente rien
Allez !
Avance !
Encore un chômeur qui se traîne
Bonjour.
Tu es en avance
En fait, je suis venue voir
si tu voulais manger un morceau avec moi,
ou juste te promener un peu.
Me promener ?
Avec toi ?
Oui
C'est juste
Que tu es le seul qui comprenne
Tout ce qui se passe dans ma vie
- Mon frère.
- Il n'y croit pas ?
Non
Il ne croit qu'aux jeux d'argent,
et est persuadé que 2PAC vit toujours
Mais il refuse d'admettre
ce que je lui ai dit
Alors ?
On fait un break ?
Un instant
Quoi ?
Mon dieu, j'arrive tout de suite
C'est ma soeur
Mince !
La balle !
- Tu n'as rien ?
- Moi ça va
- Mais ma voiture non.
- La voiture ce n'est pas grave. Fais voir
- Je peux y aller ?
- Encore un instant SVP
Du calme.
Dis moi ce qui s'est passé ?
J'avais un rendez-vous.
j'étais en retard
à cause des travaux sur l'autoroute.
Et ce mec a pilé en pleine ligne droite
Tu as besoin de quelque chose ?
J'appelle ton rendez-vous ?
C'est pas la peine,
je l'ai manqué de toute façon
- Ils comprendront ta situation au bureau.
- C'est ça
Il faut que je récupère mes affaires
avant qu'ils emmènent ma voiture
Reste-là.
Je m'en charge
Un rendez-vous, ça m'étonnerait
Merci
T'es sûre que tu avais un rendez-vous ?
C'était pas plutôt pour un échange ?
Oui, mais je ne le fais plus maintenant.
Je n'aime pas du tout ton insinuation sur la drogue
Désolée de t'avoir vexée.
Il ne faut pas avoir peur de demander de l'aide
Je n'ai pas peur de demander de l'aide.
Je t'ai appelée non ?
Ta soeur va bien ?
Peut-être.
En fait, j'en sais trop rien
Mon dieu !
C'est Nicole Simms.
Le tueur n'a pas été identifié
Le jour de son mariage
Heure du décès: entre 19h et 19h30
Elle aurait pu s'en sortir,
mais l'hémorragie n'a pas été stoppée à temps
L'ambulance était bloquée
à cause de travaux sur l'autoroute
Qui ferait une chose pareille ?
Je n'en sais rien.
Peut-être un détraqué
Ou quelqu'un voulait l'empêcher de se marier
Commence le rapport,
je vais préparer la radiographie
Vous désirez ?
Il neige.
C'est à peine croyable
De la neige.
Vous voulez vous sécher ?
Non merci.
En fait
Ma
Je pense qu'elle
On devait se marier aujourd'hui
Et je crois qu'ils l'ont amenée ici
En effet
Puis-je la voir un moment ?
Je n'ai pas pu
Je n'ai pas pu lui dire au revoir
Ce n'est peut être pas grand chose
Mais je sais ce que vous endurez
Mes sincères condoléances
Merci
Je peux
Je peux la voir ?
Oui
J'attends à côté
Nicole
Bonne nouvelle !
Mes beignets au fromage sont enfin là.
Je vais pouvoir...
Pourquoi n'as tu pas commencé le rapport ?
J'ai une autopsie à faire
Il faut que je retire la balle
pour l'enquête criminelle
Le fiancé de la victime est arrivé
- Il voulait juste lui dire au revoir.
- Où attend-il ? Je vais lui parler
En fait
Il est avec elle
Et que fais-tu du règlement ?
On ne peut pas faire une exception ?
Il n'y a aucun mal à...
Tant que l'affaire est en cours
Nous sommes responsables des corps
Et que fais-tu des vivants ?
Tu prends soin des morts
mais tu oublies ceux qui restent
Excusez-moi ?
Que faites-vous ?
Écoutez
Je peux tout expliquer
Appelle la sécurité, STP
- Non, personne ne bouge !
- Mon dieu
Écoutez
Ce n'est pas en blessant quelqu'un
que vous aurez ce que vous voulez
- Vous ne comprenez pas
- Expliquez moi !
Je comprends votre peine, mais restez calme
Davis, ne bouge pas !
Non !
Davis.
Mon dieu
Parle-moi, Davis !
Reste avec moi
Debout !
J'ai dit Debout !
- Vous avez interêt à ce qu'il s'en sorte.
- Je ne voulais pas tirer
Vous devez m'aider.
Tout de suite !
Jamais de la vie
C'est vraiment dommage
Aidez-moi
On s'est vus hier, tu sais ?
Il faut qu'on parle
Ça va ?
Je ne le sais pas encore
Je sais que tu ne me crois pas.
Mais sache que j'ai vécu ma pire journée hier
Je m'en doute bien puisque j'y étais
Voir sa soeur se jeter sur une passante
Je ne parle pas de ton hier, mais du mien
Ça n'a pas de sens.
Explique-moi tout clairement
Et pas d'histoires de jours qui recommencent
C'est quoi ?
Ton emploi du temps de la journée
11h20 repas. Prévoir 7$ 32cts
C'est quoi ce truc ?
S'il m'arrivait quelque chose,
j'aimerais que tu comprennes pourquoi
Le meilleur moyen de t'expliquer,
c'est de t'impliquer dans ce que je fais
Et comment je réussirai ?
Tu n'as qu'à suivre mes consignes
Et d'ici ce soir tu auras
toutes les réponses que tu cherches
Je suppose que c'est un jour spécial.
Vu que tu n'es pas de garde
et que tu es quand même ici
C'est un jour déjà vécu
De quoi il s'agit ?
Quoi ?
Ça fait plaisir de te voir
Content de te voir aussi
Je suis vraiment contente
de t'avoir à mes côtés
Tu te rappelles que je travaille ici quand même ?
Qui est Nicole Simms ?
Elle se marie aujourd'hui.
Enfin, c'est ce qui était prévu.
Elle a été tuée par balle.
Faute de secours rapide, elle n'a pas survécu
Tu penses pouvoir identifier le coupable ?
Cette fois je pense connaître le meurtrier.
C'est son fiancé
- Comment le sais-tu ?
- Je l'ai vu
Il est venu ici
À la morgue ?
Pourquoi faire ?
Il trafiquait son cadavre
Sûrement pour récupérer des preuves
Récupérer la balle avant la police, par exemple
Il était là quand elle t'a demandé de l'aide ?
J'y étais ? Bien sûr, je suis toujours là
Tu y étais
Pourquoi tu ne m'as rien dit ?
Je suis désolée Davis,
je dois y aller
Tu as raison.
Tu as quelqu'un à sauver
On peut dire ça
Et je devrais répondre quoi ?
Oui vas-y.
Je te fais confiance
Tu croyais que j'allais te prêter
ma voiture comme ça ?
Dans certaines communautés
l'entraide est bien vue
Et si tu avais un accident ?
Fini mon bonus d'assurance
Je te la rendrai d'ici ce soir
sans la moindre rayure, promis
J'aimerais te rendre service.
Mais j'ai un rendez-vous cet après-midi
et j'ai besoin de la voiture
<i>C'était un rendez-vous ou plutôt un échange ?</i>
Ce rendez-vous ne serait pas
en dehors du boulot par hasard ?
La conversation est terminée.
J'ai une réunion
Écoute, demain tu pourras avoir la voiture.
Appelle-moi, on s'arrangera
Demain ce sera trop tard
Pour chacune de nous
Si, tu voulais qu'il soit à ta table
Tu... attends un instant
- Bonjour
- Bonjour, je cherche Nicole
Et vous êtes ?
Tru Davies, une vieille amie
Maman, je te rappelle
Juste une question.
Vous allez au mariage ?
Et comment,
je serai au centre des débats
- Vous êtes le témoin ?
- En fait je suis le futur mari
- Vous épousez Nicole Simms ce soir ?
- C'est ce qui est prévu
<i>On devait se marier aujourd'hui</i>
- Mais bien sûr.
- Vous êtes venue pour le mariage ?
- Pourtant vous n'êtes pas sur la liste des invités.
- Je passais juste souhaiter mes voeux
Nicole est en manucure en ville avec ses amies
Je peux savoir où ?
C'est pour lui faire une surprise
C'est sur la 5ème
- Ça s'appelle <i>Hands-on</i>
- Merci
Vous pourrez lui dire qu'elle me manque ?
Cette tradition de ne pas voir
la mariée le jour des noces
Dites-lui que c'est une vraie torture pour moi
Il ne faut pas qu'elle chante
On ne peut pas l'en empêcher.
C'est ma belle-mère
Elle peut chanter,
mais quand elle ouvrira la bouche
Ça va faire fuir tout le monde
- Encore un dilemme.
- J'en ai marre
Le transparent est mieux.
Le blanc ça fait vieux jeu
Merci
Ça peut vous sembler anodin,
mais je vous suis reconnaissante
C'est le grand jour ?
Le jour le plus long en tout cas.
C'est excitant, mais épuisant
Je veux retrouver ma vie
de tous les jours
Bon courage.
Tu sais ce qu'on dit ?
Ce n'est jamais comme avant
J'aurais dû te bâillonner
<i>Quelqu'un voulait l'empêcher de se marier</i>
Une amie à moi m'a dit un jour:
Le plus dur dans le mariage
C'est de l'annoncer à son premier amour
Il a été plus rapide que moi.
Il s'est marié l'année dernière
Il n'y a aucun mec qui soit contre ce mariage ?
Justin.
Justin Burke
Voyons, Il s'en moque
Ça m'étonnerait fortement.
Je te rappelle qu'il a participé à la liste de mariage
Et il n'est même pas invité
C'est bon, j'ai compris
À partir de ce soir, un seul homme
sera au centre de mes préoccupations
11h20: repas.
Prévoir 7$ 32cts
Qui peut être assez mesquin
pour laisser une ardoise de 7$ 32 cts ?
Ça sera déduit de ma paye
- Elle s'est arrangée avec vous ?
- Pardon ?
Ma soeur
Vous lui direz qu'il en faut plus que ça
pour me convaincre
Quelle actrice vous faites.
Gardez la monnaie
Allo.
Pourriez-vous me rendre un service ?
On m'a chargée d'acheter un cadeau de mariage.
Je crois que je me suis trompée de destinataire
Si c'est le cas, mon patron n'appréciera pas.
Vous pourriez vérifier la liste pour moi ?
Merci.
C'est au nom de Justin Burke
Où sont mes... ?
- Steeve ! Avez-vous vu mes clés ?
- Non
Ne me dis pas que tu as osé
Appelez-moi un taxi
<i>Si c'est important, je suis dans le jardin</i>
Désolée de vous déranger
Je vous en prie
On s'en fout partout.
Je peux vous aider ?
En fait, je venais vous rendre service
J'ai emménagé à quelques encablures d'ici,
et on a les mêmes numéros de maison
Avant-hier, on m'a retourné un colis non délivré,
et je pense qu'il vous était destiné
Il était au nom de Justin Burke.
C'est mon copain.
C'est sa maison
- J'essaie de la rendre plus agréable à vivre.
- Il est ici ?
Il travaille, mais il devrait rentrer
pour déjeuner d'ici un instant
Et ce colis il venait d'où ?
Je crois que c'était une fabrique de porcelaine
Je sais pour qui c'est.
Son ex se marie bientôt
Ça le tracasse ?
Il fallait s'y attendre.
Depuis qu'il le sait, il a la tête ailleurs
Rien de grave
Quand on parle du loup
Pile à l'heure
Vous pourrez lui dire vous même
En fait, j'ai un rendez-vous.
Je dois vous laisser
Merci pour tout
C'était qui ?
Je ne sais pas trop.
Une histoire de livraison, je crois
Tout va bien ?
Oui.
Il faut que...
Quand tu auras fini,
il faut qu'on parle
D'accord
Et je suis partie.
Je ne savais pas quoi faire
Il a menti.
C'est son ex, pas son fiancé
Et il est policier
Maintenant que tu as trouvé la mariée.
Tu dois la convaincre d'annuler le mariage
Empècher le mariage n'arrangera rien.
C'est lui qu'il faut arrêter
Je ne sais pas si j'en suis capable
- Tu l'as déjà fait.
- J'ai échoué. Là je n'ai pas droit à l'erreur
Que s'est il réellement passé hier ?
- Je te l'ai dit.
- Non, tu t'acharnes à me cacher des choses
- Que veux-tu que je te dise ?
- La vérité
Je t'ai dit qu'il était venu
pour récupérer des preuves
Il essayait d'extraire la balle
Je ne t'ai pas dit qu'on l'a pris sur le fait
Et il a sorti un revolver
Ici même ?
Mon dieu, que s'est-il passé ?
Il m'a tiré dessus
Mais le jour à recommencé
juste avant que je...
Écoute, je n'ai rien à craindre,
mais tu ne dois pas rester ici
Quelqu'un t'a tiré dessus,
et c'est moi qui dois me protéger ?
Tu ne me dis pas tout
Il t'a tiré dessus
Il m'a tiré dessus
Et je suis mort ?
Je n'en sais rien
Si je comprends bien,
je pourrais mourir d'ici quelques heures
Davis.
Reprends-toi
Si tu restes ici,
ça pourrait se reproduire
- Va à mon appartement.
- Mais je vais bien
Si je ne peux rien faire,
laisse-moi au moins changer la donne
Prends-les et vas-y
Et toi ?
Tu sais bien,
je dois avertir la mariée
Je sais aussi que c'est à cause d'elle
que ce mec est venu ici armé
Tout ira bien
On se retrouve à mon appart
Merci
De quoi ?
Pour m'avoir dit la vérité
Ce sont des marguerites
Ce n'est pas ce que j'ai commandé
C'est trop tard pour changer ?
Elle est dans le couloir,
et elle hésite entre deux chansons
Elle voudrait chanter un morceau de chaque
Ça ira comme ça
- De pire en pire.
- Nicole, bonjour
- Je peux vous parler ?
- Je n'ai pas le temps
- Vous êtes la fille de
- la manucure
Je ne vous ai pas tout dit
Je connais votre ex, Justin
Il a toujours des sentiments pour vous
Et il est capable d'empêcher ce mariage
- Mais qu'est-ce qu'elle raconte ?
- J'en sais rien
Tu dis que tu connais Justin,
et bien c'est aussi mon cas
Et il ne ferait rien contre moi
Et je ne laisserai pas une inconnue
gâcher mon mariage
Ma famille s'en charge déjà
Vous trouverez la sortie,
ou vous avez besoin d'aide ?
J'ai compris
Si vous voulez que ce mariage ait lieu,
tenez Justin à l'écart
On va avoir besoin de mon aide.
<i>Apporte une balle de Baseball</i>
Bonjour
- Vous avez besoin d'aide, n'est-ce pas ?
- Non
Allez, on va traverser ensemble
Ne me touchez pas !
Et ça alors, j'en fais quoi ?
<i>La balle !</i>
Ça t'intéresse ?
Merci
Je t'en prie
Où étais-tu ?
J'attends depuis des heures et ce type
Je vais bien, calme toi
Et toi ?
Ça va
Quand tu dis que tu vas bien
c'est que...
Je mens
Tu ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé
après qu'il m'ait tiré dessus ?
Non
Il faut faire avec
et s'assurer que ça ne se reproduise pas
J'ai informé la victime.
Il me reste à intercepter Justin
Comment vas-tu t'y prendre ?
C'est le problème.
Il est policier et armé
A part l'assommer et l'attacher quelque part
je n'ai pas trop d'idées
J'en ai une
La vraie force c'est la connaissance
C'est tout ce que j'ai retenu de l'école
Et ça m'aide en quoi ?
Peut-être pas à l'assommer
mais certainement à le neutraliser
Le sulfate de zinc
Le sulfate de zinc ?
Ça va le faire vomir
Pendant un bon moment.
Bonne idée
Ce n'est pas que ça m'enchante
de te laisser seule avec lui
- Mais tu gagneras du temps.
- Et s'il est occupé, il ne pourra tuer personne
- Où est-ce que je peux en trouver ?
- J'ai un ami à l'hôpital
Donne moi ses coordonnées.
Je récupérerai la préparation
Sois prudente,
il a tiré sur 3 personnes hier
Ne t'en fais pas
Vous avez quelque chose pour moi ?
Ça dépend
Si j'ai poireauté pour rien
Mais...
C'est du racket
Je vous parle
Pauvre imbécile
Tu veux quelque chose ?
J'ai payé pour l'avoir
Tu l'auras le jour où tu auras compris
Nicole te cherche.
Elle veut te voir là avant le mariage
Nicole ?
Tu veux en parler ?
Justin
Nicole est en retard.
Elle m'a envoyée venir t'avertir
Et vous êtes qui ?
Une demoiselle d'honneur consciencieuse
On s'est déjà vus, non ?
Étant son amie et toi son ex,
on a certainement dû se croiser
C'est probable
Je suis étonné qu'elle veuille me voir.
Vous savez la raison de ce rendez-vous ?
À vrai dire,
je crois qu'elle est un peu inquiète
Au sujet de votre séparation un peu tendue
Et que vous voudriez régler des comptes,
ce soir
Vous plaisantez ?
Je n'ai fait que la remercier
Quand j'ai appris son mariage,
j'ai enfin pu voir la vérité en face
Comment ça ?
Si elle est prête à s'engager avec lui,
c'est qu'elle l'aime vraiment
J'espère connaître la même chose
Il fait un peu chaud. Vous pouvez accrocher ma veste ?
- Bien sûr
Vous ne portez pas votre arme ?
- Vous êtes policier, non ?
- Je ne suis pas en service
Vous ne portez jamais votre arme
en dehors du service ?
Non.
Certains le font
Mais pas moi.
C'est pas mon genre
- Ce n'était pas vous.
- Pardon ?
Vous savez quoi?
je dois y aller
- Désolée.
- Ce n'est rien
Nicole vient toujours ?
Oui, elle va arriver
J'ai laissé Justin à 19h53.
<i>Il n'avait pas son arme sur lui</i>
Ce n'est pas lui qui a tué Nicole
Quelqu'un d'autre a tiré, mais qui ?
- Alors pourquoi récupérer la balle à la morgue ?
<i>- Je ne sais pas</i>
Si j'arrive à temps,
il n'aura pas à le faire
Mon dieu, Nicole !
Au secours !
Que s'est-il passé ?
Quand je suis rentrée, elle était déjà au sol
- Que faites-vous ?
- Je suis ici pour aider
Elle est encore en vie
Appelez les urgences !
- Vous avez vu quelque chose ?
- Non
C'est encore tôt.
Tous les invités ne sont pas arrivés
Mon dieu !
- Nicole !
- L'ambulance ne va pas tarder
L'ambulance était bloquée à cause de travaux.
L'hémorragie n'a pas été stoppée à temps
L'ambulance ne sera pas là à temps.
Il faut l'emmener
Ne la touchez pas.
Personne ne la touche
Et la police ?
Personne ne les a appelés ?
Donnez moi un téléphone
Écoutez !
Je vous dis qu'il y a des travaux sur la route
Personne ne sera là à temps.
Si on ne l'emmène pas, elle mourra
On n'a pas de temps à perdre !
Aidez moi à la transporter
les voitures sont bloquées à l'entrée
- Pas la mienne.
- Et ses parents ?
Si la famille a besoin,
ils pourront me trouver à l'hôpital
En train de sauver leur fille
Tiens bon !
On va y arriver !
Bon sang !
<i>Je n'ai rien pu faire</i>.
Elle est mal en point
- Je ne sais pas si elle s'en sortira.
- Tu es loin de l'hôpital ?
Trop loin
- Qui est à la morgue ?
- Tu n'es pas sérieuse ?
Il doit y avoir quelqu'un qui peut l'aider.
Je suis juste à coté
- C'est peut-être sa seule chance.
- Je te rejoins
Non.
Je t'ai tenu à l'écart jusqu'ici.
Je ne vais pas te laisser te faire tuer
- C'était hier.
- Aujourd'hui c'est hier !
<i>bye</i>
Et merde !
A l'aide !
Gardez !
Ya personne ?
Je t'ai dit de ne pas venir
Tu as dit apprécier mon aide.
Alors laisse moi faire
Ou au moins laisse-moi l'aider
- Verrouille toutes les portes.
- On a intérêt à faire vite
- C'est quoi ça ?
- Du sang ?
Non, ce n'est pas ça
- Du pollen de lis.
- Du bouquet ?
C'était des marguerites pour le bouquet
Comment c'est arrivé sur sa robe ?
Ça colle partout.
Vous désirez ?
Justin a laissé son arme chez lui.
Seule sa copine y a accès
Le mobile était bon mais pas le coupable
C'était très instructif
d'apprendre que tu me quittais
le jour des noces de Nicole
Ça n'a rien à voir avec elle.
C'est comme ça
Désormais, elle n'a plus rien à y voir
Qu'est-ce que tu fais avec ça ?
Je l'ai tuée
Nicole ?
C'est fou comme son nom
revient sans arrêt sur tes lèvres
- Pourquoi ferais-tu ça ?
- C'était si facile pour toi
De mettre un terme à tout ça
- Aly, il ne fallait pas.
- La tuer ?
Je n'ai rien fait Justin, c'est toi
Mon dieu
Elle doit être à la morgue en ce moment
Je n'ai rien fait
C'est ma parole contre la tienne
C'est ton arme, ta balle, ton mobile
Les preuves sont là
Quoi qu'il se passe,
quelqu'un les trouvera
- Où en est-elle ?
- Le pouls est léger
Prête ?
- Je t'assiste.
- Non, non
- C'est toi qui opère.
- Quoi ?
- Tu es médecin.
- Je sais
Je n'y arrive pas sur des corps vivants.
Ça me bloque
- Tu plaisantes ?
- Pourquoi tu crois que je bosse ici ?
Tout ira bien,
je te guiderai
Tu peux le faire.
Tu en es capable
Je serai ici à tes cotés
Plutôt là, en fait
Par quoi on commence ?
Il faut dégager l'entrée de la blessure.
Tu peux le faire ?
Je pense
Doucement.
Les éclats ont pu engendrer une infection
Comment est l'hémorragie interne ?
Assez importante
Il faut réduire les pertes sanguines
en pinçant les veines touchées
Pas celui-là,
celui de gauche
Bon, ça à l'air de fonctionner.
Maintenant ?
Davis, sauve-toi tout de suite
Je ne laisserai pas Nicole mourir
Qui es-tu ?
Tu disais être une amie de Nicole
J'ai menti
Écoutez, je suis venu lui dire adieu
Tu es venu chercher la balle
Elle est toujours en vie ?
- On sait que tu n'as pas tiré.
- Mais vous pouvez le prouver ?
Parce que la balle vient de mon arme
Tout le monde sait que je l'aime toujours.
Et il n'y aura aucun témoin pour m'aider
Il me faut cette preuve,
cette balle qui est en elle
Si tu bouges, il te tuera
Il y a un témoin.
Elle est sur cette table
Elle seule peut témoigner qu'Alyssa est coupable
On peut la sauver, et donc te disculper,
mais laisse-nous faire
Tu as le choix
Quelle voie veux-tu emprunter ?
Bon, ensuite, je fais quoi ?
- Il faut s'assurer qu'elle respire bien.
- C'est bon
Ses poumons ont l'air ok
Comment était ta journée ?
Pour être franc,
tu t'es bien débrouillée
Le coup de la serveuse,
le petit avec sa balle
C'était très malin
Désolé.
Tu as perdu
Mais pour la neige, c'est râpé
Fais voir ta montre
Tu avances de 2 minutes
Et ?
Regarde dehors
Incroyable
Je pensais que tu blaguais
Avec la vieille sur la route
Mais là, ya pas moyen de tricher
Je ne comprends pas
C'est incompréhensible
Mais désormais, je te crois
C'est ce que je voulais
Tu ne peux pas t'imaginer
combien c'est important pour moi
Merci
Merci à toi
Tu sais ce que ça veut dire pour moi ?
Tu es une déesse
Comme un ange-gardien infaillible
- Ce n'est pas le but.
- C'est comme être invincible
Tu peux écarter tous ceux
qui me créeront des ennuis
- Ce n'est pas ça.
- Un instant
Comment ça va ?
Bien sûr que j'ai ton pognon
<i>Pour être franc</i>
Ce soir ça va pas être possible
Non, c'est moi qui t'appellerai
Tu dois de l'argent
Oui, mais ya pas le feu
Je lui rendrai
Tu ne peux pas agir de la sorte.
Si tu ne paies pas
Je ne serai pas toujours là pour t'aider
Mais si
Tu es ma soeur
Justin s'est rendu
Ils ont arrêté sa copine
après son témoignage
Et Nicole ?
Elle est à l'hôpital.
Son état est stable
Ses parents ont appelé.
Ils voulaient remercier le médecin
C'est gentil
Ils parlaient de toi
Sans toi elle n'aurait pas survécu
Et moi non plus
C'est drôle quand même
C'est la 2ème fois qu'on me sauve la vie
Ah bon ?
Que s'était-il passé ?
Désolée
- C'est moi.
<i>- Meredith tout va bien ?</i>
Aide-moi
Ne bouge pas, j'arrive
C'est ma soeur
Vas-y, la journée à été longue
On en discutera une autre fois

Lycée de Groverland
5 ans plus tôt
- Salut Tru
- Ronnie
- C'est bientôt le bal de fin d'année
- Vraiment ?
Oui, et je voulais...
Ronnie, si tu as quelque chose à me demander,
n'hésite pas
Candace, pas maintenant
Je t'appelle plus tard, d'accord ?
Désolée mais ça ne peut pas attendre.
Ronnie essaye de te dire qu'il veut aller au bal...
- Avec moi
 - Quoi ?
Candace, comment peux-tu ?
Tu es ma meilleure amie
On va quitter le lycée
et notre amitié ne durera pas
Donc pourquoi je laisserais notre amitié
m'empêcher d'avoir ce que je veux ?
Ne le prends pas mal
C'est la vie
À plus
Dieu merci
<i>Lycée Grover Cleveland:
 Réunion des anciens - 5 Ans</i>
Nuit blanche ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Réunion des anciens, tu vas y aller ?
Retourner au lycée ?
Certainement
pas
Ep. 1-10 - <i>Reunion</i>
Je n'y crois pas, combien de fois tu vas répéter
que tu ne viens pas à la soirée ?
Ça va être sympa.
Pour la dernière fois,
tu viendras même si je dois t'y traîner de force
Tu peux essayer,
mais attention, elle est têtue
Allez, moi j'y vais
- Tu n'étais même pas dans notre classe
- J'y étais 2 ans après, et je suis le cavalier de Lindsay
Bien, vas-y, amuse-toi bien
et tu me raconteras tout demain
- Elle va bien ?
- Je verrai bien
Juste par curiosité,
Tu avais des amis dans notre classe ?
Pas il y a 5 ans, mais maintenant
je t'ai toi
- J'ai loupé quelque chose ?
- Je ne veux pas aller à cette réunion, c'est tout
- Mauvais souvenirs ?
- Du bon et du moins bon
Je n'ai pas envie de revivre ça, c'est tout
Écoute, je ne te connaissais pas à l'époque
Je ne suis même pas sûr de te connaître maintenant
Mais tu peux être fière, tu as de vrais amis
un boulot sympa et un peu morbide
- L'école de médecine n'est plus très loin.
- Je sais
Et en plus, tu as un nouveau petit-ami sympa
que tu peux présenter à tout le monde
- Vraiment ?
- Ouais
Je suis contente que tu aies changé d'avis
- Ok, t'en penses quoi ? Trop décolleté ?
- Qu'est-ce tu racontes, pas du tout.
Tu devrais porter ce pantalon que tu as
acheté en ville
C'est clair
Meredith me l'a emprunté il y a 2 mois
puis m'a laissé le ticket du pressing
- Comment va t-elle au fait ?
- La désintox se passe bien, encore quelques semaines
Bien, ne t'inquiète pas pour ce soir
Je vais arranger ça
Ici, Commence avec ça
On va bâtir autour
Tu te souviens de Craig Burke ?
Gardien de but, super canon.
bien sûr
- J'avais un béguin énorme pour lui
- Ouais, tu lui as laissé un message
lui expliquant tous mes sentiments
Je l'ai mis dans son casier et j'ai attendu
- Et qu'est-ce qu'il a fait ?
- Rien, il ne m'a jamais répondu
Mon dieu, j'y pense sans arrêt
Tu penses qu'il sera là ce soir ?
Un seul moyen de savoir
Oh mon dieu, de retour au lycée
Juste pour quelques heures
Respire et sois forte
- Allons grignoter un peu
- On se voit plus tard, respire !
Billy ?
Salut
Belle cravate!
Elle très bien cotée chez les antiquaires
- Qui est-ce ?
- Candace Aimes
- Tu la connais ?
- C'était ma meilleure amie
- Tru Davis, c'est moi
- Billy, Billy Lamber
Je ne t'avais pas reconnu
tellement tu as changé en mieux
- Tu étais déjà bien à l'époque du lycée
- Tu parles, j'étais un raté
- Mais ce n'est plus le cas
- Qu'est-ce que tu deviens ?
J'ai créé un logiciel qui va révolutionner
le téléchargement de musique
C'est super, on se voit à l'intérieur
- Salut Tru
- Salut
Ça se passe bien ?
Tu ne regrettes pas d'être venue ?
Mon dieu, c'est toi
Judy, Judy Rogers
Bien sûr, Judy, comment oublier ?
Voici mon petit-ami
Tout le monde est ici.
C'est comme si on ne s'était jamais quittés
Ces réunions permettent de savoir ce que
chacun est devenu, même si on ne sait pas tout
- Comme Larry Cafperk, il est accro aux calmants
- Judy était
Et Kenny Lewdis, il est homo.
Et à propos de Savitsky ?
- il a renvoyé son propre père
- Judy était
- Et Julian Kay, elle a une nouvelle poitrine.
- Judy dirigeait l'équipe de natation
Il est adorable, tu es au courant
pour Ronnie Clifton et Candace ?
Il dit que ce n'est qu'une emmerdeuse
de bal de fin d'année
Je dirigeais l'équipe de natation
vu qu'elle ne savait pas nager
Ça m'a fait plaisir mais
je dois retrouver quelqu'un
- Super
- Ravi de t'avoir rencontrée
Craig
- Leonard Carpenter, on peut discuter ?
- Plus tard sans problème
- Craig Burke, salut
- Salut
Ça va te paraître bizarre mais
lors de notre dernière année de lycée
j'ai laissé un mot dans ton casier
J'y décrivais mes sentiments pour toi en détail
des détails embarrassants
Je n'ai jamais eu de réponse
et je me demandais...
Je n'ai jamais trouvé de mot
Comment tu t'appelles déjà ?
Désolé
Comment ça va mec ?
- Votez pour la reine de cette soirée
- Bien sûr
Je vais mettre Lindsay
Merci
C'est quoi l'histoire avec ce Ronnie ?
Coup de foudre du lycée,
tu peux lui demander directement
C'est lui là-bas
Tu sais quoi ?
Je vais te chercher à boire
- Tru
- Salut Ronnie, le temps passe vite
La dernière fois que je t'ai vu
c'était juste avant le bal du lycée
C'est un peu tard
mais je te dois des excuses
Je ne voulais pas te blesser
Candace a eu ce qu'elle voulait.
Comme toujours
- Et ça continuera.
- Ça n'a pas l'air de te plaire
Non, je vais très bien
Ça ne pourrait pas aller mieux
C'était sympa de te revoir Ronnie
A un de ces jours, Tru
- Tu cherches quelqu'un ?
- Non, personne
- Allons danser alors
- Non merci, ce n'est pas trop mon genre
Ok, tu veux boire quelque chose ?
Allo, Harrison, ici la terre
- Tu veux faire quoi ?
- Je reviens
- Qui est-ce ?
- Mr Connor
Mon professeur préféré,
il m'avait vraiment comprise
Il m'a énormément influencée
- Donc va lui parler
- Ce n'est pas si facile
- Candace est avec lui
- Il est temps d'oublier le passé
Mr Connor, bonjour
Tru Davies, je suis content que tu sois venue
Tu as l'air en forme
- Tu as du courage de sortir habillée comme ça
- Merci
C'est ton petit-ami ?
On vous laisse l'occasion
de vous rappeler le bon vieux temps
C'est la moindre des choses.
Viens, je t'offre un verre
Comment évoluent les choses ?
Vous vouliez écrire un best seller
Ça se passe très bien
Je travaille sur quelque chose de terrible
Super, c'est super
Toujours cette histoire à Candace
Rien n'a changé au cours de ces 5 ans
- Je peux en prendre une
- Bien sur
- Keith Morgan
- Un problème mec ?
- Tu ne te souviens pas de moi, n'est-ce pas ?
- Effectivement
- Je vais te rafraîchir la mémoire
- D'accord
Bonjour, je peux avoir votre attention svp ?
Les votes sont clos, et voici notre reine
<i>5 ans après</i> de la promo 1999
Ce soir, notre reine est... Candace Aimes
Craig n'a jamais eu mon mot.
Il ne sait même pas qui je suis
Ouille
C'est toi qui voulait
faire resurgir les souvenirs du lycée
Vous y croyez, moi non.
C'est comme un cauchemar
Merci beaucoup, c'est une surprise
Enfin, pas vraiment.
En tout cas, c'est sympa
de tous se retrouver ici
- Même si on ne se souvient pas de tout le monde
- <i>Je t'ai déjà dit que je ne savais pas qui tu es</i>
Harrison, mon dieu, ça va ?
- J'ai attendu des années pour cogner ce connard
- Tu es ce gamin que je m'amusais à malmener
Tu es venu pour te venger d'une stupide
histoire de lycée ?
- En fait non, je suis venu pour toi
- Tu es impossible Harrison
- Tu vas bien ?
- Ouais, super
On dirait que tu penses beaucoup à Candace
Si vous étiez si bonnes amies, il est temps d'aller lui
parler et de mettre les choses au clair
- Vous avez aperçu Candace ?
- Elle allait vers la piscine il me semble
Candace, tu es là ?
Ho, non
- Oh mon dieu, Candace
- Sauve moi
Nuit blanche ?
Réunion de lycée, super
Tu vas y aller ?
Oui, encore une fois
- Encore ? donc ça veut dire que...
- La journée se répète
- Qui est la victime cette fois ?
- Candace Aimes, camarade de lycée
- Une de tes amies ?
- C'est compliqué
Je doute qu'elle apprécie mon aide.
Elle s'est noyée à la soirée
- Noyée
Ses poumons étaient remplis d'eau ?
Le jour s'est répété trop vite,
je n'ai aucun indice
Et de la mousse ?
La noyade est caractérisée par la présence
d'écume dans les voies respiratoires
Quand le corps convulse
il y a formation d'écume dans la gorge
- Non, aucune trace
- Tu as un meurtre à résoudre
Quelqu'un l'aurait tuée avant puis jetée à l'eau
pour faire croire à une noyade ?
C'est une théorie
Je dois y aller mais j'aurai peut-être
besoin de toi ce soir
- <i>Je suis ravie</i> que tu viennes
- Je ne voulais pas rater ça
Allons-y toutes les 2 uniquement
Tu ne voulais pas venir ?
à une réunion de lycée ? Je survivrai
- Moi j'y vais
- Tu n'étais pas dans notre classe Harry
- Je lui ai promis
- Mais tu t'amuseras 2 fois plus sans lui
- Tu comprends, vas voir un film ou...
- Je voulais vraiment venir
Arrête de pleurnicher.
Le lycée c'est nul
Je peux te parler un instant ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- C'est ma grande soirée avec Lindsay
- Menteur, tu veux juste te battre avec Keith Morgan
Quoi, de quoi tu parles ?
- On est déjà allés à la soirée, n'est-ce pas ?
- Considère ça comme un avertissement
- Tu sais à quel point tes pouvoirs sont chiants ?
- Il n'y a pas de quoi
Quelle surprise.
Qu'est-ce que tu...
- Comment sais-tu où j'habite ?
- Tu es dans la liste des organisateurs
Elle n'a pas encore été diffusée, mais je suis
dans le comité et je dois tout mettre en place
- Bel immeuble
- C'est correct, pour le moment
Qu'est-ce qui t'amène ?
Tu te rappelles notre amitié ?
Des retrouvailles et tout le monde devient mielleux
Tu t'en souviens, on séchait des cours ensemble
On passait des heures au téléphone
J'ai tiré un trait sur le passé
Parce que les choses vont très bien pour moi
et ça va encore s'améliorer
- Vraiment ? Comment ?
- J'ai écrit un roman <i>High School Confidential</i>
Ça parle de la vie au lycée,
personne ne l'a encore lu
mais ce sera meilleur que
<i>Moins que zéro</i> de Bret Easton Ellis
Super, je suis heureuse pour toi
donc ne le prends pas mal mais...
Tu ne peux pas aller à la soirée ce soir
Je vois
Tu es toujours jalouse
C'est pour ça que tu es là ?
Pour m'écarter pour que je ne t'éclipse pas
encore
Non, ça peut juste mal tourner
Qui sait ce qui peut arriver
Je sais exactement ce qu'il va se passer
- Tu viendras avec Linda ou Lindey
- Lindsay
Tu porteras...
quelque chose qu'elle aura choisi pour toi
Une robe noire d'il y a 2 ans
et un haut avec du strass
Merci d'être passée
C'était sympa de discuter avec toi
Mais je ne manquerai pour rien au monde
cette soirée
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Tu sembles tendue, c'est cette soirée ?
Je ne cesse de penser à Candace Aimes
Tu penses que quelqu'un lui en veut toujours ?
Question étrange, laisse moi réfléchir
Je sais, toute la promo
Non, pas du lycée, aujourd'hui
Qui pourrait lui en vouloir ?
- Ronnie Clifton lui en veut peut-être
- Pourquoi ? Qu'est-ce qu'elle lui a fait ?
Tu n'es pas au courant ?
Après qu'elle te l'ait volé, ils se sont fiancés
et elle l'a quitté devant l'autel, lui brisant le coeur
- Vraiment ?
- Personne ne te l'a dit parce que...
Enfin, mon pantalon
- Bonjour j'ai une livraison pour...
- Billy
Je ne t'ai pas revue depuis 5 ans
- C'est pour toi ?
- Oui, sous le nom de ma soeur
- 8 dollars. Tu viens à la soirée ce soir ?
- Je ne voudrais pas manquer ça
Tu sais ce que j'aime dans ces retrouvailles ?
Tout le monde essaye de bien se faire valoir
A ce soir Tru
<i>Billy ?, salut</i>
Belle cravate.
Elle doit être cotée chez les antiquaires
Elle m'a toujours vu comme un raté
Je ne devrais pas te dire ça...
Mais j'ai créé un logiciel qui va révolutionner
le téléchargement de musique
- Tru
- <i>Salut Billy</i>
- Oh mon dieu, c'est toi
- Salut Judy
Tout le monde est ici comme si
on ne s'était jamais quittés
- Tu as vu Larry Cafperk ?
- Le Larry accro aux calmants ? Oui
- Et Kenny Lewdis.
- Homo
- Et Steeve Savitsky.
- Il a renvoyé son père
- Et concernant...
- Julian Kay et sa chirurgie plastique
Tu savais que Candace Aimes ne savait pas nager ?
C'était super de discuter avec toi Judy
- Ronnie, salut
- Tru
- Tu as l'air en forme
- Merci
- C'est bizarre de se retrouver ici
- Ouais, sans blague
Ça ne te gène pas de voir Candace à nouveau ?
- Ça n'a pas marché. Restons-en là
- Elle t'a vraiment blessé
Ça semblerait normal de vouloir se venger
Je reconnais que c'était difficile
mais c'est de l'histoire ancienne maintenant
Elle t'a vraiment brisé le coeur
J'ai brisé le tien
et tu ne veux pas te venger
Craig ? Je suis Tru Davies
- Ma meilleure amie Lindsay est géniale
- Super
Tu ne la connais pas mais elle a mis un mot que
tu n'as jamais vu dans ton casier au lycée
Mais STP, si elle vient te voir ce soir
soit sympa avec elle
- Tu peux faire ça pour moi ?
- Je crois que c'est possible
Tru, tu as une minute ?
Je veux que tu saches que je ne suis pas
qu'un looser qui travaille au pressing
- Je n'ai rien dit
- J'aurais bien fait ce que j'ai dit mais...
J'avais le financement
et puis le gars s'est désisté à la dernière minute
- Et plus de capital
- Désolée, il a dû faire une grosse erreur
Tu sais qui est-ce gars ?
Le père de Candace
- Vraiment ?
- Ouais, génial hein ?
Une bière SVP
- Je ne pensais pas que tu viendrais.
- J'avais rien d'autre à faire
- Grace à ma soeur.
- Tu veux vraiment aller à la soirée ?
- Tu veux savoir pourquoi ?
- Lindsay
Non
Keith Morgan
Ce gars m'a torturé.
D'abord des petites taquineries
Et puis c'est devenu des coups réguliers
Et il est de retour en ville
- Donc tu veux y aller pour...
- En 2 syllabes: re-vanche
- Mais j'ai compris que...
- Je peux vous interrompre ?
Tru Davies, quelle surprise
Salut Tru, contente de te voir
Tu es venue seule, pas de copain ?
Élégante tenue
Je ne m'attendais pas à ça
- Je peux te parler un instant ?
- De quoi ? De ta jalousie ?
Elle m'a demandé de ne pas venir mais
elle peut souffler, le lycée est terminé
Regarde, c'est Larry Whitesman.
Je dois lui dire que son surpoids lui va à ravir
- Ne la laisse pas te manipuler
- Ce n'est pas le cas
Alors pourquoi tu ne la quittes pas du regard ?
Une danse avec ton ancien prof ?
C'est peut-être Candace ou le fait d'être ici,
mais quelque chose te tracasse
Tu es diplômée mais mon bureau
est toujours ouvert
J'apprécie Mr Connor
- Quelque chose ne va pas ?
- Non, ça ira si je m'en charge
Candace, tu es là ?
Attention !
- Terrible, ça se vendra très cher
- J'ai attendu 5 ans pour ça
Vas-y, prends-en une de là !
- Tru, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Elle ne sait pas nager
- Vous auriez pu la tuer
- C'était juste une farce
On pensait que tu détestais Candace
plus que personne
Ça va ? Tu as avalé un peu d'eau
mais ça devrait aller
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ?
- Rien Curtis, enfin Mr Connor
- On s'amuse c'est tout
- Très intelligent les gars
Rigolez bien tous les 2
Ils m'ont dit de les rejoindre ici
Vous rirez moins
quand je vous traînerai en justice
- Vous en êtes témoins
- Candace, tu vas bien ?
Laisse-moi
Ce n'est pas comme si
tu m'avais sauvé la vie
Retournez à l'intérieur
Maintenant !
Tu peux utiliser les séchoirs
C'est trop tôt
- Morgue
- <i>Davis, c'est moi</i>
Tout se passe bien ? Personne de mort ?
La bonne nouvelle, c'est que j'ai sauvé
Candace de la noyade
- Et la mauvaise ?
- <i>C'était juste une farce</i>
<i>Elle est toujours en danger</i>
et le meurtre est toujours prévu
C'est peut-être cette farce qui avait tué Candace
C'est impossible, l'heure n'est pas bonne
Je l'avais trouvée à 22h
<i>Quelque chose a dû changer</i>
Qu'as tu fait de différent ce soir ?
Luc.
Candace lui parlait hier
Elle ne pouvait pas aller à la piscine
Mais il n'est pas là ce soir
Donc tes actions peuvent
changer les évènements
Hier, tu l'as sauvée d'une humiliation
<i>Ce soir, tu dois empêcher un meurtre</i>
Malheureusement,
on n'est pas plus avancés pour les suspects
<i>On dirait bien.</i>Je te rappellerai sûrement.
Ce n'est pas terminé
Je n'étais qu'un môme, bon sang !
Mais il m'en a fait baver
Pendant des années
Depuis la seconde, j'attends ma vengeance
Ça devait être le grand soir mais non...
- Ma soeur a convaincu Lindsay de ne pas m'emmener
- Elle avait sûrement de bonnes raisons
- Mais Tru a toujours raison...
- Quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Tu sais, elle veut toujours me protéger
Dommage qu'on ne puisse pas se pointer là-bas
pour tout résoudre
Allons-y
Craig
- Leonard Carpenter, on peut discuter
- Plus tard sans problème
- Craig Burke, salut
- Salut Lindsay
Tu t'en souviens
Ça va te paraître bizarre
mais j'ai laissé un mot dans ton casier
quand j'étais en dernière année
Je ne l'ai jamais eu
Mais si j'avais eu un mot de ta part
une fille si charmante
- J'aurais été touché
- C'est vrai ?
Certainement, et j'aurais fait
quelque chose pour te répondre
Qui sait où ça nous aurait menés
- Mais comme tu le vois, je suis marié
- Félicitations, c'est super
Oui, c'est vrai.
C'était sympa de se revoir
Je suis heureuse de t'avoir revu
- Tout le monde te cherche, je leur ai raconté
- Raconté quoi ?
<i>Votez pour la reine de la soirée</i>
Non merci
De ton sauvetage de Candace
J'aurais aimé avoir ces photos.
Je n'ai pas le temps, je dois y aller.
C'est très important
On tombe mal ?
Je sais que tu étais impatiente de nous voir
Il ne manquait plus que ça
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je croyais que tu ne venais pas
C'était le cas, mais j'ai plusieurs
choses à régler
Désolé pour la surprise, ça semblait
une bonne idée il y a 1/2h
- Non, ça ira
- Tu es sûre ?
Oui c'est une soirée plutôt terrible
- Terrible en bien ou en mal ?
- Je ne sais pas encore
Dis-le moi quand tu le sauras
Je serai au bar, veste marron
Tu sais ce que je pense de Candace ?
- Ce n'est pas le bon moment
- Tu aurais dû la laisser se noyer
Quoi, tu plaisantes ?
C'est pas juste, Tout le monde dit
que Candace a tout
Des copains, de l'argent, la popularité
mais elle n'a rien de tout ça
Elle les a volés aux autres
- De quoi tu parles ?
- Elle a volé à des gens comme moi
J'aurais du être reine de promo à sa place.
Elle n'a que ce qu'elle mérite
- Allons prendre l'air, dehors
- Pourquoi ?
Je peux avoir votre attention svp ?
Les votes sont clos, et voici notre reine
<i>5 ans après</i> de la promo 1999
Il s'agit de...
Tru Davies
Je ne peux pas
- Vous ne comprenez pas
- Ne sois pas timide
Un petit discours ?
Désolée, je dois y aller
- Mr Connor
- Tru, je corrigeais des copies
- Pourquoi tu n'es pas avec les autres ?
- J'ai besoin de votre aide
- Quel est le problème ?
- Je n'ai pas le temps de vous expliquer
Candace est en danger
Je crois que Judy en a après elle
Ce genre de soirée peut amener
à des comportements bizarres mais pas la violence
Je pense comme vous
mais ce soir, il faut que vous me croyiez
J'y crois si tu y crois
En quoi je peux t'aider ?
- Vous avez vu Candace ou Judy ?
- Non mais...
Faites moi une faveur, on se sépare
et vous m'aidez à les retrouver
- Ne me demandez pas pourquoi
- Ça fait 2 faveurs
- Ce n'est pas juste
- Où est Candace ?
J'ai dit: ce n'est pas juste
- Tu me fais peur maintenant
- Je ne peux plus le supporter
C'est le retour au lycée sans fin
Rien ne change
D'abord, elle est reine du lycée
et maintenant toi
Ce n'est jamais moi
Pourquoi Candace gagne toujours
et moi c'est le contraire ?
Les choses changent. Aide-moi
Je dois trouver Candace
Pourquoi est-elle si importante ?
Pour toi et Mr Connor
Je suis importante aussi
- Que viens faire Mr Connor dans l'histoire ?
- Je viens de la voir avec lui
- Tu les a vus ensemble ?
- Oui, il y a 2 minutes
<i>High School Confidential</i>
Par Candace Aimes
J'écris un roman
Ça s'appelle <i>High School Confidential</i>
<i>High School Confidential<i/>
Par Curtis Connor
Tu es sûre que personne d'autre
n'a vu ton roman ?
Je vous l'ai déjà dit
- Pourquoi toujours cette question ?
- Juste pour être sûr
Vous m'avez dit que ce n'était pas bon,
qu'il y avait encore du boulot
Pourquoi l'aurais-je montré à d'autres ?
Je le pensais bien abouti avant que vous ne le lisiez
Pourquoi m'avoir amenée ici ?
C'est glauque
J'ai essayé d'écrire un roman sans succès
pendant des années
En regardant des étudiants être diplômés
avancer dans la vie
- Je pensais que vous seriez fier de moi
- Oh oui
Un essai et tu écris ce que
je n'ai jamais réussi à écrire
Je connais mes limites
Le seul moyen pour moi de réussir
est de faire de ton roman le mien
C'est impossible
Personne ne l'a lu
Personne ne saura
Oh mon dieu
Personne ne sait.
Le seul moyen de me voler mon roman
Je suis désolé Candace
- Tru, qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
- Je cherchais Candace
Pour lui dire à quel point j'ai adoré son livre
Le seul moyen que ça marche
c'est que personne ne l'ait vu
Vous avez le choix
Tuer Candace et voler son livre
Mais il faudra me tuer aussi
Vous ne direz rien à personne ?
Pas si vous démissionnez demain
et que vous vous rendez à la police
C'est dommage, l'école perd un bon professeur
Vous étiez mon préféré
Mais les choses changent
Oh mon dieu
Mesdames et messieurs de la promo 1999
Faites un triomphe à notre reine, Tru Davies
C'est ma soeur
Bonjour tout le monde
Pour ceux qui ne s'en rappellent pas
Je ne suis pas une fan des discours
Mais puisqu'il le faut.
Le lycée, c'était plutôt nul
pour la plupart d'entre nous
Les rivalités amoureuses
étaient au centre des débats
Mais ce soir nous pouvons changer ça,
laisser le passé derrière nous
Cette couronne a beaucoup de valeur pour certains
mais elle n'est pas pour moi
Judy Rogers, tu sais tout sur tout le monde
dans cette promo
Et tu attends cela depuis toujours
Ça te fait reine à mes yeux
Viens nous parler de toi sur scène
<i>Merci, je suis sans voix</i>
- Lindsay, salut
- Leonard, à nouveau
- Oh salut
Ça va te sembler étrange mais
j'ai toujours voulu t'avouer quelque chose
Tu as toujours été la plus belle pour moi
- Et tu as laissé ce mot dans mon casier
- Le mot dans ton casier ?
- Ce mot a changé ma vie
- Vraiment ?
J'ai compris quelque chose d'important
Si je ne pouvais pas t'aimer
Je ne pouvais aimer aucune fille
Attend, mon mot t'a fait comprendre
que tu étais homo ?
Ton mot m'a rendu homo
Et je peux te dire, pour la réunion des 10 ans
cette couronne sera à moi
Oh mon dieu, quelle nuit !
A cause de mon mot, un gars est un menteur
et un autre est homo
Le pouvoir de tes mots
- Comment était ta soirée ?
- Typique
- Et ne me parle pas d'Harrison
- Mince, j'ai oublié Harrison
Il ne s'est pas battu avec Keith Morgan ?
Je me souviens de toi
On va boire mesdames ?
Toute la soirée comme ça
Je pensais qu'il le cognerait.
Mais ils ont commencé à rire
Et là, ils sont comme les doigts de la main
- Regarde-moi
- Je reviens, une chose à faire
- Comment tu vas ?
- Je vais bien, pourquoi ?
Après tout ce qui s'est passé
- Je ne veux pas de ta pitié
- Ce n'est pas de la pitié
- C'est de l'amitié
- Pour être honnête, je n'en veux pas non plus
On était les meilleures amies
Je sais que les choses évoluent
On ne l'est plus maintenant
Mais ça pourrait changer aussi
J'aimerais beaucoup.
T'en penses quoi ?
Désolée Tru
Des choses changent, d'autres ne changeront jamais
- Salut
- Salut
- Je suis contente que tu sois là
- Vraiment ?
- Oui
- Tu veux danser ?
Je n'attends que ça
Des souvenirs sont remontés à la surface ce soir
Oui, en effet
Tu sais avec qui tu devrais aller au bal ?
Ronnie Clifton
- Il n'est pas à ma portée
- N'importe quoi
- Il aurait de la chance
- Tu le penses ?
- A quoi servent les meilleures amies ?
- Ne changeons jamais cela, d'accord ?
On sera les plus vieilles meilleures amies
pour toujours

<i>Pourquoi y a plus de musique ?</i>
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
Je vous présente
Tru, ma bienveillante, adorable
et j'oubliais, magnifique soeur
Ravie de vous rencontrer les gars
Je t'écoute
Tu sais combien notre relation est fusionnelle
Et le vieux dicton:
<i>Mi casa es su casa</i>
Sans oublier la bible qui dit:
<i>Que celui qui n'a jamais pęché
me jette la premičre pierre</i>
Juste les faits, ça ira
Ma proprio,
c'est une vraie vache pour le loyer
Tu t'es fait expulser ?
C'est pour ça que je citais <i>Mi casa...</i>
C'est quoi cette eau ?
Justement je voulais t'en parler
C'est pas possible !
Luc a réparé l'évier ce matin.
Qu'as-tu fait ?
Rien
Si seulement il avait été lŕ
Pourquoi tu n'es pas allé chez Lindsay ?
Dire ŕ sa nouvelle copine
qu'on est ŕ la rue
C'est pas trčs bon pour le couple
Bon, on s'en va
- Tu as besoin d'intimité.
- Merci
On y va les mecs !
Je comprends vite
Attrape
Au fait,
il reste de la bičre dans la baignoire
Ok
Ouvrez la caisse
Pardon ?
Vous m'avez bien entendu.
Ouvrez-la !
Il n'y a rien dedans.
Je n'ai pas de liquide
Les convoyeurs sont passés il y a 1 heure
Donnez-moi tout ce que vous avez,
maintenant !
- Ça ne te pose pas de problčme ?
- Je peux préparer un corps toute seule
Tu n'as pas l'air en forme
Un bon conseil:
évite le sandwich aux crevettes du snack d'en face
Je crois que
Excuse-moi
Bonjour
Moi c'est Tru
Et tu es
<i>Crédit insuffisant
Solde compte - 432.18 $</i>
ŕ découvert
Et comment tu t'appelles ?
Aide-moi !
Un mauvais ręve ?
Oui
Un mauvais ręve
Qu'est-ce que je fais ici ?
On devait aller au ciné ensemble
Mais tu t'es assoupie sur le canapé
Désolé de t'avoir réveillé..
Je voulais m'occuper de l'évier
Luc a réparé l'évier ce matin.
Qu'as tu fait ?
- Tu le répares ?
- Oui
Comme tu me l'as demandé toute la semaine
Et la voilŕ repartie
Je dois déjeuner avec Lindsay
En semaine ?
Elle ne travaille pas ?
Elle a pris un jour de repos
Comment le sais-tu ?
Tu viens juste de te lever
C'est un truc de filles
- Tu ne te changes pas ?
- Ça ira comme ça
En plus, je suis en retard
Écoute
Que tes excuses soient farfelues
ça ne me dérange pas
Ce qui me dérange, c'est que j'ai l'impression
que tu me caches une partie de ta vie
Non, ce n'est pas le cas.
Je t'expliquerai ce soir
Prévois du café
Harrison, c'est moi.
J'ai une mauvaise nouvelle
<i>- Je t'écoute</i>
- Tu vas ętre expulsé aujourd'hui
Merci, je le sais
<i>Meredith peut t'héberger.
Va la voir</i>
Et toi, tu ne peux pas ?
Déjŕ essayé
et ça ne m'a gučre plu
Un jour qui recommence
Qu'est-ce que j'ai encore fait ?
Un poker dans mon salon, de la bouffe partout
et ma cuisine inondée
<i>Je suis outré</i>
Outré !
Je ne ferais jamais ça.
Et au fait
Je gagnais au poker ?
Au revoir Harrison
- Je suis plutôt pressée.
- Ça ne sera pas long
J'écris un morceau.
Et je ne trouve pas la bonne rime
Écoute
<i>I'm living out loud
I'm driving right through</i>
<i>Will you meet me there</i>
<i>Will you be true</i>
Maligne, Tru
Ce n'était pas pour placer mon prénom
Il faut trouver autre chose
Quelque chose de plus...
Bon, je vois
Pourquoi n'es-tu pas passée ŕ la morgue
avant d'aller sur le terrain ?
Parce que je ne sais rien sur lui.
Pas de nom, ni d'effets personnels
Heureusement que j'ai vu le reçu bancaire
<i>Heure: 10H18</i>
Il ne devrait pas tarder
<i>Tu n'as rien d'autre ?</i>
<i>Une balle a touché la poitrine</i>
Davis, pose ce sandwich !
Pourquoi ?
Je te rappelle que j'ai déjŕ vécu cette journée.
Tu veux des détails ou tu me fais confiance ?
<i>C'est fait</i>
Il arrive
Je te tiens au courant
Fauché
Ces machines sont impitoyables
<i>Assistance Médicale Publique</i>
Vous pouvez m'ouvrir ?
Merci
Je peux vous aider ?
Oui, en m'ouvrant, pour rattraper
le monsieur qui vient de rentrer.
Vous ętes de la famille ?
- Non.
- On ne rentre que sur rendez-vous
Vous en avez un ?
C'est bien ce que je pensais
- Prenez une chaise et attendez.
- Il faut que vous m'aidiez
Sinon vous aurez des problčmes.
C'est déjŕ le cas
Un problčme Harrison ?
Je suis allé chez Meredith comme tu m'as dit
<i>Tu as fracturé la porte ?</i>
Je n'ai pas ses clés
Et je ne savais pas qu'il y avait cette alarme
C'est quoi le code ?
- Quoi ?
- Attendez !
Je suis lŕ
Merci beaucoup
<i>On signale un vol
ŕ l'angle de Clark et de la 4čme Rue</i>
<i>Répondez</i>
<i>Le code !</i>
<i>Quel est ce putain de code ?</i>
Désolé Harrison, je te rappelle
Quoi ?
Messieurs,
je suis si content de vous voir
Donnez-moi l'argent
Il n'y a rien dans la caisse
Maintenant !
Arrętez !
Mon dieu !
Je ne voulais pas
Je ne voulais pas
Vous m'entendez ?
Mon dieu, je suis désolé
Parlez-moi
Allez
Non, pas ça
Restez avec moi
Il est... ?
Sauvez-moi !
C'est pas possible !
Un mauvais ręve ?
Plutôt un vrai cauchemar
Désolé de t'avoir réveillée..
Je voulais m'occuper de l'évier
C'est vrai.
Merci
C'est moi qui suis désolée
de m'ętre endormie hier soir
On se rattrapera,
c'est promis
Et la voilŕ repartie.
Oů vas-tu cette fois ?
Ŕ la bibliothčque
- Elle n'ouvre qu'ŕ midi
- Je sais je vais ŕ la bibliothčque universitaire
Tu y vas pourquoi ?
Pour un truc que Davis m'a demandé.
Ça fait beaucoup de questions, non ?
Non
Juste 2
Tu sais que ça ne m'enchante pas non plus
Mais je dois vraiment y aller
Ne t'embęte pas avec l'évier,
c'est un nid ŕ problčmes
Je peux m'en charger
Je ne disais pas que tu n'y pouvais rien
Merci, de t'en occuper
C'est la moindre des choses
<i>Non Harrison, Mi casa es mi casa</i>
Si je comprends bien
je dois aller vivre en collocation
avec des cadavres ?
La morgue n'est qu'une solution temporaire.
J'ai un problčme ŕ régler d'abord
<i>Je crois que j'ai compris</i>
- C'est un de tes jours qui recommence ?
- On peut dire ça
Qui recommence 2 fois
pour ętre plus précise
Qu'est-ce que j'ai encore fait ?
T'as pourri mon appart,
t'es entré par effraction chez Meredith
<i>- Pas mal</i>
- Va ŕ la morgue
Salut Brian
J'essaie d'écrire une chanson.
Peut-ętre tu peux m'aider ?
<i>I'm living out loud
I'm driving right through</i>
<i>Will you meet me there</i>
<i>Or are we through</i>
Tu fais une rime avec le męme mot ?
C'est trčs inventif
Plus sérieusement...
- 2 fois de suite ?
- Oui
C'est plutôt surprenant
Je croyais avoir compris le mécanisme
On demande de l'aide,
j'interviens et tout rentre dans l'ordre
- Mais cette fois
- Quelqu'un d'autre est mort
Ŕ cause de moi
Mais tu en as sauvé un
J'ai sauvé un braqueur
En quoi c'est juste ?
N'importe qui peut me demander de l'aide alors ?
Peut-ętre qu'un tueur en série a besoin de moi
Voyons, Tru
Mes interventions
n'ont fait que causer une autre mort
Qui dois-je sauver maintenant ?
Les 2
Super
Au moins je sais oů le premier
sera dans 8 minutes
Ŕ propos du sandwich
Et il arrive
Maintenant
On se connaît, non ?
Je suis Maureen.
Je travaille au Rosefood Market
Désolé, je ne vous connais pas
Comme vous y passez souvent,
Je voulais vous dire
qu'on fait l'inventaire aujourd'hui
Le magasin est fermé.
La caisse enregistreuse est vide
Écoutez, je ne sais pas qui vous ętes,
ni de quel magasin vous parlez
Et votre inventaire m'importe peu
Aucune rigidité musculaire
Hypertrophie du foie
Peut-ętre une cirrhose
Et moi qui pensais m'ennuyer
Mais qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Je fais ce qu'on me dit de faire.
Tru m'a dit de loger ici
Loger ?
- Oů est ma chambre ?
- On n'a pas de chambres
On a des armoires frigorifiques
Peu importe
Je ne suis pas difficile
On ne s'est plus vus
depuis la fęte chez ma soeur
Ça tombe bien.
On n'avait pas vraiment eu l'occasion de discuter
Discuter de quoi ?
Devine.
On est les seuls ŕ connaître son secret
Ya pas moyen de la convaincre
de jouer aux courses ?
Elle est bien au-dessus de tout ça.
Attention !
Ils sont stériles, enfin ils l'étaient
Alors, c'est un jour qui recommence ?
Il recommence plusieurs fois
Plusieurs fois
Elle me l'a dit
en premier
- Je peux le manger ?
- Non c'est...
Vas-y !
Pas mal
Je peux vous aider ?
- Je me sens mal.
- Vous avez un dossier médical ici ?
Non
Il faut remplir ça
Il faut que j'aille aux toilettes
C'est au bout du couloir ŕ droite
<i>Vous seule pouvez m'aider
ŕ avoir ces médicaments</i>
<i>Et vous me dites que
vous ne pouvez pas m'aider?</i>
<i>-Pouvez-vous me donner ces médicaments ?
- Non</i>
<i>Pourquoi ?</i>
- Je n'ai plus le temps.
- M. Mancuso, attendez !
Patricia ?
Stephanie Brandis
Enchantée Stephanie
Ça fait plaisir d'avoir du renfort.
<i>Entrez</i>
Si vous vous sentez mieux,
le docteur va vous recevoir
Vous savez,
je me sens mieux
Je suis pas mal occupée
Ton frčre ne doit pas rester ici.
Tout-ŕ-l'heure,
il s'est enfermé dans un caisson réfrigérant
Je n'ai pas le temps
Il m'a męme demandé
combien vaut un cadavre sur le marché noir
Occupe-le.
J'arrive dčs que je peux
Il sera déjŕ trop tard
Pourquoi tu ne me demandes pas de l'aide ?
Allez, je suis son frčre
Il était ŕ quoi ce sandwich ?
M. Mancuso
<i>Attendez !</i>
Je suis lŕ
Quelqu'un braque ce magasin
<i>On signale un vol
ŕ l'angle de Clark et de la 4čme Rue</i>
<i>Répondez</i>
Donnez-moi ce qu'il reste.
Maintenant !
Mains en l'air !
Posez votre arme au sol
Je ne suis pas armé
C'est dans sa poche de gauche
Videz vos poches
Il y a un malentendu
Mon dieu !
Je ne l'ai pas vu arriver
Appelez une ambulance !
<i>- Ici 1980. Demande ambulance d'urgence.
- Reçu</i>
C'est trop tard
Il est...
Pourquoi vous ne m'avez pas écoutée ?
Je vous ai dit de ne pas entrer dans ce magasin
<i>S'il-vous-plaît</i>
Aidez-moi
C'est pas possible !
Quoi ?
Tu ne voulais pas que je le répare ?
Je crois que l'évier préfčre rester cassé
Je ne t'avais jamais vue pręte aussi vite
- Ni personne d'autre d'ailleurs.
- Désolée
- Je suis vraiment pressée.
- Tu vas oů ?
- Je vais voir Meredith.
- Je croyais les visites interdites
La famille proche est autorisée
Si c'était autre chose tu m'en parlerais ?
Bien sűr
<i>Va chez Lindsay</i>
Dire ŕ sa copine qu'on est ŕ la rue,
c'est pas terrible pour...
Je me fiche de ta vie de couple
Quel langage !
C'est un jour qui recommence ?
Qui recommence 3 fois.
Sois poli, elle comprendra
Trois !
Pas mal
Tu écris une chanson ?
Comment tu le sais ?
Tu as une guitare autour du cou
Je suis trčs pressée
Écoute ça
<i>I'm living out loud
I'm driving right through</i>
<i>Will you meet me there</i>
<i>'Cause I'm stuck in traffic</i>
Ça ne rime pas !
Trois fois
Et chaque fois j'ai causé
la mort de quelqu'un d'autre
Ce n'est pas ta faute.
Il faut ętre optimiste
Comment ça ?
Tu découvres chaque fois un peu plus de choses
D'autres indices
Tu sais maintenant qu'il n'était pas armé
J'avais déjŕ compris qu'il était désespéré
Et je le deviens aussi
Et si ça ne finissait jamais
Si tous les jours il fallait
trouver une excuse minable pour Luc
et essayer de tenir Harrison
sur le droit chemin
Sans parler de la chanson de mon voisin
Ce n'est pas possible
Peut-ętre que ta mission
n'est pas si évidente qu'on le pensait
Oů veux-tu en venir ?
Peut-ętre qu'aujourd'hui quelqu'un doit mourir
Pour de bon
Ce n'est pas acceptable
Ce n'est pas mon job
de décider qui doit mourir
Qu'en sais-tu ?
Ne dis pas ça
Tu connais le genre de décisions
que prennent les gens de mon âge ?
Aller ŕ la fac ou trouver un boulot
Commander des pizzas ou sortir en ville
Acheter un mobile
avec appareil photo ou garder l'ancien
On dit que rien n'arrive par hasard
C'est le destin
Et le destin est immuable
Et peut-ętre que tu es lŕ
pour t'assurer que
Le destin fasse son oeuvre ?
Comment je saurais ce que le destin a prévu ?
Il te le montrerait.
Peut-ętre
Et pour que ça arrive
Suis ton instinct
Tu retournes au distributeur de billet ?
Il s'est passé quelque chose au centre médical
C'est sans doute ce qui l'a poussé
ŕ faire ce braquage
Bonjour.
Je suis Stephanie Brandis
Je viens rejoindre votre équipe médicale
Bien sűr
Premičre ŕ gauche
Patricia Norris vous attend
Je m'en doutais, merci
Enfin, depuis le temps
que je demandais du renfort
Entrez
J'ai déjŕ pu voir certains dossiers
J'étais restée sur le dossier Mancuso
Un cas terrible.
C'est une enfant formidable
Une enfant ?
Elisabeth
Ses parents ont tout tenté
Mais ces cas sont..
Je n'ai que survolé le dossier pour l'instant
Elisabeth a une cardio-myopathie
Elle a attrapé un virus l'année derničre
qui a aggravé son cas
Elle est sous quel traitement ?
On lui prescrit des anti-arythmiques,
Ça ne fait que masquer les symptômes
Le seul remčde fiable est
une transplantation cardiaque
Est-elle sur une liste ?
Oui, mais elle n'est pas prioritaire
En plus elle est <i>O négatif</i>
ce qui réduit le nombre de donneurs possibles
- Ŕ quasiment zéro.
- Exactement
M. Mancuso a perdu son emploi il y a 6 mois.
Son assurance-maladie est...
- J'ai besoin de vous parler.
- Michael
On parlait justement du cas de votre fille
Voici une nouvelle venue:
Stéphanie Brandis
Enchantée
J'ai besoin d'Immuonoron
On n'en a plus
Elizabeth respire de plus en plus mal
Je suis allé ŕ la pharmacie, mais
ils ne me remboursent plus les pilules
Vous saviez que 2 pilules coűtent 500 $ ?
Je n'ai pas cet argent !
- Je le sais bien.
- Il faut que vous me donniez ces pilules
Je vous rembourserai
- M. Mancuso, calmez-vous
- Elle souffre
Je ne suis pas pharmacienne.
Je ne peux pas délivrer de médicaments
Vous deviez m'aider, non ?
Donnez-nous un peu de temps,
on fera notre possible
Je ne peux pas attendre !
- Attendez !
- Je ne peux plus attendre
Ça ne pourrait pas ętre pire pour lui
Il y a toujours pire
Je vous le jure.
Je suis Stephanie Brandis
Et j'ai rendez-vous
Ne me faites pas appeler la sécurité
Je comprends votre situation,
mais Patricia peut vous aider
Attendez qu'elle vous rappelle
- Ma fille a besoin de ses pilules maintenant !
- Vous n'arrangerez rien en faisant une bętise
Qu'est-ce que vous racontez ?
Ne me dites pas que vous cherchez
un moyen rapide de trouver de l'argent
Quitte ŕ envisager le braquage d'un magasin
Laissez-moi tranquille
Ne faites pas ça !
Vous avez une meilleure idée ?
Elle n'a que 11 ans
Je ne peux pas offrir ŕ ma fille
la seule chose dont elle ait besoin
Quand je vois ses camarades,
je me demande
Pourquoi leurs coeurs fonctionnent
et pas celui de ma fille
Pourquoi est-elle malade ?
Et pas eux
Je ne peux pas la soigner
Mais je peux lui éviter de souffrir
Elle a besoin de son médicament.
Tout de suite
Je vous le procurerai
Laissez moi 1 heure
Vous n'aurez rien ŕ payer
Mais promettez-moi
de ne pas aller dans ce magasin
Une heure ?
Il me faut votre adresse
820 South Norman D.M
Appartement 2
De l'Immuonoron, c'est ça ?
Oui. 50mg
Je m'en occupe
Allez auprčs de votre fille.
Je vous rejoins dčs que possible
Merci
<i>Attendez !</i>
Je suis lŕ
Merci
Merci beaucoup
<i>On signale un vol
ŕ l'angle de Clark et de la 4čme Rue</i>
<i>Répondez</i>
Va ŕ la pharmacie d'en face
et demande ŕ voir Timothy
Avec une insuffisance respiratoire.
Ça devrait passer
Si elle a une cardio-myopathie,
ça n'aura...
Je sais.
il n'y a que la transplantation pour la sauver
Tu es sűr qu'il va me donner
pour 500$ de médicaments ?
Il a une dette envers moi.
Le mois dernier,
sa grand-mčre avait une infection pulmonaire.
Je l'ai quasiment sauvée
On dirait que tu avais tort, Davis.
Personne n'est mort aujourd'hui
Tant mieux
Alors Harrison, quoi de neuf ?
J'ai suivi ton conseil.
Je suis allé chez Lindsay
Tu m'as dit d'ętre gentil avec elle
C'est ce que j'ai fait
J'ai pensé lui préparer un petit repas
Et j'ai failli mettre le feu
Et pourquoi tu m'appelles ?
<i>Est-ce que cette journée
ne pourrait pas recommencer de nouveau ?</i>
Dis-moi ce que je veux entendre
Tires-toi de lŕ
Bonne chance
Ça va ?
Je me sens pas bien
- Ne commande pas...
- Le sandwich aux crevettes
C'est ma faute
Je n'y pensais plus avec cette histoire.
Désolée
C'est pas grave.
L'important c'est de sauver la petite
J'ai les pilules
Est-ce que...
Elle est partie
J'aurais dű faire plus vite
Les pilules n'auraient rien changé
Merci d'avoir essayé
Je suis vraiment désolée
Nous avons tous une destinée
Viens
Elle ne souffre plus maintenant
On a fait tout ce qu'on pouvait
<i>S'il-vous-plaît</i>
Aidez-moi
Un mauvais ręve ?
Si seulement c'était ça
Ça ne vaut pas la peine de s'embęter
ŕ réparer cet évier, crois-moi
- Tu vas bien ?
- Non
Je peux t'aider ?
Non
Et la voilŕ repartie
Juste par curiosité,
tu vas oů ?
Je pourrais te donner une excuse bidon,
mais tu t'en douterais parce que tu me connais
Si tu as besoin de tout savoir
pour que cela marche entre nous
Et pour ça, il va falloir
que tu sois encore patient
Il y a beaucoup de choses
que tu dois m'expliquer
Je vois bien que tu es stressée,
laisse-moi au moins t'aider sur ça
Tu as raison, tu pourrais m'aider
Harrison a des soucis en ce moment
Il risque de passer ici aujourd'hui.
Tu pourrais t'en occuper
Merci.
On discutera ce soir
On verra bien
<i>I'm living out loud
I'm driving right through</i>
<i>Will you meet me there
So we can start it new</i>
C'est ma chanson !
On est sur la męme longueur d'onde.
Tu veux qu'on fasse un groupe ?
Tu dois en avoir marre
de m'expliquer la męme chose
Ça empire ŕ chaque fois.
Tu aurais dű voir cette famille
Si on récapitule
- Tu as sauvé le pčre.
- Résultat: sa fille est morte sous ses yeux
Ça ne va pas
- Mais sans toi ils mouraient tous les 2.
- Je sais, pourtant je suis toujours bloquée
Qu'ai-je négligé ?
Peut-ętre que tu as fait ce qu'il fallait
Les théories ne me sont gučre utiles
Je dis juste que tout ce qui s'est passé
a peut-ętre servi ŕ t'amener ŕ cette enfant
Alors, il faudrait empčcher Michael de mourir
et soigner sa fille ?
N'oublie pas que les médicaments
ne sont d'aucun secours pour la petite
Il faut que je l'emmčne ŕ l'hôpital
Passe moi le sandwich qui est au frigo
- Quoi ?
- Maintenant
Et je mange quoi maintenant ?
Qui ętes-vous ?
Peu importe.
Je suis lŕ pour aider votre fille
Il faut l'hospitaliser au plus vite
Ça ne sera pas nécessaire
Non, croyez-moi
la vie d'Elisabeth est en danger
- Comment connaissez vous son prénom ?
- Je sais aussi que votre compte
est ŕ découvert de 432.18 $
- Je ne comprends pas.
- Vous voulez aller au centre médical public
pour essayer d'avoir
son traitement gratuitement
Je peux vous faire gagner du temps
Patricia Norris ne vous donnera pas
ces médicaments
De quoi vous parlez ?
L'Immuonoron ne la sauvera pas
Son coeur va lâcher aujourd'hui
Ŕ quoi seriez-vous pręt
pour sauver votre fille ?
Je mourrais pour elle
Dites ŕ votre femme
d'emmener Elizabeth ŕ l'hôpital
Allez-y !
Chérie, c'est moi,
elle va bien ?
Non, les médicaments ne résoudront rien
Emmčne-la ŕ l'hôpital
On se voit lŕ-bas
Merci
Qui que vous soyez
Donne-moi ton pognon !
Je n'ai pas d'argent
<i>On signale un vol
ŕ l'angle de Clark et de la 4čme Rue</i>
<i>Répondez</i>
S'il-vous-plaît.
Il n'a pas d'argent !
- La ferme !
- Pitié
Prenez mon collier,
il vaut cher
Ne lui faites pas de mal.
Prenez-le
Donne-moi ça
- Allez.
- J'essaie de l'enlever
File-moi ce collier !
<i>911, j'écoute</i>
Il a été poignardé.
Il saigne abondamment
Il nous faut un lit.
Préparez la transfusion et l'intubation.
Je veux le groupe sanguin,
et la chimie du sang tout de suite
Qui ętes-vous ?
Je travaille ŕ la morgue
Oů est ma fille ?
Bon sang !
Elle est en réanimation
On s'écarte
Pas de pouls
Massage cardiaque
Calmez-vous monsieur
Il y ŕ 3 incisions dans le ventre coté gauche.
Préparez le lavage péritonéal
L'hémorragie est importante.
Que fait la chirurgie ?
Je mourrais pour elle
Je ne m'en sortirai pas
S'il vous plaît, sauvez-la
La tension continue de chuter
Augmente le débit au maximum
Il a besoin de sang.
Oů est le O négatif ?
- Il arrive.
- Scalpel
Elizabeth est O négatif
ce qui réduit le nombre de donneurs
ŕ quasiment aucun
Quel massacre
Son coeur avait été touché
Mais pas aujourd'hui
Il fallait juste que je sauve son coeur
Pour elle
Votre fille vivra
Elle vivra longtemps et en bonne santé
Allez ! Un effort
Et merde
Heure du décčs: 13h32
Sa fille a besoin de son coeur
Il faut appeller l'équipe de transplantation
<i>Il est comme neuf !</i>
J'espčre que tu ne l'as pas cassé
Luc a passé la matinée dessus.
Ça va ?
C'était le jour le plus long de ma vie
Je connais ça.
Si ça peut te réconforter.
Je me suis fait expulser aujourd'hui
Vraiment ?
Je peux te dire que Luc m'a sauvé la mise
Il a empęché tes potes
de pourrir mon appart ?
Ça et, il a joué avec nous au poker
Et j'ai assez d'argent pour payer
le loyer du mois dernier
Et celui du mois prochain
Tu as besoin de repos
Je file
On se voit demain
Je l'espčre vraiment
Tu avais raison
Quelqu'un devait mourir
Il fallait qu'il meure différemment,
pour sauver la vie de sa fille
J'aurais dű pouvoir les sauver tous les 2
Tu peux changer les évčnements
mais pas le destin
Je fais des choses
que personne ne peut faire
Mais parfois cela ne suffit pas
Mais les autres fois cela suffit

La Saint-Valentin.
Même la morgue
paraît plus romantique.
- Vous partez quand en week-end ?
- Harrison passe me prendre demain matin
- Pour aller où ?
- À la montage, aux <i>Pinetop Cabins</i>
Il a dit que ça devrait être magnifique
Et pour toi et Luc ?
Il a trouvé un Bed&Breakfast près de la côte.
Il passe me prendre après ma garde.
On a deux amours.
Ils nous ont préparé un super
week-end pour la Saint-Valentin
Cette période de l'année est géniale.
Cette fête est une honte
Inventée par les fleuristes et les carteries
- Il ne faut pas lui en vouloir, il est très seul
- Étonnant !
À lundi.
Passe un bon week-end
Toi aussi
Alors tu travailles demain ?
Oui.
Je remplace les mecs mariés.
J'ai hâte d'y être, j'ai besoin de penser
à autre chose qu'au boulot.
- La morgue ou sauver des gens ?
- Je dirais, pour les deux
Ep. 1-12 - Valentine
Réveillée ?
J'ai failli prendre ton pouls.
Quand on est partis tu as dit
que tu fermais les yeux 5 minutes
C'était il y a 4 heures.
Ce n'est pas bon signe.
Il y a eu une crue importante.
La route est fermée pour une journée.
Il n'y a qu'une seule route.
Nous devons y être aujourd'hui.
Désolé,
mais vous devriez rebrousser chemin.
On fera la St Valentin à l'appart.
C'est pas grave.
Qu'est-ce que tu cherches ?
On n'est qu'à 50 km du lieu où sont
Lindsay et Harrison
<i>- Pinetop Cabins ?</i>
- Comment tu es au courant ?
- Harrison m'en a parlé la semaine dernière.
- Un vrai romantique.
- Ça doit être très beau
- Harrison a dit ça
Ses mots exacts étaient :
<i>Rustique et romantique</i>
Allez, faisons-leur la surprise.
J'ai envie de chips.
Tu veux quelque chose ?
Non merci.
J'ai appris qu'ils ont fermé la route 14.
Je voulais vous mettre au courant.
<i>Merci mais on le sait déjà</i>
Tout se passe bien à la morgue ?
En fait, je ne passe pas ma St Valentin
tout seul finalement
<i>Je suis avec Marissa Hatcher</i>
La police l'a trouvée égorgée
dans le parc McKenley.
<i>Vraiment ?</i>
Le tueur a laissé un bout de journal
taillé en forme de coeur.
Comme une carte de voeux.
Certains sont complètement givrés.
Pauvre fille
En tout cas,
repose-toi et profites-en
Merci, j'essaierai.
On se voit lundi
Désolé, je ne voulais pas vous effrayer
- Ça va.
Vous allez vers le sud ?
Je cherche un moyen de transport.
Je sais ce que vous vous dites.
Un étranger qui demande à une jeune femme
de le prendre en stop.
On dirait le début
d'un mauvais film d'épouvante.
En quelque sorte.
Je suis Kevin Rafferty et je suis tombé
en panne il y a quelques kms
Heureusement qu'il y a un garage
Le mécanicien est parti en vacances.
Et je suis censé retrouver ma petite amie
On n'a jamais été séparés à la St Valentin,
et je ne veux pas que cela se produise.
J'aimerais vous aider, mais...
Pas d'auto-stoppeurs.
- Passez une bonne St Valentin
- Vous aussi
Quelqu'un a vu mon portefeuille ?
Il est rouge et noir
- Vous avez dû le laisser tomber ici
- Merci
Comment allez-vous
mon bon samaritain ?
- On est encore loin de l'hôtel ?
 - J'ai demandé au caissier
20 km et on devrait voir un panneau.
On ne peut pas le louper.
- C'est-ce que je pense ?
- Tu demanderas à Harrison.
- Je voulais juste de faire plaisir
- Ici ?
- C'est un peu morbide
- Ils ont leur propre cimetière
Ils m'ont dit qu'il ne faisait pas
partie de la propriété
Je veux rentrer
Il paraît qu'il y a un belle cascade.
On pourrait s'y rendre demain.
Pour y faire un pique-nique.
Regarder les oiseaux.
- Toi, te promener ?
- Pour toi ? Bien sûr
Rustique et romantique
On a tout ce qu'il faut, merci
C'est moi Harry
Tu nous a dit où vous alliez
Salut
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez ici ?
La route vers la côte était fermée.
Et je n'avais pas de réseau
pour vous appeler.
On a entendu ça à la radio.
Un orage à endommagé un émetteur.
Du coup, plus personne n'a de réseau.
- On pense rester ici.
- Super, plus on est de fous, plus on rit.
Allez vous enregistrer.
Installez vous et venez manger ici,
c'est moi qui régale
Je croyais que les repas
étaient inclus dans le prix.
Bien-vu bébé.
À dans 30 minutes.
Écoute, je sais que ce n'est pas
ce qui était prévu.
On est ensemble,
peu importe l'endroit.
- Tu es sûre ?
- Oui
On se croise à nouveau
Je faisais du stop tout à l'heure
A la station d'essence
tu étais à l'intérieur.
Tout va bien,
Hank m'a pris un peu plus loin.
- Je suis vraiment désolée
- Moi aussi
Si je savais que vous veniez ici.
Vous auriez pu avoir une ristourne.
Ma soeur dirige l'établissement.
Hey Kevin, salut.
- Tu as pu venir, entrez.
- Voici Hank, il m'a amené.
À leur place, je vire le cimetière,
je mets des saunas dans les chambres.
Et l'hôtel Pinetop Cabins devient
la station balnéaire Pinetop Cabins
Est-ce que je t'ennuie ?
Non, c'est juste que cet homme est seul
le jour de la St Valentin.
Il veut peut-être être seul.
- Ça intéresse qui?
- Moi, je trouve ça triste
- Sacré repas.
- Oui, c'est bon.
- Quoi ?
- Rien du tout
C'est juste que tu t'intéresses
toujours aux autres.
- Tu penses que je suis trop maternelle ?
- Dès qu'il s'agit des autres, oui.
- Qui veut un dessert ?
- Tu sais, tu as raison.
Je devrais être comme toi.
Être égoïste, tout le temps.
Moi, égoïste ?
Ce n'est pas moi qui ai
vidé le chauffe-eau en prenant ma douche.
J'aime les longues douches.
Traîne-moi en justice.
Je peux te parler en privé ?
- Je le largue ce soir Tru.
- C'est la St Valentin.
Le jour le plus romantique de l'année
et on n'arrête pas de se disputer.
Attends, tu n'es pas fâchée ?
Bien sûr que non.
Vous êtes mes meilleurs amis
Et ce sera toujours le cas.
On sortira moins ensemble,
c'est tout.
- Ils ont réparé l'émetteur.
- Enfin quelque chose qui marche ce soir.
- Joyeuse St Valentin.
- Luc, elles sont magnifiques, où as tu...
Je l'ai pris sur une tombe.
ils n'en ont pas besoin de toute façon.
- Je plaisante, elles étaient dans mon sac.
- Viens ici.
Tu me largues ?
On se dispute sans arrêt,
sur tout.
Ce week-end pouvait nous être profitable.
Peut-être que c'est le cas.
Écoute, je vais faire un tour
donc si tu veux le lit.
Non je prends le canapé.
Le lit a une odeur bizarre.
Merde
Y'a quelqu'un ?
Harrison, c'est toi ?
Y'a quelqu'un ?
Mon dieu, tu m'as fait peur
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
J'allais chercher de la glace
Ça va ?
J'ai cru entendre un bruit dans les bois.
Désolée, cet endroit est effrayant.
C'est le fait qu'ils aient un cimetière ?
Va savoir, à plus.
<i>Aidez-moi</i>
<i>- S'il vous plaît</i>
- Quelqu'un est là ?
Kevin
J'ai besoin de toi
- Tu es réveillée
- Quoi ?
Je pensais que tu étais morte
- Tu appelles qui ?
- Harrison pour le prévenir
Le prévenir de quoi ?
Des allergies de Lindsay
Il va lui préparer un repas ce soir
et s'il y met des cacahuètes
<i>PAS DE RÉSEAU</i>
L'orage à endommagé un émetteur.
On ne capte pas à des kilomètres
Ce n'est pas un bon signe
Il y a eu une crue importante.
La route est fermée pour une journée.
On doit y passer notre week-end
et il n'y a qu'une route.
Vous devez repartir d'où vous venez
J'ai une idée. Harrison et Lindsay
ne sont pas très loin d'ici.
- Pinetop Cabins.
- On pourrait les rejoindre.
C'est bizarre, je pensais exactement
la même chose.
Et arrête-toi à une station d'essence.
J'ai une envie de chips.
Un paquet de chips pour la demoiselle.
- Allo
- Davis, c'est moi
- J'allais justement t'appeler
- Oui, je sais
J'ai compris, tu revis la journée
 Qu'as-tu comme info sur la victime ?
Kevin Rafferty,
égorgé près de notre hôtel.
Et il y avait un coeur taillé dans du journal
ça te rappelle quelque chose ?
- Oui, 2 victimes, 1 méthode, ça ressemble à...
- Un tueur en série, je sais
<i>Moi qui pensais être en vacances</i>
- Ça arrive toujours au mauvais moment
- Suffisamment pour me gâcher la vie.
Dis-moi tout sur la 1ère victime.
Je vais rencontrer la 2ème dans un instant.
Le rapport de police signale qu'un homme
a été aperçu quittant les lieux
- Quoi d'autre ?
- Du résidu sur le coeur en papier
Je ne sais pas ce que c'est
mais je vais le faire analyser
Je ne serai pas joignable
avant 18h03 ce soir.
- Pourquoi ?
- Problèmes de réseau.
Trouve tout ce que tu peux d'ici là.
- Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire en attendant ?
- Essayer d'éloigner Kevin du motel
Je dois y aller Davis
Laissez-moi deviner, vous cherchez
un moyen de transport.
Oui, pour aller au motel Pinetop Cabins
Ce n'est pas très loin.
Ça ne me pose pas de problème
mais je dois en parler avec mon copain.
Super.
C'est lui, demandez-lui
Quelqu'un a vu mon portefeuille
Rouge avec des scratchs noirs
Oui, il vient de le prendre
sur le comptoir
- C'est faux
- Vous n'avez qu'à vérifier son sac
Quoi ?
- D'accord
- Voyons ça
- Je ne l'ai pas pris, je le jure
- Oui, c'est toujours comme ça
Je ne comprends pas
Pourquoi faites-vous ça ?
Ce n'est pas ce que vous pensez
J'essaye juste d'aider
Allons-y maintenant
Je vais parler à Harrison.
Je reviens tout de suite
- Comment tu sais dans quelle cabine il est ?
- 4, son chiffre porte-bonheur
D'accord, on reste
- Tout va bien, merci !
- Ouvrez c'est moi
Salut, la route était fermée
alors on ne peut pas rejoindre la côte
Donc on a décidé de venir ici à la place.
Luc est dehors
- Super
- Je dois parler à Harrison en privé
- Donc tu l'as fait arrêter ?
- Pour sauver sa vie
- Incroyable, un tueur en série, ici
- C'est le cas
Donc on fait nos bagages et on rentre
et pas de contestation
Calme-toi, on parle d'un tueur en série
Je me tire d'ici
On devrait pas appeler les flics
et leur dire de surveiller le coin
J'aimerais bien mais on n'a pas de preuves
Et si je leur dis que je revis la journée
Tu imagines leur réaction
Appelons la presse
et on leur dit que j'ai eu une prémonition
- En quoi ça nous aiderait ?
- Ça pourrait aider notre compte en banque.
Ça vaut le coup.
- Remballe tout
- Quoi ?
Tu avais raison depuis le début.
Ce n'est pas le meilleur endroit
- Mais tu viens de me convaincre de rester
- Ici ? Tu plaisantes ?
Ils ont leur propre cimetière
Mauvaise nouvelle, il y a des rats chez Harrison.
On ne peut pas rester.
- Mais je viens de réserver.
- Alors annule, on ira ailleurs.
Crois-moi, on ne doit pas rester ici.
D'accord, je reviens
On se croise à nouveau
- Étonnée de me voir ?
- Tu peux le dire
Ta petite blague a failli marcher.
Heureusement que le magasin avait
une caméra de surveillance.
Le shérif a vérifié,
Devine ce qu'il y a vu ?
Ça doit sembler bizarre
mais j'ai fait ça pour votre bien
Me faire passer pour un voleur,
pour mon bien ?
Je ne sais pas ce que vous faites ici
mais je propose que vous partiez
- Ou j'appelle la police
- Kevin
- Tu as réussi
- Bonjour Hank, je l'ai amené
- Changement de plan, je reste
 - Quoi ?
- La victime vient d'arriver, je ne peux pas partir
- Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Tu ramènes Lindsay en ville comme prévu.
- Je ne te laisse pas ici avec un psychopathe
- Donc Lindsay repart avec Luc
C'est ça.
Comment tu vas leur expliquer ?
En plus, avec la victime ici
On est en sécurité.
Peut-être pas.
Nos agissements ont peut-être
modifié le cours des évènements
La victime de ce soir pourrait être ...
Moi ?
On ne peut pas savoir
Si c'est le cas, je t'appelle à l'aide
et on recommence cette folle petite journée
Si tu restes
qu'est-ce qu'on dira à Luc et Lindsay ?
La vérité
Quand je t'ai dit la vérité
tu m'as traitée de cinglée.
Dans ce cas,
il va falloir mentir.
- Maintenant tu veux rester ?
- Je dois rester
Harrison et Lindsay sont en train de se...
Disputer
- Et j'aimerais arranger les choses.
- Je ne veux pas les laisser comme ça.
C'est peut-être en étant seuls qu'ils vont
arranger les choses.
Je ne crois pas.
Harrison a été...
détestable.
- Ça ne ressemble pas à Tru
- Elle n'est pas elle-même
Je dois discuter seul avec elle
pour l'aider à comprendre, sinon...
Ils vont se séparer
Je peux faire quelque chose ?
Reste assise ici
Ne bouge pas, une fois que j'en ai fini
vec ma soeur, je serai de retour
Je retourne réserver une cabine
- Comment ça s'est passé ?
- Comme une lettre à la poste, et toi ?
Et maintenant ?
Il faut surveiller Kevin
et chercher après des suspects
Tu en as un ?
Davis a parlé d'un homme
sur les lieux du 1er meurtre.
Super, qui pourrait
correspondre au profil ?
2 suspects:
l'un a amené Kevin.
L'autre était au resto hier soir.
Un mec âgé avec des lunettes.
Oui, il était à l'accueil juste devant nous.
Il s'appelle...
Carl
Tu arrives à y croire ? Un motel, un cimetière
et un psychopathe aux alentours
Il n'avaient même pas ça
dans <i>Vendredi 13</i>
- C'était dans un camp de vacances.
- Peu importe.
Fais attention.
Tru Davies est ma soeur,
je suis en sécurité.
Je vous avais dit de partir
J'allais le faire mais...
- Pourquoi êtes-vous encore ici ?
- Je suis désolée pour ce qui est arrivé
- Et j'aimerais m'excuser
- Les excuses n'y changeront rien.
C'est dur à croire mais
j'essayais de vous protéger
De quoi ?
Kevin ?
- Il y a un problème ?
- Non
Aucun problème,
juste un malentendu.
Tant mieux, j'ai besoin que
tu m'apportes du bois.
N'en voulez pas à mon frère.
Il est remonté à cette période de l'année.
La St Valentin, il doit avoir prévu
quelque chose pour ce soir.
Il m'a dit qu'il devait retrouver sa copine.
Il ne m'en avait pas parlé.
Toujours la dernière au courant.
- Gardez un oeil sur lui ce soir, d'accord ?
- Je le fais tout le temps.
Depuis que nos parents sont morts.
Je ne serais rien sans lui.
Que faites-vous dans mon bungalow ?
Votre bungalow ?
Je croyais que...
- Réveille-toi Harrison.
- Donc c'est une erreur.
Oui, je me demandais
Où sont mes affaires, ma copine ?
- Que font ces journaux ici ?
- Ils sont à moi
Vraiment ?
Vous rédigez une demande de rançon ?
C'est le registre funéraire de ma femme.
Elle est morte la semaine dernière
- Désolé
- Je sais que ça semble morbide.
Les journaux ont dit
de très belles choses sur elle.
D'après celui-là,
l'enterrement était hier.
- Et vous y étiez
- C'était une belle cérémonie
- Donc vous n'étiez pas dans le parc
- Excusez-moi ?
- Est-ce que c'est ?
- Les cendres de ma femme.
Elle m'a demandé de les disperser ici.
Désolé pour le dérangement.
Je dois y aller.
Carl n'est pas le meurtrier.
Il n'était pas là lors du 1er meurtre
C'est sûr ?
J'ai mis ma main dans les cendres de sa femme.
En entier.
- Il nous reste le gars de la camionnette.
- Indique-moi sa cabine, je vais vérifier.
On devrait se séparer.
Kevin n'aimerait pas me revoir.
Je m'occupe de Kevin.
Tu prends l'autre gars.
- Si tu as le moindre soupçon...
- Je crierai comme une petite fille
Tu me trouveras de toute façon.
Entrez
Entre, installe-toi
Tu as vu Tru ou Harrison ?
- Non et toi ?
- Nulle part.
- Quelle St Valentin.
- Ça pourrait être pire.
On pourrait être seuls.
Et je traînerais dans mon appart,
en regardant un film avec Meg Ryan
en mangeant de la glace.
Mince, j'aimerais être seule.
Je ne veux pas jouer les curieux,
mais qu'est-ce qui
a déclenché votre dispute ?
- Pardon ?
- Tru m'en a parlé
Tu t'es disputée avec Harrison,
n'est-ce pas ?
Non, Vous vous êtes disputés.
N'est-ce pas ?
<i>APPEL EN COURS: DAVIS</i>
Pile à l'heure Davis.
Donne-moi une bonne nouvelle.
Je viens d'analyser les traces
sur le papier journal.
- Et alors ?
C'est du tabac
qui correspond
à des cigarettes Bullseyes Light
- Je cherche un fumeur alors, merci
- Attends, il y a plus
J'ai fait des recherches
sur les meurtriers en série.
Il y a eu 5 meurtres ces dernières années.
Tous avec la même arme.
<i>Tous en période de St Valentin</i>
Donc il a déjà tué
beaucoup de personnes.
- Je peux venir si tu veux
<i>- Tu n'auras pas le temps</i>
Reste disponible.
Je t'appellerai si besoin.
Tu peux m'expliquer ce que tu fais ?
Luc, qu'est-ce que tu...
C'est toi qui braque une voiture
alors réponds à ma question.
J'ai éteint ses phares.
pour ne pas décharger sa batterie.
Vous avez tout réglé toi et Harrison.
Oui, ça n'a pas été facile
mais on a pu tout arranger.
J'ai parlé avec Lindsay.
Vous nous avez menti.
- Tu ne comprends pas.
- Je crois que si au contraire.
Tu vas me dire que ta vie
est compliquée, n'est-ce pas ?
Que tu pars parfois sans explications
et je dois faire avec.
Non, c'est juste...
À mes yeux tu es ce qui m'est arrivé
de mieux depuis longtemps.
Et je réalise que
je ne te connais pas du tout.
Quand on braque une voiture.
On évite de se disputer.
Ça réveillerait un mort.
Je sais ce que vous préparez.
Ne vous approchez pas de Kevin Rafferty.
- Quoi ?
- Vous m'avez compris
Vous aussi vous fumez cette marque ?
- Ce ne sont pas les vôtres ?
- Bien sûr que non.
J'ai beaucoup d'asthme,
je ne peux pas fumer.
TIMMONS HANK
<i>TERBUTALINE 600ml</i>
Mais à qui est ce paquet alors ?
À Kevin.
Il les a oubliées dans la voiture.
- Te voilà, j'allais venir te chercher.
- Épargne moi ça STP.
Je ne sais pas à quoi vous jouez,
et je ne veux pas savoir.
Mais quoi que ce soit
c'est probablement de ta faute
Calme-toi
Tu me ramènes à la 1ère heure demain
- Bébé
- Non, Harrison pas cette fois.
Pas de mais.
Pas encore une de tes histoires.
Cette fois, c'est fini.
Merde
La Terbutaline, ce n'est prescrit
que pour les asthmatiques.
- Donc les cigarettes sont à Kevin ?
- Vrai
<i>- Ce qui fait de lui le tueur en série</i>
- Encore vrai
S'il est le tueur en série
qui l'a tué ?
- Kevin cherchait peut-être une autre victime
- Et cette victime s'est défendue
La question maintenant
est de savoir qui l'a fait.
Allez,
c'est pas possible.
Fermé ?
Oui, vous travaillez ici ?
Ma soeur est la propriétaire.
Elle est allée faire un tour.
J'allais la chercher, si vous voulez
m'accompagner pour avoir d'autres clés.
Vous êtes mon sauveur.
Je vous suis.
Ce n'est pas le conducteur le tueur.
C'est Kevin.
Quoi ?
Il y a 2 tueurs. Kevin a tué la fille
et quelqu'un l'a tué hier soir.
Davis pense que c'est la personne
qu'il a attaquée.
Je pensais que ça serait facile.
Kevin s'est envolé.
- Quoi ?
- Lindsay est venue m'engueuler.
J'ai levé les yeux 2 secondes.
Ça veut dire qu'il est toujours en danger
Et alors.
C'est un tueur en série.
Et si on laissait faire la nature pour ce soir ?
Tu ne comprends pas
Ce qu'on a fait différemment aujourd'hui,
a modifié le destin
- Et alors ?
- Ça peut se passer différemment cette fois.
Peut-être que sa victime
ne pourra pas se défendre ce soir.
- Peut-être elle va mourir à sa place.
<i>- Bonsoir.</i>
- Ça roule mec ?
- J'allais vous poser la même question.
Je viens de voir votre amie
avec un autre gars.
Quoi ?
Qui ?
- Le frère d'Eileen, je ne sais plus son nom.
- Dans quelle direction ?
Il m'a même abandonnée pendant 3 heures
sans s'en rendre compte.
Tu es sûr que ta soeur est par là ?
Je veux te présenter quelqu'un
Ma petite-amie, Amanda.
On ne passe jamais la St Valentin seuls.
C'est une blague n'est-ce pas ?
Elle est morte il y a 3 ans.
Un accident de voiture.
As-tu déjà perdu quelqu'un ?
Quelqu'un de proche.
Ça te change.
On se sent isolé des autres.
Il se disent désolés, amènent des fleurs,
envoient des cartes.
Mais ils ne comprennent pas réellement.
Ils ne savent pas
ce que l'on ressent.
C'est pour ça que je le fais.
Pour que les autres comprennent
ce que l'on ressent.
Je veux qu'ils comprennent.
Tout comme les gens qui t'aiment
vont comprendre.
Tout va bien ?
Oui, je crois.
Donc on connaissait
celle qui l'avait tué.
Oui je crois
C'est juste ...
Quoi ?
<i>-Ça va ?
- Cet endroit me donne la chair de poule.</i>
Ça ne peut pas être elle, je l'ai vue juste avant
de découvrir le corps, elle allait bien.
Qui a tué ce gars alors ?
Toi.
Le tueur connaît probablement la vérité.
Il a dit que c'était sa copine.
Quoi chérie ?
Il a dit que c'était sa copine
<i>- Il m'a dit qu'il retrouvait sa copine
- Il ne m'en a pas parlé</i>
Eileen, elle le couvrait
Tu veux toujours me protéger.
Donc maintenant tue-moi.
Tue-moi avant que je ne tue quelqu'un d'autre.
Je ne peux pas, je suis ta soeur.
Je t'aime.
Il faut que tu mettes fin à tout ça.
Je t'en supplie à nouveau.
- Kevin.
- S'il-te-plaît.
Ne le fais pas Eileen.
Je ne pourrais pas,
c'est mon frère.
Combien de temps l'avez-vous protégé ?
Il m'a tout confessé avant que vous arriviez.
Et je l'ai supplié d'aller à la police.
Mais il m'a promis qu'il ne tuerait plus.
Je l'ai cru, jusqu'à ce que je le voie
suivre votre amie.
- Et j'ai compris qu'il ne pouvait pas s'arrêter.
- STP, fais-le, tue-moi.
Non je ne peux pas, désolée.
Mais on va t'aider, les meilleurs docteurs.
Je ne veux pas de leur aide.
Je voulais ton aide.
- Mais si tu ne peux pas.
- Non Kevin, STP, tu es tout ce que j'ai.
Je vais être franche, je ne sais pas
si vous méritez de vivre.
Mais si vous vous tuez
vous la tuerez aussi.
Merci.
Donc laisse-moi résumer.
Tru l'a entendu se confesser à sa soeur
cet après-midi.
- Et au lieu de prévenir la police.
- Elle ne pouvait pas à cause de la panne de réseau.
Elle est venue te voir.
Donc pourquoi ne pas nous en avoir parlé
à moi et Luc ?
On voulait pas vous faire peur.
Je ne serais pas allée avec lui
si j'avais eu peur.
Et dire que j'ai failli
rompre avec toi ce soir.
Ce que tu as fait pour moi.
Je ne pensais pas qu'un homme
puisse être si courageux.
Je sais que j'ai tout gâché.
Tu as sauvé des vies.
Tu as fait ce qu'il fallait
Mais encore une fois,
tu m'as tenu à l'écart.
J'essayais de te protéger.
Je n'ai pas besoin de ta protection.
Je n'en ai jamais eu besoin.
Ce dont j'ai besoin,
c'est de faire partie de ta vie.
Mais maintenant, après ça.
Luc, ça n'arrivera plus
Ça arrivera
Peut-être pas de la même façon,
mais ça arrivera.
C'est un cercle vicieux.
Toujours les mêmes problèmes.
Je pense que rien ne changera.
C'était l'enfer ce week-end, et pour quoi ?
Sauver la vie d'un tueur en série.
De cette façon, il est en prison.
C'est mieux que la mort pour certains.
Je voulais m'éloigner
juste pour 2 jours de ce boulot,

Mais ça me poursuit, et ça m'a coûté Luc,
parce que je ne peux pas lui dire la vérité.
- Tu as une vocation
- Une vocation, c'est la destinée.
Quelque chose qui donne de la valeur à ta vie,
qui te rend joyeux.
Ce que je fais, ça ressemble plus
à une malédiction.
Écoute, tu as été choisie pour une raison.
Ceux qui t'ont donné ce don
savaient ce qu'ils faisaient.
Ils ont vu ce que j'ai vu en toi.
Force, compassion, conviction.
Tu es la bonne personne
pour cette mission
Je n'en ai aucun doute.

<i>Dossier Tru Calling - http://trucalling.free.fr</i>
Arrêtez de bouger ces projecteurs
Re-vérifiez le son.
Il y a encore du larsen.
Je me fiche de ce que tu leur as dit Marty.
Je ne chanterai pas !
J'ai eu mon amie au <i>Times</i>.
On aura leur meilleur photographe.
Que ferais-je sans toi ?
Salut
<i>Bienvenue à
Miss 'Fresh Face' 2004</i>
Tu comptes bouger
ou je vais me changer dans ma voiture ?
Désolée
Tu sais que cette pièce est réservée
aux participantes ?
J'en fais partie !
Super
J'aurais dû m'en douter
Je m'appelle Jackie
Désolée chérie,
mais on ne fera pas
copain-copain, aujourd'hui
Je suis là pour gagner
Tru Davies ?
Oui. Qui c'est ?
Désolée.
Michelle Carey du <i>Post-Dispatch</i>
- Le journal ?
<i>- En effet</i>
Puis-je vous poser quelques questions ?
En fait, je ne souhaite pas m'abonner
<i>Ce n'est pas le but de mon appel</i>
J'ai étudié tous les rapports de police
de ces derniers mois.
Que ce soit les tentatives de meurtres,
menaces et autres agressions,
ils ont tous, sans exception,
une seule chose en commun.
Et c'est vous.
- Où voulez-vous en venir ?
<i>- Dans toutes les affaires,</i>
<i>les victimes rescapées vous désignent
comme responsable de leur survie.</i>
A chaque fois.
Étonnant non ?
Ça doit être une coïncidence
Peut-être, mais ce n'est pas mon avis
Pour une employée à la morgue,
vous figurez souvent dans les rapports de police.
- Je suis plutôt occupée.
<i>- Je peux vous appeler plus tard ?</i>
- Je vous rappellerai moi
- Bien
Quoi qu'il en soit,
le journal saura vous trouver.
J'attends votre appel
Très bien
Ep. 1-13 - <i>Drop Dead Gorgeous</i>
- Je ne suis pas déprimée, je suis juste...
- Célibataire.
Luc et moi ne sommes pas faits
pour être ensemble.
Il ne devrait pas tarder à te demander de
revenir avec lui, crois-moi.
Enfin.
Je ferais mieux d'y aller
J'oubliais qu'aujourd'hui tu as
le concours de beauté à gérer
- Ça m'étonne de toi d'avoir demandé ce poste.
- Je sais
Je dois nommer un des juges,
et après avoir bien réfléchi
Puisqu'il faut élire une fille nature,
j'ai pensé à un mec nature.
Ne me dis rien
Harrison
- Ta copine ne sait rien de tout ça ?
- Rien. Elle me fait confiance.
- Tu ne vas pas te défiler, hein ?
- Moi ? Voyons !
Comme je fais partie des juges,
je peux presque te garantir
que ta fille sera
la prochaine 'Miss Fresh Face'.
- Presque ?
- On est trois juges.
Écoute,
Angela est arrivée à ce niveau toute seule
Notre accord sera valable
uniquement si Angela termine, disons
à la première place ?
Marlon,
c'est pas très raisonnable
Je le suis !
Tu me payes ce que tu me dois,
je reste cool
Tu t'arranges pour qu'Angela gagne,
je reste aussi cool
S'il se passe autre chose,
je deviens moins raisonnable.
Tu es en avance.
Je voulais juste ramener ça aux archives
- Le rapport d'autopsie de ta mère ?
- Oui
- Du nouveau ?
- Rien
Le rapport n'apporte pas grand chose.
Une seule balle, perte massive de sang
Même si je l'ai lu quinze fois,
j'ai l'impression d'avoir manqué un truc
Tru, si je peux me permettre,
Parfois, il n'y a qu'une seule balle.
Un tireur isolé, une mort tragique.
Parfois, les apparences ne sont pas trompeuses
- Qu'est-ce qui te fait dire ça ?
- 8 ans d'expérience à la morgue.
J'aimerais avoir le même avis que toi
À ce soir
Je savais que cette fille
nous causerait des ennuis
Elle nous a lâchés
2 minutes avant le début du show
- Tu sais ce que ça signifie ?
- Il te manque une fille ?
Exact
Il faut que je trouve une remplaçante.
Quelqu'un qui conviendrait parfaitement.
Comme quelqu'un que je connais
Tu peux rêver
- Allez Tru, allez
<i>- Écoute</i>
Te tenir les cheveux quand tu vomis,
je le fais sans problème.
T'emmener à l'aéroport, volontiers.
Mais défiler à la parade,
pas question
Ça sera super
Je suis désolée,
mais je ne le ferai pas
<i>- Merci quand même</i>
- Salut
Bonsoir et bienvenue à la première élection
de "Miss Fresh Face"
Rejoignons nos juges et accueillons notre
première concurrente, Angela Todd
A propos,
j'ai vu les concurrentes en coulisse.
Angela est vraiment impressionnante
Elle est très intelligente
Et c'est quelque chose que j'apprécie.
mais cela n'engage que moi.
Si vous pouviez dîner
avec un personnage historique,
qui choisiriez vous ?
Et bien Chuck,
c'est une bonne question.
Je pense que ce serait
Britney Spears
Angela, j'ai précisé n'importe quel
personnage 'historique'
Britney Spears !
Angela, merci
Cette fille a du caractère !
C'est une qualité rare
chez les jeunes aujourd'hui
Excusez-moi
- Mademoiselle Walker
- Oui, monsieur Barnes
- Nous avons un problème
- Ah bon ?
- Je suis viré ?
- J'en suis vraiment désolée
Julian Barnes a dit que tu essayais
d'influencer les autres membres du jury
- Mais, c'est dingue !
- Je sais, mais c'est le patron.
Mais, tout ce qu'on a partagé,
ce qu'on a fait ensemble, tout ça
- Ça ne compte plus ?
- Bien sûr que si.
C'est pour ça que tu as
une place au premier rang
Parfait
Content de te voir.
Je voulais te parler de quelque chose,
en personne
- Est-ce que tout va bien ?
- Oui, oui, c'est juste que ...
Écoute, c'est pas facile à dire,
mais je vais essayer
Il ne devrait pas tarder à te demander
de revenir avec lui.
Prends ton temps,
c'est important
Oui, c'est pour ça que je veux
te parler en tête-à-tête.
Maintenant qu'on est séparés,
on rencontrera forcement d'autres personnes
et comme on travaille ensemble,
je sais que c'est difficile
C'est pour ça que je voulais que tu saches,
j'ai un rendez-vous ce soir
J'espère que j'ai fait le bon choix,
je préfère ça que tu l'apprennes autrement
Tu as bien fait.
J'apprécie que tu y aies pensé
Bon, je dois aller travailler
Tu sais, c'est drôle
Depuis 3 mois qu'on se connait,
c'est la première fois
que je coupe la conversation avant toi.
<i>C'est moi.</i>
Et j'ai besoin de toi. Maintenant.
- Ça ne peut pas attendre ?
- Oui, si tu veux voir mon cadavre.
Je viens dès que possible
Désolée, mais je dois y aller.
Ça ne m'étonne plus
Elle a passé son bac avec mention,
et terminé major de promotion à la faculté
Si j'ai bien compris, tu as obtenu
une place de juge grâce à Lindsay
pour pouvoir influencer le vote
en faveur de la fille de ton prêteur sur gages
Ton analyse me déçoit beaucoup.
Je ne comprends pas de quoi tu parles
Je l'avoue. Tu as raison.
Il me faudrait 4000 $ pour rattraper le coup
Je n'ai pas 4000 $
Je m'en doutais
Et 40 $ plus les numéros gagnants
du Loto de demain ?
Dites-nous Jackie, pourquoi seriez-vous
la prochaine Miss Fresh Face ?
Je suis désolée,
je ne peux pas continuer.
Pauvre fille, ce concours est rude
Et moi qui pensais avoir des problèmes.
Dis-moi, si tu ne paies pas ce type,
qu'est-ce qu'il te fera?
Pour faire simple,
Je te demanderai peut-être
de l'aide ce soir.
Depuis l'au-delà
- Harrison !
- Je déconne
Tu as perdu le sens de l'humour
depuis que tu sauves des gens
T'inquiètes pas, je vais
trouver une solution.
- Je passe une très bonne soirée
- Moi aussi
Ça peut sembler être
une question bizarre mais,
tu ne vas pas quitter le restaurant
au milieu du repas, n'est-ce pas ?
Non, sauf si tu me le demandes
Ok, on va faire un marché.
- Je promets de ne pas te le demander.
- Ça me va.
Mesdames et Messieurs,
les votes des juges viennent de me parvenir
La première dauphine du concours,
qui montera sur le podium,
Ne dis pas son nom,
ne le dis pas.
est Mademoiselle Angela Todd !
Oh merde !
La nouvelle star des cosmétiques Julian Barnes
qui remporte le chèque,
le contrat de top model,
et des produits de beauté à vie...
est Mademoiselle Alex Reynolds !
Nous sommes tous enchantés
du résultat de Miss Reynolds.
Laissons-lui prendre le temps
de se rafraîchir avant de prendre d'autres photos
Sérieusement, mon maquillage
doit être en bouillie
Merci
Tru, on se barre d'ici
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Disons que certaines personnes
pourraient être énervées
- On ne peut pas sortir par là
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce qu'on a besoin d'un... pass
- Pardon Franck
J'étais juge, souviens-toi
J'y étais presque, je n'avais
qu'à convaincre les 2 autres, et j'aurais...
Allez, magne-toi
Tu devrais arrêter d'emprunter de l'argent
pour éviter ces situations
Merci du conseil
Est-ce que j'ai imaginé ça ou...
Je pense que ça venait de là-bas
Ce n'est pas le moment idéal
pour prendre un bain de foule
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
C'est Jackie, elle était là
quand je suis entrée
Appelle la police !
Elle est ...?
Morte
On dirait que tu les attires, hein ?
Malheureusement
Alors, c'est maintenant que ça se passe ?
- Quoi ?
- Qu'elle t'appelle à l'aide, le réveil du mort.
Je ne sais pas quand ça arrive Harry !
Sois sympa, va surveiller l'entrée
pour garder la scène du crime intacte
Désolé, mais je meurs d'envie de voir ça
Ce n'est pas sûr que ça se produise,
et même si c'était le cas
tu ne t'en souviendrais pas demain, parce que
ça n'aurait pas encore eu lieu.
Je pense que je ferais mieux de sortir.
Aide-moi !
<i>Salut, c'est Tru, laissez-moi un message</i>
Bonjour, Michelle Carey du <i>Post-Dispatch</i>
Comme vous n'êtes pas chez vous,
je vais vous appeler au travail.
Une seule fois !
Est-ce trop demander de sortir une seule fois
et que tout le monde reste en vie ?
- Tu attends une réponse ?
- Non
- Que sait-on ?
- Pas grand chose
Juste qu'elle a subitement craqué
pendant son passage sur scène
À ce qu'on m'a raconté,
ces questions peuvent être de vraies tortures.
Des marques sur le corps ?
Elle avait des rougeurs sous les yeux
- Une inflammation ?
- On aurait dit des brûlures
Ça ne me dit rien mais je vais chercher
Tiens-moi au courant.
Je vais essayer de convaincre Jackie
d'abandonner le concours.
Elle ne gagnera pas de toute façon.
Tu penses pouvoir devenir 'Miss Fresh Face' ?
Non, je vais lui sauver la vie
Si une journaliste du nom de Carey me cherche,
Ne réponds à aucune question
Questions ? Quelle genre de questions ?
Le genre auquel nous n'aimerions pas répondre.
Ah, ce genre là.
J'ai un rendez-vous ce soir
J'espérais tomber sur toi
Je voudrais te dire quelque chose
Maintenant qu'on est séparés,
nous allons forcément faire des rencontres
et le fait qu'on travaille ensemble
risque de compliquer les choses.
Je voulais que tu saches
que je ne t'en voudrais pas
- Vraiment ?
- Ça sera bien si quelqu'un te rend heureux
Mais, je pensais que...
- Je dois y aller
- Vas-y
J'allais justement t'appeler.
- C'est parfait
- Vraiment ? Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Une des filles vient de nous lâcher.
- Il me faudrait quelqu'un d'exceptionnel.
- Ok, j'en suis
- Vraiment ?
- Oui, pas de souci
Et moi qui pensais que tu allais refuser.
Je dois aller en coulisses ?
Oui, je vais te chercher un pass.
Attends-moi ici
- Hey Harry
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Des choses...
Ne m'en dis pas plus
C'est moi qui t'ai demandé de l'aide ?
Non, pas toi.
Une des filles
- Ne me dis pas que c'est Angela Todd
- Elle s'appelle Jackie
Incroyable !
Un meurtre pendant le défilé de Lindsay
- Alors que je suis juge et toi
- Concurrente
Oh mon dieu !
Toi ?
Pardon
- C'est la seule façon de m'approcher d'elle
- Oh ouais
C'est ça, marre-toi, mais sache
que ta combine ne marchera pas
Quoi ?
Truquer le vote pour dédommager
ton prêteur sur gage
Mais où as-tu la tête ?
C'est suffisamment dur de sauver des gens
sans avoir à sauver tes fesses
Essaies d'être plus malin
- Hier, tu as été viré du jury.
- C'est bon à savoir.
Ok, voilà ton pass
- Alors, c'est la remplaçante ?
- Oui, Tru
Enfile vite ta robe pour le défilé.
Une robe de soirée
Je n'ai pas de robe de soirée
Tu peux emprunter une des miennes
- Merci
- T'en fais pas
J'arrivais pas à me décider
alors j'en ai pris 4
Ça ira.
Dépêchez-vous les filles
- Salut, Tru
- Jackie
Touchantes.
Je vous apporte des petits-fours ?
- Tu dois être la nouvelle
- Enchantée
C'est en te réveillant ce matin
que tu as décidé de devenir Miss Fresh Face
C'est à peu près ça
Incroyable
Ils laissent entrer n'importe qui
- Elle est toujours comme ça ?
- J'en ai bien peur
Mais ce n'est pas seulement elle,
elles le sont toutes
La compétition c'est pas trop mon truc
Je pensais me marrer un peu
mais elles sortent toutes les griffes
Avant de commencer, je souhaite
vous présenter nos juges
Veuillez accueillir
le pdg des 'Cosmétiques Barnes'
Monsieur Julian Barnes !
Le juge suivant est
un ancien mannequin
Je pense qu'elle aurait sa place
parmi les autres finalistes
Julian le pense aussi et c'est
pourquoi il l'a épousée
Mesdames et messieurs,
Adrian Barnes !
Et notre homme de la rue,
Monsieur Harrison Davies
Jackie, je dois te dire quelque chose,
et ça va te paraître bizarre
Tu as l'air si sérieuse.
Allons parler à l'intérieur
Tyler
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
- Jackie
Tu me manques.
Je t'ai dit de ne pas venir
- Écoute-moi
- Laisse-moi !
- Laisse-moi une chance
- Tyler, il n'y a rien à ajouter
Je vis ici maintenant, c'est chez moi.
Pars, tout de suite
Jamais de la vie, j'ai traversé la moitié
du pays pour te voir !
- Il y a un problème ?
- S'il-te-plaît, va-t'en !
- Faites ce qu'elle vous a dit
- Il vaudrait mieux
- Par ici
- Je trouverai tout seul
Mon ex
Ce n'est pas ce qu'on appelle
une séparation à l'amiable
Je me suis installée ici
pour repartir de zéro
Je ne pensais pas qu'il me suivrait
Les hommes sont imprévisibles
Voilà, essaye celle-là
Elle t'ira super bien
Merci
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a fait ?
- Rien, il m'est plutôt sympathique
Le problème est que sa soeur
participe au concours
- Conflit d'intérêts
- Donc, je devrais le ...
Oui
Est-ce que c'est bien ici ?
On m'a dit de m'adresser à Tru Davies
Euh, en fait elle n'est pas ici,
mais j'aimerais pouvoir vous aider.
Je pourrais vous aider.
Peut-être
J'ai besoin d'un certificat de décès,
c'est pour un ami.
- En fait vous devez passer par ...
- Les archives
J'ai fait la queue toute la matinée,
ils ont perdu l'original
- Ils m'ont dit d'en demander un chez vous
- Toute demande doit provenir...
S'il vous plaît, ne me dites
pas que je dois y retourner
Je suis déjà en retard de 4h au boulot
Je pense qu'on peut
faire une exception pour cette fois.
- Mes condoléances mademoiselle ?
- Park, Susan Park
Jackie porte un superbe modèle de la
collection Julian Barnes
<i>50% coton, 50% nylon...</i>
Comment fait-elle avec un cul
comme le sien ? Énorme
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a entre vous deux ?
La seule chose qu'il y ait
c'est la couronne
Personne ne peut gagner
contre moi
Ne le prends pas mal
C'est juste un concours,
si tu ne gagnes pas, tant pis
Tu ne peux pas comprendre
- Ce concours ouvre des portes
- Lesquelles ?
Celles des supermarchés
Faut bien commencer quelque part
Au fait, un conseil
Si j'arrivais en finale, parce que ma
meilleure amie organisait le défilé
Je ne parlerais pas autant.
- Tu as été terrible
- Merci
Tu sais, j'ai pensé à ce tu as dit
à propos de ces filles, et en fait
Je pense comme toi.
J'ai une idée.
Barrons-nous d'ici
- Pardon ?
- Je suis sérieuse. Partons d'ici
On aura mangé une pizza avant qu'ils
se rendent compte qu'on est parties
Oh, c'est tentant,
je dois l'admettre
Mais j'ai voulu ce concours,
alors je le fais.
Ça ne peut pas être pire, hein ?
Tu es la preuve que toutes les participantes
ne sont pas mauvaises
Jackie, il y a quelque chose
que je n'ai pas pu te dire avant.
Je sais, je marche trop vite,
je ne me ferai jamais à ces hauts talons
Non, c'est quelque chose
d'autre à propos de ce soir
Écoute, je ne sais pas
comment te le dire, mais il va se...
Allez, vas-y
Bonne chance
Voilà pourquoi je voulais
que tu reviennes avec moi
Je voulais te le demander quand
nous serions arrivés, mais
après notre dispute de ce matin,
c'est le moment ou jamais
Qu'est-ce que t'en dis Jacks ?
J'ai envie d'accepter.
Je t'aime plus que tout.
Mais j'ai besoin d'y réfléchir
Prends le temps que tu voudras,
je t'attendrai.
Voilà, Terence Park
68 ans, infarctus
Il était coréen
C'était un oncle par alliance
L'acte original a été signé
par Jessica Park ?
Ma cousine. Elle devait
venir aujourd'hui mais,
C'était déjà dur pour elle de venir
ici la dernière fois
- Oui, c'est pas facile de venir à la morgue.
- Et dire que vous le faites tous les jours.
Vous devez être quelqu'un de fort.
A travailler ici tout seul,
encerclé par la Mort
En fait nous avons du personnel.
Tru, n'est-ce pas ?
Ma cousine m'a dit que appeliez
quelqu'un comme çà
Oui
- Je vais éditer le certificat.
- Je ne suis pas pressée.
En plus,
J'aime bien parler avec vous
Tout va bien ?
Cette question peut te paraître bizarre, mais
Tu ne vas pas t'échapper
au milieu du repas ?
- Non, sauf si tu le demandes
- Non, pas du tout
Je ne supporte pas quand
on se lève et part
- Au milieu du repas, parce que mon..
- Ex, n'arrêtait pas de le faire
- Combien de fois je l'ai dit ?
- Trois fois
Écoute, Tabatha
Tu as l'air d'être une fille bien
Je pensais pouvoir à nouveau
inviter des filles à sortir.
Je crois que c'est encore
un peu tôt pour moi
Super !
Tu aurais peut-être
dû y penser avant de m'inviter
Regarde-moi bien m'échapper
au milieu du repas
Quelle perte de temps !
Britney Spears !
Merci Angela
Accueillons la candidate suivante:
Tru Davies !
Alors Tru, d'après votre CV, vous
travaillez de nuit à la morgue ?
C'est exact
Que faites-vous en dehors du travail ?
J'aide les gens
Du bénévolat ?
On peut dire ça, oui
<i>C'est la dernière fois que je te
le demande, compris ?</i>
<i>Tu l'as amenée ?</i>
Elle est ici,
je te la donnerai tout à l'heure
Alex, je n'ai pas le temps de jouer.
Je ne devrais pas être ici pendant le concours
Attention Julian, les juges pourraient
voir des marques sur mes bras
Tu sais que tu gagneras ce concours,
même avec deux yeux au beurre noir
Cette cassette est mon assurance.
- Tu auras tous les votes dont tu as besoin
- C'est ce que je voulais entendre
Tu es la suivante
Tru, dites nous brièvement, pourquoi
vous pourriez être Miss Fresh Face ?
J'aimerais, mais j'ai un
planning assez serré, merci
- Qu'est-ce qu'y s'est passé ?
- La foule me rend nerveuse
Dommage, les juges t'aiment bien
A propos de juges, où
est Harrison ?
- Euh, j'ai dû le renvoyer
- Tu quoi ?
Comme tu es candidate du défilé,
il y a un conflit d'intérêts
Je suis désolée, je ne peux pas
Je n'ai plus à me soucier
d'elle à présent
Tu m'as dit que c'était la concurrente
la plus dangereuse pour toi
Après sa performance,
maintenant, c'est toi
Avec toute cette paperasse,
vous ne devez pas sortir souvent.
C'est que les femmes me trouvent bizarre
Décoloration autour des yeux :
application typique de pesticide "Parathion"
- Tout va bien ?
- Oui
Vous m'excusez une minute ?
C'est moi
J'ai eu le rapport du labo
La décoloration autour des yeux est due
à l'application d'un phosphate organique
<i>Vraisemblablement un pesticide</i>
Tu penses qu'elle est morte parce
qu'on lui a brûlé la peau
Ces phosphates sont de puissants neuro-toxiques
qui provoquent une asphyxie instantanée
- Charmant
- Tu as des suspects ?
J'en avais deux, mais
plus rien maintenant
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Je croyais que c'était son ex, mais
il l'a demandée en mariage
Puis une concurrente de Jackie,
hors de cause maintenant
- C'est quelqu'un pourtant Tru
<i>- Je ne vois pas d'autre suspect.</i>
Jackie est une fille super-sympa,
personne ne peut lui vouloir du mal
Elle va être assassinée dans une demi-heure
Je dois y aller, je te rappelle
Qui va être assassinée
dans une demi-heure ?
Je veux être sûre que tout va bien
- Je m'en vais
- Quoi ?
Tout ce défilé c'est du bidon
Les filles sont fausses
La gagnante n'en est pas une.
Rien n'est vrai.
Écoute Jackie, je veux t'aider mais tu
dois me dire ce qui se passe ici
C'est Alex, elle a quelque chose
sur un des juges
- Une sorte de cassette
- Elle le fait chanter ?
Pour être certaine de gagner le concours.
On est donc venues ici
pour leur servir d'alibi.
Mon Dieu !
Regarde-moi, je n'ai plus
l'air de rien
Il ne faut pas que Tyler
me voie dans cet état.
Je vais accepter sa proposition
Une décoloration autour des yeux
est l'application typique
d'un phosphate organique,
autrement-dit un pesticide
N'en mets pas
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que ça te tueras
- Le démaquillant d'Alex va me tuer ?
- Attends, ce n'est pas le tien ?
Le mien est rangé, je voulais
juste emprunter le sien
C'est à Alex
Mon Dieu
C'est elle qui
devait mourir, pas toi
Sans vouloir te vexer Tru,
tu me files la trouille
Désolée, je pense qu'on essaie
de tuer Alex
Pourquoi voudrait-on la tuer ?
Hormis le fait que ce soit une
véritable salope
Tu as dit qu'elle avait une cassette
pour faire chanter un des juges ?
Pour gagner un petit concours régional
Ce n'est pas un mobile de meurtre
Ce n'est pas le concours le mobile,
c'est la cassette
Écoute, peut-être tu te fais des idées,
je vais y aller
Je suis heureuse de t'avoir rencontrée
C'était horrible aujourd'hui,
je ne veux plus jamais vivre ça
Mais de t'avoir à mes côtés
a fait la différence
Je vous ai posé une question
- Vous avez votre certificat, partez !
- Je ne veux pas de certificat
Je ne m'appelle pas Susan Park
Vous êtes Michelle Carey ?
- Je n'ai rien à vous dire
- Qu'est-ce Tru veut me cacher ?
Partez
Ça a un rapport avec sa présence
sur les lieux de meurtres ?
Sur le fait qu'elle sauve des inconnus ?
- Vous vous trompez, c'est ridicule
- J'attends une explication
- Dites-moi ce qui se passe
- Il ne se passe rien ici !
- C'est le fruit de mon imagination ?
- Exactement
Figurez-vous que
j'ai même imaginé d'autres choses
J'ai fait des recherches
Tru n'est pas la première à
mystérieusement sauver la vie d'inconnus
Il y en a déjà eu une,
avant elle
Je vous demande de partir
Dites à Tru que je la trouverai
un jour ou l'autre
<i>Je ne suis pas certaine de ça M. Barnes</i>
<i>On fait un marché,
tu m'appelles Julian</i>
<i>- Et je t'appelle Miss Fresh Face
- Je ne suis pas Miss Fresh Face</i>
<i>- Pas encore, mais tu le seras
- Comment ça ?</i>
<i>Pourquoi ne pas faire
plus ample connaissance ?</i>
Et la nouvelle égérie des cosmétiques
Julian Barnes est
Alex Reynolds
Ça craint !
Grosse surprise, hein ?
Désolé, il n'y a qu'une seule gagnante,
essayez l'année prochaine
Je pourrais amener une cassette
l'année prochaine
- Je ne comprends pas
- Vous savez
Je peux organiser une projection en public.
Ça vous rafraîchira la mémoire.
Que voulez-vous ? De l'argent ?
- Je veux que vous vous démasquiez
- Pour quoi ?
Pour avoir essayé de tuer Alex
Qu'est-ce que vous dites ?
Elle a gagné, c'est fini
Vous avez raison
Vous auriez dû vous enfuir
dès la fin du concours, mais qui... ?
Nous allons la laisser se remaquiller
avant de prendre des photos
Votre femme !
Vraiment ?
Mon maquillage doit être en bouillie
Je resterais là, si j'étais toi
À moins que Miss Fresh Face
veuille devenir Miss cadavre
Quoi ?
Adrian n'a pas apprécié ce que
tu as fait avec son mari
elle a ajouté un ingrédient
à ton démaquillant
qui élimine les maîtres chanteurs indélicats
Vous avez empoisonné mon maquillage !
Le meilleur moyen de tuer
une reine de beauté
- Vous ne pouvez rien prouver.
- La morgue n'est pas équipée pour,
mais quand je leur montrerai le flacon,
ils auront quelques questions à vous poser
Adrian, qu'est-ce qui t'a pris ?
Elle t'a pris pour un con Julian,
et moi avec.
Son visage aurait été sur toutes les affiches.
C'était insupportable pour moi.
Dans deux jours, je rembourserai tout
avec les intérêts
Désolé mon pote,
c'est trop tard
Papa
Je te cherchais partout !
Désolé, j'avais du boulot à terminer ce soir.
Dommage chérie pour le concours.
- J'ai gagné
- Quoi ?
J'ai gagné
L'autre fille faisait chanter un juge
Ils l'ont disqualifiée
Je suis Miss Fresh Face
Le contrat, les produits de beauté...
J'ai tout raflé
J'appelle maman
C'est génial
Je sais pas ce que t'as fait
Mais je suis impressionné
Quand tu veux, mec !
Quand tu veux
Comment c'était ?
Pas terrible
Je n'ai pas arrêté de penser
à une fille que j'ai connue.
Rappelle-moi pourquoi on a rompu ?
Parce que j'étais imprévisible
Parce que je m'échappais tout le temps
Parce que j'ai des secrets
- Et ça m'ennuyait ?
- Oh oui
J'ai réagi trop vivement
Peut-être que je pourrais vivre avec ça
Tu ne pourrais pas
Parce que même si je le voulais
Je ne pourrais pas changer.
Je suis comme ça et je le serai toujours
Ça m'oblige à abandonner des choses
Quelquefois des choses que j'aime vraiment
Je suis désolée Luc
- Ne le sois pas
- Non, je suis désolée pour moi
Bonsoir
Tu vas bien ?
Je pense que ça ira
Et toi ?
Aucun journaliste n'a appelé ?
Non
Elle est venue
Tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter,
je n'ai rien dit.
Ça a été une longue journée
J'espère que je ne ferai pas
la une de son journal
Elle sait quelque chose
Quelque chose que je sais depuis longtemps
Elle ne peut pas le prouver.
J'aurais dû t'en parler,
mais ça t'aurait embrouillée
Avant toi, il y avait déjà quelqu'un
Une femme
Avec le même don que toi.
Elle pouvait empêcher la mort
Quand tu me demandais
pourquoi je te crois ?
Pourquoi j'accepte facilement ce que tu fais ?
C'était pour cette raison.
Parce que je l'ai rencontrée
Tu ne trouveras rien d'utile
dans son dossier.
C'était ta mère
Ce que tu peux faire
Elle le faisait aussi

<i>Dossier Tru Calling - http://trucalling.free.fr</i>
DťpÍche-toi !
Suis-moi.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe maman ?
Suis-moi bťbť.
Y'a un problŤme ?
Ne fais aucun bruit Tru.
Tu es seule ?
Oui.
Oý est ta fille ?
Elle n'est pas lŗ.
Tant mieux.
Je vois le visage de maman.
Et puis je l'entends.
La voix de cet homme.
C'est le retour de papa qui te fait Áa.
- Ce rÍve n'a aucun rapport avec papa.
- C'est Áa.
D'aprŤs Meredith, il est lŗ pour une confťrence.
On ne le verra mÍme pas.
- Mais il y a autre chose.
- Et c'est...
Ce que je peux faire.
Revenir en arriŤre, essayer de sauver
ces personnes de la mort.
Je pense que maman pouvait aussi le faire.
- Tu tiens Áa d'oý ?
- Davis
Il ťtait assistant quand ils l'ont amenťe.
Comment ce tarť de la morgue
est devenu expert sur notre mŤre ?
Il s'est renseignť en faisant
des recherches,
mais le plus important
c'est de savoir s'il a raison.
Et si c'est le cas.
Qu'est-ce que je vais encore apprendre ?
<i>Ep.1-14 - Daddy's Girl</i>
Tu connais la nouvelle technologie
dont tout le monde parle ?
«a s'appelle un lit.
Dťsolťe, j'ai ťtť malade derniŤrement.
- Ta garde est terminťe, va te reposer.
- Terminťe ? Depuis quand ?
Je dois retrouver Meredith et Harrison
au resto dans 3 minutes.
- Nos parents sont en ville.
- Ton pŤre ?
MÍme si on ne l'a pas vu depuis 5 ans,
il nous rend toujours aussi fous.
Donc tu veux qu'on parle de papa.
En fait je voulais savoir qui allait
prendre des toasts grillťs.
On attend quelqu'un ?
Oui, ŗ ce propos.
Tu as demandť si je voulais dire
quelque chose sur papa.
Donc j'ai amenť quelqu'un qui pourra
mieux en parler.
Sa femme.
Le petit dťjeuner ťtait piťgť.
N'en voulez pas ŗ Meredith.
C'ťtait mon idťe.
Vous savez que ce week-end
c'est l'anniversaire de votre pŤre.
Et comme il vient pour une confťrence,
je l'ai convaincu d'organiser une soirťe.
Ici en ville.
Et j'ai pensť
que de passer son anniversaire
avec ses enfants serait une bonne chose.
- Les enfants de quel mariage ?
- Fais un effort Harry
- C'est juste un groupe restreint.
- Je travaille de nuit.
Ils te laisseront sortir pour manger, non ?
Essaye de venir ce soir.
Tu peux au moins faire Áa ?
C'est marrant.
Je me disais la mÍme chose ŗ son propos
durant mes 10 derniers anniversaires.
- Tru, je suis dťsolťe.
- Pour quoi ?
Pour avoir brisť le mariage de mes parents,
ou avoir fait semblant de l'ignorer ?
Je viens de me rappeler que j'ai un RDV.
Cela peut vous surprendre,
mais certains candidats ont un profil douteux.
Ce qui n'est pas votre cas.
6 ans en tant que technicien mťdical urgentiste.
- Vous Ítes mÍme surqualifiť pour ce poste.
- J'ai aussi mon loyer ŗ payer.
…coutez, je suis ici parce qu'on dit
que le travail est trŤs convenable.
Des heures raisonnables,
roulement des employťs.
Vous avez de bonnes rťfťrences.
J'ai encore d'autres candidats
pour ce poste mais...
- Je vous fais visiter.
- Super.
C'est la salle d'affectation.
Tout se passe ici en fait.
C'est plutŰt calme aujourd'hui.
Vous utilisez LFD
pour gťrer vos dossiers ?
Oui.
Semaine peu chargťe.
C'est bon signe
si on n'a pas trop de boulot, non ?
- Je peux prendre quelque chose ŗ boire ?
- Oui, c'est juste lŗ.
Merci.
Timing parfait,
imprťvu mais Áa tombe bien.
Je les ai oubliťes ce matin.
Voici Jack Harper,
il devrait remplacer Gardez.
- Salut, Jack.
- Salut, Tru.
Il faut que vous l'ťcriviez ?
Juste pour ťviter qu'on ne me le pique.
On n'est jamais trop prudent
avec tous ces vols de canettes.
Et moi qui croyais
que vous n'aviez pas vu mon prťnom.
Je prendrai sŻrement ma dťcision
d'ici cet aprŤs-midi.
Parfait.
Vous savez oý me trouver.
Pardon, merci.
Il a une sacrťe expťrience.
J'espŤre qu'il la bonifiera ailleurs.
Tout va bien ?
Bien.
Je ne comprends pas comment on peut
embaucher quelqu'un comme Áa.
J'imagine que tu as quelques tracas,
mais est-ce vraiment Jack la cause ?
Salut Claire,
C'est Tru.
- Je sais qui tu es.
- Comme cela fait longtemps...
- Je cherche Jordan, ta maman.
- Elle n'est pas lŗ, tu veux parler ŗ papa ?
- Non c'est pas grave.
- Papa !
Salut papa.
C'est bon de...
Je te croyais ŗ une confťrence.
Je cherchais Jordan.
Claire, fais-moi plaisir
Va surveiller ton petit frŤre.
Entre, ou tu es pressťe ?
Jordan est allťe faire quelques courses.
Mais elle sera ŗ la fÍte ce soir,
si cela peut attendre.
Je ne sais pas si je pourrai venir.
Tu sais, le travail
Jordan m'a parlť
de votre entrevue ce matin.
«a lui fera plaisir de savoir
que tu es venue pour t'excuser.
M'excuser ? Non
J'ai ťtť un peu froide c'est vrai.
J'ťtais contrariťe.
Contre Jordan ?
Ou contre moi ?
Je ferais mieux d'y aller.
- Viens ce soir, d'accord ?
- Si je peux.
Regarde-toi.
Tu ressembles tellement ŗ ta mŤre.
C'ťtait ta mŤre. Tes pouvoirs,
elle les avait aussi.
Jordan c'est encore moi. Oý es-tu ?
Je dois m'inquiťter ? Appelle-moi
- J'ai pu m'ťchapper.
- Content que tu l'aies fait.
Je ne peux pas rester longtemps.
Oý est Jordan ? J'aimerais lui parler.
En retard, comme d'habitude.
On devait se retrouver aprŤs son shopping.
Elle est comme Áa.
Elle t'achŤte sŻrement
un cadeau de derniŤre minute.
Hť bien, regarde qui voilŗ.
Allez.
Salut.
Je te prťsente
mon adorable petite-amie Lindsay.
- Enchantťe Mr Davies
- L'amie d'ťcole de Tru c'est Áa ?
C'est la premiŤre fois
qu'Harrison me prťsente quelqu'un.
Cela ne se justifiait pas, avant.
- Lindsay, allons chercher ŗ boire.
- C'ťtait sympa de vous rencontrer.
Elle semble trŤs gentille cette Lindsay
- Et c'est parti.
- Ne monte pas sur tes grands chevaux.
Tu as tellement d'options.
Pourquoi te limites-tu ?
D'habitude tu rťserves tes prťcieux conseils
pour les cartes de voeux.
Ne les g‚che pas ce soir.
J'essayais simplement de dire
que tu te dťbrouilles bien.
Ne te laisse pas enfermer dans cette aventure.
Tu es jeune, garde les yeux ouverts.
Pour ne pas laisser passer la bonne.
En fait,
c'est juste ma petite-amie.
Ce n'est pas si fort.
Je sais ŗ quoi m'en tenir.
- Bonsoir.
- Salut.
- Comment ťtait la soirťe ?
- Un fiasco.
J'y suis allťe pour m'excuser auprŤs de Jordan,
mais elle n'ťtait pas lŗ
- Tru, concernant ta mŤre, je voulais juste...
- Tout va bien.
J'ai eu mon lot de discussions
pour la journťe.
Et pour le voleur de soda ?
Quand commence-t-il ?
Il ne reste pas.
- J'ai vťrifiť ses rťfťrences et...
- Elles ťtaient fausses ?
Non, mais il a tendance ŗ quitter
son boulot du jour au lendemain.
Son prťcťdent employeur se demandait
oý il ťtait passť.
Donc ce sera juste toi et moi.
- Qui nous a apportť Áa ?
- Coaplin, des urgences.
Il m'aide en attendant un remplaÁant.
Il a dŻ passer quand j'ťtais en pause.
Une victime d'agression il me semble.
Oh mon Dieu !
Jordan.
Papa, je...
Je sais.
Tu ne t'en souviens probablement pas
mais ta mŤre.
C'est ici qu'ils l'ont amenťe.
On peut la faire transfťrer si tu veux.
C'est de ma faute.
- Je n'aurais pas dŻ la laisser partir.
- Tu ne pouvais rien faire.
Elle s'est faite agresser.
Si seulement je pouvais changer le passť.
- Tu devrais leur parler.
- Je le ferai.
Je me souviens de certaines choses
de la nuit oý maman est morte.
Des choses que je prťfťrerais ne pas avoir vťcues.
Il n'ont pas ŗ vivre Áa.
Tout est prÍt.
Je surveille les petits.
C'est bon, je m'en occupe.
Attends-moi ici.
Laisse papa s'en occuper.
Bon.
- Et maintenant ?
- Je m'en charge.
- Tu es sŻre que...
- C'est mon boulot
Le tien est de veiller sur tes enfants.
Ils auront besoin de leur pŤre.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Rentre chez toi, je m'en occupe.
Je suis sťrieux.
Personne ne te donnera de mťdaille
pour ton courage.
Allez, rentre chez toi.
Tu ne peux pas sauver tout le monde.
Rentre chez toi.
La victime a subi plusieurs coups de couteau.
Quoi ?
Je ne t'ai pas parlť
Sexe: fťminin.
<i>TRU !</i>
ArrÍte-le.
Oh mon Dieu, Davis.
Je suis vraiment dťsolťe.
Ce cafť est brŻlant.
C'est la 3Ťme fois que tu t'endors aprŤs ta garde
Pourquoi ne...
Je ne peux pas. Je t'ai parlť de ma belle-mŤre,
Jordan, n'est-ce pas ?
Elle est en ville et elle va Ítre tuťe
dans la journťe.
Je vois le genre de journťe.
Et au sujet de ce Jack,
vťrifie ses rťfťrences avant l'entretien.
«a t'ťvitera d'Ítre dťÁu.
Oý vas-tu maintenant ?
C'est dur ŗ croire, mais je vais tenter
de m'entendre avec ma belle-mŤre
- Tru.
- Jordan.
Salut, c'est inattendu.
Elle voulait nous voir pour nous parler
de quelque chose.
Je me disais justement que Áa serait bien
d'apprendre ŗ se connaÓtre.
Vraiment ?
J'aimerais beaucoup.
«a va faciliter ma demande.
C'est l'anniversaire de ton pŤre
et je lui organise une soirťe
Je serai lŗ.
Tu disais qu'elle me remballerait.
Je suis ravie Tru, merci.
Excusez-moi, je reviens.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Tu n'as jamais ťtť aimable avec elle.
Aujourd'hui,
on a tous notre lot de surprise.
«a gaze les enfants ?
Jordan est en ville.
Elle organise une soirťe
pour papa ce soir.
- et Tru...
- l'a rembarrťe ?
Elle a dit qu'elle s'y rendrait.
Elle a ťtť tuťe,
Tu dťlires ?
Pourquoi tu crois que je suis lŗ ?
Je n'ai pas le choix
Elle a ťtť tuťe, a demandť mon aide
La journťe a recommencť
Et je suis coincťe avec elle
une journťe entiŤre.
On va choisir le g‚teau.
On se retrouve plus tard ?
Je peux me joindre ŗ vous ?
Pour organiser la fÍte.
Bien sŻr Tru, Áa serait super.
Qu'est-ce qu'on s'amuse.
Vous nous excusez un instant.
Tu ne peux pas me dire tout Áa
et t'enfuir vers une boulangerie.
- Tu vas faire quelque chose ?
- Non pas tout de suite.
Quand papa verra Lindsay ce soir.
Dis-lui ce que tu ressens.
Et pas ce qu'il veut entendre.
Il sera content, toi aussi.
C'est le bureau, je reviens
Alors Jordan, oý vas-tu aprŤs ?
Retour ŗ l'hŰtel ou...
- Tu dois rencontrer quelqu'un d'autre ?
- «a dťpend du temps qu'il restera
Quel genre de g‚teau veut-il cette annťe
ŗ ton avis ?
Je suis vraiment mal placťe
pour connaÓtre les goŻts de Richard Davis.
On a Áa en commun alors.
Qu'est-ce que Áa veut dire ?
Tru, j'aime ton pŤre.
Et j'arrive ŗ le cerner parfois.
Ce n'est pas pour autant
que je le connais.
Je pense qu'une seule personne
a rťussi ŗ le connaÓtre entiŤrement.
C'ťtait ta mŤre
Nous, on n'a droit qu'aux restes.
- Je peux vous aider ?
- On va prendre le gros au chocolat.
Vous ťtiez Technicien mťdical urgentiste.
Pourquoi ce changement ?
La vťritť, c'est que je pense avoir
fait le tour de ce boulot.
J'ai contactť vos anciens employeurs.
Ils disent tous la mÍme chose.
Vous Ítes un bon ťlťment mais du jour
au lendemain, vous disparaissez.
Vous voulez m'en parler ?
Il y a quelques annťes, je...
Je suis mort.
Pardon.
J'ťtais sur les lieux d'un crime, ŗ travailler
sur un gamin de 9 ans.
On lui avait tirť dessus dans le dos.
Je venais d'avoir un pouls.
Mais quelqu'un lui en voulait vraiment.
Il a commencť ŗ tirer.
J'ai pris la balle ŗ sa place.
Je me souviens...
C'ťtait comme une aiguille
derriŤre mon oreille, ici.
Pendant 3 minutes et 28 secondes,
mon coeur s'est arrÍtť.
Et puis, je suis revenu.
Et c'ťtait comment ?
On dit qu'une telle expťrience vous change.
Vous donne envie de vivre pleinement.
Mais, pour moi,
cela a juste...
J'ai perdu cette envie.
J'ai senti qu'il fallait que j'arrÍte.
«a ne pouvait pas continuer.
Je ne me sentais plus capable
d'assumer la vie des autres.
J'ai alors pensť que la solution
ťtait de partir loin.
«a n'a pas ťtť le cas.
J'espŤre qu'en changeant de vocation
cela fonctionnera.
Certains diraient que vous avez ťtť ramenť
pour une certaine raison.
On verra bien.
J'aime bien passer
par le parc.
Ces villes me font sentir
moins vivante.
- Tu ne prťfŤres pas prendre un taxi ?
- Un taxi ? Non, on n'est plus trŤs loin.
J'ai beaucoup apprťciť le fait que
tu m'aies donnť une 2nde chance aujourd'hui.
Je n'en sais pas la raison,
mais j'en profite sans hťsiter.
Nous nous disputons peu avec ton pŤre.
Mais quand c'est le cas, c'est souvent
concernant sa relation avec vous 3
Vraiment ?
D'aprŤs moi,
son dťtachement vient
de son sentiment de culpabilitť.
Concernant la maniŤre
dont il a gťrť la situation.
Mais il est diffťrent maintenant
Il...
Il veut amťliorer la situation.
Il a changť.
- C'est un homme diffťrent, Tru.
- Jordan, attention.
On sait pourquoi on a quittť la ville.
Ils se gargarisent avec
leur taux de criminalitť en baisse.
Je vais m'allonger un peu avant la soirťe.
Merci.
- Que ce serait-il passť sans toi ?
- Tu vas bien, c'est l'essentiel.
Quelle journťe !
- Quand c'est pas les petits, c'est Jordan.
- Heureusement elle va bien.
Heureusement, tu ťtais avec elle.
C'est une femme charmante.
J'aurais dŻ m'en rendre compte avant.
- Je ferais mieux d'y aller.
- C'est bien que tu ne lui en veuilles plus.
- Lui en vouloir ? De quoi ?
- Moi et ta mŤre.
…coute, j'ai aidť Jordan,
mais ce n'est pas bon moment pour...
On aurait dŻ en discuter
depuis longtemps. Assieds-toi.
Quand j'ai rencontrť Jordan,
j'ťtais encore mariť avec ta mŤre.
«a je le savais, papa.
Mais on avait dťjŗ dťcidť de divorcer.
Quoi ?
Je ne le savais pas.
Parce que je ne le voulais pas.
J'aimais ta mŤre Tru
mais la rťalitť est que....
Nous avons pris des chemins diffťrents.
Elle est devenue distante.
Imprťvisible.
Elle disparaissait sans arrÍt.
Parfois en pleine nuit.
Ses excuses ťtaient ridicules.
Comme si elle menait une...
DeuxiŤme vie.
En vťritť, quand j'ai rencontrť Jordan,
je me sentais seul depuis des annťes.
J'en ai dit assez,
un peu trop mÍme.
Le passť est le passť.
On se voit donc ce soir.
«a ferait ťnormťment plaisir ŗ Jordan
si tu pouvais faire une apparition.
Et ŗ moi aussi
<i>Joyeux anniversaire Richard</i>
- Tu as pu venir
- Comment Áa se passe ?
- Tu es splendide
- Tout comme toi
Deux enfants sont passťs par lŗ.
Je vous prťsente Tru.
Jordan n'arrÍte pas
de chanter tes louanges.
Il y a pas mal de personnes
que j'aimerais te prťsenter
Harrison.
Papa.
Je te prťsente ma chťrie, Lindsay
- M. Davies.
- Vous Ítes l'amie d'ťcole de Tru ?
C'est trŤs sympa de vous revoir.
Elle semble gentille.
C'est le cas.
La plus gentille que j'aie rencontrťe.
- C'est bon ŗ savoir mais ŗ ton ‚ge...
- A mon ‚ge, tu as rencontrť... maman.
Et tu ne considŤres pas Áa
comme une erreur ?
- Non, pas une seule seconde.
- Penses-y, tu as 3 enfants formidables.
Si Áa t'avait ťchappť.
Je vois oý tu veux en venir
Parfois, tu es si imprťvisible.
- Papa
- Quoi ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Il est lŗ
- De qui parles-tu ?
- L'homme qui a attaquť Jordan, je l'ai vu.
- Il est lŗ maintenant ?
- «a signifie qu'il en a aprŤs elle.
J'appelle la police
Ne quitte pas Jordan des yeux.
Excusez-moi.
Vous.
Qu'est-ce que vous lui voulez ?
La fille est toujours
la derniŤre au courant.
<i>Oý est ta fille ?</i>
C'ťtait vous.
Vous avez tuť ma mŤre.
Qu'est-ce que vous nous voulez ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Papa m'a parlť d'un problŤme avec Jordan.
- Il ťtait lŗ.
- L'homme qui l'a attaquťe ?
- L'homme qui a tuť maman.
- Quoi ?
C'est la mÍme personne.
Trouve Jordan et assure-toi
qu'elle est en sťcuritť
Vas-y, dťpÍche-toi !
Tu es allť trop loin cette fois.
Je te le dis pour la derniŤre fois
C'est terminť, compris ?
Je ne veux plus jamais te revoir.
Tru, attends.
- Laisse-moi une chance de t'expliquer.
- Tu le connais.
- Ce n'est pas ce que tu penses.
- Tu ne t'imagines pas ŗ quoi je pense.
Oui, je le connais.
Il a fait de la prison.
Il s'appelle Carl Neesan.
- Et tu le sais parce que ?
- C'est moi qui l'ai reconnu coupable.
J'ťtais flic il y a 15 ans.
C'ťtait un gamin accusť de meurtre.
Il se disait innocent comme tous les autres.
Il y avait peu de preuves.
Je voulais marquer le coup,
alors je l'ai beaucoup chargť.
Il ťtait coupable ?
Le jury l'a dťclarť coupable.
Cela m'a suffi.
Lors de la sentence, il a jurť de se venger.
Qu'il me ferait payer ŗ sa sortie.
Pourquoi aujourd'hui ?
Pourquoi c'est aujourd'hui qu'il se montre ?
Tu penses que c'est la premiŤre fois
«a fait des annťes que Áa dure.
Il se montre et demande de l'argent.
Il me menace donc je le paye.
Et puis il s'en va,
jusqu'ŗ la fois d'aprŤs.
Et aujourd'hui ?
Je lui ai dit que j'arrÍtais tout,
que je ne paierai plus.
Je ne pensais pas qu'il mettrait
ses menaces ŗ exťcution.
Et je ne voulais pas t'impliquer.
Ni toi, ni Jordan.
Et pour maman ?
Que vient faire ta mŤre dans tout Áa ?
Il l'a tuťe.
Il a tuť maman.
- Qu'est-ce qui te fait dire Áa ?
- J'ťtais prťsente.
- Chťrie.
- J'ai entendu sa voix.
Je n'oublierai jamais cette voix.
Il a tuť maman parce qu'il t'en voulait.
Il voulait se venger.
- Tru, non.
- Ne me dis pas non.
- J'y ťtais, je l'ai vu appuyer sur la dťtente.
- Ce n'est pas ce qui est arrivť.
- Pourquoi tu ne m'as rien dit...
- C'est faux.
C'ťtait bien ťvidemment
mon premier suspect.
L'enquÍte en est arrivťe ŗ la conclusion
que ce n'ťtait pas lui.
Il avait un alibi en bťton.
Ce n'est pas lui, M. Davies.
Mais j'ai entendu sa voix.
Tu as vu son visage ?
Non.
Quand une question reste longtemps en suspens.
On veut une rťponse.
Notre esprit nous joue alors des tours
pour en trouver une.
Mais nous sommes dans l'erreur.
- Rentrons, il fait froid
- Je ne peux pas, je dois aller au boulot
- Ce soir ?
- Ils m'attendent.
Joyeux anniversaire papa
<i>1m85, 90kg, ch‚tain</i>
Tru, tu en as dťjŗ assez vu
Rentre chez toi et repose-toi
Se reposer, c'est un nouveau concept.
Si Neesan n'a pas tuť ma mŤre,
Áa veut dire que c'est vrai ?
Quoi ?
Que sa mort a un rapport avec sa vocation.
Tru, malgrť ce que tu peux penser.
Je n'ai pas toutes les rťponses
Mais je te promets de t'aider ŗ les trouver.
Merci Davis.
Je vais t'ťcouter.
Rentrer, me relaxer
et essayer de dormir.
On dirait que tu n'as pas engagť Jack.
En fait, je l'ai fait
J'ai dťcidť de suivre mon intuition.
- Bizarre.
- Pourquoi ?
Hier il a pris un soda,
celui avec mon nom dessus.
Et aujourd'hui, il est encore lŗ
Tu sais ŗ quel point tu peux
changer le destin.
Hier tu l'as rencontrť,
aujourd'hui non.
On ne peut pas prťvoir les consťquences.
Oui, certainement.
Donne-lui une chance.
Tu ne regretteras pas plus tard.
il est ŗ cŰtť.
«a deviendra moins pťnible.
Quoi ?
Ceci, faire ce que l'on fait.
Toutes ces personnes, parties trop vite.
«a semble parfois injuste.
Je n'y ai jamais vraiment pensť.
C'est une faÁon de gťrer cela,
mais si tu veux parler.
Parfois, Áa aide.
Tu sais ce qui est injuste selon moi ?
Quand les machines gardent quelqu'un en vie.
Quand la vie est prolongťe au-delŗ de son utilitť.
«a, c'est injuste.
- Oui, sŻrement.
- Je vais Ítre honnÍte.
Je pense que la mort est la meilleure chose
qui soit arrivťe ŗ certaines de ces personnes.
Tu as dit n'y avoir jamais pensť.
Tu m'as eu.
Je voulais me prťsenter,
je suis Tru.
- Le nom sur le soda.
- Oui c'est Áa.
Jack.
Merci pour m'accueillir de la sorte.
C'est pas ťvident d'Ítre le nouveau.
«a te rappelle des choses,
pas vrai ?
- «a va ?
- Oui.
Ne bouge pas, reste ici.
Non, il te tuera, c'est lui qui a tuť maman.
J'en suis sŻre.
Je te crois, Tru.
Et je vais y mettre une fin
- Non papa.
- Ferme la porte et attends-moi.
- Le charme de l'‚ge n'est plus efficace, Richard.
- Pour qui te prends-tu ?
Pour l'homme que tu as payť
pour tuer ta premiŤre femme.
<i>Supprimer</i> selon tes termes.
On avait un deal, je te payais
et tu disparaissais.
Tu ne l'as pas respectť.
J'y mets donc un terme.
Je t'ai parlť de la lettre n'est-ce pas ?
La lettre explicative envoyťe ŗ ta fille,
si je mourais subitement.
Tru, vas-t'en.
Vas-t'en.
Maintenant.
La prochaine fois, il n'y aura pas d'avertissement
Ce sera une balle dans ton coeur.
Adieu, Carl.
Est-ce que tu as ...?
Est-ce qu'il est ...?
C'est terminť mon bťbť
C'est terminť.
Papa s'en est occupť.

<i>Tru, il est 13h.
Tu dors encore ?</i>
Plus maintenant.
- <i>Tu sais que j'ai travaillť tard.</i>
- Jack t'attend. Tu devais lui prťsenter le service.
- Tu as oubliť ?
- Non, je n'ai pas oubliť.
Je serai juste en retard.
Elle sera en retard.
On va commencer ici.
Voici notre station d'enregistrement numťrique.
- Elle nous permet de...
- d'analyser le cadavre ŗ la recherche de traumas,
avant de rťfťrencer le nom
et le numťro dans la base de donnťes.
Tout-ŗ-fait.
Ici, c'est le scanner.
Pour numťriser et imprimer
les empreintes digitales.
Je connais dťjŗ tout Áa.
Si je l'avais su,
je ne me serais pas levťe si tŰt.
Nous n'aurions pas pu
passer du temps ensemble.
A vrai dire,
Il y a 2 ou 3 trucs
que je ne sais pas.
Comme ?
Tu aimes vraiment bosser ici ?
Je te le demande parce que
tu n'as pas l'air
d'une employťe de morgue.
Ah, et j'ai l'air de quoi ?
Tu as l'air d'une fille
qui prend les choses trop au sťrieux,
Qui devrait profiter de ses journťes,
mais qui passe ses soirťes du vendredi,
seule devant la tťlť,
avec un repas au micro-ondes.
Je rťcupŤre les effets personnels du dťfunt ?
Je ne passe pas
tous mes vendredi soirs chez moi.
Et toi, tu fais quoi
le vendredi soir ?
Devine.
Tu ne restes pas chez toi,
c'est sŻr.
Parce que tu n'aimes pas rester seul,
c'est pas ton genre.
Alors tu sors, au bar,
ou en boÓte.
Et aprŤs quelques heures tu rentres,
parfois seul,
mais souvent accompagnť
d'une bimbo dťvergondťe,
qui ne te comprend pas,
mais d'une faÁon ou d'une autre.
Tu es plus souvent seul que moi.
Devant ta tťlť,
avec un repas micro-ondes.
Je n'ai pas de micro-ondes.
Mais tu ne m'as toujours pas rťpondu.
«a te plaÓt ici ?
Oui, j'aime bien.
Je comprends.
Ce n'est pas le cas
de la majoritť des gens.
C'est parce que la plupart
pensent que seuls les vivants
ont besoin d'aide.
File-les moi !
Tout de suite !
- Je peux vous aider ?
- Bien sŻr
Ouvre le coffre sous
le comptoir et remplis ce sac.
Il n'y a pas de coffre.
Ouvre-le ou je la tue !

Maintenant !
…pisode 15 - The Getaway
- Harrison Davies ?
- Ouais.
 tes-vous le frŤre de Tru Davies ?
- «a intťresse qui ?
- Michelle Carey, du <i>Post-Dispatch</i>
Ah ouais,
Tru m'a parlť de vous.
J'ai quelques questions
ŗ propos de votre soeur.
Elle apparaÓt souvent sur les lieux de crimes,
qu'est-ce que vous pouvez me dire ?
Dťsolť MichŤle,
je ne parle pas aux journalistes.
«a me rend nerveux.
Je lui passerai la commission.
Harri, quelle surprise !
Tu me connais,
je suis plein de surprises.
Mon frŤre Harrison, Jack.
- Salut, Jack Harper.
- Ravi de te connaÓtre mec.
- Tu as deux minutes ?
- Oui.
- J'ai vu Michelle la reporter.
- Et ?
J'ai pas dit un mot.
<i>...ŗ 15h00, et a rel‚chť l'otage peu aprŤs.</i>
- Qu'est-ce qui t'amŤne ?
- Je viens juste prendre des nouvelles.
- M'assurer que tu vas bien
- «a va, pourquoi ?
ņ propos de l'autre fois avec papa.
C'ťtait vraiment le meurtrier de maman ?
Je le pense.
Ils n'ont pas retrouvť son corps.
Fais confiance au vieux,
il a dŻ s'en charger.
Je suppose que tu n'es pas venu
que pour parler de Áa.
Bien, maintenant que tu le dis,
«a fait pile trois mois
qu'on est ensemble avec Lindsay.
- Tu t'en es souvenu ?
- Oui.
«a ne veut rien dire pour moi,
mais Áa compte beaucoup pour elle.
Alors, j'ai rťservť une table,
ŗ <i>La Petite Fleur...</i>
- Bref
- C'est bien, elle va adorer.
Le problŤme c'est que je suis ŗ sec.
Si tu pouvais m'avancer un peu d'argent,
Je ferais en sorte que
ta meilleure amie, Lindsay
passe une soirťe inoubliable.
T'as de la chance,
c'est jour de paye.
C'est un restaurant de luxe.
Il doit y avoir un valet de parking.
- Je me garerai dans la rue.
- Va-t'en.
Je vais la chercher.
T'es la meilleure.
C'est Áa petit, vas-y, vas-y !
Allez <i>Eight Ball</i>
Continue,
vas-y <i>Eight Ball, allez</i> !
Ne te rel‚che pas, vas-y.
Je l'encourage un peu.
Vu que je sors ma copine
ce soir, tu vois.
On dirait que tu as perdu.
Allez une derniŤre.
Une course pour me refaire.
- Tu as des tuyaux ce soir ?
- Pas grand chose.
- Je parierais sur <i>Deep Shaker</i>
- <i>Deep Shaker</i>?
- Il est ŗ 20 contre 1.
Je suis bien avancť avec Áa mec !
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Je voulais te remercier d'avoir passť
ton aprŤs-midi ŗ m'aider.
- Sans problŤme
- Alors tu ne m'en veux pas ?
Pourquoi je t'en voudrais ?
Je voulais Ítre sŻr de ne pas
avoir fait mauvaise impression.
Non c'est pas ton cas,
tu as trŤs bien...
Salut.
Voici Jack, le nouvel intendant.
Luc est photographe des scŤnes de crime.
- Enchantť
- Moi de mÍme.
Alors ?
- Alors comment Áa va ?
- Bien.
- Dťbordť.
- Moi aussi.
Comme toujours.
En parlant de dťbordť,
je dois y aller.
ņ bientŰt.
A bientŰt, Jack.
- Ravi de t'avoir connu.
- Moi aussi.
- Vous Ítes restťs longtemps ensemble ?
- Quoi ?
J'ai vu les regards prolongťs.
- Les phrases non terminťes.
- De quoi tu parles ?
Je dirais que Áa a durť 2 mois.
Et puis tout est devenu compliquť.
Et vous avez rompu.
Maintenant tu te demandes,
si tu as fait le bon choix,
ou le choix le plus facile.
C'est ŗ peu prŤs Áa.
Et lŗ c'est le moment oý
tu t'ťtends sur le fait
que je suis beaucoup trop sťrieuse.
Non, j'allais dire que suis dťsolť que
Áa ne ce soit pas bien passť.
Comment Áa se passe avec Jack ?
- Pas trop mal
- Pourquoi ? Il ne connaÓt pas le matťriel ?
Non, c'est pas Áa.
Il est intelligent et connaÓt son mťtier.
Je n'arrive pas ŗ le cerner.
Parfois il est collť ŗ moi
et dťsagrťable.
L'instant d'aprŤs il est adorable et
essaie d'Ítre amical.
Il essaie juste de prendre ses marques.
Tu te souviens de tes premiers jours ici ?
On a vraiment besoin de son aide
du fait de ton emploi du temps.
Peut-Ítre.
Ceci dit, je dois y aller,
on se voit ce soir.
- Ce soir ?
- Oui, ŗ l'expo de Luc.
- Quelle expo ?
- Rien d'important.
Luc fait une exposition de photos
dans une galerie.
C'est pas une grosse expo,
j'ai ťtť invitť ŗ la derniŤre minute.
C'est bon, on a rompu tu sais.
Et je travaille ce soir de toutes faÁons.
- Je te l'ai dťjŗ dit ?
- Oui 3 fois.
- C'est complŤtement...
- C'est bon.
Tu n'avais pas ŗ faire tout Áa
pour fÍter nos 3 mois.
Mais je suis trop contente que tu l'aies fait.
Vivement le dessert.
Ils font de super soufflťs au chocolat.
Tout va bien ?
Qui ? Quoi ?
Rien, on dirait que tu te prťpares ŗ t'enfuir.
Mon dieu, prends un verre d'eau.
«a va monsieur ?
Mon dieu !
Une arÍte !
Elle ťtait dans mon veau,
j'ai failli m'ťtouffer.
Je suis navrť monsieur.
- Je vais changer votre assiette
- Un autre plat ?
Avec une autre arÍte ?
Je crois pas mon pote.
La maison vous fait cadeau de ce repas.
Mon repas. Et le sien ?
C'est bon Harrison, nous allons rťgler mon repas.
Et merci pour tout.
Harrison, assieds-toi.
Une arÍte ?
Tu as commandť du veau, imbťcile.
Laisse-moi deviner.
Tu n'as pas un sou, n'est-ce pas ?
Voici un nouveau chapitre dans le livre
des dťceptions d'Harrison Davies.
Qui eut cru...
que <i>Deep Shaker</i> allait gagner.
Il ťtait ŗ 20 contre 1.
20 contre 1 !
<i>Dans cette ťpidťmie de crimes,</i>
<i>le tireur a encore pris
une cliente comme bouclier.</i>
<i>Dans un magasin de vÍtements, vers 18h.</i>
<i>L'absence de camťras...</i>
- Alors Linds, ce repas ?
- <i>Parfait.</i>
Jusqu'ŗ ce que ton frŤre fasse
semblant de s'ťtouffer avec l'entrťe.
Quoi ?
<i>Il a essayť de se faire offrir les repas,
vu qu'il a tout perdu aux courses.</i>
- Tu plaisantes ?
- <i>Je sais que Áa fait mal.</i>
Je crois que je vais rompre.
…coute, c'est mon frŤre et je l'adore,
- Mais si tu as besoin de quoi que ce soit...
- ņ part un soufflť au chocolat...
Je t'appelle demain.
Allez, salut.
Ton frŤre a des soucis ?
Dťsolť.
Je n'ai pas pu m'empÍcher d'ťcouter
Tout va bien ?
- Rien de spťcial.
- FrŤre et soeur.
- Ils peuvent t'attendrir comme personne.
- Tu as des frŤres et soeurs ?
J'avais une soeur,
elle est dťcťdťe il y a quelques annťes.
Je suis dťsolťe.
Merci, c'est gentil de ta part.
Mais je suis sŻr qu'elle est heureuse.
Je sais que Áa a l'air d'un clichť.
Mais j'y crois vraiment.
Elle ťtait malade,
elle ne l'est plus.
Enfin, je sais ce que tu traverses avec ton frŤre.
Tu penses que tu dois veiller sur lui.
Exactement.
Pourtant tu dois le laisser faire ses propres
erreurs de temps en temps.
Apprendre <i>ŗ la dure</i>, tu vois.
A propos d'erreurs,
J'ai pris une soupe au distributeur.
- Oublie Áa, c'est immangeable.
- Oui.
Tu sais oý je peux trouver un truc
mangeable dans le coin ?
Le resto ŗ 2 blocs d'ici, est correct.
Je vais y chercher un plat ŗ emporter,
je t'en prends ?
- Seulement si je paye.
- Marchť conclu.
J'ai commandť au nom de Davies.
- C'est prÍt dans 2 minutes.
- J'attends lŗ-bas.
Bonsoir Tru.
- On se connaÓt ?
- Michelle Carey.
On s'est parlť plusieurs fois au tťlťphone.
Je n'ai rien ŗ vous dire.
J'ai vu votre frŤre ce matin,
il n'a pas voulu me parler.
«a fait un mois que vous ťvitez mes appels.
VŰtre patron a dŻ vous parler de notre entrevue.
Il m'a surtout dit qu'il a dŻ vous virer.
Suicides avortťs, tentatives de meurtres,
accidents ťvitťs. Que de prouesses.
Pourquoi vous Ítes toujours
sur les lieux avant la police ?
Hormis le fait que votre mŤre
faisait la mÍme chose.
- Je ne vois pas de quoi vous parlez.
- Ce n'est pas le problŤme Tru.
Racontez-moi votre version.
Ou vous lirez la mienne dans
le journal ce week-end.
Je la publierai,
que vous me parliez ou pas.
<i>Votre commande !</i>
Au dťbut, j'ai cru au "complexe du hťros".
Que vous mettiez en scŤne ces incidents,
et sauviez ces gens.
- Mais vous n'en tirez aucun crťdit.
- Il n'y a rien de secret dans tout Áa.
Personne ne bouge, ou elle meurt.
Passe la caisse, vite !
Ce type a dťjŗ braquť 2 fois aujourd'hui.
Il prend toujours quelqu'un en otage.
Taisez-vous, tous !
Remplis-le !
Je rigole pas ! Je vais la tuer !
Police,
L‚chez votre arme !
J'ai besoin d'aide, vite !
«a va aller Michelle, Áa va aller.
Tenez bon Michelle,
Appelez les secours, vite !
Tenez bon.
Vite !
Oh, non.
Elle est ?
Oui.
J'ai besoin de vous.
- Allo
- <i>Tru, tu es debout.</i>
C'est le premier jour de Jack.
Dis-lui que j'arrive.
Encore.
Tru, tu ne montres pas le bon exemple.
Dťsolťe, je ne voulais pas te faire attendre.
C'est pas grave, j'ai l'habitude.
Bien, Davis je peux te parler 2 minutes ?
Dans ton bureau.
- Je reviens.
- Je t'attends.
C'est Michelle la journaliste qui
te demande de l'aide ?
Malheureusement,
et elle avait toutes ces questions,
- ņ propos de ce que je fais.
- On sait quelque chose d'autre ?
Le tireur a pris l'otage
blessťe pendant la fusillade.
Et il est parti avec.
Tu vas essayer de sauver
celle qui essaie de divulguer ton secret.
C'est assez ironique.
Que sais-tu du tireur ?
Il semble faire le marathon du crime aujourd'hui.
3 braquages en 5 heures.
Salle de jeux vidťo, magasin
et restaurant.
A chaque fois, il prend un otage comme bouclier.
- C'est inquiťtant.
- Tu es toujours inquiet.
Le fait que Michelle meure m'intrigue.
Le destin de certains est de mourir avant l'heure,
et pour d'autres c'est d'entraÓner la mort des premiers.
Si tu te retrouves au restaurant avec Michelle,
le destin en sera altťrť et
quelqu'un d'autre sera tuť.
- Mais Davis
- Et je dois ajouter,
Que si tu la sauves, elle te dťmasquera,
saura qui tu es, ton pouvoir.
Tu dois prťvenir les flics.
Car si tu arrives ŗ faire arrÍter le braqueur ŗ temps,
il ne se rendra pas au restaurant.
Michelle sera en sťcuritť et toi aussi.
Bien, j'y vais.
Vraiment ? C'ťtait facile !
Tu vas appeler la police ?
Oui, mais je dois faire en sorte
qu'ils attrapent ce gars.
- Sinon Michelle n'est pas en sťcuritť
- …coute-moi une minute !
Je sais que tu es douťe pour Áa.
Mais Áa n'empÍche pas que je sois inquiet.
«a veut dire beaucoup Davis.
Laisse ton portable allumť pendant l'expo de Luc.
On s'y retrouve, si tu as le temps.
Je n'ai pas ťtť invitťe.
T'inquiŤte pas,
je te rappelle plus tard.
Et cette visite ?
ProblŤmes personnels.
Je vous fais faire le tour cet aprŤs-midi.
Tru est trŤs occupťe.
Oui elle a de nombreux hobbies.
Pourquoi tu fonces ?
…coute, c'est gentil de t'Ítre
souvenu de l'anniversaire de vos 3 mois.
Mais je ne te donnerai pas d'argent.
D'oý est-ce que tu sors Áa ?
Pourquoi les jours que tu revis
sont un calvaire pour moi ?
Alors, qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Tu as perdu aux courses
tout ce que je t'avais donnť.
Dťsolť, tu devras Ítre plus inventif.
Et je vais te rendre un service.
Je t'emprunte ta voiture,
J'y vais.
Va sauver les autres,
et laisse ton frŤre ŗ la rue !
Il me faudrait un boulot.
Et puis quoi encore.
On dirait que t'es perdu <i>Airbud</i>.
- Tout va bien.
- Oui, gr‚ce ŗ ma soeur.
Tu dois Ítre le frŤre de Tru.
- Jack, le nouveau.
- Harrison.
- T'es sŻr que tout va bien ?
- Rien de grave.
Ma copine voulait sortir
fÍter cet anniversaire.
J'allais l'emmener au restaurant,
mais je suis ŗ sec.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais normalement pour
avoir de l'argent facile ?
Je parie sur les chevaux.
- Mais je n'ai pas un centime.
- J'adore les courses.
Pourquoi on n'irait pas ensemble
dťpenser quelques dollars ?
- Vraiment ?
- J'ai un peu de temps devant moi, allons-y.
Si on se dťpÍche on verra le derby.
Je voudrais vous signaler un braquage.
<i>Patientez svp.</i>
Officier Cooper, je peux vous aider ?
Quelqu'un que je connais
va commettre un braquage.
Quelqu'un que vous connaissez ?
- Votre nom ?
- Je prťfŤre ne pas le dire.
Cette personne vous a communiquť
le lieu et l'heure ?
La salle d'arcade sur la 51Ťme.
A quoi ressemble notre homme ?
25 ans, taille 1m80.
Cheveux noirs courts.
Il portait, euh, il porte un T-shirt orange
et une veste grise.
Nous envoyons une patrouille.
Merci. Faites vite.
Quoi de neuf Frankie ?
Tu me mets 20 dollars sur le 2.
Deux secondes.
Tu as changť d'avis ?
Si j'ai perdu en pariant...
De quoi tu parles ?
Tru m'a dit que je ne devrais pas.
Jouer aux courses.
Les paris vont me causer du tort.
Je ne connais Tru que depuis peu,
mais elle ne m'a pas semblť
Ítre experte bookmaker.
Non, elle est.
Tru est ... chanceuse, mec.
Comme moi.
Suis-moi et parie sur le cheval nį7.
- <i>Aidan's Luck</i> ?
- <i>Aidan's Luck</i> adore cette piste.
3 sur 3 sur cette distance.
Et la paire entraÓneur-driver
a 32% de rťussite.
Bien.
Dťsolť.
AprŤs rťflexion, j'ai changť d'avis,
gr‚ce ŗ mon nouveau consultant.
Mets 20 dollars sur le 7, gagnant.
File-moi Áa !
Maintenant !
Il y a un problŤme ?
Non, aucun problŤme.
Vous avez de la monnaie pour le parcmŤtre ?
- Vous avez vu quelque chose d'inhabituel ?
- ņ part ma clientŤle, non.
Appelez-nous au moindre problŤme.
Ils ont dŻ voir les flics.
Tu pourras te libťrer ce soir ?
- J'attends avec impatience
- Bien, c'est ma premiŤre expo.
Et j'ai peur qu'il y ait
plus de photos que d'invitťs.
Je sais que Tru est impatiente d'y aller.
Elle adore la photographie.
- Les photos, tout Áa.
- En fait, je n'ai pas invitť Tru.
Je ne le savais pas.
Tu sais elle va et vient,
je ne pense pas qu'elle ait le temps.
…coute, je ne suis pas expert
en relations fructueuses.
Ni en relations tout court, mais
Laisse-moi te dire.
Les gens peuvent te surprendre.
<i>ici Q47 il se passe quelque chose voiture 211 ?</i>.
<i>Ici McLane, 211 nťgatif.</i>.
<i>C'est ŗ dire ?</i>
Un abruti a fait une fausse alerte.
J'ai vťrifiť les lieux. Rien ŗ signaler.
<i>Compris, continuez votre ronde.</i>.
Si elle rappelle,
dites-lui qu'une fausse alerte est un dťlit.
Qu'est-ce que tu mijotes ?
Le tireur ne s'est pas montrť,
l'agression n'a pas eu lieu.
Tu es intervenue dans le cours des choses.
Ils ont vu les flics et ont filť.
- Il y a juste un problŤme.
- Le braqueur court toujours.
Et s'il continue ses agressions,
Michelle n'est pas sortie d'affaire.
Un nouvel appel anonyme
serait le bienvenu.
Tu paieras ma caution
quand ils m'auront arrÍtťe.
Dťsolť, mais c'est ŗ moi de jouer.
Je dois me rendre sur le 2nd lieu.
- Tru, c'est trop dangereux.
- Je ne peux pas tourner le dos au destin.
Qui sait ce qui peut arriver ?
Je dois y aller.
Alors prends Áa.
Un mťdaillon de Saint-Benedict.
«a te protťgera.
Il est dit que le corps et l'‚me
de ceux qui le portent sont protťgťs.
On me l'a donnť il y a longtemps.
Et j'aime ŗ penser qu'il m'a protťgť depuis.
«a va bien se passer.
Je l'espŤre.
- Je suis...
- Je sais. Tu dois y aller.
Je sais que tu es occupťe,
et je te prťviens au dernier moment,
- Si tu as le temps, passe ŗ mon expo
- Merci, je vais essayer.
J'espŤre.
Merci <i>Aidan's Luck</i>.
Merci, je ne sais pas ce que
j'aurais fait sans toi.
Non, en fait je sais.
Si seulement Tru voyait Áa !
Elle me ferait un peu plus confiance.
C'est quoi le problŤme avec ta soeur ?
Elle te surprotŤge, hein ?
Elle ne peut pas s'en empÍcher.
Depuis la mort de notre mŤre,
et notre pŤre qui nous a laissť tomber,
elle s'occupe de la famille.
C'est pour Áa qu'on dirait
qu'elle porte le monde sur ses ťpaules.
- Elle a pas mal de boulot en effet.
- Comme quoi ?
- Plus que tu peux imaginer.
- J'ai une sacrťe imagination.
Elle est unique en son genre.
ArrÍtons de parler d'elle.
Le plus important
c'est qui tu vois dans la prochaine course.
«a ne va pas te plaire.
<i>Deep Shaker.</i>
Quoi ? Il est ŗ 20 contre 1 !
Il aime l'extťrieur sur piste sŤche.
Il va peut-Ítre gagner.
Et si tu gagnes ce pari,
tu pourras payer 6 dÓners d'anniversaire.
- <i>Deep Shaker</i> ?
- <i>Deep Shaker.</i>
20 contre 1 ?
Ne le fais pas.
Je sais ce que tu vas faire.
Tu vas braquer le magasin en prenant un otage.
- Je ne vois pas de quoi vous parlez.
- …coute.
Tu n'as encore rien fait ŗ cause des flics.
ArrÍte avant de blesser quelqu'un ou pire.
- Qui Ítes vous ?
- Quelle importance.
Pousse-toi de lŗ.
N'y allez pas, ce type est armť.
Je suis pressťe.
Vous ne m'ťcoutez pas ?
- <i>La morgue.</i>
- Davis tu ne vas pas le croire.
A ce stade, rien ne me surprend plus.
<i>Il a essayť d'attaquer le magasin</i>.
- J'ai empÍchť le vol, mais il s'est enfui.
- <i>Et l'otage ?</i>
<i>Il n'y a pas d'otage.</i>
Il ne prend pas d'otage au hasard.
C'est la mÍme fille, ŗ chaque endroit.
- Ils sont complices.
- Comme Bonnie & Clyde.
Exceptť que dans ce cas,
Clyde utilise Bonnie comme un faux otage.
Beau retournement de situation.
J'aurais dŻ rťaliser au restaurant
quand il l'a traÓnťe aprŤs qu'elle soit abattue.
Elle ne servait pas de bouclier.
Il ne l'aurait pas laissťe parce que
<i>Ils sont complices.</i>
Vous Ítes bien occupťe aujourd'hui.
- «a vous dirait de me dire ce qui se passe ?
- Michelle ?
Vous me connaissez dťjŗ, mÍme si
je ne me souviens pas vous avoir rencontrťe.
- J'ai reconnu votre voix
- Vraiment ?
- Vous avez suffisamment harcelť mon rťpondeur.
- Si vous m'aviez parlť, j'aurais arrÍtť.
- <i>C'est pas le jour</i>
- <i>Je pense que c'est le jour parfait</i>.
Vous parcourez la ville,
dťclenchez de fausses alarmes.
Faites sortir des gens du magasin de vÍtements.
- La routine habituelle pour Tru Davies.
- Michelle.
J'ai vťrifiť les rapports de police et les archives.
- Votre nom surgit partout
- Michelle !
Vous ne devez pas rester
dans mes parages aujourd'hui.
Je veux des rťponses,
et je n'irai nulle part tant que je ne les aurai pas.
Disons, ce soir.
Lieu et heure.
20h pile ŗ la morgue.
Promettez-moi d'attendre
jusqu'ŗ ce que j'arrive.
J'y serai.
«a a intťrÍt d'Ítre bien.
Faites-moi confiance.
- Tu as tout entendu ?
- <i>Oh oui.</i>
<i>Elle sera ŗ la morgue vers 20h</i>.
Assure-toi qu'elle m'attende.
On sera sŻrs qu'elle reste en vie.
MÍme si Michelle n'est pas au restaurant,
il peut y avoir des blessťs.
C'est mon boulot,
c'est un risque que nous allons courir.
Je te rappelle.
J'ai bien entendu le <i>Standard Cafť</i> ?
Non je parlais ŗ Tru.
Elle va chercher ŗ manger ?
Je mangerais volontiers un hamburger.
Elle a les mains prises.
Je te dis, il doit avoir des pouvoirs mentaux.
Jack connaissait toutes les stats de ce cheval.
Je pensais que c'ťtait un tocard.
Mais Jack a rťpondu : si ce cheval gagne.
Tu pourras payer 6 repas d'anniversaire.
Tu ne manges pas Áa ?
<i>Deep Shaker</i> ťtait ŗ 20 contre 1.
Jack le sentait.
Et mon gars, il a toujours le bon feeling.
- «a a fait 400$, bon sang !
- J'ai une idťe.
Pourquoi je partirais pas ?
Comme Áa tu pourrais dÓner avec Jack.
Quoi ?
Laisse tomber.
Quelle journťe! Quelle soirťe!
Et c'est pas fini .
- Pour votre petite dame.
- Merci monsieur.
Non, vous devriez remercier Jack.
- Vous Ítes policier, n'est-ce pas ?
- Pas en service madame.
Je peux vous aider ?
Je l'espŤre.
Il y a quelqu'un ?
Je peux vous aider ?
Bonjour.
Je ne vous avais pas vu.
Michelle Carey du <i>Post-Dispatch.</i>
Dťsolť, je suis abonnť au <i>Times.</i>
Je ne vends pas des abonnements.
Je cherche Tru Davies.
Davis m'a dit qu'elle est au <i>Standard Cafť</i>.
C'est juste ŗ cŰtť.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
- On avait rendez-vous ŗ 20h.
- Alors, elle ne devrait pas tarder.
J'en doute.
Allez ŗ sa rencontre.
2Ťme ŗ droite en sortant d'ici.
Merci.
J'y vais.
Je ne sais pas d'oý vous tenez l'info,
mais je ne vois pas la blonde
que vous avez dťcrite.
Ni son complice.
Je ne comprends pas.
Ils devraient Ítre ici.
Les ťvŤnements
n'ont pas ťnormťment changť.
- Tu ne veux pas le faire ?
- Cette fille savait pour les deux coups.
Pure coÔncidence.
- Elle sait qu'on est ensemble.
- Elle ne sait rien de nous,
et elle ne peut pas connaÓtre
notre prochain coup.
- ņ moins que tu n'en aies parlť ŗ quelqu'un.
- Tu crois que je suis cinglť ?
Pourquoi j'irais en parler ?
«a part en vrille.
On devait juste faire quelques coups.
- Et tirer du cash sans blesser personne.
- Qui a ťtť blessť ?
- Personne, mais...
- Exactement.
Personne.
On avait dit que dŤs le moindre problŤme,
on arrÍtait tout.
On n'a toujours pas rťcupťrť d'argent.
Et question adrťnaline, j'ai rien vu.
Croise les doigts.
Dommage, tu vas manquer le meilleur.
Votre ami a dŻ vous refiler une info bidon.
- «a arrive.
- Dťsolťe de vous avoir dťrangť.
Mieux vaut prťvenir que guťrir.
Vous partez dťjŗ ?
Vous pouvez dÓner avec moi si vous voulez.
Non merci,
j'ai un entretien qui m'attend au bureau.
Et fatalement, il aura bien lieu.
Est-ce qu'une reporter brune
aux cheveux longs est venue pour Tru ?
Oui. Michelle...
Il y a environ 10 minutes.
Je lui ai dit que Tru ťtait au <i>Standard Cafť</i>,
et elle a filť.
20h ŗ la morgue ?
Je rťcupťrais un casse-croŻte.
Vous mangez lťger, je trouve.
Vous ne pouvez pas imaginer
combien cette journťe a ťtť compliquťe.
Mince.
- Attendez-moi ici. Je reviens.
- Mais bien sŻr ?
Attendez-moi ŗ la morgue,
croyez-moi, c'est pour votre bien.
Vous avez intťrÍt ŗ y Ítre.
Donnez-moi le pognon !
Ne faites pas Áa.
Encore vous ?
Police !
Posez votre arme !
Je ne sais pas comment
vous Ítes arrivťe ici. Asseyez-vous et taisez-vous !
- «a va mal tourner.
- Maintenant !
DťpÍchez-vous.
- L‚chez-votre arme.
- Plus vite !
Si vous posez votre arme
tout le monde s'en sortira.
Si je sors d'ici, elle reste en vie.
Qu'en dites-vous ?
Personne n'est blessť
mais c'est inťvitable si vous persistez.
L‚chez-la.
- Et si elle ťtait blessťe ou tuťe ?
- Ferme-la !
Vous avez ťtť clairement identifiťe.
Vous voulez vraiment
finir en prison ŗ vie ?
Elle ne le veut pas.
Je t'en prie, Beth.
Laisse tomber.
On n'a jamais voulu faire de mal ŗ personne.
Ce n'est pas ce qu'on voulait.
On n'est pas des criminels.
C'est pas notre truc.
Sinon, comment aurait-elle pu nous suivre ?
Et si elle peut nous suivre,
- Les flics le feront aussi.
- Il y en a dťjŗ un ici.
Je t'en prie.
Laisse-la partir.
Posez votre arme
et faites-la glisser jusqu'ŗ moi.
L‚chez votre arme !
Envoyez-la par ici.
Posez l'arme !
Comment Ítes-vous arrivťs si vite ?
Le coroner a signalť un hold-up en cours.
Il ťtait inquiet pour son amie sur place.
Harrison a dťpensť une fortune pour le dÓner.
- <i>Ah oui ?</i>
- <i>Oui.</i>
Il a passť la soirťe ŗ parler
de son pote Jack qui l'a aidť ŗ gagner.
Vraiment ?
Si j'avais su, j'aurais commandť
une pizza au lieu du soufflť.
J'aurais fait pareil.
Pas trop dťÁue malgrť tout ?
On verra demain matin.
Il faut que vous m'expliquiez tout Áa.
«a ne vous a pas suffi ?
Je vous ai sauvť la vie ŗ...
- Vous voulez la vťritť ?
- C'est ce que j'ai toujours voulu.
Faites tourner votre dictaphone.
Hier, je suis allťe au <i>Standard Cafť.</i>
- Vous me suiviez, comme aujourd'hui.
- Hier, je n'ťtais pas...
Vous ťcoutez ou pas ?
Il y a eu un hold-up.
Et vous y avez ťtť tuťe.
AprŤs votre mort,
vous m'avez appelťe au secours.
Je suis remontťe dans le temps
et je revis la journťe d'hier.
Quoi ?
En plus de vous protťger,
j'ai pu empÍcher une sťrie de braquages.
Que vous m'aviez indiquťs
et je vous en remercie.
Mais vous vous Ítes tout de mÍme
pointťe au resto. SŻrement le destin.
Alors, vous voulez
que je vous croie folle ?
Bien essayť.
Mais il m'en faut plus que Áa.
Je ne sais pas
ce qui s'est passť lŗ-bas.
Mais je ne vais pas
vous l‚cher de sitŰt.
Ton expo !
Je voulais vraiment venir, mais
ma journťe a ťtť interminable.
Tu n'as pas ŗ te justifier.
Je t'ai invitťe car je souhaitais ta prťsence
c'est pas si grave.
«a ira, ne t'en fais pas.
Et c'ťtait comment ?
PlutŰt positif.
Un bon accueil.
J'en ai vendu deux.
Une bonne soirťe en somme.
C'est tant mieux.
ņ une ťpoque,
j'ai cru pouvoir changer ta destinťe.
Mais...
Changer le destin semble impossible.
- Tu es saine et sauve.
- Tout va bien.
Et Michelle m'a laissť un peu de rťpit.
Espťrons que Áa lui serve de leÁon.
Le mťdaillon t'a protťgťe ?
C'est toi qui m'a protťgťe.
En appelant la police.
C'est la moindre des choses.
J'avais laissť filer Michelle.
Merci.
Il est ŗ toi.
- «a me touche. Merci.
- De rien.
Encore une chose.
Je suis sans arrÍt en danger.
Je cours aprŤs les mťchants,
j'ťvite les balles.
Mais pourquoi m'avoir
autant protťgťe aujourd'hui ?
En fait,
il y avait Michelle qui te suivait.
Mais la vťritť,
c'est que je me fais du souci
pour toi tout le temps.
Aujourd'hui je voulais juste
te donner un coup de pouce.
Tu t'es bien amusť aux courses ?
En effet, nous nous sommes bien amusťs.
Ton frŤre est sympa.
C'est aussi mon avis.
Ce n'ťtait pas la peine de jouer
aux courses pour s'en rendre compte.
Ne sois pas si mŤre-poule.
C'est un grand garÁon.
En plus, il a gagnť.
Je suis sa soeur.
Je le connais bien mieux que toi.
Et je sais ce qui est bon pour lui.
Peut-Ítre bien.
Mais tu sais,
tu ne peux pas t'occuper
de tout le monde.
Rien ne m'empÍche d'essayer.

Harrison a appelķ ?
Salut.
Non, pourquoi ?
Il devait me conduire quelque part.
Enfin, rien d'important.
Rien qui ne puisse gŌcher ma journķe.
Tu veux savoir pourquoi ?
Davis.
Je suis une nouvelle femme.
Nouvelle en quoi ?
Je ne mettrai plus ma vie de c¶tķ
quand des cadavres me demanderont de l'aide.
Je reprends ma vie en main.
Au fait, comment ńa va ?
Tu as l'air fatiguķ.
J'ai organisķ un truc
Ó mon appart, demain.
Et je n'ai pas fini d'emmķnager.
Depuis quand y es-tu ?
Il y Ó 3 ans.
J'ai du monde qui vient.
Une connaissance de la NASA,
retransmet des images du Spirit-Rover
- Je peux t'aider pour ton appart.
- Vraiment ?
TrĶs bien, on sera 3:
toi, moi et Jack.
- Pourquoi ?
- Il m'a proposķ de m'aider.
Chķrie !
Je suis rentrķ.
Une balle en plein coeur.
Trouvķe dans une rue piķtonne
du centre-ville.
Sa famille va bient¶t arriver.
Son portefeuille et ses papiers sont lÓ.
Ce n'ķtait pas une agression banale.
Melissa Sumner, 18 ans.
╔tudiante.
C'est bien de remarquer tous ces dķtails.
C'est mon boulot.
Peu de gens le font
aussi mķticuleusement.
Aide-moi !
Ūa va ?
Oui
Je sors, juste un instant.
- Ce corps vient de me demander de l'aide.
- Maintenant ?
└ l'instant.
Mais tu es toujours ici.
C'est que rien ne s'est passķ.
Pas de retour en arriĶre.
Rien.
Ep. 1-16 - <i>Two Pair</i>
Tu es s¹re de l'avoir entendue ?
Je suis peut-Ļtre surmenķe
mais j'hallucine pas encore.
J'ai perdu mon pouvoir ?
J'en sais rien.
- J'ai fait quelque chose qu'il ne fallait pas ?
- Non.
Ūa n'a rien Ó voir.
Tu t'es battue pour sauver des vies.
Tu n'as rien Ó te reprocher.
Peut-Ļtre qu'il y a une raison Ó ńa.
qui est propre Ó cette affaire,
Ó cette fille.
Une ķtudiante.
Quelque-chose de spķcial Ó son propos ?
Les parents sont lÓ
pour l'identification du corps.
On trouvera bien de quoi il s'agit.
Madame Sumner,
je me doute de ce que vous ressentez.
Je compatis.
On lui a toujours rappelķ
les dangers que reprķsente la ville.
Qu'il valait mieux donner
son portefeuille que sa vie.
Elle a ķtķ retrouvķe
avec son portefeuille sur elle.
Avec 20 $ dedans.
Savez-vous si des personnes
lui en voulaient ?
Melissa ķtait trĶs sociable.
Toujours serviable.
Si intelligente.
Son avenir ķtait prometteur.
Chķrie.
Tu ne devrais pas regarder ńa.
Allez, viens.
C'est certainement le pire moment
comparķ aux jours o∙ je reviens dans le passķ.
Toute cette souffrance.
Comment fais-tu ?
On s'habitue.
O∙ vas-tu ?
Je ne vais pas rester sans rien faire.
Je peux essayer de savoir
ce qui est arrivķ Ó Melissa,
pourquoi elle m'a demandķ de l'aide.
Je m'excuse, Je t'ai oubliķe.
J'ai eu un empĻchement
de derniĶre minute.
Une fille ou un pari ?
C'ķtait une urgence.
J'ai pariķ sur un tiercķ 3-4-7,
et l'arrivķe ķtait 3-4-6.
J'ai failli l'avoir.
Tout ńa Ó cause
de la disqualification de Vanilla Coaster.
Laisse-tomber.
Pourquoi es-tu pressķe ?
Un cadavre vient de me demander de l'aide.
Tu connaissais les rķsultats
et tu m'a laissķ perdre 200 $ ?
Je n'en savais rien.
Le cadavre m'a appelķe,
mais rien ne s'est passķ.
Tu as ķtķ virķe ?
Je partageais sa chambre
mais on se parlait peu.
Elle avait toujours
le nez dans ses bouquins.
Elle suivait un double cursus
d'ingķnieur et de mathķmatique.
Elle avait une moyenne gķnķrale de 16/20,
et donnait des cours aux premiĶre annķe
Aucun problĶme apparent,
ni querelle ?
Tout semblait aller pour le mieux.
Rien d'alarmant.
Dķsolķe,
je ne vois pas quoi dire de plus.
Ne le soyez pas.
MĻme si Melissa et moi n'ķtions
pas aussi proches,
quand je vois la chambre
avec ses affaires,
- Vous vous attendez Ó la voir arriver.
- Tout-Ó-fait.
Cela doit Ļtre la routine,
pour vous en tout cas.
Super.
Merci d'Ļtre venue
Y a pas de quoi.
VoilÓ le dķsastre.
Quoi de neuf ?
Pas grand chose.
La colocataire m'a confirmķ
ce que je savais dķjÓ.
Personne ne sait
qui pouvait lui en vouloir.
Tu as appris pas mal de choses sur elle.
C'est dķjÓ ńa.
C'est pas grave si j'ai mis les 13 ķpisodes
de <i>I, Claudius</i> Ó c¶tķ de ceux d'<i>X-files</i> ?
Tu veux vraiment les classer
par ordre alphabķtique ?
Davis est passionnķ
par son boulot on dirait.
Son boulot le suit partout.
Imagine un instant le truc.
Un gars drague une fille et dit:
Viens chez moi,
on lira des bouquins sur la mort.
Ūa doit mettre l'ambiance.
Sauf si c'est un tueur en sķrie
qui t'invite.
On regardait tes livres.
Je croyais que vous ķtiez venu
pour m'aider.
Qui est-ce ?
Certainement une amie ?
On travaillait ensemble.
Oh, une marina.
Elle est mignonne.
Tu la vois encore ?
Je crois que...
Je vais finir de ranger seul.
Vous pouvez y aller.
Il est dr¶le comme mec,
je trouve.
- Dr¶le ?
- Oui.
Il est seul,
il se consacre Ó la mort.
Tu as vu comme il ķvite
de parler de lui ?
N'exagĶre pas,
il est juste un peu excentrique.
- Que sais-tu de lui ?
- Plein de choses.
Vraiment ?
Alors, renseigne-moi.
Davis, c'est son prķnom
ou son nom de famille ?
Je parie qu'il sait
beaucoup de choses sur toi.
J'ai un corps Ó rķcupķrer.
On se voit Ó la morgue.
Oui, Ó tout-Ó-l'heure.
Pourquoi ?
Que me veux-tu ?
Comment puis-je t'aider ?
Tu parles seule ?
C'est le genre d'occupation
qui va bien avec l'endroit.
Je crois une chose,
c'est qu'il faut s'inquiķter
quand on croit les entendre rķpondre.
Regarde ce mec.
Il a avalķ une boite de calmants.
Qu'a-t-il sur lui ?
<i>KEEL
Import - Export</i>
C'est bizarre.
Pas de carte d'identitķ
mais une flopķe de cartes de visites.
- Il devait Ļtre reprķsentant.
- Y a un post-scriptum.
<i>Gene, je m'excuse. Pardonne-moi.
Geoffrey</i>
Concis et direct.
Je dis chapeau.
Sauve-moi !
Davis. Il y a 2 victimes,
mais qu'une journķe pour les sauver.
J'ai pas mal de choses Ó t'expliquer.
Davis, o∙ es-tu ?
Tu es en avance.
Il faut que je voie Davis.
Pas pour le boulot.
Tu lui fais beaucoup confiance,
je trouve.
Et tu ne sais quasiment rien sur lui.
Est-ce que je me trompe ?
└ plus tard.
H. Clark
J'ai fait aussi vite que j'ai pu.
Tu veux m'expliquer au bureau ?
<i>Ces 2 morts pourraient Ļtre liķes ?</i>
Quel rapport entre le meurtre
d'une ķtudiante,
et le suicide d'un reprķsentant.
Pour le suicide,
on n'a que le prķnom.
- Il a signķ son mot: Geoffrey.
- Pas adresse ni d'identitķ ?
Non aucune.
J'ai trouvķ plusieurs cartes de visites
dans sa poche.
J'ai fait une recherche sur les sociķtķs.
Elles ont toutes la mĻme adresse.
C'est une bonne piste.
2 personnes Ó sauver,
ńa double ma charge de travail.
- Ūa va aller ?
- Ūa ira.
Je me suis dķjÓ renseignķe
sur Melissa hier.
Oui ?
Vous connaissez quelqu'un
qui s'appelle H. Clarck ?
Pourquoi ńa ?
Tru faisait une recherche sur l'ordinateur,
et j'ai vu ce nom sur l'ķcran.
C'est un corps Ó rķcupķrer ?
Y'avais pas de H. Clark sur la liste,
mais je peux le rajouter.
Non,
c'est certainement sans importance.
J'ai besoin de ta voiture.
- J'allais justement passer te...
- Tu ne serais pas venu.
Et si j'ķtais toi,
j'arrĻterais de miser sur des chevaux.
C'est pas juste.
Tu sais ce qui s'est passķ et pas moi.
Tu m'as encore plantķe.
C'est une habitude chez toi.
Et Lindsay
pense comme moi Ó ton sujet.
Pardon, j'ai fait une erreur.
Mais je n'ai pas ta chance.
Quand tu te plantes, tu te dis:
Mince, qu'est-ce-que... ?
Mais oui ! Je recommence la journķe.
C'est ńa, j'ai la chance
d'avoir 2 morts Ó sauver aujourd'hui,
sans savoir comment faire.
Alors, laisse-moi t'aider cette fois.
M'aider ?
Tu n'as mĻme pas pu
passer me rķcupķrer aujourd'hui.
╔coute.
J'ai un bon relationnel.
Tu l'as dķjÓ constatķ quand je t'ai aidķe.
Tu n'as pas vraiment le choix.
Deux vies sont en jeu.
Si tu dois faire confiance Ó quelqu'un,
je suis bien placķ, non ?
Je te le jure, Tru.
Je ne te dķcevrai pas.
Bon, je vais tout te dire
sur Melissa Samner
Sois trĶs attentif.
Chaque dķtail compte.
Rends-toi au Campus de Hudson.
Elle y dirige un td de mathķmatique.
Bon,
Ūa sera tout pour aujourd'hui.
Rappelez-vous que le hasard
n'existe pas.
Tout est question de cycles.
Comme Einstein le disait:
<i>Dieu ne joue pas aux dķs.</i>
J'ai bien aimķ votre cours.
Surtout Ó la fin.
Je ne suis pas vraiment d'accord
sur le fait que Dieu ne joue pas aux dķs.
Vous voulez en parler avec Einstein ?
C'est amusant de parier,
vous ne trouvez pas ?
Rien que le fait de dķfier les dieux.
Faut profiter de ce qu'il a crķķ.
Tout l'intķrĻt du jeu
c'est qu'on ne connait pas le futur.
Comme Dieu est censķ faire le futur,
il ne doit pas trouver ńa trĶs excitant.
C'est lÓ que vous vous trompez.
En fait,
je connais dķjÓ une partie du futur.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Je vous vois dķjeuner
avec moi.
Bien essayķ,
mais je ne me vois pas
Ó table pas avec vous.
Bon.
368 West 1st Street.
C'est plus compliquķ que prķvu.
Cette fille est pas commode du tout.
C'est ńa
Il faut absolument que tu rentres dans sa vie.
Arrange-toi pour changer
ce qu'elle avait prķvu de faire aujourd'hui.
Tu peux le faire,
sois toi-mĻme.
J'ķtais moi-mĻme !
- Tu lui as fait du rentre-dedans ?
- Non !
Pas jusque lÓ quand mĻme.
Oui
Sois ton autre toi, alors.
Le menteur ?
J'ai pigķ.
Tu m'as fait livrer
plus de 2 tonnes de viande.
Et on n'a pas de chambre froide.
Qu'est-ce qui t'a pris de faire ńa ?
En plus avec de la viande de buffle.
Un instant
Gene, ńa fait plaisir de t'entendre.
Non, tu ne me dķranges pas.
Ce n'est pas encore minuit ici.
Hong Kong ne dort jamais.
╔coute, chķrie.
Je suis Ó table avec un client.
Non, tout se passe trĶs bien.
Tu me manques aussi.
Oui, je rentre bient¶t.
Je t'aime ma chķrie.
Et merde.
- Vous avez beaucoup de noms.
- Je peux vous aider ?
Je viens voir Geoffrey.
Je travaille Ó la banque.
J'ai parlķ Ó votre directeur.
Je lui ai dit que j'aurai l'argent,
ne vous en faites pas.
Je dois d'abord conclure une affaire.
Une combine, je parie.
- J'ai un frĶre qui fait la mĻme chose.
- La banque aura son argent,
je vous le garantis.
Merci d'Ļtre passķe.
Pas de quoi.
C'est pour Ļtre seule que je viens ici.
Je vois.
Il y a une belle vue, ici.
Si tu cherches une fille,
y'en a plein le campus.
Ce n'est pas le cas.
C'est gĻnant Ó dire.
J'aurais besoin de cours de maths
Vraiment ?
C'est quoi qui coince ?
En calcul ?
Additions ?
En divisions.
J'ai du mal avec les divisions.
Allez !
Quand on multiplie ou qu'on divise,
ya toujours des retenues
et j'y capte rien.
C'est embĻtant.
En fait,
tu as besoin de faire une pause.
Tout est question de cycles,
pas vrai ?
Alors pourquoi pas changer un peu ?
╔coute.
Tu as l'air d'Ļtre sympa,
mais j'ai trop Ó faire,
dķsolķe.
J'ai compris.
Oui, la marina ?
je cherche H.Clark.
Il possĶde un bateau, le <i>Comet</i>
J'attends
Pas facile d'avoir quelqu'un
dans ces bureaux.
Oui, je vous ķcoute.
Vous venez pour la partie de poker ?
La mise d'entrķe est trĶs ķlevķe.
Je reviens.
Tu connais le Countdown Club ?
Il doit y avoir un tournoi de poker.
Je sais qu'une fois par mois,
ils font une partie pour les gros joueurs.
Je l'ai entendu dire seulement.
On dirait que Geoffrey
va perdre ce soir et se suicidera.
Il a besoin de cet argent.
Tu penses pouvoir y participer ?
Et Melissa alors ?
Et en plus,
le ticket d'entrķe est Ó 5000 $.
Super.
Ne bouge pas, je t'amĶne l'argent.
On change les r¶les.
Le poker c'est ton truc.
Tu t'occupes de Geoffrey
et moi de Melissa.
Et o∙ tu va trouver le pognon ?
Vanilla Coaster a ķtķ disqualifiķe.
Comme tu l'avais dit hier.
Tu fais gagner des ķtrangers
mais pas ton propre frĶre.
O∙ est Melissa ?
Dans sa chambre.
L'entrķe est par lÓ.
Bonne chance.
J'ai fait quelques recherches
avec les noms des cartes de visite.
J'ai trouvķ qu'il s'agissait en fait
d'un certain Geoffrey Pine.
Pine ?
C'est donc son nom.
Il s'est servi de ces identitķs
pour multiplier les demandes de prĻts,
ainsi que pour fuir
ses crķanciers les plus importants.
Il doit Ļtre vraiment mal cette fois
pour en venir au suicide.
Sa femme pense qu'il travaille Ó Hong Kong.
Sa vie n'est qu'un mensonge.
Et le pire dans tout ńa,
c'est qu'il n'est pas
fonciĶrement mauvais.
Avec toutes ses combines,
il me fait penser Ó Harrison.
La vie, la mort.
La dualitķ.
C'est comme ńa que beaucoup
de religions perńoivent le monde.
Je dois te laisser.
<i>Je suis au club.</i>
- Je me suis inscrit.
<i>- TrĶs bien.</i>
- Ne lŌche pas Geoffrey des yeux.
<i>- Voyons, Tru.</i>
<i>Je ne te dķcevrai pas.
Promis.</i>
Je maŅtrise la situation.
Tu m'as suivie ?
Je ne vois pas comment,
vu que j'ķtais lÓ avant toi.
Si j'ķtais toi,
je partirais, tout de suite.
- Qui Ļtes-vous ?
- Peut-Ļtre une amie de votre femme.
- Pas avec ce signe.
- Un signe ?
C'est un tic.
Votre regard vague et
votre main gauche vous trahissent.
Je suis sķrieux,
tu devrais partir.
Pourquoi veux-tu absolument
que je parte ?
J'ai le pressentiment
que tu pourrais
perdre gros ce soir.
Bien tentķ.
Tu veux ķliminer une concurrente ?
J'ai besoin de cet argent
et je ne partirai pas.
Tu es jeune et jolie.
Pourquoi une fille si intelligente
aurait besoin de cet argent ?
Votre femme ne sait rien
de votre vraie vie.
Quand ils saisiront votre maison
elle comprendra.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
Il y a longtemps que ma femme
m'a demandķ d'arrĻter mes bĻtises.
Elle pense que je l'ai ķcoutķe.
J'ai mis en pratique
mes thķories de probabilitķs.
Je joue gros
depuis pas mal de temps.
J'ai pigķ.
Sur le long terme
je devrais Ļtre gagnante.
Mais Ó court terme.
J'ai perdu l'argent de ma bourse d'ķtude.
Tout ?
Je peux tout arranger.
Je peux gagner.
J'ai pas besoin de tout rafler.
Je suis lÓ pour ńa.
Disons que je suis
votre porte-bonheur.
D'ici quelques jours
l'ķcole le notifiera Ó mes parents.
└ moins que je ne leur rembourse ce soir.
C'est ma derniĶre chance.
Je t'aime bien, mais
je vais devoir te plumer.
La couleur bat la paire.
Et si on faisait une pause ?
Je veux pas dire, mais
comme porte-bonheur
j'ai dķjÓ vu mieux.
- Qu'est-ce qu'elle joue bien !
- └ mon avis, elle a d¹ gagner hier.
C'est pour ńa qu'elle a ķtķ tuķe.
Donc Geoffrey perd et se suicide.
Melissa rafle tout et...
Et le braquage Ó la sortie du club
lui sera fatal.
Si elle perd, elle restera en vie.
- Si elle perd, elle est virķe de la fac.
- C'est moins grave que la mort.
On doit avant tout sauver leur vie.
Il faut que tu la plumes.
Figure-toi que
c'est ce que j'essaie de faire.
Tu as un tic quand tu bluffes.
C'est faux.
Tu touches le col de ta chemise
Ó chaque fois.
Vous venez jouez ?
J'arrive.
Je te rappelle que c'est moi
le spķcialiste du poker.
La suite bat les 2 paires.
Fķlicitations.
Tu as feintķ le tic.
En fait,
juste le dernier.
C'est vraiment pas mon genre
de faire ńa, mais
Je te coupe tout de suite,
je suis avec quelqu'un.
Harrison, j'ai vraiment besoin
de cet argent.
Tu voudrais bien
me le prĻter ?
Je te rembourserai avec les intķrĻts,
d'ici quelque temps.
Je suis dķsolķ.
Je ne peux pas.
Je vois.
Merci.
Tu sais,
Le fait de savoir le futur,
- ńa craint vraiment.
- Parfois, c'est vrai.
Le hors-d'oeuvre est passķ.
Reste le plat de rķsistance.
Laisser gagner Geoffrey.
Si tu voulais me torturer,
tu as tapķ dans le mille.
Il faut que tu perdes.
Bonsoir, je cherche
une personne nommķe H. Clark.
Je suis Hope Clark.
Vous Ļtes la propriķtaire
du bateau <i>The Comet</i> ?
En fait,
c'est ma fille Hayley qui l'a achetķ.
Je pourrais lui parler ?
Puis-je savoir Ó quel sujet ?
Seulement deux paires.
Je me couche.
Parole de porte-bonheur:
- Va changer tes jetons.
- Tu es folle ?
Un petit conseil:
- File avec tes gains.
- Tu plaisantes ?
Il y a encore de l'argent sur la table
et j'ai la barraca.
Il y a toujours de l'argent quelque part.
Je suppose que je saurai pas
qui vous Ļtes.
Non.
Je vais faire plaisir Ó ma femme
avec mon retour prķmaturķ de Hong-Kong.
Merci.
Et dire que j'ai perdu volontairement
tout cet argent.
C'est mon pain quotidien.
Il faut que j'aille travailler.
Et toi, tu fais quoi ?
Melissa pense que je suis un con.
Alors, je vais essayer de la trouver,
et de la rķconforter.
Tu t'es bien dķbrouillķ.
Toi aussi.
Il a ķtķ gķnial.
Il ne s'est pas contentķ
de les avoir sauvķs.
Il est parti voir Melissa
pour la rķconforter.
Il y a un problĶme avec Geoffrey Pine ?
J'ai l'impression
que tout n'est pas encore rķglķ.
Je l'ai sauvķ, mais
s'il ne change pas de comportement...
Il me fait tant penser Ó Harrison.
Je pourrais parler Ó Geoffrey ?
<i>Il est toujours Ó Hong-Kong.
Vous voulez laisser un message ?</i>
Non, merci.
Sa femme le croit toujours Ó Hong-Kong.
Il devrait pourtant Ļtre rentrķ.
Je vais voir s'il va bien.
Et si c'ķtait autre chose ?
- Je t'ai dķjÓ parlķ de dualitķ ?
- Oui.
Meurtre et suicide le premier jour.
Si on inverse les ķvķnements,
Tu te doutes des consķquences.
Tu es lÓ ?
<i>Maman et papa, pardonnez-moi.
Je vous aimerai toujours.</i>
Je suis au campus.
Melissa veut se suicider.
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>
Il faut que tu viennes.
Je n'y serai jamais Ó temps.
En plus, Geoffrey n'est pas rentrķ.
Tu sais trĶs bien o∙ il est.
LÓ o∙ sont tous les joueurs.
- Il est retournķ jouer.
- Oublie-le !
Je sais o∙ elle est allķe.
Il faut que je le trouve.
Il ne sait pas ce qu'il l'attend.
Elle va se suicider, bon sang !
Vas-y !
Tu peux l'en empĻcher.
Tu en es capable.
Je sais ce que tu veux faire.
Je peux t'aider.
Tu vas me donner l'argent ?
J'aurais bien voulu.
Je ne l'ai plus.
Tu as tout perdu.
J'ai perdu.
C'est pas la fin du monde.
Crois-en mon expķrience.
Je peux t'aider.
Tu peux le dire Ó tes parents.
Je ne peux pas !
Je n'aurai pas le courage de leur dire.
Ils triment comme des malades
pour ma soeur et moi.
Ūa rķduirait leurs efforts Ó nķant.
Si je leur avouais que j'ai jouķ
ma bourse d'ķtude au poker.
Ils ne comprendraient pas.
Il y a forcķment une solution.
C'est fichu.
Il me faut l'argent pour demain matin.
Sinon ils enverront une lettre
Ó mes parents.
Ma voiture.
Ma voiture, ńa irait ?
Elle vaut dans les 5 000$.
Je te la donne.
Elle est Ó toi.
Ūa suffira pour gagner un peu de temps ?
Tu ferais ńa pour moi ?
Bien entendu.
Viens par lÓ.
Allez.
Quelle soirķe.
Finalement,
j'avais pas besoin de porte-bonheur.
J'ai la barraca.
Bien-jouķ.
└ la prochaine.
File-moi le pognon.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi
vous me protķgez comme ńa.
Je ne sais pas
comment vous remercier.
Si j'ķtais lÓ pour vous protķger,
je vous dirais quoi ?
De tout avouer Ó ma femme.
C'est plus dur que de miser gros.
Vous allez vous y faire ?
Non.
Mais il le faut bien.
Je vais rķcupķrer un corps en ville.
Comment tu t'es mise dans cet ķtat ?
Les morts sont agressifs ?
- Tu n'imagines mĻme pas.
- Tu savais que Davis ķtait mariķ ?
Sa femme est morte.
Morte ?
C'est lui qui te l'a dit ?
Davis, discuter de sa vie privķe
c'est pas son genre.
On me l'a dit.
<i>Il faut que tu viennes
avec moi un soir.</i>
Mec, il faut vivre un peu.
J'ai aussi sauvķ une pizza
sur le chemin du retour.
- AprĶs avoir sauvķ la demoiselle.
- Et comment !
Il y a un problĶme ?
Hier, Ó ton appart,
il y avait une photo.
On pourrait en parler.
Laisse tomber,
c'est pas mes oignons.
En fait si.
Je vais sortir.
Reste.
Il faut aussi que tu le saches.
On ķtait mariķs depuis un an.
Toi, mariķ ?
Je devais retrouver Hayley chez sa mĶre.
On allait dŅner en ville,
pour son anniversaire.
J'avais fini tard ce soir lÓ,
et en allant Ó ma voiture,
Les pneus ķtaient crevķs
et on m'avait vidķ le rķservoir.
Et cette folle qui me disait
d'appeler ma femme,
et de lui dire de ne surtout pas
prendre sa voiture.
Une folle ?
Notre mĶre.
Mais je savais que...
mĻme si j'ķtais en retard,
je pouvais les rejoindre au restaurant.
Maman ignorait
o∙ la trouver.
Et tu n'as pas prķvenu Hayley.
Pour lui annoncer qu'une folle disait
qu'elle allait mourir dans la soirķe ?
Je ne pensais pas que ce soit le mieux
pour fĻter son anniversaire.
Et ensuite ?
AprĶs avoir perdu une roue,
elle est partie en tĻte-Ó-queue
avant de heurter un poids lourd.
Et le premier jour ?
Je suis mort avec elle.
C'est pour ńa que tu en sais autant
sur elle et son pouvoir.
Et que tu me comprends.
Notre mĶre t'a sauvķ.
Je suis vraiment dķsolķe.
Cela fait partie du passķ.
Aujourd'hui nous fĻtons une victoire.
Deux vies sauvķes.
Santķ.
VoilÓ qui est fait.
Plus personne n'a de rķvķlations
ni de secrets Ó avouer.
Tu en sais autant que moi.
Pas tout, Davis.
C'est ton prķnom
ou ton nom de famille ?
En fait c'est mon 2░ prķnom.
C'est une longue histoire qui...
Ūa va mon pote.
Viens boire un coup.
ArrĻte un peu de bosser.
En fait la soirķe a ķtķ calme.
Seulement un corps
Ó rķcupķrer sur le campus.
Quoi ?
Va t'asseoir, on va essayer de savoir
ce qu'il s'est passķ.
Elle allait bien quand je l'ai quittķe.
Il la connaissait ?
Tout ķtait rentrķ dans l'ordre.
La dķpression est trĶs difficile Ó dķceler.
Leurs rķactions sont imprķvisibles.
- O∙ vas-tu ?
- Peu importe.
Lindsay et toi aviez raison.
Je ne suis pas comme toi.
Je ne sauverai jamais personne.
Je ne suis mĻme pas foutu
de me sortir de la merde
Reste, on peut en discuter.
Il faut que je sorte.
Je me doute de ce que vous ressentez,
je compatis.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi nous cacher la vķritķ ?
Ce n'ķtait que de l'argent.
On ķtait bien trop exigeants avec elle.
Ma chķrie, tu ne devrais pas rester lÓ.
Pouvez-vous nous donner plus de dķtails ?
On a reńu un coup de fil.
Un homme qui disait que Melissa
avait perdu sa bourse scolaire au poker.
Les parents de Melissa ont ķtķ
avertis de la situation.
Ils ont d¹ appeler leur fille
pour qu'elle s'en explique.
Ūa explique son suicide.
Ūa n'a aucun sens.
Hier, ils n'ķtaient pas au courant.
Que s'est-il passķ de diffķrent ?
Qui a pu faire ńa ?

Tu n'iras pas plus loin, Maggie.
Je t'en prie Nate.
Je ne dirai rien à personne.
Tu as raison.
Tu ne diras rien.
Tu vois, c'est elle.
C'est Carly Anders.
C'est celle qui joue
dans des films pour ado.
- Elle a aussi sorti un album.
- Et tu me montres ça parce que ...
Parce que demain,
elle vient passer la journée ici.
Pourquoi une actrice viendrait ici ?
Elle joue une employée de morgue
dans son prochain film.
Elle veut connaître tous les aspects
techniques du rôle.
Non, pourquoi vient-elle ici ?
Dans notre morgue ?
Elle est d'ici et sa mère et sa soeur de 8 ans
vivent dans le coin.
- Ça explique le pourquoi du comment.
- D'accord.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Journée recommencée ou non
Sexe des victimes, cause de la mort.
Ce sont des statistiques sur ceux
que tu as sauvés jusqu'ici .
Je me suis amusé à modéliser
toutes ces données.
Donc si un corps arrive,
on saura mieux comment l'aider.
Tu savais qu'on t'appelait le plus à l'aide
les lundi et jeudi ?
Et qu'il y a 83% de chances pour que le tueur
soit un proche de la victime.
Ça peut aider à résoudre le cas de ma mère ?
- Tru, je ne crois pas...
- Ça explique pourquoi elle ne nous a rien dit ?
- Qu'elle avait le même pouvoir.
- Elle n'a surement pas eu le temps.
Elle savait qu'elle pouvait le transmettre
à ses enfants mais elle n'a jamais rien dit.
Elle ne nous a pas prévenus,
pas un seul mot.
- Tu es en colère...
- Tes recherches devraient me le dire.
Plutôt que de me savoir surbookée
les lundis et jeudis.
Parfait, je prendrai tous les lundis de repos possibles.
Soirée TV pour moi.
- L'emploi du temps de cet après-midi ?
- Non.
Rien d'important.
J'afficherai l'emploi du temps
dans la matinée.
Au revoir.
Tu sais Tru.
J'ai vérifié des papiers ce matin.
Et je n'ai pu m'empêcher de remarquer
que tu n'es jamais allée récupérer un corps.
- C'est ridicule.
- Non pas un seul et c'est de ma faute.
Jack, merci de l'avoir précisé.
Comme toujours.
A chaque fois, le jour se répétait.
- Ça n'est jamais arrivé.
- Il nous a entendus ?
On a vraiment besoin d'une bat-cave.
Ep.1-17  Death Becomes Her
2200 $ ? Vous me prenez pour qui ?
C'est une épave.
C'est du délire.
Vous vous moquez de moi.
Cette voiture a 6 ans
et a moins de 50 000 km.
- 2200 $, c'est du vol ?
- Du vol, exactement.
Vous voulez un café ?
- Il y en a dans le bureau.
- Désolée, j'ai travaillé cette nuit.
- Vraiment ? Vous travaillez où ?
- Je travaille pour le comté.
Il faut qu'on parle, toi et moi, maintenant.
Qu'est-ce que je t'ai dit sur le fait
de donner des infos au vendeur ?
S'il sait que tu as de l'argent
C'est le prix fort.
J'ai juste dit que je travaillais la nuit.
Suis juste le plan.
Ton truc c'est de parler aux morts.
Le mien c'est de négocier.
Elle vous en donne 2000 $, pas plus.
Vendu.
Je vais chercher les papiers.
Café ?
J'ai comme l'impression
qu'il serait descendu bien plus bas que 2000.
Maintenant tu as une voiture
donc tu peux faire tes trucs de fille.
Et aller sauver les morts.
Toutes les choses que tu adores faire.
Je dois y aller. Lindsay veut me briefer
pour le dîner avec sa soeur ce soir.
- Souhaite-moi bonne chance.
- Bonne chance.
- Essaye de la jouer cool.
- Je vais essayer.
Bonjour, vous devez être Davis.
- Tru Davies.
- Carly Anders et voici mon assistante Anna.
- Salut
- Salut, enchantée
Donc voici la salle principale
où les corps sont analysés.
- Après les avoir récupérés sur les lieux d'un crime.
- Exact.
- Ça fait aussi partie du boulot ?
- Habituellement, oui.
Mais s'il n'y a pas de corps ?
Je veux dire, vous allez sur les lieux d'un crime.
Mais le corps a disparu.
Où voulez-vous en venir ?
Dans la première partie du film, mon personnage
doit faire un certificat de décès
pour un disparu lors d'une randonnée
en montagne.
- Vous voulez savoir comment procéder sans corps ?
- Exactement
Dans certains cas, le coroner peut déclarer une
personne morte sans le corps.
Ça s'appelle un certificat de mort présumée.
Laissez-moi vous poser une autre question.
Comment avez-vous obtenu ce job ?
Un stage est tombé à l'eau pour entrer en
médecine et j'ai atterri ici à la place.
Je voulais être docteur quand j'étais enfant.
Mais la comédie a pris le dessus.
Quand vous trouvez votre vocation,
il faut la suivre.
Oui, je vois ce que vous voulez dire.
Mais d'après votre succès,
vous avez fait le bon choix.
J'en doute parfois.
Toute la pression, les horaires, gérer les médias.
C'est usant à force.
Je devrais bosser ici pour décompresser.
Les morts sont moins exigeants.
En fait vous seriez surprise.
Tu ne vas pas le croire.
Mais Erin n'a jamais aimé mes copains
et je veux qu'elle t'apprécie.
T'as peur de quoi ?
Elle va m'adorer.
Elle a intérêt.
Les courses de chevaux et les fêtes entre potes
attendront cette fois ?
Je compte vraiment sur toi.
- Jack, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Harrison.
Excusez-moi.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
<i>Maison funéraire</i>
- C'est un enterrement ?
- Oui, un de mes amis, je viens l'honorer.
- Vraiment désolé.
- Moi aussi.
- Salut.
- Bonjour.
Jack, j'ai beaucoup entendu parler de toi.
J'allais boire un coup.
Je sais qu'il est encore tôt
mais voulez-vous vous joindre à moi ?
J'ai plein de choses à faire d'ici ce soir.
Mais si tu penses
avoir le temps avant le repas...
Tu plaisantes.
Décliner l'offre serait de la folie.
Mais on ne l'est pas.
Elle était très gentille Davis.
À l'opposé de ce que j'imaginais.
Elle pourrait être une de mes amies.
- Malheureusement elle rentre à Hollywood demain.
- Il n'y a pas que ça.
Tous ces pouvoirs, enquêter partout.
C'est dur de garder mes amis,
et de m'en faire de nouveaux.
Les super-héros n'ont pas beaucoup d'amis.
Juste quelques alliés confidents.
J'ai 22 ans.
J'ai besoin de plus que ça.
Bonjour, je peux vous aider ?
- Oui, je cherche Carly Anders.
- Elle vient de partir.
- Je devais la rejoindre.
- C'est une de vos amies ?
Ça remonte à loin.
Vous savez où elle se rendait ?
Chez sa mère, il me semble.
Commencez par là.
Merci, j'y vais.
Davis, on se voit demain.
C'était une longue journée.
Au sujet de ta mère.
Elle ne t'a peut-être rien dit car elle pensait
que tu ne pourrais pas comprendre.
On ne le saura jamais.
Salut.
Ce n'est pas évident d'être nouveau en ville.
Merci d'avoir facilité les choses.
Qu'est-ce qui te fait rire ?
J'imaginais la tête de ta soeur si elle
nous découvrait dans ce bar.
- Ne le prends pas mal, tu sais c'est Tru...
- Ce n'est pas le cas en fait.
Nous travaillons ensemble,
nous parlons tous les jours.
Mais je ne la connais pas vraiment.
- Elle est cool, mon pote.
- Sans aucun doute.
Elle est loyale comme moi
mais elle est plus intelligente.
- Et elle bosse comme une malade.
- Ne m'en parle pas.
Elle arrive pour sa garde
et mémorise toutes les infos de toutes les victimes.
On a l'impression qu'elle ne vit
que pour son boulot.
- Si tu savais.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Qu'est-ce que quoi ?
- Quelque chose que je devrais savoir sur ta soeur ?
Quoi ?
- <i>Je t'écoute</i>
- Super, ma voiture est foutue.
- Quoi ?
- Le moteur ne démarre pas.
On la ramènera ensemble demain.
C'est ça, je suis sûre qu'ils reprennent
leurs propres épaves sans sourciller.
<i>Je trouverai une solution, promis.</i>
- J'ai juste besoin de me faire déposer à la maison.
- À la maison.
- J'aimerais beaucoup t'aider Tru
- Mais ?
<i>- Je dois rentrer me préparer pour ce soir.</i>
Sinon Lindsay va me tuer.
- Tu plaisantes hein ?
- Demande-lui où elle est ?
- Où es-tu ?
- Au coin de la 3ème et de Ogden.
- 3ème et Ogden
- Dis-lui que je suis là dans 20 min.
- Jack sera là dans 20 min
- Non, je ne veux pas que ce soit Jack.
Crache pas dans la soupe.
- Tu montes à l'arrière ou à l'avant ?
- Très drôle.
- Harrison est de tout coeur avec toi.
- Où est-il ? Aux paris sur les courses ?
- On était dans un bar.
- Encore mieux.
Pourquoi j'ai l'impression que tu ne veux pas
que je traîne avec ton frère ?
Parce que tu es perspicace.
- Harrison est un gentil gars.
- Et j'aimerais qu'il le reste.
- Il se fera des amis de toute façon.
- Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Tu penses que c'est facile pour moi
de travailler à la morgue ?
J'ai essayé d'être sympa,
mais à chaque fois que j'entre dans une pièce
Toi et Davis, vous vous taisez ou changez
de sujet, ou vous partez.
- Ça n'a rien à voir avec toi.
- Je ne fais pas partie de l'équipe.
Si tu te sens délaissé, ce n'est pas
du tout ce qu'on...
- Ça n'était pas intentionnel.
- Excuses acceptées.
Ici Jack.
J'y serai.
C'est ton jour de chance.
Tu vas récupérer ton premier corps.
Grimpe.
Vous avez remarqué la météo dernièrement ?
Dans le temps, il faisait beaucoup plus chaud.
Oui c'est vraiment étrange.
C'est la fin du printemps
et je porte toujours mes habits d'hiver.
- C'est une couleur magnifique sur vous.
- Merci.
Excusez-moi.
Je vais me rafraîchir.
Tu t'en sors super bien.
Attends, tu t'attendais à quoi ?
Ne réponds pas.
On a reçu un appel depuis une voiture,
il y a environ 20 min.
Elle était poursuivie par une autre voiture
et approchait du pont.
Je vous laisse imaginer la suite.
- Je vais chercher le matériel.
- Elle a été poussée depuis le pont ?
Ils ont trouvé des traces
de peinture rouge sur la portière.
Probablement la voiture du poursuivant.
- Qui a sorti le corps de la voiture ?
- Il flottait déjà quand on est arrivés.
Comme si elle avait été éjectée
lors de l'impact.
Carly.
Tru, j'ai besoin de ton aide.
2200 !
Mais c'est un tas de ferraille.
C'est du délire !
Et voilà, ça recommence.
- 2200 c'est du vol ?
- Je ne la veux pas.
- Pardon ?
- Je ne la veux pas.
Je veux, je veux celle-là.
- On devait négocier.
- Pas aujourd'hui.
Ma petite dame, je pense que vous faites erreur.
Cette voiture est comme neuve.
Elle peut encore rouler 100.000 Km.
Elle va rouler 10 Km et nous lâcher.
Et je ne suis pas votre petite dame.
Le jour a recommencé
pour que tu sauves une voiture ?
Je vous donne 1500 pour la rouge là-bas.
- Elle en vaut 2000 au minimum.
- 1500, à prendre ou à laisser.
Marché conclu.
Merci Monty.
C'est la même Carly Anders
que celle qui est dans l'ascenseur ?
Mon dieu !
Je suis déjà troublé avec les inconnus qui vont
mourir, alors avec une célébrité...
Elle ne va pas mourir Davis,
pas si nous y faisons quelque chose.
Qui aurait cru qu'on t'aurait
demandé de l'aide un mercredi ?
Pourquoi ce ne serait pas le cas ?
D'après mes recherches,
les retours en arrière le mercredi
Sont statistiquement rarissimes.
- J'allais faire du mercredi ton jour de congé.
- Fini les stats. Efface-les de ton ordinateur.
- Pourquoi ?
- Jack se pose des questions.
Il pense qu'on lui cache des choses,
nous devons être plus prudents.
Tu as des suspects ?
Il n'y en a aucun pour l'instant.
Profite de la visite pour en apprendre un maximum.
Essaye d'être zen cette fois.
Bonjour, vous devez être Davis.
L'ascenseur vous a plu ?
Si vous allez sur les lieux d'un meurtre avéré
et que le corps est introuvable ?
Selon le cas.
On émet un certificat de mort présumée.
Ce qui permet au légiste
de déclarer la personne décédée.
- Même sans corps.
- Vraiment ?
Ça fait drôle de rentrer chez soi
après être devenue une star ?
Bien sûr que ça fait bizarre.
Pas que pour les stars.
Vous avez dû susciter des jalousies.
Parfois.
Aucun conflit de longue date avec quelqu'un ?
Vous avez l'air d'être très gentille,
mais je préfère ne pas parler de ma vie privée.
D'accord, bien sûr.
- Je me demandais...
- S'il vous plaît.
Retournons au travail, d'accord.
Je vais chercher à manger au snack d'en face.
Tu veux quelque chose ?
Non ça va merci.
Ça ne t'embête pas de prendre la suite,
je vais au snack avec Anna.
Tu peux me prendre une part de...
Non finalement ça ira.
Je m'occupe de Carly depuis quatre ans.
C'est un vrai métier.
- Vous la suivez sans arrêt.
- Oui.
Vous devez savoir si quelqu'un lui en veut.
- Lui en vouloir ?
- Oui, elle est si célèbre.
Ça peut faire des jaloux.
Tout le monde apprécie Carly.
Personne ne pourrait penser différemment ?
La presse à scandale le pourrait.
Mais Carly est une dure à cuire.
Un vrai bourreau de travail.
Sa mère m'a dit que
la seule fois où elle s'est arrêtée,
C'était il y a 8 ans,
après un gros film.
Elle avait 16 ans
et frôlait la dépression nerveuse.
Sa mère l'a forcée
à prendre une année sabbatique.
Elle a ensuite repris.
Plus forte que jamais.
Où est Carly ?
Ce type est venu pour lui parler.
J'ai voulu l'arrêter mais elle m'a dit
que tout allait bien.
Il est venu pour Carly hier,
mais elle était déjà partie.
- Tu as entendu ce qu'ils disent ?
- Ils parlent à voix basse.
A plus tard Carly.
- Tout va bien ?
- Oui. C'est un vieil ami.
- Il n'avait pas l'air amical.
- Ce n'est rien du tout.
Je dois y aller.
Anna est là ?
Elle gare la voiture.
Vous ne voulez pas rester ?
Vous pourriez voir une autopsie.
Non merci.
- Ravie de vous avoir rencontrée.
- Moi aussi.
Tu la laisses partir comme ça ?
Ne t'inquiète pas, je vais la suivre.
- Je dois lui ramener ça
- Tu lui as volé son sac ?
Je devais faire quelque chose.
Il faut que j'en sache davantage.
Pourquoi ?
Pour arriver à comprendre
comment elle va mourir.
Relax, elle va m'adorer
Elle a intérêt
Les courses de chevaux et les fêtes entre potes
attendront cette fois ?
Je compte vraiment sur toi.
Alors ?
Tu es prêt pour le grand test de Lindsay ce soir ?
Test ? Non. C'est un...
- C'est un, tu sais...
- Un dîner.
Tu es plus courageux que moi.
Si j'avais voulu assurer,
je ne serais pas célibataire.
Assurer ? Non.
Lindsay et moi,
on se complète.
- Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
- Parfaitement.
En vérité, je t'envie mec.
Tu possèdes ce que tout homme désire,
s'il est assez viril pour l'admettre.
A toi et Lindsay.
Moi et Lindsay.
- Tu dois être la soeur de Carly ?
- Vous êtes journaliste ?
- Non, je m'appelle Tru.
- Vous jurez de pas être journaliste ?
Je le jure.
Votre soeur est adorable,
elle vous ressemble.
Que puis-je pour vous ?
Vous avez laissé ça à la morgue.
Je voulais vous le ramener avant votre départ.
Je voulais aussi vous parler de l'homme
qui est venu à la morgue aujourd'hui.
- Peter ?
- Il semblait assez énervé.
- Ça ne vous regarde pas.
- En effet.
- Je suis inquiète à votre sujet.
- Pourquoi ?
- J'ai un mauvais pressentiment
- Vous êtes extralucide maintenant ?
Vous avez posé des questions
bizarres toute la journée.
Merci de m'avoir rapporté mon sac,
vous devez partir maintenant.
- Si vous avez des problèmes, je peux vous aider.
- Je ne vous connais même pas.
- Pas encore, mais si vous me donnez une chance.
- Nous serions les meilleures amies du monde.
- Carly, s'il vous plaît.
- Ecoutez.
Revenez encore et j'appelle la police.
Merci encore.
- On devrait reboire ensemble un jour.
- À propos de ce que je t'ai dit tout à l'heure.
J'ai perdu trop d'amis en privilégiant
mes relations amoureuses.
Je ne veux pas en perdre un autre.
Faut arrêter de dire ça.
Ça n'arrivera jamais.
Je te dépose ?
Non merci, je vais marcher.
Bonne chance pour ce soir.
Merci encore mec.
Laisse tes clés !
Écarte-toi de la voiture.
Doucement mec, doucement
Calme-toi.
Ya pas de problème.
Garde tes clés Harrison.
Non, t'aurais pas dû dire ça !
Malheureusement je l'ai dit.
Les clés !
- C'est ta voiture, pas la sienne.
- La ferme !
Ecoute, il demande les clés,
je lui donne.
Pas cette fois.
La seule manière pour qu'il prenne ta voiture,
c'est que tu la lui donnes.
Parce qu'il a sûrement pas les couilles
de la prendre lui-même.
S'il les avait, nous serions déjà morts
et il serait déjà parti.
T'es sûr de ça ?
Oh que oui.
Cette caisse, c'est une merde.
Elle n'en vaut pas la peine.
Dans 5 secondes, ton pote est mort.
Jack, déconne pas.
Cinq.
Allez Jack, ça vaut pas le coup.
Quatre.
Trois.
- Jack, allez
- Tout va bien Harrison.
Je vais te donner mes clés.
Un
Putain, c'était quoi ça, mec ?
J'ai foiré.
Elle ne me parlera plus maintenant.
C'est qu'elle ne te comprend pas.
<i>Tout se passait bien hier.</i>
Et à cause de mon don,
elle croit que je suis une tarée.
Et je ne peux pas le lui reprocher.
Tout ce qui compte, c'est de la sauver.
Je sais, c'est que, tôt ou tard,
ça va me faire perdre tous mes amis.
La vie d'un héros est semée d'embûches.
Je peux gérer les embûches,
<i>mais ça craint d'être toute seule.</i>
Tu n'as rien trouvé à propos
du gars avec qui elle se disputait ?
Non, juste son nom, Peter.
<i>Tu penses à quoi ?
Un de ses ex peut-être ?</i>
- Ça peut coller.
- Et maintenant ?
Je file Carly en espérant
qu'elle ne me repère pas.
- Et si je te retrouvais là-bas ?
- Davis, tu n'es pas obligé de le faire.
Non, j'en ai envie, parce que...
Tru, tu n'es pas toute seule.
- Merci
- A tout de suite.
Tu vas bien ?
J'ai l'air d'un mec qui va bien ?
Tu as l'air d'un mec qui a toujours sa voiture.
Quoi ?
- Il allait te tuer !
- Mais il ne l'a pas fait.
Quand on parle de courage, je comprends.
Mais là c'était...
Tu as des pulsions de mort ?
Pas besoin d'avoir envie de mourir,
la mort vient, quoi qu'il arrive.
Mais, qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Je peux te faire une confidence ?
Bien sûr.
Je t'ai menti.
J'ai dit qu'un de mes amis était décédé.
J'étais à des funérailles.
Mais je ne connaissais pas le défunt.
Tu t'es trompé d'église ?
Non, c'est ce que j'aime faire.
- Aller à l'enterrement d'inconnus.
- Oui.
- Pour quoi ? Les gâteaux ?
- Non.
Pour la clarté.
Je me rallie au fait que
la mort est inévitable,
la mort fait partie de la vie.
Et dès que tu comprends ça, tu es libre.
Tu peux faire ce dont tu as envie.
C'est de ça que tu parlais tout à l'heure.
Tu parlais d'assurer avec Lindsay.
Écoute, je suis sûr que Lindsay
est une fille bien.
Mais les filles bien,
veulent une belle vie.
Une maison avec une barrière blanche,
et 2,5 enfants jouant dans le jardin.
Je ne te connais pas encore bien,
Mais tu es le genre de gars qui veut plus que ça.
Qui a besoin de plus que ça.
Plus de liberté, plus de fun.
Plus de vie.
Il y a plus que prévu.
Disons que c'est une avance.
Tu as oublié notre arrangement ?
Tu me donnes le montant que je demande
au moment que je souhaite.
Ça fait 8 ans que ça dure.
J'en ai assez.
Pas moi.
Merci pour le supplément,
mais comptez sur moi,
je ne vous lâcherai pas.
- C'est quoi cet arrangement ?
- À qui ai-je l'honneur ?
Quelqu'un qui veut aider Carly.
Elle a dit que vous étiez un vieil ami,
mais vous ressemblez plutôt à un racketteur.
Je suis reporter au <i>Sun Times</i>.
Ce que vous avez vu est anecdotique.
Elle vous a payé pour cacher
un secret qui date de 8 ans.
- Je ne peux rien vous dire.
- Que s'est-il passé ?
C'est Isabelle.
Ce n'est pas sa soeur.
C'est sa fille.
Je ne sais pas ce que vous allez faire,
mais si vous la touchez,
je previendrai la police.
Vous plaisantez ?
Elle me paye le crédit
de ma résidence secondaire.
Je n'ai aucun intérêt
à lui faire du mal.
Je peux y aller ?
C'est vraiment la fille de Carly ?
<i>Le scoop !
Tu penses que le reporter est le tueur ?</i>
- Non, c'est sa poule aux oeufs d'or.
- Alors c'est qui ?
<i>Je suis retournée chez elle
pour en savoir plus.</i>
D'après tes statistiques, le coupable
est souvent un proche de la victime.
Exact.
Ce qui place Anna en première ligne.
Ça va ?
On avait rendez-vous il y a 2 heures !
Où étais-tu ?
J'étais aux courses.
Ya pas de quoi en faire un flan.
Justement si.
Je t'avais dit que c'était important.
Je suis là maintenant.
Où est ta grande soeur ?
Elle est partie.
J'ai foiré, c'est ça ?
- À quoi tu joues ?
- À rien.
Et toi, pourquoi es-tu si mielleuse ?
Pardon ?
Exactement comme Jack l'avait dit.
Que vient-il faire dans notre relation ?
Il m'arrivera d'être en retard,
ou de poser un lapin.
Il va falloir t'y habituer.
Je ne pense pas.
Si tu te sens prisonnier avec moi,
tu es désormais libéré.
Peu importe.
Je te quitte.
Que faites-vous là ?
Carly m'a demandé de passer
au sujet de la morgue.
- Tout va bien entre vous deux ?
- Honnêtement, non.
Pourquoi ça ?
Carly m'a prêté sa voiture pour faire des courses
pendant qu'elle était chez sa mère.
J'ai eu un petit accrochage et elle m'a engueulée.
Vous avez eu un accident ?
En sortant du parking,
quelqu'un a accroché la portière.
Il y a une franche éraflure rouge,
mais peu importe.
C'est une voiture de location.
Excusez-moi.
Enfin.
Anna a eu un accident
avec la voiture de Carly.
- Quoi ?
- Une voiture rouge a accroché sa portière.
Si l'accrochage a été fait
avant l'accident sur le pont...
Sa sortie de route n'est pas un accident.
- Elle s'est volontairement jetée du pont.
- Un suicide ? Impossible.
Elle a appelé les secours en disant
qu'elle était poursuivie.
Pourquoi faire ça si elle voulait en finir ?
Je suis sûre qu'on a voulu la tuer.
Qui et pourquoi ?
C'est Carly.
Ce n'est pas possible.
Ça n'a aucun sens.
Très bien.
Je te rappelle
dès que je lui aurai parlé.
Tout va bien ?
C'était l'agent de Carly
qui me disait qu'elle n'a aucun tournage
de film sur la morgue en cours.
Comment ça ?
Le film sur la morgue c'est du pipeau !
Son prochain film est une comédie romantique.
- Alors pourquoi passer la journée avec nous ?
- C'est exactement ce que je me demandais.
Carly nous a menti.
Il n'y a aucun film sur la morgue.
- Quoi ?
- Elle l'a inventé.
Alors pourquoi venir à la morgue
et poser toutes ces questions ?
<i>Ça va te paraître dingue, mais je pense</i>
qu'elle veut simuler sa mort.
Quoi ?
Les 2 fois, elle m'a demandé
ce qui se passait lorqu'on ne retrouve pas le corps.
Elle voulait s'assurer de passer pour morte.
- Pourquoi ?
<i>- C'était son plan, tout simplement.</i>
Simuler sa mort et disparaître.
Elle est venue à la morgue pour ça.
Pour connaître la procédure.
Elle avait la gloire et l'argent.
Pourquoi faire ça ?
Imagine ses 8 dernières années.
<i>Avec sa crainte de la révélation de son secret.</i>
Elle devait être prête à tout pour s'en sortir.
Si tu dis vrai, son accident
comme l'appel des secours...
Étaient pure mascarade.
Il y a un truc qui cloche.
Hier, Carly ne faisait pas semblant de mourir.
Sinon tu ne revivrais pas la journée.
Quelque chose qu'elle n'avait pas prévu
a dû mal tourner.
Peu importe ce que c'était,
tu dois l'empêcher au plus vite.
Mon Dieu !
J'ai besoin d'aide, venez vite.
Je suis poursuivie, dépêchez-vous !
Mais...
Écoutez-moi.
Que foutez-vous ici ?
Je sais ce que vous voulez faire,
ça ne marchera pas.
Ça marchera si vous la fermez.
Je ne vous dénoncerai pas.
Laissez-moi tranquille !
Attention !
Il vous a renversée hier.
C'est pour ça que
vous êtes tombée dans le fleuve.
Morte ?
Vous délirez ?
Je sais tout.
Je sais pour Isabelle.
- C'est votre fille.
- Comment avez-vous su ?
Je m'en doutais.
Je pensais que
ça foutrait ma carrière en l'air.
Et vous l'avez cachée pendant 8 ans ?
Vous n'imaginez pas la difficulté
de garder un secret
que certains veulent dévoiler.
J'imagine très bien.
J'ai aussi un secret.
Plusieurs fois j'ai pensé
à tout plaquer, en le reniant.
Mais je tiens le coup,
car une vie est en jeu.
Laquelle ?
Ce soir, c'était la vôtre.
Je sais que tôt ou tard
on aurait été démasquées.
C'est insupportable de redouter chaque matin
la parution de votre histoire dans le journal.
Depuis peu, je l'ai donc avoué à Isabelle.
C'était vraiment difficile.
Elle l'a accepté maintenant, et elle est d'accord
pour qu'on commence une nouvelle vie.
En simulant votre mort ?
Je m'en vais ce soir,
et Isabelle vient avec moi.
Je ne voulais pas en arriver là.
J'ai essayé de payer celui
qui me faisait chanter, pour qu'il cesse.
Il a refusé.
Il ne me restait que cette solution.
Si Isabelle l'a accepté,
pourquoi s'être autant compliqué la vie ?
Pourquoi ne pas avoir dit la vérité ?
Ça lui aurait servi d'être assaillie par les médias ?
Elle n'aurait pas eu une enfance normale.
Je suis désolée pour vous
si votre secret est un carcan.
Mais je refuse de continuer comme ça.
Je croyais que tu étais sorti
avec Lindsay et sa soeur.
Ça ?
A vrai dire, ça s'est mal passé.
Elle...
Elle m'a plaqué.
Désolé.
J'aurais dû m'en douter.
Elle m'a laissé des occasions de me refaire,
mais je les ai toutes foirées.
C'est ma spécialité,
de faire tout foirer.
Ça doit être dur de perdre
une fille comme Lindsay.
C'est peut-être mieux comme ça.
Et toutes ces occasions dont tu parles.
C'étaient aussi des occasions
pour elle de te faire changer.
Les vrais amis n'essaient pas de se changer.
Les amis t'acceptent tel que tu es.
Ils t'apprécient pour ce que tu es.
Ouais, j'imagine.
N'imagine pas.
Je ne te connais que depuis peu,
mais je suis ton ami...
...quoi qu'il advienne.
Le devoir m'appelle.
- À bientôt.
- Merci.
Tu es certaine ?
Pas la peine.
Carly a pris cette décision,
c'est sa vie.
Il y a plusieurs façons d'aider les gens.
Certains veulent vivre,
d'autre préfèrent mourir.
Et d'autres veulent un peu des 2.
J'ai enfin réussi à comprendre ce qu'elle voulait.
Protéger sa fille.
Ça a failli lui coûter la vie.
Je ne parlais pas d'elle,
mais de ma mère.
<i>Je ne comprends pas.</i>
Pourquoi nous appeler
s'il n'y a pas de corps ?
Ils ont dû nous appeler
dès qu'ils ont vu la voiture dans l'eau,
en pensant que le corps était dedans.
Le courant a dû l'emporter.
Il se peut qu'on ne le retrouve pas.
On se retrouve au bureau.
Dommage.
Pour une fois que tu étais là,
c'est le corps qui manque.
Que veux-tu.
Pauvre Carly Anders.
Elle avait la vie devant elle.
C'est fou la vie, pas vrai ?
Un jour on est en vie,
puis le lendemain on est mort.
Où qu'elle soit en ce moment,
c'est certainement un monde meilleur.
Coucou maman.
Ça faisait longtemps,
mais j'étais occupée.
Tu es bien placée pour me comprendre.
Je reviendrai bientôt.
Je te le promets.

Précédemment dans Tru Calling
- Bienvenue ici, je suis Tru
- Jack
Il y a quelques années, je suis mort
et puis, je suis revenu
Certains diraient que vous êtes
revenu pour une raison
On verra bien
- Comment ça va avec Jack ?
- Je n'arrive pas à le cerner
Il est désagréable et odieux et l'instant d'après,
 il est charmant et veut être ton meilleur ami
Laisse les clés
et éloigne-toi de la voiture
- Garde tes clés Harrison
- Tu es sûr de ça ?
- Tout à fait
- Tu veux mourir ma parole ?
- La mort est inévitable
La mort fait partie de la vie
- Quelqu'un a tout fait pour ne pas la sauver
- Mais ça n'a aucun sens
<i>Donc, tu t'es fait livrer.
Qu'est-ce que tu as pris ?</i>
- Du porc aigre-doux.
- Bon choix, avec les pancakes ?
Non seuls, et toi ?
Des weetabix avec
purée de pommes de terre à l'ail.
- Encore des céréales?
- Mon docteur m'a prescrit des fibres.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ce soir ?
- Tu sais, comme d'habitude
- Rien ?
- Exactement
Moi étant seul un vendredi soir,
c'est compréhensible, mais toi ?
Je me repose quand
j'ai une nuit de repos
Et en plus, je te l'ai dit.
Je sors d'une relation.
- Quoi ?
- Quelqu'un te manque
- Luc... pourquoi est-ce que Luc me manquerait ?
- Je n'ai pas dit Luc, tu l'as dit
<i>Ce que je pense c'est que le fait d'être seul
ne signifie pas que l'on est solitaire</i>
Donc selon ta théorie, tu dirais que
ma voisine d'en face
- Elle semble passer une super soirée.
- Elle est probablement misérable.
Je peux te le dire Davis
Elle semble beaucoup s'amuser
<i>Crois-moi, on est parfois bien loin
de la vérité</i>
Je dois y aller.
L'intégrale d'<i>Outerlimits</i> va commencer.
Je te laisse
Hé Tru, tu as une vie plus excitante que la mienne
Revenir dans le temps, sauver des vies, un patron sympa
- Ouais bonne nuit Davis
- Bonne nuit Tru
Laissez-moi un message
Je vous rappellerai
C'est un avertissement, tu peux faire
ce que tu veux mais je vais te retrouver
et quand ce sera le cas,
il n'y aura pas de 2ème avertissement
Ep.1-18 Rear Window
C'est le livreur
J'arrive
4B, pas 3B
4 c'est un étage au-dessus
Salut Tru, ça fait longtemps
Je pensais que tu avais déménagé
Non, j'ai eu beaucoup de travail dernièrement
- Le livreur a laissé cela à mon adresse
- Cool, merci
- Hé Tru, je peux te demander un conseil ?
- Bien sûr
- Il y a cette fille qui vit dans le coin
Elle est fantastique - D'accord
Elle est toujours occupée à courir partout
mais quand je la vois
Elle me donne envie de sourire
- Je vois
- Oui et je voulais l'inviter à sortir
depuis un moment. J'ai peur qu'elle dise non
et que la situation soit gênante, on est voisins
Mon premier conseil est de t'assurer
qu'elle est prête de son côté
Et après je ferais les choses en douceur
- D'accord, en douceur
- Très en douceur, tu vois ?
ok, ça tient debout
ok, merci
Pas de problème
- Justement la personne que je cherchais
- Je parie que tu dis ça à toutes les filles
- Tu te rappelles que je cherchais un appart ?
- Ouais
Je l'ai trouvé, près du boulot, taxes incluses
- Félicitations
Je n'ai pas encore signé
parce que je voulais en parler avec toi d'abord
- Moi, pourquoi ?
- C'est dans l'immeuble en face du tien
Et si ça te gène ou quoique ce soit
je préférais vérifier avant
Tu plaisantes, tu ne devrais pas attendre
Les bons plans sont durs à trouver dans le quartier
- Salut les gars
- Tu as ton formulaire ?
- Davis me l'a rappelé 3 fois
- Donc tu es sûre ?
- à 100%
- Ça sera sympa d'avoir un ami en face
- Je dois aller signer alors
- A plus
- Salut
Signé et daté, parfait
Tu as mis l'adresse de la morgue comme domicile.
Ça ne vous dérange pas ? J'habite chez un ami
qui n'a pas de ligne téléphonique,
donc c'est le meilleur moyen de me joindre.
Pas de problème. Au fait, tu as eu
du courrier ce matin
Voilà
Le centre Schenkman
C'est un centre renommé.
Oui, l'un des meilleurs du pays
Tu y es resté longtemps ?
Ca n'était pas dans ton cv
C'était il y a longtemps
J'ai trouvé ça sans importance
Tu connais un gars du nom de Tom Forrester ?
Un de mes copains d'université
On jouait à <i>Donjons et Dragons</i> le week-end
On l'appelait le magicien.
Forrester, bien sûr, un brave gars.
Le vieux magicien.
Je devrais l'appeler
<i>Appeler Tom Forrester</i>
On a rendez-vous à midi pile,
sous le clocher, pour le duel final.
Ne sois pas si dramatique
C'est la première fois qu'on se revoit
depuis notre rupture.
On échange nos affaires
C'est dramatique.
Je veux que vous soyez heureux
mais en réalité, être seul n'est pas plus mal
De qui te moques-tu ?
Pas moi
Et tu es en miettes depuis
ta rupture avec Luc
- Ce n'est pas vrai
- A quoi ressemble ta vie en ce moment ?
Parler à Davis au téléphone toute la journée
Me dire que ton voisin à le béguin pour toi
- Ce n'est pas ta journée
- Tu as raison, je suis désolé
Je suis juste nerveux, je dois y aller
C'est à qui de payer ?
Parce qu'on paye chacun notre tour ?
- C'est moi qui régale la prochaine fois
- Je retiens ma respiration
Je m'en fous, écoute moi
Pour la dernière fois
laisse-moi tranquille
<i>Ma voisine, elle semble passer
la meilleure soirée de sa vie</i>
Certains gars n'acceptent pas qu'on leur dise non
Essayez de dire oui
Oui, tu es un psychopathe
Oui j'avais raison de te quitter
Je m'en souviendrai
J'ai l'impression de vous connaître
On s'est déjà rencontrées ?
Non mais je vous ai vue dans le voisinage
Merci, Chris
- Je suis Tru Davies
- Chris Berenson
- C'est sympa de mettre un nom sur un visage
- Absolument
- Merci
- Au revoir
Un t-shirt de <i>Motley Crüe</i>.
Un jeu de cartes avec des filles nues
2 oeufs <i>Silly Putty</i>
et 13 comic books
Je les cherchais partout
- Bon, où sont mes affaires ?
- Ici
- C'est tout ?
- J'ai cherché partout.
C'est tout ce que j'ai trouvé.
Ce n'est pas le mien
Je t'ai demandé de venir ici aujourd'hui
parce que je voulais te regarder dans les yeux
Dans ces yeux
Et te dire que
Je veux que tu reviennes
- Quoi ?
- Donne-moi une autre chance, c'est tout
Je t'ai déjà donné 50 chances
et tu les as toutes laissées passer
Tu es trop égoïste pour t'en rendre compte
- Et tu es la parfaite petite amie ?
- Quoi ?
Tu es tellement exigeante
Tu as pris la chose la plus chère du menu
alors que tu savais que je n'avais pas les moyens
Prend soin de toi Harrison
Je ne sais pas la fermer
Bonjour, Tom Forrester SVP
Hé Magic, c'est Garthor, le roi des elfes
Oui, Davis
Il se trouve que nous avons
un ami en commun, Jack Harper
Oui il travaillait avec toi à Schenkman
Oh vraiment ?
- Allo
- Ton frère et moi c'est officiellement terminé
Je ne suis pas surprise
mais je suis vraiment désolée
Il a essayé de me récupérer une dernière fois
mais quand j'ai dit non
Il a dit que j'étais nécessiteuse et exigeante
Tu peux croire ça ?
- Allo Tru, tu es là ?
- Oui désolée
Il y a un couple dans l'immeuble d'en face
qui a une grosse dispute
- Ils se séparent ?
- Je ne peux pas le dire
- Ils ont fermé la lumière
- Ils se réconcilient au lit
Oui tu as probablement raison
Je dois aller au boulot
- Bien, je te parle plus tard, ok ?
- D'accord
Un nouveau
- Je croyais que ton voisinage s'améliorait
- C'est le cas
J'ai un meurtre ici qui prouve le contraire
- Dans mon immeuble ?
- En face de chez toi il me semble
La victime est Chris Berenson
Morte après un trauma
- Chris Berenson ?
- Un ami à toi ?
- Non on s'est rencontrées aujourd'hui
- Tu veux rester là ?
Oui
- Ce n'est pas Chris Berenson
- C'est le nom sur sa carte d'identité
Non, Chris est une fille
J'ai vu ce gars chez elle
plus tôt dans la soirée
Il semblait furieux à propos de quelque chose
Tu sais, les policiers ont parlé
d'une meurtrière
Prends ça
2 personnes, même nom
même appartement
- Une coïncidence ?
- J'en doute
Un corps ici n'est jamais bon
- Salut Tru
- Je te pensais chez toi ce soir
- J'y étais mais...
- Tu ne peux pas t'en empêcher hein ?
- En fait, si tu as un instant
- Ça peut attendre un peu ?
C'est le moment où l'on doit parler
Tru vas-y, je m'en occupe
- Tru ?
- Oui, d'accord, j'arrive.
Sauve-moi !
<i>C'est le livreur.</i>
<i>C'est le livreur.</i>
Attendez, c'est une erreur.
Il s'enfuit même quand la journée recommence.
Donc ta voisine et la victime
ont le même nom.
- Il est mort, elle est le suspect n°1.
- Sinon ça aurait été trop facile.
D'accord, voila ma théorie.
Ça pourrait être une usurpation d'identité.
Il a pris sa place et elle l'a tué pour ça.
L'usurpation d'identité est en progression.
Que ce soit sur internet,
ou l'utilisation de photo
de carte de crédit prise avec un gsm.
Elle semble sans problème.
C'est dur de croire qu'elle puisse tuer.
Les gens peuvent se surpasser,
surtout quand ils sont poussés à bout.
Pour la dernière fois,
laisse-moi tranquille.
- Tu as sûrement raison.
- Salut Jack.
Désolé de vous déranger, je viens juste
déposer des papiers.
Merci beaucoup.
On jetait un oeil sur la nouvelle procédure.
- Je peux vérifier mon courrier ?
- Vas-y.
Tru, concernant la nouvelle procédure.
Tu as des indices concernant
l'identité de la victime ?
Il avait un stylo avec un logo dessus
un soleil avec un A majuscule.
Ça vient probablement de son travail.
Je travaille là-dessus.
- Un usurpateur qui a un boulot.
- Raison de plus de rencontrer la victime.
Je ferais mieux d'y aller.
Elle sera au <i>Diner</i> dans un instant.
Ok, je t'appelle
si j'ai quelque chose de nouveau.
J'oubliais.
Tu voulais me dire un truc
avant le retour en arrière.
- C'est vrai ?
- Tu as dit que c'était important.
Je ne vois pas.
Dommage que je ne revive pas les journées.
On aura probablement la même conversation
si tu ne changes pas trop les évènements.
Je l'espère.
Journée identique, j'ai compris.
Pas le temps pour le petit-déj.
Comme tu as une journée d'avance
Que m'est-il arrivé hier ?
Mon conseil, repousse la rencontre
à plus tard.
- Ça s'est mal passé ?
- C'est rien de le dire.
Merci de m'avoir prévenu, dommage pour
le petit-déj, je voulais t'inviter.
Ça doit être sympa de vivre
dans ton monde.
- Salut Jack, tu as vu Tru ?
- Tu viens de la manquer.
Merde, j'avais une question à lui poser
et je n'ai pas beaucoup de temps
Appelle-la sur son portable
Non, il vaut mieux lui demander en face
pour être sûr de ce qu'elle dit
Tu veux dire que les femmes
ne disent pas toujours ce qu'elles pensent ?
Pas celles que j'ai aimées.
À plus.
Pour la dernière fois
laisse-moi tranquille
Un café, SVP
Certains gars n'acceptent pas qu'on leur dise non
- Ex petit-ami ?
- C'est une longue histoire
- Tenez
- Merci Chris
J'ai l'impression de vous connaître
Vous n'habitez pas sur York par hasard ?
C'est le cas
- Moi aussi, je suis Tru Davies
- Chris Berenson
C'est sympa de mettre un nom sur un visage
Chris... Berenson
- Vous avez entendu parler de moi ?
- En quelque sorte
Un gars posait plein de questions sur vous
ce matin et semblait plutôt hostile
A peu près 1m80,
cheveux châtains ?
Le même qui n'accepte pas qu'on lui dise non ?
Ce n'est pas un ex.
C'est plus compliqué.
Vous voulez que je vous accompagne ?
au cas où il serait dans les parages ?
- D'accord
- D'accord
C'était il y a 6 mois, j'ai découvert
qu'il avait volé mon identité
Je voulais faire un emprunt et la banque
a trouvé 10 cartes de crédit à mon nom
Il a dépensé au moins 60 000 $
- Et maintenant il vous menace ?
- Parce que je suis allée à la police
Pas d'arrestation ?
J'ai suivi la procédure, il me faut des preuves
et je n'en ai pas
Mais c'est de pire en pire
car je me sens observée
C'est terrifiant
Vous savez comment tout a commencé ?
Non, tout est possible
Si vous n'avez pas de shredder, de firewall
ou un téléphone à cryptage
n'importe qui peut ruiner votre vie.
En tout cas, merci de m'avoir
tenu compagnie
Et si vous voyez de nouveau cet homme
n'hésitez pas a le dénoncer.
Pas de problème
Parce que si je le croise
qui peut dire ce qui va arriver
- Jack, qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
- J'emménage
- Tu rigoles ?
- Non j'ai vu 'à louer' et j'ai sauté dessus
J'ai eu de la chance, le gars qui devait le prendre
n'a pas répondu à temps
parce qu'il devait demander quelque chose
à sa copine
C'est en face de ton appart
Donc si c'est inconvenant
Le malheur des uns fait le bonheur des autres
3ème étage, superbe vue, incroyable
- C'est-ce que j'ai entendu
- Je dois aller faire mes cartons
On se voit plus tard
Tru, ton amie que je viens de croiser
n'est pas célibataire par hasard ?
Je ne suis pas sûre qu'elle ait besoin
d'un nouveau copain en ce moment
En plus, suis mon conseil
Les filles n'aiment pas être draguées par leur voisin
- Tu devrais avoir des voisins plus intéressants
- Tu devrais être moins prétentieux
Elle a des problèmes avec les hommes
en ce moment, ok ?
- Mauvaise rupture ?
- Pas vraiment
ok, ne me dis rien
Je découvrirai par moi-même
En tout cas
En vérité, un gars la harcèle
et la dernière chose dont elle ait besoin est...
...d'un deuxième, j'ai compris
Si cet autre gars est un danger pour elle
Je peux la surveiller
Tu penses que je suis sans coeur
J'ai déjà eu de la compassion pour les êtres humains.
- En dehors de moi
- Merci, je gère la situation
Je n'en attendais pas moins de toi
- Allo
- <i>C'est moi</i>
- J'ai trouvé ton logo et ton usurpateur
- Vraiment ?
Une entreprise du nom de Advantix.
ils vendent de l'équipement médical
Et l'un de leurs vendeurs
s'appelle Chris Berenson
Tu as une adresse ?
Pas la peine, il vient à la morgue dans 20 min
pour nous faire une démonstration
Tu as pris RDV avec lui
J'ai dit que nous voulions changer de fournisseur.
Pourquoi toujours courir après le méchant
- On le fait venir à nous pour une fois
- Super, je te vois dans 20 min
- Ma collègue Tru, voici Chris Berenson
- Salut
STP, aide-moi
C'est mon premier RDV dans une morgue
La plupart de nos équipements
- sont faits pour que le patient reste en vie
- Tout le monde y passe un jour ou l'autre
Vrai, laissez-moi vous présenter
ce qui pourrait vous être utile
- Ça fait longtemps que vous faites ce boulot ?
- 8/9 mois, pourquoi ?
- Ça paie bien ?
- Seulement si vous achetez ce que je vends
On dirait que vous ne vendez pas beaucoup
- ok, qui êtes vous ?
- Je pense que cette question s'applique mieux à vous
- Quoi ?  - Nous connaissons la vraie
Chris Berenson et vous n'êtes pas elle
Et ce n'est qu'une question de temps
avant que la police ne l'apprenne
Elle est douée.
- Elle vous a raconté n'importe quoi
- Vous ne comprenez pas
Non, j'ai raison
Vous ne comprenez pas
La police est de mon côté
sauf qu'ils ne peuvent rien faire
Je suis le vrai Chris Berenson, ok
Voilà, regardez
Elle a volé mon identité
et si vous savez qui elle est
Vous feriez mieux de lui parler
avant que je la retrouve
Sa photo correspond bien
d'après son permis de conduire.
La police confirme qu'il y a eu 6 plaintes
pour usurpation d'identité déclarées par un homme,
du nom de Chris Berenson.
- C'est lui qui dit la vérité
- La fille que tu as rencontrée t'as donc menti
Elle m'a sûrement donné ce nom car
c'est celui qui était sur la carte d'identité
J'ai passé la journée à aider la mauvaise
personne et celui qui a besoin d'aide ne veut plus me voir
Aider le criminel est peut-être
un moyen d'aider la victime
Comme le vrai Chris ne va pas te répondre
Tu dois te concentrer sur l'imposteur
- pour l'empêcher de commettre le meurtre
- D'accord
- Allo
- <i>C'est Jack</i>
- <i>Quoi de neuf ?</i>
- Ton amie a la bougeotte
- Elle a quitté l'immeuble ?
- Oui, mais je garde un oeil sur elle
- <i>Tu la suis ?</i>
- Tu semblais inquiète, je voulais t'aider
- <i>Où est-elle maintenant ?</i>
- Elle est de retour dans le quartier
Mais elle était dans une bijouterie
du centre il y a environ 1h
Elle a acheté quelque chose ?
Oui un collier
Mais elle ne l'a pas gardé longtemps
Elle l'a revendu un peu plus loin dans un magasin
pour récupérer son argent, étrange n'est-ce pas ?
Elle est presque chez elle, je te la laisse
J'ai du taf.
Attends Jack
Attends que je raccroche
pour me dire que je te manque.
Désolée c'est pas le cas.
Pourquoi est-ce que tu l'as suivie ?
Elle semblait avoir des ennuis et en dehors
de sa petite affaire, elle n'est pas si méchante.
Fais attention, elle n'est pas vraiment
ce qu'elle semble être
Qui l'est ?
- Jack la surveille ?
- Il essaye d'aider
Je veux que tu prennes ça
C'est le nom et le numéro du policier que j'ai eu.
Qui est Tom Forrester ?
C'est un de mes copains d'université
Je ne lui ai pas parlé depuis des années, pourquoi ?
Hier, tu avais un mot pour l'appeler
Essaye de savoir ce qu'il veut
Il faut que la journée reste le plus identique possible
ok, je l'appellerai.
C'est un mec extra.
Qu'est-ce que je viens de dire
- Harrison
- Au sujet du RDV...
- <i>Laisse-moi deviner, tu ne peux pas venir</i>
- Pas vraiment
Tu as perdu mes affaires, c'est ça ?
Ce n'est pas ça, c'est juste...
Ce n'est pas le bon moment
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que, je dois... C'est comme ça
Très bien, quoi qu'il en soit
- RDV demain, même heure, même endroit
- Je serai là, promis
Tu as intérêt à avoir raison Tru
Excusez-moi mademoiselle
N'oubliez pas ça
- Randall ?
- Lindsay ?
Donc, vous pouvez me dire qui
vous êtes en réalité ?
- Je vous l'ai déjà dit, je suis ...
- Arrêtez, je sais que ce n'est pas le cas
Tout comme je sais que vous avez acheté des
bijoux avec la carte de crédit d'une autre personne
et l'avez revendu pour avoir du liquide
- Comment savez-vous tout ça ?
- Ça n'a pas d'importance
Il est temps pour vous d'arrêter,
de rendre sa vie à ce Chris
- Je le ferai, un jour
- Un jour, ce sera trop tard
- Faites-moi confiance
- Je n'ai confiance en personne
C'est pour ça que je réussis ce que je fais
Restez en dehors de ça, Tru.
Ça vous dépasse.
Salut Tru, quelle surprise
Comment ça va ?
Bien, merci. Au fait, j'ai un paquet pour toi
Une erreur de livraison ce matin
Tu veux venir ...
Il y a cette fille que j'aimerais inviter
Tu sais quoi, je te l'apporte plus tard
pour ne pas te déranger, ok ?
- Je serai ravi de venir et de voir ton appart
- Je suis pressée
ok, je peux te poser une question ?
Désolée, je n'ai pas le temps
mais on en parle plus tard
- <i>Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait maintenant ?</i>
- On dirait qu'elle fait ses bagages
<i>Bien, ton intervention a marché et elle sera partie
quand le vrai Chris fera son apparition</i>
Peut-être mais ce n'est pas sûr
- J'ai parlé à Tom Forrester au fait
- Et ?
Il m'a parlé de sa femme, ses enfants, ses
recherches mais rien d'intéressant pour toi.
- Il fallait essayer.
- Ça a peut être un rapport avec mon calcul urinaire ?
Probablement pas.
Je continue de chercher.
Vous pensez pouvoir gérer la situation
mais vous vous trompez.
<i>Cela ne résoudra rien
et ne fera qu'aggraver votre cas.</i>
Laissez-moi vous aider ou j'appelle la police.
C'est vous qui voyez.
C'est si facile de vivre sans compter.
Au début c'était pour m'en sortir,
mais c'est vite devenu une habitude.
Vous devez me croire.
Je ne pensais pas que ça irait si loin.
Mais c'est le cas
et il faut trouver une solution.
J'ai peur.
Il m'a laissé des messages menaçants.
Et si je le remboursais ?
Il me dénoncerait à la police ?
Vous pouvez le rembourser ?
- Oui, j'ai du liquide.
- Ah bon ? Vous avez beaucoup d'argent ?
Je vous ai dit que je me débrouillais bien.
C'est parfois utile d'être un bon escroc.
Vous avez ravagé ma vie.
Elle veut se racheter.
C'est pourquoi je vous ai appelé.
C'est ça.
Elle savait que j'allais la retrouver.
- Je suis vraiment désolée.
- Vous êtes désolée ?
Je suis sincère.
Les excuses ne remboursent rien.
Tenez.
Peut-être ça vous aidera.
Tout y est, avec 5% d'intérêts.
C'est le minimum pour que vous me donniez
une seconde chance.
Et j'oubliais,
la carte de crédit.
Si j'entends encore parler de vous,
ou si je vous croise...
Ce ne sera pas le cas.
Je le promets.
Très bien.
J'ai un coup de fil à passer.
D'ici là vous devriez être partie.
Merci.
Vous devez vous en moquer,
mais je m'appelle Cathy.
Enchantée, Cathy.
- Laissez-moi régler.
- Non, c'est pour moi.
Encore merci pour tout.
Je suis démasqué.
Je me sert du van de la morgue
pour mes affaires.
Je n'ai rien vu.
Merci de m'avoir aidée aujourd'hui.
Tu aurais fait pareil.
Quand même,
tu m'a aidée sans sourciller.
J'aurais dû te poser des questions ?
La plupart des gens l'auraient fait.
Je ne me mêle que de ce qui me regarde.
Même pas un peu ?
Très bien.
Raconte-moi tout.
Et si je refuse ?
L'alcool sera ton sérum de vérité.
Bien.
En tout cas, tu me dois un verre.
Ferme le van, s'il te plaît.
Où sont les clés ?
Sur le contact.
Les voilà.
- Tu peux le faire.
- Merci.
Je voudrais un sandwich au roast-beef
à emporter.
Bien sûr.
- Vous n'avez pas de monnaie ?
- Non, désolé.
Je suis désolée,
ce billet est un faux.
C'est pas possible !
Tu as bien dit que ton pote Tom
bossait au <i>Schenkman Center</i> ?
Oui.
- Lui as-tu parlé de Jack ?
- Pourquoi je l'aurais fait ?
Jack avait une lettre du <i>Schenkman Center</i>
dans sa veste.
- Tu as certainement dû la récupérer hier.
- Et si j'appelais Tom ?
Tiens-moi au courant.
Il ne manquait plus que ça.
Vous vous êtes enfermé dehors ?
Oui, ça m'arrive souvent.
Tenez-moi ça.
Je viens d'emménager.
- Merci.
- De rien.
- Voilà.
- Merci.
<i>Lancer le diaporama</i>
Mais que fait-il là ?
Matt !
Vite.
C'est Tru !
Ouvre-moi !
Que fais-tu ici, Tru ?
Vite !
Il faut que j'aille dans l'appartement de Cathy.
Cathy ?
C'est qui ?
Chris c'est Cathy !
La fille que tu as suivie.
Bon.
J'essaie de t'ouvrir.
<i>C'est pas évident.</i>
<i>Ça s'est ouvert ?</i>
Merci, pardon.
<i>Ça a marché ?</i>
Ne vous approchez pas d'elle !
C'est une fille bien.
Matt ! Pose-ça !
Il a forcé la porte,
il lui veut du mal.
Tu veux la protéger mais
tu ne connais rien d'elle.
Je la connais !
Je l'observe depuis qu'elle a emménagé ici.
Je la connais mieux que quiconque.
Pas du tout.
C'est une voleuse.
Elle a usurpé l'identité de cet homme.
C'est impossible.
Elle est parfaite !
Elle ne ferait jamais ça !
Elle a trompé beaucoup de monde, Matt.
Je dis la vérité.
Elle a détourné des milliers de dollars.
Elle a ruiné beaucoup de personnes.
C'est une voleuse ?
C'est la triste vérité.
Je suis désolé.
Ça va ?
Pourquoi êtes-vous revenu ?
On avait un accord.
En effet.
Jusqu'à ce que je découvre
que les billets étaient des faux.
Elle est en fuite et je suis ruiné.
Et je ne la reverrai jamais.
On ne sait jamais.
L'avenir nous réserve des surprises.
Pourquoi cela prend tant de temps ?
Ça fait 45 minutes.
Je suis désolée.
La carte ne passe pas ?
C'est notre ordinateur qui est en panne.
Tout sera réglé dans un instant
mademoiselle Davies.
On quitte la ville, Tru ?
Heureusement que
je ne gobe pas tout les mensonges.
- Les miens en l'occurrence.
- Ça a failli marcher.
C'est au restaurant que j'ai compris.
Quand tu as pris ma carte en photo
avec ton téléphone.
J'ai juste appelé ma banque
pour signaler le vol de ma carte.
Je savais que tu avais le numéro
mais je ne pensais pas que tu allais t'en servir.
Et puis la banque m'a appelée.
<i>Votre carte de crédit a été utilisée
chez le loueur automobile Avalon</i>
Merci.
C'est trop tard pour des explications ?
Trop tard pour moi.
Mais j'en connais qui seraient ravi de les écouter.
Vraiment ?
<i>Le plus beau jour de ma vie.</i>
Avec un mec extra.
Avec mon frère ?
Non, Harrison a été fidèle à lui-même.
Il m'a posé un lapin au dernier moment.
Et c'est là que j'ai remarqué Randall.
Je l'avais rencontré pendant
mes études à l'étranger.
Il est ici pour quelques semaines.
C'est l'opposé de ton frère.
Contente pour toi.
Je commençais à ne plus trop y croire.
Je vois ce que tu veux dire.
Bonne nuit.
<i>Ici Luc, laissez-moi un message.</i>
C'est moi, Tru.
J'ai entendu que tu n'as pas pu
avoir l'appart en face de chez moi.
Je suis désolée.
Je sais qu'on n'est plus ensemble.
Mais ça aurait été sympa d'être voisins.
De te savoir à proximité.
<i>Je te rappellerai bientôt.</i>
Non, c'est moi.
Désolé.
J'ai vu le numéro de la morgue
et comme Luc travaillait ce soir.
Quoi de neuf ?
J'ai parlé à Tom du <i>Schenkman Center</i>.
C'est au sujet de Jack.
Il a été patient là-bas.
Patient ?
C'est un centre psychiatrique.
Il s'est présenté de lui-même.
Pour quitter le suivi quand il le voulait.
On savait qu'il y avait
des zones d'ombre à son propos.
<i>Il y a autre chose.</i>
Il s'est fait interner, se pensant fou.
Les docteurs n'ont pu le confirmer.
Fou comment ?
Il croyait revivre certaines journées.
Revivre certaines journées ?
Comme moi ?
Exactement.
Sous-titrage: Van, Ben & Stinc3
<i>http://trucalling.free.fr</i>
Et je revis les journées
Tu revis des journées
Jack, ce que tu croyais vivre
Je le vis aussi
- Je me pose des questions parfois
- A propos de quoi ?
les conséquences,
les effets boule de neige
Il n'est pas comme toi
Il est ton opposé
- Tu sauves des vies, lui...
- les prend
Tu n'as pas idée de ce que tu fais
Il y a des conséquences
lorsqu'on sauve des gens destinés a mourir
Tu crois que je perturbe l'ordre établi ?
J'en fais peut-être partie
- Qu'est-ce qui sera différent ?
- Ce week-end, on discutera de tout
Luc, reste avec moi
Ma mère avait cette vocation
et elle me l'a transmise
Si tu penses un seul instant que je vais arrêter
tu as tort
Tu dois savoir une chose
C'est plus important que tu ne penses
Tu n'as aucune idée de ce que tu as commencé
Monte
- Donc dis-moi, que sait ma fille ?
- Je commencerai par ce qu'elle ne sait pas
Que vous faisiez ce que je fais
- Elle est forte, ça ne sera pas facile
- J'aime les challenges
Et bien Jack, Je crois que tu en as un
- Allô
- OK, j'y suis
On en a discuté Tru
Tu sais exactement ce que tu dois faire
- Ok, je suis entrée
- Parfait
Rappelle-toi où tu dois aller
Johnson 201
- Je ne le vois pas
- Tourne à gauche
3ème porte à droite. Calme-toi
C'est ce à quoi tu étais destinée
J'y suis Davis. J'ai réussi
Je ne peux pas y croire
Premier jour à l'école de médecine
- Oui, presque
- Presque ? Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
J'aurais eu du mal à être reçue.
Si tu n'avais pas passé tous ces appels
- Tru, écoute-moi
- Quoi ?
- C'est normal que tu sois fière
- Merci Davis, à plus
- Harrison
- C'est moi
- J'ai des nouvelles intéressantes
- Tu as trouvé Jack ?
Non
- Essaye de faire une phrase sans <i>Jack</i> dedans
- Pardon
Quelqu'un tue mon petit-ami et disparaît pendant 2 mois
Ça devient un peu une obsession
C'est pas faux, mais non
Papa est en ville
- Papa ?
- Tout le monde, asseyez-vous
<i>Il m'a invité a dîner,
il n'a pas dit pourquoi</i>
Je dois vraiment y aller
Je vais être en retard pour cette livraison
Oh, félicite-moi. 6 semaines
avec le même boulot, mon record personnel
Félicitations Harri
- Mlle Davies
- Je dois y aller
Oui, professeur
Mlle Davies,
Ce n'est pas parce que votre ami coroner
a utilisé ses relations pour vous faire entrer ici
que vous aurez un traitement de faveur
par rapport aux véritables élèves
Véritables élèves ?
Je suis une véritable élève
Bien.
Dites-moi quelle artère
se termine à l'artère naso-palatine
C'est l'artère maxillaire
Vous êtes en école de médecine
Vous avez une décision à prendre
Êtes-vous prête à sauver des vies ou non ?
- Oui je suis prête
- Ça nous rassure tous
Maintenant passons aux choses sérieuses
- Tu déménages ici ?
- C'est les affaires
Quand le business va bien,
il ne faut pas hésiter
- Et pour Jordan et les enfants ?
- Je les verrai le week-end
Ce n'est pas l'idéal mais ils comprennent
Donc dis-moi, comment va Tru ?
Je sais combien elle était peinée
après ce qu'il est arrivé à Luc
Elle est forte
Si elle retrouve qui a fait ça,
elle le tuera
Promets-moi une chose
Essaie d'éviter qu'elle ne soit trop obsédée
C'est trop tard
Ok, assez discuté. Je veux te dire pourquoi
je t'ai demandé de venir
Vu que j'ouvre un bureau, j'aurai besoin d'aide
Investigations, recherches, ...
- Quelqu'un comme toi
- Tu m'offres un boulot ?
Tu en dis quoi ?
Tu veux travailler avec ton vieux ?
- Tu as refusé ?
- Je t'ai dit, j'ai déjà un boulot
Ce n'est pas le meilleur, mais c'est le mien
et je l'ai eu tout seul
Toute ma vie, j'ai souhaité
qu'il agisse comme un vrai père
Maintenant que c'est le cas
je n'en ai pas besoin
- Non, non, attends
- Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
- Le fourgon, je l'ai garé ici
- C'est la fourrière ?
Non, j'ai tout fait dans les règles
Du verre brisé. Quelqu'un l'a volé
On me l'a volé, Tru
Ils ont volé...
Mes affaires... C'est pas possible
- Calme-toi
- Me calmer, pour une fois que je réussis un boulot
Tu vois ce qu'il arrive.
Essaye d'avoir une vie honnête et voilà
On va trouver quelque chose, c'est promis
Calme-toi et je te promets
Quoi ?
A l'instant ?
Ok, super, merci
- C'était mon book maker
- Et ta vie honnête ?
- Laisse-moi terminer
Quelqu'un correspondant à la description de
Jack vient de récupérer un gros gain
- Où ?
- 111 Grand Street, mais c'était tout à l'heure
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ? Tru
De rien
- C'était quoi ça Jack ?
- Tru, quelle agréable surprise
Les enfants d'aujourd'hui
Même pas un merci
Donc maintenant tu sauves des vies ?
Un, qui te dit que ce camion l'aurait tué
et deux, pourquoi es-tu si surprise ?
Parce que tu prends les vies
Tu ne les sauves pas
Tu n'écoutes pas très bien Tru
Je préserve le destin
Avant que la journée ne recommence
je ne suis pas si différent de lui ou d'elle
- Ou de toi
- Tu es différent
Parce que je n'ai pas tué le copain de quelqu'un
et disparu pendant 2 mois
Vivre dans le passé peut être
si déprimant, tu ne trouves pas ?
Tu pensais que tuer Luc
m'aurait fait tout arrêter
- Cela m'a rendue encore plus forte
- Tu prêches un converti
Je t'ai vue cet été, toutes ces personnes
censées mourir et que tu as sauvées
C'est vrai, pas un seul échec
pendant que tu faisais quoi exactement ?
- Voyages, détente
- La mort prend des vacances ?
Mais tu sais ce que j'ai fait de plus Tru ?
J'ai espéré. J'ai espéré que
tu reviendrais à la raison
J'ai espéré que tu arrêterais de sauver
des personnes censées mourir
Correction. Elles sont censées vivre
Je te donne un cadeau, la meilleure
excuse de tout arrêter
En fait, tu me donnes toutes les raisons
de continuer
Donc nous voilà
De retour à la case départ
A plus tard Tru
On se verra lors de la répétition
- Je t'attendrai
- Pas si je suis là le premier
Ep.2-01 Perfect Storm
Il est de retour Davis
- De retour pour m'arrêter
- Tu es prête pour ça
Tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter
Tu es prête
C'est toi qui semble inquiet
Je ne suis pas inquiet
Je suis curieux
Pourquoi est-elle surprise de te voir ?
J'ai de plus grosses surprises
en réserve pour elle.
Écoutez, je peux gérer cela
Vous n'avez pas besoin de rester ici
Je connais ma fille, Jack
et tu auras besoin de toute l'aide possible
J'ai des personnes pour m'aider
Toi, Harrison
Mais c'est ma vocation, la mission que
l'on m'a confiée. Je peux le battre
Tu es prêt ?
Parce que je suis certain qu'elle l'est
Vous êtes fière d'elle
C'est mignon
Mais je lui ai donné la possibilité d'arrêter
et elle n'en a pas voulu
Donc je l'arrêterai moi-même
La confiance. Comme moi
quand je faisais ce boulot
Sauf que j'ai gagné
Avant que sa journée ne commence
Suis-la.
Je dois aller à l'étage. Je suis en retard
pour mon évaluation psychologique
C'est vrai. La médecine du travail
Bonne chance Davis
C'est une simple formalité. Tom Jordan et moi
sommes de vieux amis.
- Ok Tom, on fait ça vite
- Vite ?
- Je viens voir Tom Jordan
- Il s'est retiré pour raisons médicales
Je ne le savais pas malade
Désolée. Je suis Dr Carrie Allen
Sa remplaçante
- Et vous devez être ...
- Je suis Davis
Davis, par ici
- Vous avez 2h de retard Dr Davis
- C'est juste Davis
- Je pensais que vous ne viendriez plus
- Non, j'aime les tests psychologiques
Les taches d'encres
Dites que je suis dingue
Vous êtes probablement nerveux
mais ce qui est génial avec mon test
- Il n'y a pas vraiment de réponse
- ok
Tout ce que je vous demande
C'est de regarder cette image
Et dites-moi la première chose
qui vous traverse l'esprit
- Pas vraiment de réponse
- Pas vraiment de réponse
C'est Atlantis, le continent perdu.
Et le chien que je n'ai jamais eu
étant enfant
Oui je pense qu'il devrait accepter ton offre papa
Mais tu connais Harri
- Il veut faire les choses par lui-même
- Du nouveau
Je dois y aller
Je t'appelle plus tard
Mon père s'établit subitement en ville
- Oh non, une policière
- Un officier de la patrouille portuaire
Elle est morte lors d'un sauvetage
Kate Wilson. Elle a répondu
à un SOS à 15h07
Un étudiant a perdu le contrôle d'un bateau
Le Green Hornet
La routine
- Sauf concernant la rafale blanche
- La rafale blanche ?
Une tempête qui arrive sans prévenir
Et bang, tu es en plein milieu
Elle est tombée par dessus bord
- Et son partenaire ?
- Trop de vagues, il n'a rien pu faire
Un miracle qu'il soit toujours en vie
Ah, c'est pour moi
Le devoir m'appelle
Elle est à toi, Tru. À plus
À plus tard
A perdu conscience à cause de l'hypothermie
De l'eau dans les poumons évidemment
- Tu n'as plus besoin de moi maintenant
- Ouais, un jour peut-être
Non je suis sérieux. C'est bien de savoir
que si quelque chose m'arrive
- Tu pourras tout gérer toute seule
- C'est à propos de Jack ?
Ça ne concerne pas Jack
Il s'agit de Carrie
- Carrie ?
- Dr Allen, la remplaçante de Tom Jordan
Mes tests ne se sont pas bien passés
et elle demande une étude approfondie
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
- Peut-être rien du tout
- Ou ?
Ou ça veut dire que je suis cinglé
cliniquement parlant
Et si les tests le prouvent
Je ne serai plus là pour t'aider
Non, ce n'est pas possible
C'est très sérieux
D'abord je me fais humilier à l'école
Puis Jack réapparaît
Et maintenant ça
C'est quoi la suite ?
Sauve-moi
C'est reparti
- Davis, c'est moi
- Pourquoi tu m'appelles maintenant ?
- Tu as cours dans 3 heures
- Je sais, c'est l'une de ces journées
- Ok, qui est la chanceuse victime ?
- Kate Wilson, de la patrouille du port
Elle est morte dans une tempête blanche
On n'entend pas ça tous les jours
Tu as besoin d'une adresse ?
Non je l'ai déjà
J'ai fait mes recherches Davis
- Elle doit arriver dans un instant
- En quoi je peux t'aider ?
Tu peux m'écouter attentivement
parce que tu as manqué une grosse journée hier
Jack est revenu, mon père emménage en ville
Et tu as raté ton test psychologique
- Quoi, ce n'est pas le genre de Tom Jordan
- Non, mais celui de sa remplaçante, le Dr Carrie Allen
Quoi, une femme ?
Je l'ai trouvée attirante ?
Parce que ça pourrait tout expliquer
Je dois y aller Davis
Question stupide. Bien sûr
que je l'ai trouvée attirante
- Officier Wilson ?
- Oui
Bonjour, je suis Tru Davies
J'aimerais rejoindre la patrouille du port
- Et on m'a dit de m'adresser à vous
- Et qui vous a dit ça ?
Tout le monde, en fait
Vous avez beaucoup de fans
Ça fait plaisir
J'aimerais beaucoup discuter avec vous
et parler de l'examen peut-être
- Kate, on doit y aller
- Je suis en retard pour ma patrouille
Mais je fais une pause déjeuner à 13h
On pourra prendre un café et je vous dirai tout
Super, merci
Je vous retrouve à 13h
- Allô
- Salut Harry c'est moi
- C'est bizarre, j'allais justement t'appeler
- Je sais, c'est pourquoi je t'ai appelé la première
Ok, j'ai compris, une de tes journées
Ok, qu'est-ce que je dois savoir ?
Essaye d'être surpris
quand papa te proposera un job
Un job, vraiment ?
Est-ce que je l'ai accepté ?
Non, tu as refusé
Il l'a plutôt mal pris
C'est vrai Tru
parce qu'ils m'adorent dans mon boulot
Peut-être pas pour longtemps
- Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
- Ton fourgon a été volé pendant que tu déjeunais
Je n'ai pas pu t'avertir à temps
Mon conseil est de le garer ailleurs
Ok, je vais le déplacer
- Mlle Davies, merci de nous rejoindre
- Oui je suis désolée
Mlle Davies
Ce n'est pas parce que votre ami coroner
a utilisé ses relations pour vous faire entrer ici
que vous aurez un traitement de faveur
par rapport aux véritables élèves
Véritables élèves ?
Je suis une véritable élève
Dites-moi quelle artère se termine
à l'artère naso-palatine ?
Ça doit être l'artère maxillaire
Bien entendu ces artères
passent d'abord derrière l'os sphénoïde
J'ai bon ?
Oui, c'est juste
C'est entièrement juste
Il n'y a rien à faire ici
On rentre ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
- Attends quelques secondes
Vas-y
- Allez
- J'y vais
Allez
Allez Kate
Vous m'avez sauvé la vie
Je ne sais pas ce qu'il s'est passé.
Tout allait bien, et puis...
Tout va bien maintenant.
C'est fini
- Vous avez eu de la chance.
- Je n'en doute pas
Merci
...quand on croit maîtriser la situation
Au moins on ne s'ennuie pas avec moi
Faites-voir
Ça a dû arriver quand vous avez chaviré.
Asseyez-vous
Heureusement que vous étiez là
Je me souviens juste
d'être monté dans le kayak
Vous naviguez rarement,
je me trompe ?
Ca se voit tant que ça ?
En fait, ma soeur vient faire escale ici ce soir
Et quand elle arrive au port,
on fait toujours la course
Je voulais m'entraîner un peu
avant qu'elle n'arrive
Je crois que l'âge commence
à se faire sentir sur mes performances
Je ne me suis pas présenté
- Je suis Jack Harper
- Kate Wilson
Vous devriez laisser gagner
votre soeur la prochaine fois
Grâce à vous, il y aura une prochaine fois
Officier Wilson !
Oui, Mr Harper ?
Je voulais vous dire.
Ça peut paraître étrange,
mais vous n'êtes pas la première
à m'avoir sauvé la vie
Je ne vous ai pas sauvé la vie
C'était un chirurgien en Californie.
Il m'a retiré une balle du cou
et suturé quelques artères pour me sauver.
Désolée
Le temps que je sorte du coma,
il a été transféré dans un autre hôpital.
Et je n'ai jamais pu le remercier,
comme je l'aurais souhaité.
Alors je me suis juré
que si cela se reproduisait
Je ne manquerais pas d'exprimer ma gratitude.
Votre kayak a chaviré,
vous auriez pu vous en sortir seul.
Laissez-moi vous inviter à déjeuner.
Un déjeuner ?
Laissez-moi finir de ranger mes affaires.
J'arrive dans un instant.
J'attendrai le temps qu'il faudra.
Kate
Salut, Tru
- Vous prenez ce café avec moi ?
- Mince, je suis désolée
Je viens d'accepter un déjeuner
avec Mr Harper
- L'officier Wilson vient de me sauver la vie.
- Quel dommage.
Tru voudrait s'intéresser au métier de garde-côte
- Vous voulez devenir garde-côte ?
- Non
J'attends de voir ce que fait la concurrence
Je vois.
Vous n'aimez pas trop la compétition.
Sans plus.
Pas de quoi en faire un fromage.
Tru, si on remettait ça à une autre fois ?
La semaine prochaine ?
- Non, on ne peut pas
- On ne peut pas ?
Je ne veux pas abuser,
mais je passe l'exam la semaine prochaine.
- On discutera, mais pas cette fois-ci
- Kate, c'est plus compliqué...
Si cette fille vous dérange,
je peux appeler...
Non, merci. Ça ira.
Je ne sais pas quel est votre problème,
mais je vous suggère de trouver
quelqu'un d'autre pour vous aider
Je vais me changer,
à tout de suite.
Faire le coup de la fille passionnée.
Un classique
- Dommage que ça n'ait pas marché
- Dommage que tu ne te sois pas noyé
Tout ça me manque, tu sais
Tu es si drôle quand tu échoues.
Tu n'as rien gagné, je te signale
En effet, mais dans mon boulot
je ne modifie pas le cours des choses.
Je dois juste t'empêcher de le faire.
Et pour l'instant,
Kate est sur le bon chemin
Tu es fier de toi ?
Oui, plutôt
C'était sympa de discuter,
mais j'ai un déjeuner
Et ne t'inquiète pas
pour le dernier repas de Kate.
Il sera mémorable.
Il ne faut pas mourir l'estomac vide.
Il n'y a aucune raison
pour que tu perdes cette fois.
Il nous reste 2 heures
Kate est morte après
avoir répondu à un S.O.S hier à 15h07
Pour l'instant je n'ai rien pu faire.
- Que va faire Jack ?
- Probablement la séduire,
Il l'a invitée à déjeuner.
Il est vraiment vicieux
C'est déjà dur de prévenir les gens,
si en plus il faut s'occuper de Jack.
Si tu ne peux pas empêcher Kate d'intervenir,
il faut essayer d'empêcher qu'il y ait un S.O.S
Exact. Il n'y aura pas de S.O.S
si tout est sous contrôle
Un étudiant a perdu le contrôle d'un bateau,
<i>le Green Hornet</i>
Merci Davis.
J'ai encore besoin d'un service
Je t'écoute.
- Essaye de bloquer le bateau de Kate au port
- Bloquer un bateau de police ?
On doit assurer nos arrières à cause de Jack
Comment veux-tu
que je bloque un bateau de police ?
Tu va trouver, je le sais.
Et dire qu'elle va croire
que je suis un malade mental
Belle machine
Coque en fibre de verre
et motorisation Evenrud
C'est à mon père
Pour se consoler de ne pas
avoir eu le fils qu'il voulait
Je peux vous aider ?
C'est moi qui voudrais vous aider.
Je suis bénévole chez les garde-côtes
Et nous avons eu une alerte de tempête
pour cet après-midi.
Tous les bateaux de loisirs
sont consignés à quai
Vous plaisantez ?
J'aimerais.
Mais on m'a donné le mauvais rôle aujourd'hui
Non, pas à ce sujet...
J'ai cru qu'il était débile
Comment ça ?
Vous êtes Tru, non ?
Oui
Un gars est venu ce matin
me dire que vous pourriez passer
Il m'a demandé de vous donner ça
Un gars ?
Il a dit que vous voudriez
m'empêcher de naviguer.
<i>Je suis déjà passé par là. Jack</i>
Il m'a parlé d'une tempête
Je l'ai pris pour un dingue
Il faut me croire.
Vous courez un danger
Avec tous ces dingues sur le port.
La baie me semble bien plus sûre
Harrison, j'écoute
Volé ? Quoi ?
C'est pas possible !
Comment bloquer un bateau de police.
Allô, ici Edmil Mac Nulty
de la Marine Fédérale
Durant ma tournée sur le port ce matin,
j'ai remarqué qu'un de vos bateaux...
Je peux vous aider ?
Oui, je suis le Docteur Allen
La remplaçante de Tom Jordan
Mon dieu,
mon évaluation psychiatrique
Pouvez-vous patienter un instant ?
Je vous attendais depuis 30 minutes,
alors je suis descendue voir ce qu'il se passait
Et maintenant je sais
Vous faites des blagues téléphoniques
- Ce n'est pas ce que vous croyez
- Vraiment ?
Expliquez-moi alors, Edmil.
Vous allez rire...
Ou peut-être pas
La bonne nouvelle, docteur,
c'est que cette évaluation
n'a plus lieu d'être
Car j'ai déjà de quoi tirer un bilan.
Oui, je suis là
- Merci pour le repas
- Merci encore de m'avoir sauvé la vie
Je vais peut-être un peu vite,
mais je suis libre ce soir
Et il y a un festival en ville
qui serait très amusant à faire.
Oups, vous avez déjà une copine
qui n'apprécierait pas ça ?
C'est vrai, j'ai une copine
C'est ma soeur, elle arrive ce soir.
On a prévu pas mal de choses
Je me doute
En plus ça ne me regarde pas
Mais je suis disponible demain
Très bien
Moi aussi
Kate !
On y va !

Ça serait dommage
- Alors à demain
- À demain
Salut Kate
- Tru, on n'est pas là pour s'amuser
- Écoutez-moi
Vous êtes en danger si vous partez
Ça vous dérange peut-être mais,
mon métier c'est de sauver des gens
- Comme Jack Harper ?
- Exactement
- Les apparences sont trompeuses
- Vous pensez que je ne l'ai pas sauvé ?
Je dis juste que tout est possible
La météo change très vite
et vous le savez bien
- Et ?
- Une tempête peut se déclencher
- Une rafale blanche
- Une rafale blanche ?
Vous regardez trop de films
La météo est calme,
et nous n'avons eu aucun appel ce matin.
Parti à 15h07
<i>S.O.S, ici le Green Hornet</i>
<i>Nous sommes juste à côté de la plate-forme</i>
Ici garde-côte. Bien reçu
Nous arrivons.
Kate, attendez !
- Tout ira bien.
- Non, laissez-moi vous accompagner
C'est une blague ?
Allez on y va !
Je sais ce que c'est de vouloir sauver des gens,
mais on ne peut pas sauver tout le monde
Peut-être vous, mais pas moi
Ici la patrouille portuaire, donnez votre position
<i>Juste après la première plate-forme,
Faites vite...</i>
<i>Green Hornet, répondez !</i>
Mon dieu
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Elle avait raison
On ne peut pas y aller
On n'en sortirait pas vivants
Il le faut,
ils nous attendent
- Il le faut
- <i>Ici la garde-côtière.</i>
<i>Où en êtes-vous ?
Le temps presse</i>
Nous ne pouvons pas intervenir.
Il nous faut du renfort
<i>C'est en route,
la Marine Fédérale nous file un coup de main</i>
<i>Je ne savais même pas
qu'on avait une Marine Fédérale</i>
On se tire
Vous allez bien
La garde-côte à pris le relais
Ils ont été avertis
Bien joué, Davis
Je n'ai pas vraiment compris
ce que vous faisiez
Mais je devine que
vous n'avez plus de raison de me traquer
En effet
Qui a dit que je ne pouvais pas
sauver tout le monde ?
Bien joué avec la garde-côte
- Je pensais que ce n'était pas leur secteur
- J'ai été très convaincant
- Quelle heure est-il ?
- 16h15
- Quoi ?
- Tu as sauvé Kate, tout va bien
Les règles ont changé.
Jack est de retour
Rien n'est acquis
tant que je ne m'en suis pas assurée.
Il doit être ici
Il a sauvé une petite fille hier
à 16h16 précises
S'il veut vraiment préserver
le cours des choses, il doit la sauver
C'est vrai,
j'oubliais le bon samaritain qu'il est
Espérons qu'il soit
aussi efficace qu'il le prétend
Elle est là.
Où est ton skate ?
Un mec me l'a acheté 50$
Désolé de vous embêter encore
Je n'ai pas pu attendre
- C'est le déluge dehors
- Vous ne deviez pas sortir ce soir ?
Si, mais ma soeur a appelé
Elle a du retard donc je suis disponible
Moi aussi
J'ai demandé à un gars cet après-midi
et il a dit non
Quel taré ferait ça ?
Je dois terminer dans 10 minutes
Si vous pouvez patienter jusque là
- Pas de problème
- Ok
- SOS, SOS, nous avons un problème
- Excusez-moi
Ici la patrouille du port, indiquez votre position
et la nature de votre problème
- Le bateau est dans la tempête
- Indiquez votre position
- Il est au nord de la baie
- Le bateau a été identifié ?
Non, attendez, il s'appelle <i>le Jezabel</i>
C'est le bateau de ma soeur. Je viens de lui
parler Elle disait que tout allait bien
Il y a une fille
elle est tombée par dessus bord
On arrive
- Kate
- C'est mon boulot Jack
- Patrouille du port
- Je me doutais que tu allais répondre
- Je me doutais que tu allais appeler
- Qu'as-tu dit pour qu'elle retourne là-bas ?
- Elle est en train de sauver ma soeur
- Ta soeur est morte
Kate Wilson était censée mourir cet après-midi
Jack, et je l'ai sauvée
Oui c'est effectivement le cas
Mais la journée n'est pas encore terminée
Et ma fenêtre d'opportunités
est toujours ouverte
Et chanceux comme je suis...
cette tempête ne fait qu'empirer
Kate aide des gens Jack
Elle sauve des vies
Les bonnes personnes doivent aussi mourir Tru
Tu sais cela autant que moi
Tu dis que tu n'es pas un meurtrier
Mais comment qualifies-tu ce que tu fais ?
Mon boulot
A plus tard, Tru
- Ce n'est pas le bon moment, Harry
- Tu ne croiras pas ce qu'il est arrivé
- Ils ont encore volé le fourgon ?
- Non ce n'est pas le problème
Mes patrons sont un peu louches
Ils ont volé leur propre fourgon
afin de toucher l'assurance
Et j'ai tout fait foirer
en me garant dans un parking sécurisé
Je croyais enfin travailler honnêtement
Mais ce n'était pas le cas
Désolée Harry, je t'appelle plus tard
Ne vous inquiétez pas, tout ira bien
Je sais ce que je fais
Je suis désolée
J'y ai pensé toute la journée
- Kate ?
- Oui
On dînera une autre fois
- Ouais ?
- Tout a fonctionné ?
J'ai presque cru que vous étiez sur ce bateau
Richard. Je suis impressionné
La prochaine fois
Fais-le toi-même
11, c'est la patrouille du port
11, c'est la patrouille du port, merde
Kate
Kate tenez bon
J'arrive
Je vous tiens
Tenez bon, je vous tiens
Allez Kate, tout va bien
- Tout va bien maintenant
- Merci
Docteur
Je montais m'excuser.
Je suis désolé de ce qu'il s'est passé...
Ah bon ?
Je descendais justement vous rassurer
- J'ai parcouru votre dossier cet après-midi.
- Oulala, mon dossier
Et vous savez ce que j'y ai trouvé ?
Des commentaires élogieux allant
du maire au commandant de la police locale.
Dans mon dossier ?
Donc, si vous avez des lubies bizarres,
faites comme bon vous semble
Il faut être un peu fou pour travailler ici
L'évaluation peut bien attendre
Oui
Et je ne crois pas
que nous ayons été présentés.
Enchantée.
Je suis le docteur Carrie Allen
Moi c'est Davis.
Ravi de vous rencontrer
Je suis si content que tu aies changé d'avis
- Ça va être super de travailler ensemble
- Oui
Ça sera super de travailler honnêtement
Écoute
C'est peut-être l'occasion
de rattraper le temps perdu
Pour mes erreurs
On a beaucoup à apprendre
l'un de l'autre
- Oui
- De nos expériences passées
Quoi ?
Ça en étonnerait beaucoup
de nous savoir si semblables finalement
Un autre ?
Non, j'y vais
Je dois être frais et dispo
pour mon nouveau patron
On se voit demain
- Tu as été trop tendre aujourd'hui
- Merci, coach
Ne le prends pas mal.
Je t'avais dit qu'elle est douée
Y'en a au moins un
qui a gagné aujourd'hui
- Harrison
- Il signera demain
- Dans les temps ?
- Oui
Il vient de me rendre fier.
Il faut en garder un peu pour plus tard
C'est un bon garçon.
Un bon atout
Mais il aime sa soeur
et ce lien est fort
Autant que celui d'un père pour son fils
Repose-toi, Jack
Tu en a bien besoin
J'avais entendu quelqu'un rentrer
Je l'ai eu, Davis
J'ai battu Jack
Kate est sauvée,
le destin à repris son cours
mais je ne me sens pas soulagée
Parce que tu n'as pas sauvé Luc
Ça marche comme ça ?
Des étrangers sauvés
contre des proches qui meurent
Ça va, c'est juste un relent...
d'humanité ?
Bref, il est tard,
je vais rentrer
- Bonne nuit, Davis
- Bonne nuit
Au fait
Qu'a dit Jack quand il a su qu'il perdait ?
J'en sais rien,
mais j'aimerais bien savoir
<i>J'ai gagné. Je l'ai sauvée.

Chaque cadavre raconte une histoire.
Occupez-vous en soigneusement,
et il vous délivrera ses secrets.
Je veux un groupe de 4
sur chaque cadavre.
Excuse-moi
Est-ce toi qui a scotché le Pr Sidel l'autre fois
en répondant à sa colle ?
- Je ne sais pas si je l'ai scotché
- C'est elle les gars
C'est toi qu'on veut
Il nous faut un 4ème
pour les TD de labo
- Et vous voulez que ce soit moi ?
- Absolument
Scier le prof comme ça,
c'était génial
Tu es apparemment brillante et ton statut
n'affectera pas notre notation
Tyler pense que tu es la femme qu'il nous faut
- Jensen
- Tru
Son duodénum est en sale état
Tu dois entendre ça tous les jours
C'est gentil. Pardon,
Je travaille de nuit
Je manque de sommeil
On doit vite finir en taule
quand on charcute 6 cadavres
- C'est quoi ce sac ?
- C'est un cadeau pour Lexy
Jensen s'est enfin sorti de ses bouquins
pour trouver une copine
Nous en sommes ravis
- Essence de roses
- Oui, Essence de roses
Mais que fais-tu ?
Je ne pouvais pas le mettre
Et s'il ne me plaît pas ?
Je ne veux pas que tu le sentes,
mais plutôt que tu me dises
si c'est un cadeau approprié ou pas.
Je ne sais pas, ça dépend.
Merci du conseil
Mr Lee, ce n'est pas comme cela
que l'on manipule une vésicule biliaire
Le parfum de Lexy
Désolé
C'est mieux que de sentir le formol
C'est quoi cette odeur ?
Quoi ?
Ça sent la rose...
- et le formol
- Et cet appareil c'est pour quoi ?
Rien, juste mon premier travail
pour le cabinet de papa
Ça va chauffer
Deux gars se sont battus
sur un parcours de golf
L'un d'eux veut attaquer l'autre
pour C et B
- C et B ?
- Coups et blessures
Il prétend être trop amoché
pour sortir de chez lui
Mais je sais qu'il est
fan de Hockey sur glace
Et il a des tickets
pour le match de ce soir
Et tu seras là pour immortaliser
sa soirée au match
Quand papa aura les photos,
il va m'adorer
Je suis contente.
Je sais ce que ça représente pour toi
C'est génial
Qu'on soit tous réconciliés
On est peut-être trop durs avec lui
Peut-être
- Salut, je peut m'asseoir ?
- Dr Allen, je vous en prie
Restez assis
Mince
- J'ai oublié le sucre
- Prenez le mien
Zut
Un problème ?
Ce n'est rien,
juste un fil de polyester
Vous avez eu le memo
sur l'alarme à incendie ?
Non
J'aimerais faire venir quelqu'un demain
Parfois elle se déclenche seule,
soit quand on est
aux toilettes, soit quand on a
les mains dans les viscères
- Bon, je vais rentrer
- Très bien
- Au revoir
- Au revoir
Merci
Je suis maudit
Je suis sûre que ce n'était pas si grave
Le destin a voulu que je sois capable
d'analyser 60 sortes de blessures par balle,
mais archi nul en conversation
Je croyais que tu n'aimais pas ça
- Je déteste ce genre de conversation
- C'est quoi qui te chagrine alors ?
Ça veut dire quoi ce <i>Ahh</i> ?
Juste un <i>Ahh</i>, rien de plus.
- Harry
- <i>C'est moi !</i>
- J'ai les photos
- Bravo
Oui, ça valait le coup
- Mais je me suis pris une droite
- Aïe
Vivement que je les montre à papa
C'est super pour toi.
Je te rappelle plus tard
Au sujet du <i>Ahh</i>
Il faut que vous discutiez encore.
Trouve un sujet intéressant pour vous 2
Mes centres d'intérêt
sont bien loin du genre humain
Thomas Burrell, diplômé de médecine
- On dirait un mémo pour lui-même
- Une liste pour le supermarché ?
Il y a écrit <i>Varden</i>,
et une flèche qui pointe sur <i>DSM3</i>
Ça doit être un psychiatre
Comment tu le sais ?
- En fait...
-<i>S'il vous plaît</i>
Aidez-moi !
Mr Lee. Ce n'est pas comme cela
qu'on manipule une vésicule biliaire
Vraiment désolée
Mlle davies. Je vous prierai
de ne plus apporter vos parfums au labo
Je vais lui dire que c'était à moi
C'est pas grave.
Je dois filer
Je trouve que Tru est un peu versatile
Ep.2-02  Grace
- Bonjour
- Bonjour
- Il est là ?
- Oui, allez-y
La journée a recommencé
Rebelote.
Quelles sont les causes du décès ?
Pendant le marché de Forestreet,
il a reçu une balle dans le dos
J'espère que ton plan est bon
parce que ma fille a fait un parcours
sans faute depuis la mort de Luc.
Qui était en plus une de tes idées
Je te l'ai dit.
C'était pour lui donner une leçon
Elle ne l'a pas perçu comme ça
- Je ne laisserai pas Jack prendre le dessus.
- Tu t'en es bien sorti la dernière fois
Justement, c'est l'occasion
de passer la vitesse supérieure
De ne pas reproduire tes erreurs avec sa mère
- Mon mariage ?
- Non, la tuer était une erreur
On sait que ça ne fait
que déplacer le problème
Il faut rendre Tru inoffensive
Et j'ai une idée pour faire ça
Qui est la victime ?
Docteur Thomas Burrelll.
Ça doit être un psychiatre
Son cabinet est au
87, 3rd Street
J'y vais, je le croiserai peut-être
avant qu'il n'aille au marché
Désolé, mais je me suis permis
car votre secrétaire n'était pas là
Elle va revenir d'ici un instant
Je peux vous aider ?
Je l'espère
J'ai connu pas mal de revirements
dans ma vie ces derniers temps
et j'aurais souhaité en parler
Pouvez-vous préciser Mr..?
Paul Goodwen
Dr Burrelll
Pourquoi souhaitez-vous une thérapie ?
En fait,
j'ai un métier très stressant
et je voudrais mieux gérer ce stress
Que faites-vous exactement ?
Je suis en quelque sorte
un redresseur de torts
Certains trichent, manipulent
Quand cela arrive,
j'interviens pour remettre de l'ordre
Je vois les raisons du stress.
Vous devez subir pas mal d'agressivité
En effet, ils ne comprennent pas
que je n'ai rien contre eux
Je ne fais qu'appliquer la loi
C'est mon métier
- Mardi 17h ça vous va ?
- Très bien
Excusez-moi, je reviens
<i>Dr Burrell, je vous écoute</i>
Il faut que j'y aille.
À mardi, 17h, c'est ça ?
Oui
J'ai oublié de vous dire.
Mon ex est assez jalouse
Elle a embêté mon ancien psy
en le questionnant,
prétextant que j'étais dangereux
Elle veux s'immiscer dans ma vie privée
Ne vous inquiétez pas, le secret médical
est pour moi une règle d'or
- Je m'en doutais. Merci Docteur
- À mardi
Dr Burrell !
Dommage !
Le Docteur vient de partir
Comment étais-tu au courant
de tout ça avant moi ?
- <i>Apple</i> donne t-il ses secrets à <i>Microsoft</i> ?
- On n'est pas dans le business
Il s'agit de vies humaines
Notre business c'est la vie des gens
Bien essayé, mais je ne vais pas
perdre mon temps à discuter avec toi
- J'ai du pain sur la planche
- J'adore ton parfum
À plus
Dr Burrell
Oui ?
Je dois vous parler c'est urgent.
Voulez-vous me suivre ?
Où ça ?
Je vous dirai ça plus tard.
Accordez-moi un instant
Si vous voulez parlez,
prenez rendez-vous à mon cabinet
Il faut faire vite
Dr Burrell !
Police !
Mon dieu !
Elle a tué cet homme
Non
Mains en l'air
Vous êtes en état d'arrestation
Je suis innocente,
il a été touché dans le dos
Ils se sont engueulés,
elle a tiré quand il s'est retourné
- En effet
- Je lui parlais
- <i>Quel est votre nom madame ?
- Pam Olsen</i>
Tru, t'as un problème ?
C'est toi qui est supposée être responsable
Des menottes ?
Et voilà
C'est monnaie courante
Si ça t'arrive encore,
un couteau suisse suffira
J'ai pas ça sur moi
- Un truc pointu fera l'affaire.
- Ça t'es arrivé souvent ?
Finalement, je ne préfère pas savoir.
C'est quoi cette odeur ?
J'ai des problèmes.
Ça a mal tourné
- Il faut que je voies le corps.
- Je te le déconseille
Il y a la police ?
On peut dire ça
Dommage qu'on ne puisse
se voir aujourd'hui
Je suis arrivée trop tard,
Jack était déjà là.
Il m'a piégée.
Tout est allé si vite
J'assistais à son faux témoignage
quand j'ai pu m'enfuir
Il y a peut-être un moyen
de s'en sortir légalement
Tu veux que je me rende ?
Non
Je crois qu'il veut
que j'en parle à papa
C'est une bonne idée
Papa est avocat
d'affaires criminelles
Message reçu, je dois filer.
Je te rappelle.
Qui était-ce ?
C'est mon plombier.
Il devait venir réparer ma salle de bain
- aujourd'hui mais...
- Il n'est pas venu
- Papa, on a un truc à te dire
- Je sais, la police est venue
Viens t'asseoir
Il faut que tu me dises tout
- Tu peux attendre dehors STP ?
- Non, ça ira
Harrison, s'il te plaît
D'accord
Papa, on m'a piégée.
Je ne l'ai pas tué
La police enquête déjà sur toi.
Ils ont trouvé ton nom
sur son carnet de rendez-vous,
donc ils savent
que tu étais sa patiente
C'est faux
Ils ont aussi trouvé
ton dossier dans son cabinet
Je ne l'avais jamais vu auparavant
Plusieurs témoins affirment
avoir vu une querelle entre vous.
De quoi s'agissait-il ?
Je n'avais pas d'arme quand j'ai été arrêtée.
Ça ne me disculpe pas ?
La plupart des procès sont jugés
sans retrouver l'arme du crime
Vu le monde qu'il y avait sur place,
n'importe qui aurait pu la récupérer.
La police ne retiendra pas
cet argument car ils ont un témoin.
Et bien ce témoin est celui qui m'a piégée.
Il s'appelle Jack Harper.
Il cherche à me nuire.
Pourquoi ferait-il ça ?
Parce qu'on a déjà été confrontés.
C'est compliqué
Pourquoi as-tu fait sortir Harrison ?
Parce que je pensais
que tu avais des aveux à faire.
Qu'il valait mieux qu'il n'entende pas.
Je dois y aller
Tru
- Il croit que je suis coupable
- Mais non, il a dû mal interpréter
Il croit que je l'ai tué.
Il s'est fait son idée
bien avant de m'écouter
Quelle idiote !
Tout ça parce que c'est mon père.
Me voilà seule.
Tu n'es pas seule.
Je suis là
Je ne suis pas avocat
mais je connais un gars.
Il pourrait nous faire des faux papiers.
On irait au Mexique, en Thaïlande...
Je suis sérieux.
Je trouverai un boulot.
Tu pourrais ouvrir une morgue
Il y a des morts partout, pas vrai ?
Je ne pense pas que ça marcherait
mais merci quand même.
Allez, on y va.
- Bien joué.
- C'est une méthode humaniste
En prison pendant 50 ans
on ne peut pas sauver grand monde.
Juste quelques malfrats.
Savais-tu que la guillotine
à été inventée par un physicien ?
Par le Docteur Guillotin.
Il pensait lui aussi que c'était humaniste
C'était pas faux
- Tu peux parler ?
- Oui, ça va ?
D'habitude quand ça se passe mal,
la journée recommence. Là c'est déjà le cas
Le corps de Burrell
est ici depuis 30 minutes
Il y a un papier dans sa poche
Il y est écrit <i>Varden</i> et <i>DSM3</i>
Hier, cela t'as permis de savoir
qu'il était psychiatre
- Comment as-tu fait ?
- Probablement <i>DSM3</i>
C'est un manuel de diagnostics
des désordres psychiatriques.
C'est un genre de bible pour les psys.
C'est bizarre car la version 3
est périmée depuis 10 ans
Ça t'aide un peu ?
J'aimerais dire oui
- J'ai bien une idée.
- Je t'écoute
Si tu pouvais t'approcher de Burrell,
il pourrait te demander de l'aide à nouveau
ce qui ferait recommencer la journée.
C'est risqué mais peut-être
notre seule chance
Le problème c'est que la police
est toujours ici
Si je ne peux pas venir,
apporte-moi le corps
Je trouve ça un peu voyant
d'exhiber un cadavre en public
Il y a un endroit tranquille au campus
Le labo d'anatomie sera certainement vide.
On se retrouve là-bas.
Tu disais que l'idée de la Thaïlande
était fantasque.
Je peux me débrouiller seule
mais ils vont chercher ma voiture
- Tu me prêtes la tienne ?
- Je conduis.
Tu fais des câlins avec notre sujet de TD ?
Je revoyais le cours de ce matin,
et toi ?
- Pareil.
- Rejoins-nous
Tu ne préférerais pas faire une pause-café ?
- Tu veux boire un café avec moi ?
- Non, je suis étonnée
Tu es un des rares
que je ne pensais pas voir ici
Tu es brillant,
Entré ici plus jeune que la moyenne
Tu es un crack en chimie.
Les profs t'admirent.
Donc, tu peux faire une pause.
Ils t'ont dit tout ça sur moi
ce matin ?
Peut-être
L'avis des profs m'importe peu
- Tu connais la clinique Bedendorf ?
- C'est l'une des plus réputées
Mon père a été leur premier prodige
Certains disent qu'il est
le meilleur diagnosticien du pays.
- Pas facile de lui succéder.
- Je sais
S'il fallait le comparer à un être humain,
Martha Stewart serait la plus proche
Et moi j'essaye de suivre ses pas
Je comprends
Je n'arriverai jamais
à rattraper mon père
C'est pourquoi tu devrais sortir d'ici.
Tu ne peux pas impressionner ton père
J'ai des ennuis.
Pas le temps d'expliquer, mais crois-moi.
- Ne dis à personne que je suis ici.
- Que fais-tu ?
Tu as quelque chose à me dire ?
Je suis l'inspecteur Gomez
Pouvez-vous m'aider ?
Je recherche Tru Davies
Tru a cours dans cette classe, je crois ?
Oui, le matin.
Mais le cours est fini.
Donc vous la connaissez ?
Oui, elle est étudiante en médecine.
On est en classe d'anatomie ensemble.
Que pouvez-vous me dire d'autre ?
Je peux savoir ce que vous lui voulez ?
Elle est partie prenante
dans une affaire de meurtre
Comme témoin, alors
On voudrait juste lui parler
Quelle est cette odeur ?
C'est du parfum. J'ai cassé le flacon
que j'avais acheté pour ma copine
- Vous le trouvez comment ?
- Je le trouve un peu fort
- Excusez-moi
- Je peux vous aider ?
On peut vérifier ?
Attendez ici
Gomez
Il a fait ça ?
Non je veux l'interroger moi-même
Assurez-vous qu'il ne parte pas
Je dois y aller
Voici ma carte. Vous pouvez me joindre
quand vous le souhaitez
Vous avez quelque chose
à me dire ?
Si c'est le cas
je vous appellerai
Tru, que se passe-t'il ?
Merci
Merci vraiment
Tu as fait ce qu'il fallait
J'espère pouvoir tout t'expliquer un jour
ou alors je n'aurai pas à le faire
Tru, qu'est-ce que....
Merci officier
- Monsieur Davis
- C'est juste Davis en fait
On va avoir une petite discussion
Tru, tu dois retourner à la voiture
Les flics te cherchent
- Tu ne dois pas traîner dans les parages
- Où est Davis ?
Il n'a pas amené le corps
Il ne répond pas au téléphone
Je peux ?
Tru Davies
- Davis, qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
- C'est le détective Gomez, Mlle Davies
Devinez quoi ? Votre numéro était dans la mémoire
du téléphone de votre patron
Vous devriez penser à vous rendre.
Vous êtes une femme intelligente.
Vous ne faites qu'aggraver votre situation
- Et celle de vos amis
- Triangulation en cours
- Je n'ai pas tué cet homme
- Raccroche
C'était un homme bon.
Je devais le rencontrer aujourd'hui
car il m'avait parlé de vous
- Quoi ?
- Il voulait me parler d'un de ses patients
- Je n'étais pas une des ses patientes
- Tru, ils peuvent retracer l'appel
- Le champ de localisation est encore large
- Votre nom était dans son agenda
Et vous voulez me faire croire
que vous ne le connaissiez pas ?
Arrangez votre cas et rendez-vous.
Laissez votre avocat agir
Donne-moi ça. Prends celui-là
J'ai un téléphone dans la voiture
- Tu vas faire quoi avec le mien ?
- Je vais partir loin d'ici
Je vais passer un appel
et le jeter à l'arrière d'un 4X4
Disparaître, c'est le seul truc
que je sais bien faire
Et toi ?
Davis s'est fait attraper
Il n'y aura pas de retour en arrière
Tout ce que j'ai, c'est le contenu de la poche
du docteur :<i>Varden - DSM3</i>
Donc ?
Encore un petit service avant de partir ?
- Tu peux voler un livre à la bibliothèque ?
- Pas de problème
Restez ici et gardez un oeil sur notre ami
Au cas où Mlle Davies reviendrait, on ne sait jamais
Détective. Comme je vous l'ai dit, j'amenais
le corps du docteur à la crypte sécurisée
Là où on garde généralement
les cas plus importants
Je pensais que c'était une bonne idée car
le suspect était un employé de la morgue
Et oui, Mlle Davies est dans mon répertoire
Tout comme Funky Chicken et Charm Pizza
Et 3 autres employés de la morgue
Vous avez votre corps
J'ai une morgue à gérer
Excusez-moi
Merci beaucoup Harrison.
J'apprécie vraiment
J'ai trouvé ça en plus.
Tru, fais gaffe à tes fesses
C'est affiché partout
Merci
- Salut, je peux me joindre à vous ?
- Oui bien entendu
J'ai oublié de demander du sucre
Je voudrais discuter de la confidentialité
entre un thérapeute et son patient.
Étant employée par la ville,
j'ai des obligations,
mais je respecterai ce que vous m'avez dit
lors de votre évaluation
Je parlais au conditionnel.
Je suis en train d'écrire un livre
Vraiment ?
Scientifique et homme de lettres
à la fois.
Dites-moi que vous faites la lessive
et je vous kidnappe
Dans quelles circonstances l'éthique
vous permet-elle de discuter d'un patient ?
Les lois différent suivant les états
mais généralement, quand il y a une menace immédiate
Et la connaissance du passé criminel
serait suffisant ?
Seulement si cette connaissance contribue
à l'établissement d'une menace immédiate
Et les crimes du passé pourraient
aider à prédire le comportement futur
Vous êtes plein de surprises, Davis
De quoi parle le livre ?
- Allô
- C'est moi
Harrison m'a donné ton numéro. Il a parlé
de mettre ton téléphone à l'arrière d'un camion pizza
C'est bon de t'entendre Davis
Tout va bien ?
Oui je vais bien
Ne t'inquiète pas pour moi
As-tu trouvé d'autres infos
sur le docteur ?
Non, mais la nouvelle se répand
Je ne sais pas combien de temps il me reste
On ne sait pas ce que signifie <i>Varden</i>.
C'est peut-être le nom du tueur qui est un patient
Il doit avoir un dossier chez Burrell
J'y ai pensé mais entrer dans son bureau
par effraction, c'est risqué
La police pourrait être là-bas
Et ça ne servira a rien si Varden
n'apparaît pas sur les dossiers
Non pas nécessairement. J'ai parlé à Carrie
Tu dois chercher quelqu'un que le docteur
a considéré comme représentant un danger
Quelqu'un avec un passé violent
- Je n'ai pas toute la nuit
- Tu as raison
J'espère que le dossier
se trouvera en haut de la pile
Encore une chose, sauf si tu as un passé
de cambrioleuse dont je ne suis pas au courant
Je ne sais pas comment
tu vas pouvoir entrer dans son bureau
- La morgue a gardé ses effets personnels
- Je vois où tu veux en venir
A plus tard
Bien reçu
Coursier, bonjour
Vous avez un paquet à livrer ?
- Oui c'est très urgent
- Pas de problème, j'ai compris
- Tu assures aujourd'hui Harry
- Je suis bon dans l'urgence
Etre habitué à vivre au jour le jour, ça aide
Hier, tu étais à un match de hockey
Tu devais prendre des photos pour papa
- Je suis désolée
- C'est plus important
On traverse tout ça ensemble
Papa peut être déçu de nous deux
Ok, casse-toi d'ici
Si un flic se montre
Je t'appelle
Tru ?
Harrison
Varden
Donald Mitchell III
DSM3
Tendances violentes, Névrose
Implication possible dans la disparition
de sa petite amie Grace Varden
Mes infos se sont révélées justes
Détective, écoutez-moi. Je tiens le fichier
du tueur dans ma main en ce moment
Donald Stuart Mitchell
Il est le patient dont le Dr Burell
voulait vous parler
Il a dû découvrir ce qu'allait faire le docteur
S'il était au marché ce matin et
qu'il vous a vus parler
- Il voudra vous tuer aussi
- Taisez-vous, vous n'arrangez pas votre situation
Écoutez-moi, il voudra vous tuer aussi
S'il pense que vous savez qu'il a tué Grace Varden
Grace Varden ?
Merci. Je pense que ce dossier
est le mien
Relax, je ne vais pas te tuer
Non mais la police cherchera
un autre meurtrier
Et je suis le suspect idéal
J'irai en prison pour 2 meurtres
Dont le meurtre d'un flic
- Je leur dirai la vérité.
- Libre à toi de dire ce que tu veux
Car sans ces fichiers, je deviens
une histoire que tu as inventée
Dommage que les circonstances
ne soient pas différentes
Parce que tu es bien plus jolie
que Grace ne l'était
Il m'a explosé
Désolée Harry
Il n'y a plus rien à faire
Aide-moi
Ce n'est pas comme cela que l'on tient
une vésicule biliaire Mr Lee
- Merci
- Merci à toi
Merci à toi, vraiment
Je dois vraiment y aller
Pourquoi est-ce que tu prends ça ?
Je n'ai pas de cutter
Ça vient de moi ou Tru semble
un peu brusque ?
- 3ème journée
- Et deux vies à sauver
J'ai pu trouver que Grace Varden était
une étudiante qui a disparu il y a 3 ans
La police a suspecté un meurtre
mais n'a trouvé aucune preuve
et n'a jamais retrouvé le corps
Sa famille était anéantie mais n'ont aucune
idée de ce qui lui est arrivé
Je dois passer d'autres appels
Tu as compris ce que tu devais faire ?
- Bien reçu
- Ok
Salut soeurette, je vais faire ma première
mission pour papa
Pas le temps, la journée recommence
donc écoute bien
Hier, on m'a arrêtée pour meurtre
Tu as été frappé par Jack
- J'ai été quoi ?
- Sans importance
Aujourd'hui, je vais procéder différemment
mais ce sera également le cas de Jack
Il doit forcément anticiper sur nous
Voilà ce que tu dois faire
Dr Burrell. Vous êtes là pour
rencontrer le détective Gomez
Oui, elle n'a pas pu venir ?
Vous êtes de la police ?
Nous avons des raisons de croire que vous
êtes en danger avec l'un de vos patients
Donald Stuart Mitchell. Il est ici
sur le marché
Si vous suivez cet homme
Il vous mettra en sécurité
Merci
Ça, c'était pour hier, je pense
Harrison, pousse-toi de là
Ta soeur est en danger
Venant de toi, je ne pense pas
Tu as 2 cibles aujourd'hui. Tu veux
être sûr que la femme flic va mourir
Le tueur pense que c'est ta soeur le flic
Ne vois-tu pas
Ta soeur est la cible
- Ça te rendrait heureux ?
- Non car Tru n'est pas morte hier
et elle n'est pas supposée mourir aujourd'hui
Je me fous de ce que tu penses
mais tu es prêt à mettre en jeu la vie de ta soeur ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Je te sauve la vie
Officier, à l'aide
Police, personne ne bouge
Regarde ça.
Elle tombe dans mon piège
C'est le détective Gomez
C'est elle que tu veux
Lâchez ça
Je vous arrête
pour le meurtre de Grace Varden
Je pense que la famille de Grace Varden
va enfin pouvoir faire son deuil
Merci
Et bien, c'était...
C'était déroutant comme à chaque fois
Je dois y aller
J'ai un boulot à accomplir
Ces photos ne vont pas
se prendre toutes seules
Bon match de hockey
et méfie-toi d'un crochet de la droite
On ne s'ennuie pas au moins,
ça change à chaque fois
Oui mais c'est plus sympa au cinoche
avec Cary Grant ou Matt Damon
Là tu n'as qu'Harrison et moi
Davis, STP. Tu es le meilleur complice
dont pourrait rêver une fille
- Salut Davis
- Salut
J'étais dans l'ascenseur
quand j'ai réalisé que je n'avais pas de sucre
Tenez
Merci
- Salut, Tru
- Salut, Carrie
Vous avez vu des bons cadavres dernièrement ?
Oui, c'est le cas. Cet homme est arrivé
et tout son système....
Davis, elle plaisantait
Moi aussi, c'était une blague
- Je dois y retourner, au revoir
- A bientôt
Bon sucre
Bon sucre, mon dieu
Je suis totalement inapte
- Tu l'aimes bien
- Non ce n'est pas vrai
Peut-être un petit peu
- Comment était la 1ère journée ?
- Ça ne s'est pas bien passé
- 2ème journée ?
- Je ne sais pas, j'étais trop occupée
C'était probablement une catastrophe
J'ai des réactions bizarres.
Mon cerveau doit être un spécimen
De tous mes acolytes du sous-sol de la morgue,
tu es de loin le meilleur
Je ne sais pas où est passée
la courtoisie.
Ça fait une semaine...
Tu n'appelles pas, tu n'écris pas
Les gens ne remercient plus ceux
qui leur sauvent la vie ?
Je t'aurais remercié, si tu n'avais pas essayé
de tuer le détective Gomez en même temps
Et toute cette histoire
d'accusation de meurtre
Tu prends les choses de façon
trop personnelle Tru
Voici mon conseil : cette école
de médecine est un beau rêve
Mais tu ne peux pas faire les deux
Tant que tu fais ce que tu fais
tu n'appartiens pas à cet endroit
Mon conseil pour toi
Ne sois pas mauvais perdant
Ok, Tru est là pour dire que j'ai raison
sur le métatarse
- Tu as tort
- Elle a raison
Ça va être comme ça toute l'année ?
Vous deux contre moi ?

J'arrive
Oyeu versaire !
- Quoi ?
- Joyeux anniversaire
- Moins de bruit, s'il te plaît
- Merci de l'accueil
Je sais à quel point tu aimes ton anniversaire
mais j'ai d'autres choses à faire aujourd'hui
Ton cadeau, c'est en cours.
Et papa dit qu'il t'aime.
Non, ce n'est pas vrai. Il a encore oublié
mais merci de mentir
Et qu'est-ce que tu dois faire aujourd'hui ?
Tu n'es pas en congés avec papa en déplacement ?
Oui mais pas aujourd'hui.
Écoute ça
Je dois parler à un gars qui a vu quelque chose
sur quelqu'un, ce qui pourrait aider un autre gars
Ça a l'air plutôt important
Quel est ton programme
pour cet anniversaire ?
J'ai 23 ans, je pourrais utiliser ma carte de crédit
et m'offrir quelque chose de spécial
Peut-être des hot-dogs.
Ton frigo est désespérant, Tru
J'ai flashé sur un magnifique collier.
Ça me change un peu
de mes flashbacks morbides
Les bijoux. Vous souhaitez que les mecs
remarquent ce genre de chose
Mais ce n'est pas le cas
Tous les mecs y prêtent attention,
sauf toi
Tu sais quoi ?
Il faut que je m'habille, alors du balai.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je prends ça
- Salut Avery
- Salut Tru
- Salut Mr Gorensteen.
- Joyeux anniversaire
- J'adore ce collier. Il est nouveau ?
- Effectivement
Un cadeau de ma part
Contente que tu l'aies remarqué
C'est le cas, mais pas pour les mecs
Ils ne remarquent jamais ce genre de choses
En plus, tout le monde ne parle
que des fiançailles
- Qui s'est fiancé ?
- Jensen et Lexy
Lexy. Il en a parlé mais je ne pensais pas
que c'était aussi sérieux
Et bien, il a été très impulsif
Tyler est amoureux de l'amour
Son journal va être bien rempli ce soir
- Salut, félicitations
- Merci
- Elle est tombée sur le bon gars
- J'espère qu'elle le sait
C'est le cas, elle est excitée
Bien que ce ne soit pas le cas de tout le monde.
- Pour une fois qu'on est invités quelque part.
- Exactement, il ne se passe rien pour nous
Je ne me rappelle pas de la dernière fois
où j'ai vu un homme nu
- Hé, joli collier
- Merci
Davis ?
Davis ?
Oh mon dieu
Qui a réuni tout le monde ?
Harrison et moi avons tout préparé
C'était supposé se passer dans un meilleur endroit
Mais ça n'a pas marché
J'ai eu quelques problèmes
logistiques.
Mais j'ai pu tout installer ici
Viens voir
Pince-toi.
Ce n'est pas un rêve.
- C'est un bain bouillonnant
- Ouais
Ne m'en veux pas trop
C'est juste pour ce soir
- Davis, tu l'as laissé faire ?
- J'aime les bulles
Attends de voir à quel point
ta fête va être d'enfer, d'accord ?
On va mettre ça en route
Ça doit être un court-circuit.
Je vais appeler le gars de la maintenance
Attends, ne fais pas ça
C'est mieux comme ça
- Ambiance
- Tru
- Quel endroit
- Oui, c'est morbide et étrange
- Mais on est contents d'être là
- Merci
Suivez-moi
J'ai des personnes à vous présenter
Voici mon ami et patron, Davis
C'est Tyler et Avery, de ma classe d'anatomie
- Oui, on a parlé à Davis lors de l'invitation
- Oui, c'est ça. Content de vous connaître
- Et c'est mon petit frère Harrison
- Avery, Tyler
Salut. Harrison, c'est un bon prénom
J'aime ça
Merci
Vous avez vu le bain bouillonnant ?
Apparemment, mon frère m'a prise
pour une candidate de son Bachelor
J'ai apporté mon maillot de bain
On se change où ?
Venez avec moi
Davis, j'adore ma fête
Merci beaucoup
Oh ouais. Je t'ai aussi apporté un cadeau
Donc je vais le chercher
Super
- Tru, joyeux anniversaire
- Hey
- Je ne pense pas que tu connaisses Lexy
- Lexy, enfin. Tous mes voeux
Merci, c'est un tournant dans la vie.
J'ai hâte qu'on s'installe.
C'est la première morgue que je vois
Cet endroit est fascinant
Il n'y a pas de corps ce soir
mais vous pouvez visiter les lieux
Tu veux visiter les lieux ?
Je suis sûr que tu vas adorer
Ok, d'accord.
Tout mais pas les bocaux à viscères.
- Amusez-vous
- Merci Tru
Salut
- Ça semblait mieux présenté en vitrine
- Ils le mettent d'abord dans une boîte
- Peut-être que je devrais...
- Non, n'essaye même pas
C'est... des chapeaux
Oui, 2 chapeaux. Tu connais l'expression
"Porter deux chapeaux" non ?
Cela symbolise tes 2 activités
Un pour l'école de médecine
Un pour changer les destinées
Zut, Carrie est là
- Ça commence à bien faire cette histoire
- Je sais
- Salut Carrie
- Salut, joyeux anniversaire
Merci
- Vous pouvez nous excuser un instant
- Bien sûr
- Davis, demande-lui de rester
- Je ne vais pas...
Davis
- Carrie, aimeriez-vous rester ?
- J'aimerais beaucoup
- Comment ça se passe là-dedans ?
- Je profite de la vie
C'est pas dangereux ?
- Je ne peux pas faire ça
- Tu dois lui dire la vérité
- Ce n'est pas tes affaires
- Si, et si tu ne dis rien, je le ferai
Lâche-moi
Tout le monde se réunit
Joyeux anniversaire Tru
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Juste une coupure de courant.
Profitez-en avant que la lumière ne revienne.
Personne ne saura que c'est vous.
Tru
- Harrison, c'est toi ?
- Quoi ?
Tru, que se passe-t'il ?
Aide-moi
Pas ce que je souhaitais
Ep.2-03 In The Dark
Ne t'installe pas, Harry
Je me sauve
Quelque chose est arrivé
Je n'ai aucun indice
Je pensais que ton anniversaire, n'était
que fous rires et amour sur la Terre
- J'ai eu cet anniversaire hier
- Tu revis ton anniversaire ?
Je dois faire quelque chose ?
Ou ne pas le faire ?
- Est-ce que j'ai merdé ?
- Tu m'as organisé une fête, très sympa
Super le frère
Ce n'est pas parce que tu es mon frère
que tu es le frère
Et cette fois-ci, ne m'organise pas
une fête surprise à la morgue
Surtout avec un bain bouillonnant de location
Ce n'est pas mon style de cadeau.
Attends, j'ai organisé ta fête
à la morgue ?
Ce n'est pas important. Annule tout
et ne me fais plus de surprise
Ferme bien quand tu pars
- Hot-dogs. Étage du bas
- Merci
- Donc la voix ne te disait rien ?
- C'était un long chuchotement
C'était rauque. Je ne sais même pas
si c'est un homme ou une femme
Et tu n'as aucune idée de qui
aurait pu t'appeler à l'aide ?
Il n'y avait aucun corps à la morgue
Ce n'était pas toi, ni Harrison
- Vous étiez à côté de moi
- C'était un invité
Super, ça nous avance bien.
Je suis maudite. Va savoir combien d'amis
je vais devoir surveiller.
Ce n'était peut-être pas un de tes amis
mais quelqu'un qui est venu avec l'un d'eux
J'aime ta façon de m'aider.
Ok, écoute-moi un instant
Qui était présent ?
Tu veux dire ici
Toi, moi, Harrison, Carrie
- Des amis de l'école, Jensen
- Carrie était là ?
Oui, elle est passée et
tu l'as invitée à rester
- J'ai fait ça ? Elle est restée ?
- Tu as été remarquable
J'espère qu'elle va bien
Je ne m'en remettrais pas si j'étais
le responsable de ce qu'il lui arrive
Davis, je suis sûre qu'elle va bien
Essayons de reconstituer la scène.
Tyler était dans le bain bouillonnant
Et il y a eu un problème d'électricité
Donc c'était lui ou le gars de la maintenance
- Un bain bouillonnant ?
- Et il faisait très sombre
- N'importe qui a pu glisser et tomber
- Il y avait un bain bouillonnant ici ?
Et avant la coupure de courant
Avery et Lexy se disputaient violemment
Si tu ne lui dis pas, je le ferai
- Qui est Lexy ?
- La fiancée de Jensen
Je ne pense pas que tu connaisses Lexy
Cela semblait pouvoir dégénérer
Lexy a pu la frapper ou l'étrangler
Avery lui disait un truc du genre
Si tu ne lui dis pas, je le ferai
Je pense qu'elle est la victime
On dirait que Lexy a un secret
et qu'Avery l'a découvert
A mon tour de le découvrir
Harrison
Regarde-toi, mec. Tu as l'air en forme
Robuste, tel un homme qui a pris les choses en main
Donc le fait que je vive encore
ne te dérange pas ?
Tu veux dire vis à vis de l'univers.
Tous les jours, qui ont des conséquences
qui affecteront la race humaine.
Pourquoi ça me dérangerait ?
À plus, Jack
Connard
Sacrée veinarde
Sacrée Veinarde, Kentucky Rascall, Better off-sailing
Dans les 5,6 et 7ème courses
Et Rascall a une petite cote
donc mise gros.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je n'ai pas parié depuis des mois
Pourquoi pas ? Aucune règle n'empêche
de profiter d'un retour en arrière Harrison
Tru pourrait te faire confiance, si elle le voulait
Ça m'horripile de voir comment elle te traite
C'est trop sympa. Tu t'es rappelé
de ces noms rien que pour moi
Non, je m'en suis souvenu pour moi
Il faut bien que je vive
Mais si tu n'es pas intéressé
Oublie ce que je viens de te dire
C'est déjà fait
C'est déjà fait
- Salut Avery
- Tru, bon anniversaire
- Tu dois vraiment aimer ton anniversaire
- Je suis de bonne humeur c'est tout
- Donc, que se passe-t'il ?
- Tu ne vas pas y croire
- Jensen et Lexy se sont fiancés
- Vraiment ?
Je ne l'ai même pas rencontrée
De quoi elle a l'air ?
Elle est bien. Elle est folle de lui
donc ça doit être une bonne chose
C'est plutôt concis comme réponse.
C'est pas ton style d'habitude.
Je sais,
J'aime ce côté changeant en moi.
Je l'aime bien,
mais ça semble trop rapide
Et terriblement romantique
- Bonjour
- Jensen, félicitations
Vous savez quoi, je vous invite
pour un déjeuner de félicitations
Juste après le labo, au café Geneva
Nous tous, plus Lexy, on pourra la rencontrer
C'est très généreux de ta part. Je vais l'appeler
Elle sera probablement heureuse de venir
Oui, je viens
J'aime les desserts
Mes mains tremblent sur l'intestin grêle
On pourra parler bouffe plus tard ?
- Ils ont des tartes
- J'aime les tartes
Donc vous êtes sûr de l'avoir
déposé à l'aéroport ?
Oui, j'en suis certain
Il était en retard pour un vol
Il parlait à sa copine au téléphone
Elle était déjà à l'aéroport
Elle était furieuse.
Il lui a promis un voyage au Caraïbes
pour la calmer.
La Sacré veinarde.
Sacrée veinarde.
En tout cas, j'ai conduit comme un dingue
Je l'ai amené à l'heure
Il n'a pas voulu me donner de pourboire
Donc oui, je m'en souviens
Sacrée veinarde
- C'est tout ?
- Oui, c'est tout
- Je ne dois rien signer ?
- Non, non, c'était parfait
C'est bon, je suis dans le hall.
Il est encore trop tôt. Quel que soit le secret de Lexy,
Avery n'est pas encore au courant
Je les ai invités à déjeuner
Donc je vais pouvoir y travailler Et les regarder ensemble
J'entends des oiseaux
Où es-tu ?
Je suis à l'atrium en train de surveiller
Carrie qui prend un café
- C'est du harcèlement
- Non c'est de la surveillance
- Je veux m'assurer qu'elle n'est pas en danger
- On n'a aucune raison de croire en son implication
Il faut que j'y aille.
Je te rappelle
...Tru et Davis m'ont beaucoup parlé de vous
- Ils sont sympas
- En effet
Je voulais me présenter à vous
C'est gentil
Au revoir
Excuse-moi
Que faisais-tu ici ?
Je ne faisais que me présenter.
Je suis un peu de la maison.
Ne t'approche pas de Carrie.
Tu as bien compris ?
Que t'arrive t-il ?
Tu es amoureux ?
C'est adorable.
Vraiment.
Je protégerai tous ceux
que tu approcheras.
J'ai parlé à ma concierge ce matin
et pourtant je ne t'ai pas vu.
C'est plus profond que ça,
avoue-le.
À bientôt
Tru, les données ont changé
Écoute-moi.
Jack lui tourne autour,
il veut s'assurer
qu'elle meure à nouveau
Tu dois revenir à la morgue.
Je voudrais bien, mais je dois
découvrir le secret de Lexy
Tu dois t'en charger en attendant
Mon Dieu !
Carrie mourra si nous n'enquêtons pas
sur son passé.
- Trouver le mobile, le coupable...
-<i> C'est ce qu'il faut trouver</i>
J'ai une idée,
Harrison peut nous aider,
la filature c'est son job.
Il la suivra pendant que tu enquêtes
Un instant
Je voudrais miser 2 $ sur...
La vie est dure,
elles sont toutes folles de moi.
Il n'est pas joignable pour l'instant
Je n'y arriverai jamais
Bien sûr que tu le peux.
Parle-lui, trouve un moyen
d'engager la conversation
Avery était menacée par Lexy
lors de mon anniversaire.
J'ai déjà vu des meurtres pour moins que ça.
J'ai compris, mais viens
dès que tu as terminé de ton côté.
C'est une très bonne idée, Tru.
Très heureuse de te rencontrer
Moi de même
C'est vos fiançailles
qui m'ont amenée à faire ça.
- Jensen m'a dit que tu étais du coin.
- Oui
Je suis allée au lycée Adam High,
à deux pas d'ici.
Les filles du lycée doivent m'envier
d'être fiancée à un docteur.
- Ça fait un peu cliché.
- Je ne suis pas encore docteur.
Et tu travailles en ville ?
Je suis hôtesse d'accueil
dans une compagnie d'assurances.
Désormais je n'aurai plus besoin de travailler.
Champagne !
Pas pour moi,
je suis bénévole de garde à la clinique.
- Tu ne devrais peut-être pas boire.
- C'est vrai, pas pour moi
Merci
Pas de champagne ?
Tu es enceinte ?
Avery !
Pardon.
Je dis parfois des bêtises.
Sinon, dis-moi, tu es alcoolique ?
Je le dis ?
Vas-y, ils le sauront de toute façon.
Je suis enceinte
C'est vraiment...
- Félicitations.
- Merci.
Je voulais éviter que vous pensiez
que c'était la raison de nos plans de mariage.
Mais c'est-ce qui m'a fait dire oui.
C'est une fille fantastique...
Excusez-moi un instant
- Que fais-tu là ?
- C'est génial ils ont de la fondue au menu !
Ça ne t'est jamais arrivé
d'avoir envie d'une bonne fondue ?
Ne t'approche pas de mes amis
Je les ai vus, mais je ne les connais pas,
tu veux me les présenter ?
D'accord.
C'est en l'honneur de ton anniversaire.
J'ai failli oublier
Je voulais un truc en rapport avec la mort,
la résurrection mais je n'en ai pas trouvé.
Donc, je me suis contenté d'une carte
avec un gâteau en couverture.
<i>Bon anniversaire Tru.
Amitiés. Jack</i>
Tu peux t'en aller maintenant
Tu ne veux pas me présenter tes amis
et me faire profiter de la fondue.
Je te dérange ?
Si c'était le cas,
ça me vexerait presque
Salut Carrie,
comment ça va ?
Plutôt bien ?
Tu ne m'as pas beaucoup parlé de tes amis.
Carrie,
j'aime votre blouse.
<i>Mon Dieu !</i>
- Que se passe-t'il ?
- Rien
Je sais qu'on ne se connait que depuis peu
mais tu peux tout me dire.
On croit que ça n'arrive qu'aux autres,
d'épouser un homme violent et alcoolique.
Mais j'espérais...
que ça s'arrangerait avec le temps.
Je suis désolé
Ce qui m'étonne le plus,
c'est que malgré ça,
il m'a énormément manqué,
après sa mort.
De quoi est-il mort ?
Il s'est noyé,
dans la baignoire.
Il s'est assoupi en prenant son bain.
La police a enquêté,
j'ai été interrogée.
J'ai compris qu'ils me considéraient
impliquée dans cette mort
Impliquée ?
Oui
Il avait pris des cachets
qui n'ont pas été retrouvés.
Donc ils ont pensé
que je l'avais drogué,
avec des sédatifs que j'aurais volés
à l'hôpital où j'exerçais
Qu'est-il advenu ?
Ils n'ont pas retrouvé les cachets,
donc l'enquête s'est arrêtée là.
Mais sa soeur est persuadée
que je suis coupable.
J'ai tout quitté
et je suis venue m'installer ici.
Je me croyais en sécurité
jusqu'à aujourd'hui.
<i>Je sais que c'est toi</i>
C'est les deux mêmes.
J'en ai trouvé un dans le journal de ce matin.
Et j'ai trouvé l'autre juste avant
que tu n'entres dans le bureau.
Il était dans mon sac.
Je peux peut-être t'aider.
J'ai pas eu de tuyau.
En fait, j'en ai eu un.
Tu étais injoignable.
Écoute.
Lexy est enceinte et c'est ce qui pousse
Jensen à l'épouser, et je connais le secret.
C'est quoi ?
Lexy veut se faire une place au soleil
en épousant un docteur
Quel secret qui puisse tout faire capoter
Avery aurait-elle trouvé ?
Si Jensen n'est pas le père.
C'est un coup classique.
Elle serait prête à tout
pour garder son secret.
Je ne suis pas d'accord
Avery est de garde à la clinique cet après-midi,
et supposons
que Lexy ait un dossier là-bas
qu'Avery ait pu consulter.
Je vais essayer d'en savoir plus à la clinique,
et peut-être éviter le pire.
Quoi ?
Le mari de Carrie est décédé il y à 18 mois
et sa belle-soeur la croit coupable.
Je pense que c'est Carrie la victime
et Jack va s'assurer qu'elle meure.
Jack est venu nous voir,
donc Avery peut aussi être la victime.
- Il essaye de nous pertuber
- Tu penses que Carrie passe après Avery ?
Davis, s'il te plaît, pas de ça maintenant.
J'aurais bien aimé suivre les 2 pistes.
- Mais tu devras t'en charger.
- Pour que tu puisses rester avec tes amis.
Quoi ?
- Tu n'es pas objective sur ce coup là.
- Pourquoi, tu penses l'être toi ?
Je sais que tu tiens à elle
et je sais ce que c'est de perdre quelqu'un.
- Mais Davis...
- Tru, tu ne peux pas me faire ça !
Il ne s'agit pas du pauvre Davis
qui perd ses moyens face aux filles
Ce n'est pas pour rigoler,
c'est sérieux !
Et tu veux que je m'en charge seul ?
Et si elle meurt
parce que tu n'es pas là pour la protéger,
Je ne te le pardonnerai jamais.
- Depuis combien de temps viens-tu ici ?
- Des années.
C'est Jensen qui avait eu cette idée
quand on était en prépa.
Vous vous connaissez depuis longtemps.
On avait pas mal de cours ensemble.
- Vous sortiez ensemble ?
- Il y a très longtemps, oui.
- Et ?
- On est devenus amis.
Et c'est bien mieux comme ça.
- Tu le protèges.
- Et lui fait pareil avec moi.
Enfin, il essaye mais
je ne me laisse pas faire.
Et on s'arrêtera là
pour les confessions.
Compris.
- C'est quoi ?
- C'est la feuille de rendez-vous.
- Tu cherches quelqu'un ?
- J'essaye de m'intégrer rapidement.
Il y a pas mal de dossiers,
je vais commencer par ça.
Ça consiste en quoi ?
Des dossiers nous ont été retournés.
Je vais les classer dans les archives.
Je peux le faire
Tu veux aussi des quilles pour jongler ?
Reste zen, Tru
T'es une crack mais
tu ne peux pas sauver tout le monde.
C'est vrai que parfois j'aimerais le faire.
Alexander Keely, c'est le père de Lexy.
Tu ne devrais pas regarder
Il faut que j'y aille.
Attends, dis-moi ce qu'il y a ?
- Ne va pas la voir.
- Tu ne sais pas de quoi il s'agit.
- Je m'en doute.
- Lexy a menti à Jensen.
Je sais que tu veux le protéger
mais il doit y avoir une autre solution.
- Parlons-lui ensemble.
- Excusez-moi.
- Où est l'accueil s'il vous plaît ?
- Par ici.
Davis, j'ai peut-être le mobile du crime d'Avery.
Le secret c'est qu'elle n'est pas enceinte.
J'ai vu son dossier médical.
Elle a subi une hystérectomie il y a 2 ans.
Donc elle est stérile.
C'était juste pour obliger Jensen à l'épouser.
C'est pour ça qu'elle ne voulait pas
parler de sa grossesse.
Tu as encore une nouvelle théorie.
- Et la mienne au sujet de Carrie ?
- Davis, j'en suis consciente.
- J'essaye d'empêcher un meurtre.
- Je te laisse,
j'ai rendez-vous avec le vrai meurtrier.
Merci pour le thé,
il est bien chaud
Je ferai tout mon possible pour relancer
l'enquête sur le meurtre de mon frère
La morgue n'est pas responsable
de la réouverture d'enquêtes.
Nous nous attachons à reconstituer les faits.
Il s'agit ici de la noyade
de votre frère dans une baignoire.
C'est-ce qu'elle a raconté,
mais c'est faux.
Ça n'a aucun sens.
Il buvait, non ?
Pas au point de s'évanouir dans son bain.
Et les pilules n'ont pas été retrouvées.
Elle s'est débarrassée de la boîte,
car ça pouvait lui nuire.
- Il est facile d'égarer une boite de pilules.
- Non
Elle l'a tué
Je suis certain qu'elle sera punie.
Mais la vengeance ne résout rien.
Docteur.
Mon frère était quelqu'un de bien.
Il ne l'a jamais frappée et ne s'est
pas évanoui saoul dans sa baignoire.
Et ne me parlez pas de justice,
je sais très bien ce que cela donne.
Je sais très bien ce qu'elle a fait.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Tu n'es pas en sécurité ici.
Suis-moi
Entre
Ce n'est pas grand chose,
mais il y a la clim.
C'est utile car lorsque
celle de la morgue tombe en panne,
on est obligés de se mettre à poil
pour tenir le coup.
C'est magnifique
Je les ai ramenées du Mexique.
Mais on ne peut pas manger dedans.
L'argile cause des traumatismes cérébraux.
Veux-tu une glace ?
Non, merci
J'aime bien ton appart.
On s'y sent en sécurité.
Désolée de t'avoir embarrassé avec ces mots.
C'était sûrement une farce
des enfants du voisinage.
Je ne pense pas.
Tu es en lieu sûr en tout cas.
Je sais
Elle n'est pas revenue de la journée ?
Avery ?
Non, mais elle a appelé.
- Ah bon ? Tant mieux.
- Elle disait qu'elle devait voir son ami Jensen,
- et sa fiancée.
- Elle a dit où c'était ?
Au Standard Diner, vous connaissez ?
Surprise !
Tu croyais que j'avais tout annulé.
Mais le message que je t'ai laissé t'as guidée.
- Ce n'est pas le cas
- L'essentiel c'est que tu sois là.
- Tu as vu Avery ?
- Qui ? Qui est Avery ?
Pas grave, excuse-moi
Merci Harrison, j'adore la surprise
De rien, Tru
- Hey, joyeux anniversaire
- Merci. Tu as vu Avery ?
- Je ne crois pas qu'elle soit ici
- Où est Lexy ?
Dans l'autre pièce, il me semble
Je ne sais pas, pourquoi ?
Écoute. je ne sais pas si c'est quelque chose
que je doive te dire
- Tru ?
- J'étais à la clinique aujourd'hui
- Le dossier de Lexy était là
- Oui je l'ai transféré là
pour le bon déroulement de sa grossesse.
C'est quoi le problème ?
J'ai vu son dossier
et elle te cache quelque chose
- Attends, tu as vu son dossier ?
- Oui, j'étais là avec Avery et...
Je m'en fous. Je ne sais pas ce que c'est
Ce que tu as vu est personnel
Si elle veut m'en parler
Elle m'en parlera
Jensen, elle n'est pas enceinte
- Quoi ?
- Elle a subi une opération
Une hystérectomie.
Il fallait que tu le saches.
Merci d'avoir décidé de mon sort.
Elle ment, elle veut épouser un docteur
Les choses vont mal tourner
J'adore les apéricubes
Qu'est-ce qui se passe avec Jensen ?
Délicieux
- Je lui dirai la vérité
- Ça ne te concerne pas
Si c'est le cas, et si tu ne lui dis pas
Je le ferai
Lexy, tu dois lui dire que
tu n'es pas enceinte
Maintenant c'est une fête
Un combat de nanas, un combat de nanas !
J'adore ça
Je viendrai à ton anniversaire
tous les ans
Ce n'est pas bon
- Il va finir par l'apprendre
- Je sais
Je sais qu'il le saura
et alors tout sera terminé
C'est encore mieux qu'un combat de nanas
Mais tu vois, il est clair que Lexy est vivante
Et en bonne santé, malgré un utérus sans bébé.
Mais je ne pense pas que ce soit une meurtrière
Joyeux anniversaire
Harrison, c'est une super fête. Je savais
que tu ferais pour le mieux avec cet argent
Tu vois, réunir tout le monde ici
Jack m'a donné le nom de ces chevaux
et j'ai utilisé l'argent pour la fête
Mais je pense qu'il voulait cela
Il voulait que tu sois ici...
plutôt qu'à un autre endroit.
Mais tu serais capable de créer un bateau ?
Oui, avec de bons ingénieurs tout est possible.
J'ai rencontré ma femme
pendant une régate en fait
Son équipe a gagné
puis ils nous ont jetés à l'eau.
J'ai attrapé une infection
mais je m'en fichais.
- C'est très mignon
- C'était il y a longtemps
Ça ne me fait plus mal d'y penser
Ça sera la même chose pour toi
Tu y es pour beaucoup.
Il y a quelqu'un dans le couloir
Va te cacher dans ma chambre
Attend ! C'est... Tu avais raison
Ça n'a jamais été Avery
C'est Carrie et je suis vraiment désolée
de ne pas t'avoir écouté
- Ok, tu es là maintenant
- Elle est là ? En sécurité ?
Elle est dans l'autre pièce
Elle est en sécurité
D'autres mots ? Tu as trouvé d'autres suspects
en dehors de la belle-soeur ?
Rien d'autre. Et la soeur n'aurait rien fait elle-même
Elle aurait engagé quelqu'un
Et les mots ressemblent
vraiment à du chantage
Je ne suis pas sûr
Oh Davis, arrête
Tu sais qui a écrit ces mots
C'étaient des leurres.
Ce n'était ni Avery, ni Carrie
La mort va toujours avoir lieu
et ça va arriver à la morgue
Il n'y a personne à la morgue
Comment ça peut arriver à nouveau ?
Car quelqu'un est là-bas
Et il était là-bas la première fois
- Qui ?
- La lumière ne s'est pas éteinte à cause du bain
Elle s'est éteinte car le câblage est mauvais
Et le gars de la maintenance est là-bas en ce moment
Non
C'est frustrant, n'est-ce pas ?
Tu aurais pu le sauver
si tu étais arrivée à temps
Tu as ton brevet de secouriste,
mais c'est inutile, Tru
Il faut le laisser frire.
Tu dis faire ça pour le bien de tous
et tu prends ton pied à le regarder mourir.
Tu crois que ça m'amuse, Georges ?
Georges ne répond pas.
Tu savais qu'il s'appelait Georges ?
Je ne pense pas.
Mais c'est peut être mieux.
C'est moins douloureux
quand on ne connaît pas la victime.
Malheureusement non.
Je sais que tu l'as déjà vu
donc ne fais pas semblant d'être surprise.
Je t'ai dit la symbolique ?
2 chapeaux, 2 boulots.
J'ai de bonnes idées, parfois.
Oui, c'est une belle réflexion,
merci Davis
Mais j'ai l'impression que
j'aurai du mal à assumer les 2.
On s'est trompés tous les 2.
Avec Jack c'est plus difficile qu'avant.
Il est fûté.
Il est plus que fûté.
Il sait des choses.
Jack n'était pas à la fête mais il savait
pour la dispute entre Lexy et Avery
Et pareil avec Carrie.
Comment sait-il tout ça ?
J'attendais cette réaction.
Merci pour les chapeaux.
Je t'en prie
Allez, file à l'école,
montre-moi que tu peux porter les 2 chapeaux.
Salut Avery.
Cool ta fête hier soir.
Je t'ai cherchée pour te le dire,
après mon accrochage avec Lexy,
mais je ne t'ai pas trouvée.
- Comment va Jensen, tu l'as vu ?
- Oui
Je crois qu'il m'a pardonné.
Mais tu dois aller le voir aussi
vu que tu as lu le dossier de Lexy.
D'accord.
Tu as pourtant essayé de me dissuader
de regarder ces dossiers.
- Je ne savais pas que celui de Lexy y était.
- Je sais, mais tu l'as fait.
Comme quand tu manques les cours,
tu sais des détails sur ce qui s'est passé.
- Ce genre de choses.
- Bizarre, je n'avais pas remarqué.
Je ne te traque pas,
je voulais juste te dire que je l'avais remarqué.
Allez, va voir Jensen.
Je suis désolée.
Ce n'est pas grave
Je t'ai révélé le contenu
d'un dossier médical, ce n'est pas bien.
C'est Lexy qui est à blâmer.
Elle a menti, elle voulait épouser un docteur.
Elle a choisi un imbécile capable
d'épouser une fille parce qu'elle est enceinte.
J'aime bien ce genre d'imbéciles
Je suis content de l'avoir appris à temps.
C'est vrai, tu as l'air content.
Je dirais plutôt qu'elle te manque.
Non
Non, ce n'est pas ça.
C'est la fille que j'aurais aimé qu'elle soit,
qui me manque.
Charmante, rieuse...
Qui aurait apprécié mon geste.
Qui aurait des amis auxquels elle tient.
Tu trouveras cette personne.
On espère tous trouver quelqu'un qui...
La bonne personne.
Bien sûr.
Chacun a son âme soeur quelque part.
- Tu pars ?
- J'ai un moment pour parler si tu veux.
Merci pour hier soir.
C'était bien de te savoir à mes côtés.
Tu m'as rassurée quand ça n'allait pas.
C'est bien.
Au sujet du baiser,
on a peut-être été trop loin.
C'était bien aussi.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui
- Désolée, je dois y aller.
- D'accord.
Je pense que le destin
m'a amenée à te rencontrer.
J'aime bien cet endroit.
C'est 100 fois mieux que le truc miteux
où l'on s'est rencontrés la première fois.
On ne pouvait pas faire pire comme endroit.
L'alcool était frelaté et les cacahuètes pourries.
- Je t'ai pris une bière
- Merci
- La journée était longue hier ?
- À peu près 48h.
Mais c'était facile,
je n'avais qu'a brouiller les pistes.
- Et toi ?
- C'était pas mal.
J'en ai appris sur Davis.
- Il est marrant.
- Et ?
Il a gobé tout ce que je lui ai dit.

Tru
- Tu as un emploi du temps chargé aujourd'hui ?
- Après le cours de chimie,
j'ai quartier libre.
Ça tombe bien car j'ai 2 places
pour un concert de Jazz.
- Désolée, mais je déteste le Jazz.
- Moi aussi.
C'est Lexy qui voulait y aller
On pourrait en tirer 50$ au marché noir.
- J'ai jamais essayé ça.
- Alors à tout à l'heure.
Devine quoi ?
Tu ne devineras jamais,
à moins que... mais tu m'en aurais parlé.
- Mon cours débute dans 2 minutes.
- Très bien.
Un des clients de papa va se faire voler
du matos électronique ce soir.
Il a été averti et il a besoin de photos.
C'est moi qui ferai clic-clac.
- C'est risqué ?
- Seulement si je me fais remarquer.
Tu t'en tireras très bien.
Ça m'aurait plus touché si ça avait été
un jour que tu as déjà vécu.
Mais c'est gentil quand même.
J'ai attendu une semaine,
il est temps que l'un de nous
propose à l'autre de sortir ensemble.
Pourquoi pas un dîner ?
Il n'est que 9h30.
Je pensais plutôt à ce soir.
Oui, bien sûr.
D'accord.
Très bien,
c'est moi qui cuisine.
On le fait chez toi ?
Ma cuisinière ne fonctionne pas bien.
D'accord, il faut juste
que je parte plus tôt pour ranger un peu.
- Disons 19h.
- Très bien.
Pour être prêt à 19h
je devrais y aller maintenant.
J'aurai voulu savoir jouer de la guitare.
Je vous ai déjà croisé ici.
Plusieurs fois d'ailleurs.
Vous travaillez dans le secteur ?
- Oui, mais pas que dans ce quartier.
- Je ne vous traque pas.
C'est juste que,
même si ça peut paraître farfelu,
C'est mon jour de chance.
Et j'ai 2 billets
pour un concert de Jazz ce soir.
Si cela vous tente, je vous invite.
Je ne peux pas.
J'ai des horaires difficiles.
Peut-être une autre fois.
2 billets de concert de Jazz pour 20$
15$ ! 10$ seulement !
On a 2 billets à vendre.
- 20$ les 2.
- 5$ ! Je vous les donne
Vous les voulez ? non ?
Tout ça a été fait dans ma cuisine ?
Oui, tu ne cuisines pas chez toi ?
J'ai fait du gaspacho.
Mais rien de comparable à ça.
C'est délicieux.
C'est quoi ?
Du thon à la provençale.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Rien
Il fait un peu chaud,
Ça me donne très soif.
Le vin est bon.
Relax
Ce n'est que moi
Désolé
Je suis nerveux car c'est la première fois
qu'une femme cuisine pour moi.
Je comprends
Mais cette soirée pourrait être
pleine de premières fois.
Mon dieu, quel idiot.
Je croyais que c'était un chien.
En place les ringards
Billy
Qu'as-tu fait ? tu as jeté la pellicule ?
Que voulais-tu que je fasse ?
C'est un ami d'enfance.
Si je ne bossais pas pour papa,
je serais dans la même situation que lui.
- Et qu'as-tu dit à papa ?
-<i>J'ai menti</i>
J'ai dit que la lumière était trop faible,
que les photos étaient inexploitables.
Il était furax.
<i>Prendre des clichés de mon pote,
c'est pas mon truc.</i>
Tu t'en sors bien.
Rien n'est facile.
Si seulement c'était moins compliqué.
- Je me doute.
- <i>Bon, je te laisse</i>
- 6 sucres, c'est ça ?
- 7, mais ça ira.
Fantastique, merci d'avoir appelé Avery.
J'ai gagné 100$ sur un pari au lycée
pour une mise de 10$.
Du marché noir, des paris sur des combats.
Et oui, c'est ça la vie de gangster.
Je crois que je n'ai pas réussi à séduire Davis,
j'y suis peut-être allée un peu fort.
Que s'est-il passé ?
J'ai essayé de lui montrer
qu'il me faisait de l'effet.
- Et il n'a pas réagi ?
- Si, il a réagi
Il a sursauté de peur.
Certains mecs ont besoin
de plus de douceur.
Je te rappelle
Que dirais-tu si on sortait ensemble samedi ?
On revendrait des billets de concerts ?
Oui, c'est ce à quoi je pensais.
Elle a sauté,
j'appelle les secours.
Jack
Aidez-moi !
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
C'était différent. Cela ne ressemblait pas
à ce que je ressens d'habitude.
Personne ne t'a demandé de l'aide ?
Il n'y avait pas de cadavre aux alentours.
- Peut-être tu ne l'as pas entendu.
- Je les ai toujours entendu.
C'est peut-être toi qui est morte alors ?
Tu veux me filer la trouille ?
Que faisais-tu quand c'est arrivé ?
J'allais...
faire un truc personnel.
Décris-moi ton flash-back.
C'était bizarre,
des images sans liens apparents.
Il y avait un tableau
Une affiche de concert
Un étui à guitare avec de la monnaie dedans.
Il y avait un billet de 20$,
c'était sûrement un musicien de rue.
Il y en a toujours du côté d'Atlantic Plaza.
C'est la bas !
J'ai vu l'horloge de la tour Edison.
Il était 23h15,
l'horloge s'éloignait comme si je tombais.
- J'ai une idée, un peu farfelue mais,
- Quoi ?
Ça pourrait expliquer la mort de la victime.
Elle a chuté.
C'est vrai qu'il y a un observatoire.
Mais on n'est même pas sûr
qu'il y ait une victime.
Ou même si quelqu'un est mort.
Ça m'énerve.
Je commençais à peine à m'en sortir.
Les règles ont changé,
c'est un nouveau défi.
Ce retour en arrière
avait quelque chose de mauvais.
De froid
Comme si une partie de moi mourrait.
J'espère ne plus jamais ressentir ça.
Je n'ai jamais ressenti un truc comme ça.
Je ne sais pas quoi dire.
Je n'avais jamais entendu parler de ça auparavant.
- Elle m'a demandé de l'aide.
- Ne te laisse pas perturber par ça.
- Bien agir est toujours plus difficile.
- Mais si les règles ont changé,
- il doit y avoir une raison.
- Ton boulot est simple
Faire qu'aujourd'hui ressemble à hier.
Et que dois-je faire ?
Ton boulot
Attends
Non, ne me dis pas
que c'est un de ces jours.
Relax, il ne t'arrivera rien de grave
Tant mieux
Je voulais te dire en personne
que papa va te donner un boulot
où tu devras photographier un délit.
Ça c'est cool
Ton pote Billy fait partie des délinquants
et si tu fais le boulot, il ira en prison.
Pas cool.
Si je refuse le boulot,
y'en a un qui sera furax.
Papa !
Quelle bonne surprise
Ça va ? Tu as l'air un peu fatiguée
Tu sais, je travaille à la morgue.
Si la mort prend des vacances,
j'en prendrai aussi.
Carrie c'est un jour qui recommence.
Voici ton emploi du temps,
Pendant le dîner avec Davis, ne l'allume pas.
Il est très sensible. Vas-y mollo.
J'aurais voulu savoir jouer de la guitare.
- Moi aussi
- On peut encore le faire
Ça prendrait des années,
c'est difficile de trouver le temps.
J'ai un peu de temps devant moi aujourd'hui,
ça vous dirai un petit-déjeuner avec moi ?
- Ça me va
- Très bien
Vous devez penser que
je suis vieux-jeu à cause du petit-dèj.
Pas du tout.
Au contraire
Un billet de 20, vous avez de sacrés fans.
En fait c'était plutôt un mec
qui voulait impressionner une fille.
- Une fille ?
- Ils viennent juste de partir.
Vous devez avoir un bon boulot,
avec des horaires à la carte.
Je suis en quelque sorte
un garde du corps.
J'essaie d'empêcher que les choses tournent mal.
Et vous ?
J'étais réceptionniste à St Lukes
jusqu'à hier.
Vous avez démissionné ?
Quels sont vos projets ?
Qui vivra, verra.
Mais, en ce qui concerne aujourd'hui
- J'ai ma liste
- Une liste ?
J'ai comme l'impression
qu'on me cache quelque chose.
Fais-moi voir ça.
Non, c'est personnel.
C'est juste des choses à faire en ville.
Des choses qu'on ne fait jamais
comme visiter la tour eiffel quand on vit à Paris.
Qu'est-ce qui est en premier dans ta liste ?
- Tu ne serais pas en train de t'inviter ?
- Seulement si tu le veux,
- et qu'il ne s'agit ni d'opéra ni de clowns.
- C'est bon, alors tu peux venir.
J'espère que tu aimes les canards morts
C'était sa dernière peinture.
J'ai étudié l'histoire de l'art,
et mon premier coup de foudre
a été pour ce peintre.
J'ai passé une nuit entière
à lire la larme à l'oeil, un bouquin sur ce tableau.
Il voulait ce que chacun de nous souhaite.
Fonder une famille.
À 29 ans, il avait plus de 200 toiles à son actif.
Il n'en n'a vendu aucune de son vivant.
Il s'est suicidé avec du poison,
ignoré de tous.
Convaincu que personne
ne s'intéressait à lui ou à ses toiles,
Il pensait être plus apprécié mort que vivant.
Tu pleures ?
Ça va ?
Toujours aussi courtois.
Je suis Tru Davies.
Megan Roberts, enchantée.
Alors, quoi de neuf Jack ?
- Excuse-moi un instant.
- Oui
Je sais où tu trouves tes infos.
- Tu vois ce que voient les victimes.
- Perspicace.
6 mois pour comprendre.
Laisse-moi deviner,
Tu as vu la toile.
Et comme par hasard
elle est dans le premier musée du coin.
Elle t'a demandé de l'aider, pas vrai ?
C'était évident.
Ils ont du se mélanger les pinceaux là-haut.
Peut-être pas.
- Il y a peut-être une raison à ça.
- Alors tu va l'aider ?
- Aider ne signifie pas forcément sauver.
- Cela signifie quoi d'après toi ?
Je n'en suis pas encore certain,
mais je sais une chose.
Elle ne t'as rien demandé
donc tu n'as rien à faire ici.
À moins que tu veuilles la tuer.
Je ne voudrais pas empiéter
sur ton territoire.
- Le plus dur est devant elle.
- Que dis-tu ?
Elle va se suicider
Comme elle ne veut plus vivre,
tu n'es d'aucune utilité.
Tu avais raison Davis,
Megan Roberts est la victime.
- Elle s'est jetée de la tour Edison.
- Voyons voir. Megan Roberts
28 ans, diplômée d'université
en 1997.
Elle vit en ville
au 1025, Burch Lane
avec Wendy Roberts,
peut-être sa soeur ou sa mère.
Pourquoi quelqu'un qui se suicide
demande de l'aide ?
Elle l'a demandé à la mort en personne,
non à toi.
Une fois morte que pouvait-elle bien
lui demander d'autre ?
Il faut surtout savoir,
en quoi tu peux l'aider.
Je savais que tu traînerais ici.
Incroyable
Alors, quoi de neuf ?
Toujours pareil.
On t'appelle chaque vendredi soir
pour taper le carton mais tu ne viens jamais.
Je sais, j'étais débordé.
- C'est ça
- Non, sérieusement, j'ai un boulot.
- Je bosse pour mon père.
- C'est génial
- On pensait que tu nous snobais.
- Non
2 bières !
Alors, raconte-moi un peu.
- Et Larry ?
- Il est en prison.
- Tu déconnes.
- Il a pris 8 ans.
T'es venu juste boire un coup ?
C'est un peu compliqué.
Je connais ce regard, j'ai compris.
Quel regard ?
Celui qui veut dire <i>j'ai besoin de cash.</i>
- C'est pas ça.
- Reste zen
Laisse faire grand frère Billy.
Ce soir, il y a un coup à faire.
Un camion à décharger.
Non
J'ai mieux.
On va chez moi, on se fait livrer des pizzas
et on regarde le match.
- Comme avant, toi et moi.
- T'en fais pas, viens par ici
Assieds-toi.
Wendy ?
- Oui.
- Tru Davies
J'ai connu Megan à l'université.
- Elle vit ici, non ?
- Oui.
Depuis quand vous ne l'avez pas vue ?
On a échangé nos voeux
par courriers ces dernières années.
En fait je m'inquiétais un peu
car elle n'avez pas donné suite à mes appels.
Et lors de notre dernière conversation
elle semblait distante.
Tout va bien ?
Écoutez,
entrez un instant.
On devrait discuter un peu.
Tu as fini tard ?
- Comme d'habitude.
- Moi aussi.
J'ai pensé
qu'on pourrait dîner ici ensemble ce soir.
- À la morgue ?
- Bien sûr
Ça sera un peu comme un picnic
avec des draps blancs
à la place de la nappe à carreaux rouges.
Vas-y, je te rejoins.
Je dois parler à Megan.
Ne t'en mêle pas.
Elle est mourante.
C'est sa soeur qui me l'a appris.
Elle a une leucémie.
Tu vois, il n'y a rien à faire ce soir,
elle mourra de toute façon.
Tu m'as entendue ?
Oui
- Où est votre billet ?
- Combien il coûte ?
C'est complet depuis 15 jours.
2 billets pour un concert de Jazz.
Personne ?
Je les prends !
Ça alors !
J'ai essayé de t'appeler tout à l'heure.
- Combien pour les tickets ?
- Pour ça ? Rien.
- Tu les veux ?
- Viens avec moi.
Non, je déteste le Jazz.
Moi aussi,
mais c'est comme les endives au jambon.
En grandissant on les apprécie mieux.
Allez viens.
- Tout va bien ?
- Oui
- Tu détestes le Jazz ?
- Non
Est-ce que tu me caches quelque chose ?
Je te dis ça parce que je t'aime bien
et j'apprécie cette journée à 2.
- Alors continuons comme ça.
- J'aimerais bien,
mais j'ai le sentiment
qu'il n'y aura pas de prochaine fois.
Admettons.
Je souhaite te revoir ce week-end.
Que dirais-tu ?
- Je ne pourrais pas ce week-end.
- Où seras-tu ?
Il y à 6 mois,
j'ai appris que j'avais une leucémie.
On me donnait 1 an maximum.
Les premiers symptômes sont vites apparus.
Ma soeur a du quitter son job
pour s'occuper de moi à plein temps.
Cela ne peux qu'empirer.
Certains jours, comme aujourd'hui,
la douleur se calme.
Puis cela reprend.
La plupart des malades
passent leurs derniers mois à l'hôpital.
Sous assistance respiratoire
et perfusion constante.
Je ne mourrai pas comme ça
Cette liste.
Ce sont 10 choses à faire
avant de mourir.
Je n'en ai fait que 4.
Je ne pourrais pas toutes les faire.
Fais les autres à ma place.
Un jour on se reverra,
et tu me raconteras tout.
C'est ta liste,
tu devrais faire toutes ces choses.
Quand j'étais au plus mal ces derniers temps,
Je me suis promis que si je pouvais
encore vivre une belle journée,
j'en profiterais au maximum.
J'ai une assurance vie qui n'est valable
qu'en cas de mort accidentelle.
Elle est de 100 000 $
Ils iront à ma soeur.
- Et tu vas te suicider ?
- Pas tout à fait.
L'assurance ne paie pas en cas de suicide.
Il faut que cela ressemble à un accident.
J'aurais du m'en douter.
- C'est Tru. Une de tes ex ?
- C'est une longue histoire
Quelle coïncidence.
Jack, Megan. Voici Jensen.
- Salut, ça va ?
- Bien, merci.
Après le musée, on se rencontre ici.
On devrait passer la soirée ensemble.
- Je vais chercher à boire
- D'accord.
J'y vais aussi.
Reste avec Megan,
je reviens tout de suite.
- C'est quoi le truc entre eux ?
- Je n'en sais rien,
mais ça doit être une sacrée histoire.
Elle a une assurance vie de 100 000 $
La première fois, on a cru au suicide.
Ce soir, il faut qu'on croit à un accident.
Pour faire marcher l'assurance.
C'est pourquoi elle m'a demandé de l'aide.
Et tu vas le faire.
C'est son souhait.
Elle ne veut pas souffrir.
C'est sa vie, c'est à elle d'en décider.
Je vais lui parler,
que tu le veuilles ou non.
Après toi.
- Tu as une tête très dure.
- Merci, euh... pardon
- Ça va ?
- Oui, je crois
Tu ne devais pas chercher à boire ?
J'ai oublié.
Tu veux bien le faire ?
Je sais que c'est un peu bizarre
mais on s'amuse aussi, non ?
- Pas trop.
- Encore 5 minutes.
Je discute un peu avec Megan
et je te paye un resto.
- D'accord, je vais me rincer la bouche.
- Bonne idée.
Il faut y aller,
y'a une livraison qui nous attends.
Pour ce soir, laisse tomber.
- Tu délires ?
- Non, laisse tomber.
- On va se faire 300$ en 30 minutes.
- Je me doute.
À moins de se faire pincer.
Allez, tu m'as dit que
la moitié de nos potes sont en prison
Billy, t'as joué avec le feu depuis tout petit.
Tu ne t'en tireras pas toujours.
Une autre fois si tu veux mais pas ce soir.
Si je comprends bien,
tu es venu pour me dire ça.
Pour me dire d'arrêter les coups ?
Tu ressurgis du jour au lendemain,
- et tu viens prêcher la bonne parole.
- Je dis juste...
- que tu n'es pas forcé de le faire ce soir.
- Je fais quoi à la place ?
J'appelle mon père pour un job ?
Mais il y a un problème.
Mon père vis sous un abris bus.
La dernière fois, il m'a demandé une pièce
sans me reconnaître.
- On devrait se voir moins souvent.
- J'essaye juste de t'aider.
- Ne me touche pas !
- Désolé pour ton père
Mais écoute mon conseil.
La vie ne donne pas de 2ème chance.
Il n'y en a qu'une seule.
Fais-moi confiance, Billy.
Reste chez toi ce soir.
Je ferai comme je veux.
Alors, entre toi et Jack,
c'est l'amour ou la guerre ?
J'aimerais que cela soit si simple.
Vous avez l'air de bien vous entendre.
Vous vous connaissez ?
Juste aujourd'hui.
C'est fou ce qu'on peut faire en une journée.
Pour info, il n'y a rien entre Jack et moi.
- Donc il est libre.
- Je n'envisage pas de relation.
Parfois c'est plus amusant comme ça.
J'avais un ami très proche
qui est devenu mon petit ami l'année dernière.
Et il est mort.
J'en suis vraiment désolée.
J'étais si furieuse quand il est décédé.
J'avais du mal à respirer.
Peu à peu j'ai réalisé
la chance que j'avais,
d'avoir eu de bons moments avec lui.
Et ce que je pensais impossible arriva.
Quoi exactement ?
J'ai eu une journée formidable.
Alors que je n'y croyais plus.
Parfois, le destin nous réserve
aussi de bonnes choses.
On dirait que Jack t'as dit
que j'étais mourante.
J'ai une assurance vie
et je ne compte pas passer noël.
Je ne remets pas en question
ce que tu as prévu de faire.
Je me doute que ce que tu subis
est inimaginable.
Si il y avait un autre moyen
de toucher cet argent ?
100 000 $ ? À moins d'un braquage,
je ne vois pas comment.
Et si je pouvais le faire ?
Il n'y a pas que l'argent en question.
Je comprends
Mais tu as passé une belle journée.
Tu peux toujours reporter ta décision
à demain, à la semaine prochaine
ou au mois prochain.
Il n'y a aucune raison d'en finir ce soir.
Alors comment ça va ?
De mieux en mieux.
J'étais contente de vous voir,
mais je dois filer.
Maintenant ?
Oui
Pense à ce que je t'ai dit.
Où va-t'on ?
Voir le combat
On laisse tomber le jazz pour voir de la boxe ?
Excellent.
Tant mieux
Merde
50 et 100
Bonjour
Ce qui nous fait...
100 000 $ !
Pas mal
Ce sera sous forme de chèque.
Parfait, mettez le à l'ordre
de Megan et Wendy Roberts
Bien sûr
Tu veux être épatée ?
J'ai gagné 100 $
- C'est super
- Il faut que vous signez ici et ici.
Tu avais parié ?
Oui
Combien t'as gagné ?
Quelques dollars
Tu aurais pu les avoir en liquide.
C'est par rapport aux impôts.
Voilà
Merci
- Tu préfères les chèques ?
- Non, en espèces c'est mieux.
Elles sont fantastiques.
Harrison, tu as été parfait sur cette affaire.
Je suis fier de toi.
Ces gars vont être condamnés ?
Emprisonnés pour la plupart.
Beau boulot, fiston.
Merci
On en est où sur ta liste ?
Il nous reste du temps.
Je sais, mais pour l'instant
je dois voir ma soeur.
J'espère qu'elle ne dort pas.
Wendy ?
Tu ne vas pas le croire.
Ton amie Tru est passée,
et m'a laissé ça.
Elle m'a parlé d'une oeuvre de charité.
La fondation <i>revivez votre journée</i>.
C'est sérieux ?
On dirait bien
Tu te rends compte ?
On aura les meilleurs docteurs,
les meilleurs traitements.
- Et ce voyage en Grèce que tu voulais faire.
- Il était numéro 10 sur ma liste.
On y va !
- Je t'aime tant
- Moi aussi
Cette journée était...
Comment dire ?
C'était bizarre
Je sais, désolée.
Ma vie est parfois déconcertante.
J'avais remarqué
Mais ta présence a été bénéfique.
- Ça l'a rendu presque agréable.
- Presque agréable
Ça c'est du compliment.
Je me comprends.
Je peux aussi être très conventionnelle,
aller au ciné après un resto.
Conventionnelle,
c'est un peu abusé quand même.
Alors ?
Quelle journée
Ça, tu peux le dire.
- On a eu une discussion.
- Avec ta soeur ?
Avec Tru
Elle ma fait réfléchir sur pas mal de choses.
J'ai été égoïste, voire stupide.
Comment ça ?
Je n'ai pensé qu'au problème d'argent.
Maintenant que l'argent est là,
le temps semble plus important.
Je croyais que tu ne voulais pas
d'assistance médicale.
C'est vrai
Mais comme Tru l'a dit,
j'ai toujours le temps de me raviser.
Si il me restait quelques jours à vivre,
avec toi
je ne veux en manquer aucun.
Je voulais m'y rendre seule,
mais maintenant
si tu le souhaites
on pourrait y aller ensemble.
Quand j'étais petite,
mon père travaillait à la tour Edison.
Il m'emmenait au sommet
et me montrait l'horizon,
en me disant que
tous mes rêves se réalisent là-bas.
Tout ce que tu peux imaginer
t'attends là-bas
Il est décédé quand j'avais 10 ans,
mais j'y retourne souvent
pour regarder la ville
et rêver à la vie que je souhaiterais
J'ai suffisamment regardé
je l'ai souvent aperçu.
Viens avec moi ce soir.
Que va-t-on voir ?
L'aube d'un nouveau jour.
Je vais chercher mon manteau
- Allô ?
- Elle allait se suicider
Elle voulait juste que je l'aide à faire
passer ça pour un accident
Félicitations
Mission facile
- Elle a changé d'avis
- Ce n'est pas une option
Je ne vais pas la tuer
Ce n'est pas une option non plus
Tu connais les règles
Oui, un corps appelle Tru à l'aide
et je m'assure qu'il reste mort.
Mais je n'ai pas changé les règles cette fois
Donc pour moi, le client est roi.
Jack, quand le destin est modifié
Il y a des conséquences
Tu es prêt à accepter ces conséquences ?
Tu dois être fort et faire ton boulot
Allez, rendons cette nuit inoubliable
"Le quizz Seigneur des Anneaux"
Qui a guidé les héros
à travers les montagnes vers Minas Thirit
- Je le sais
- Non, on ne dirait pas
- Celebrembor...
- Je t'ai eu. C'est les Gondorians
- Tu as un gage
- D'accord
Sauvé par le gong
- Allô ?
- Davis ?
- Non, c'est Jean Paul II.
- J'ai besoin de ton aide. Tu as bu ?
Juste un petit peu
Je suis avec Carrie
Mais j'ai les idées claires
Je t'écoute.
J'ai réussi à convaincre Megan et Jack.
Mais je vais aller à la Tour Edison
pour m'assurer que tout est normal
Tu sais jusqu'à quelle heure est ouverte
la tour d'observation ?
La tour d'observation est ouverte
de 9h à minuit
Ok, je vais être un peu en retard au boulot
Je vais les surveiller de près
- Vas-y ma poule.
- Vas-y mollo sur la bouteille ok ?
D'accord, salut
- Je dois aller au petit coin
- D'accord
Tru se rend à la Tour Edison
Elle veut y être avant toi
Bien reçu, merci
- Mauvaise nouvelle ?
- Un rendez-vous annulé.
- Ils t'appellent toujours aussi tard ?
- Ils ne dorment jamais
- Je suis ravie que tu ais pris ta journée
- Moi aussi
Sinon, la mienne
se serait terminée tout autrement.
Je vais te dire un secret
Je déteste mon boulot
- Pourquoi ne pas démissionner ?
- Je ne m'en sens pas capable
Prend un peu de temps libre
et réfléchis-y
- Ça ne serait pas la fin du monde
- Je l'espère
Tu ne m'as pas vraiment expliqué
ce que tu faisais
J'aide des personnes, même si la plupart du temps
ils ne s'en rendent pas compte
Je m'assure que leur vie
suit son bon déroulement
- Comme un conseiller ?
- Oui en quelque sorte
Aider les gens
Ça ne semble pas si mauvais
Tu sais ce qu'on devrait faire ?
On devrait fermer nos yeux
Tourner, tendre le doigt, et quelque soit
la direction, nous y allons
Voiture, bateau, train, peu importe
On part à la première heure
Ça serait super
C'est bizarre. J'ai l'impression
d'avoir eu une deuxième chance
- Tu connais ce sentiment
- Oui
Hé Megan
Ta liste
Tu devrais la garder maintenant
- Megan je suis désolé
- Je m'en occupe
- Non attend
- C'est ma liste
Megan attend
Megan, Megan !
- Jack
- Je te tiens
Aide moi
Jack, aide moi
Jack, aide moi
Ne me lâche pas, STP
Je ne peux pas
Je ne peux pas
Je n'ai pas assez de force.
Jack, STP, aidez moi
- Je suis vraiment désolé
- Jack
Tiens là mec
Jack, tiens moi
J'aurai aimé que ce soit toi
Alors on est deux

Randall, droite
- 26
- Allez
Je t'ai eu.
Super, vous êtes fortes
Bonne réception Davies
- Merci, joli lancer.
- Arrêtez avec les compliments
Y'a rien de mal à se renforcer positivement
Je suis sûre que Joe Montana
savait remonter le moral de ses coéquipiers.
Ça devait pas être évident à comprendre
avec les casques et les protège-dents.
Ok, 48 rouge !
48 rouge !
- Tu vas bien ?
- C'est mon poignet qui me fait mal.
Laisse-moi voir ça
Ce n'est pas cassé. Tu as dû distendre
ton ligament radio-carpien.
T'es plutôt forte pour quelqu'un
qui vient d'entrer en médecine
Tu devrais t'arrêter
et mettre un peu de glace dessus
À 10 yards de la victoire ?
Pas question
- Allons-y
- Ok Rambo
Belle partie les enfants
On a rendez-vous au labo.
Personne ne part tant
qu'on n'a pas ressuscité les cadavres.
- Je vais être en retard au boulot
- Tu veux que je t'accompagne ?
- Ouais
- Super
Tu le jures ?
Tu n'avais jamais joué à ce jeu avant ?
- C'était mes débuts professionnels
- Tu es douée.
Et physique en plus.
Ce gars s'en souviendra longtemps.
- Tru ?
- Ce sac
- Quoi ?
- C'est le même que celui du Dr Kendall
Notre médecin de famille
quand j'étais petite
Dès qu'on l'appelait chez lui, il arrivait
avec un sac comme ça
- Vous l'appeliez chez lui ?
- L'homme le plus gentil que je connaisse
Il a été le premier à me dire
que je devais être docteur
- Tu devrais l'acheter
- Je ne suis pas docteur, juste une simple étudiante
Mais un jour, tu le deviendras, non ?
Allez, Davis doit se demander
où je suis
Hey, tu es certain de ne pas vouloir
de glace sur ta blessure ?
Merci, je dois aller faire du volontariat à la clinique
cet après-midi. Je soignerai ça là-bas
Hey Tru, c'est toi ?
- Euh oui
- Oh salut
- Euh... donc, on se voit en cours
- Oui, c'est ça
- A plus tard mec
- Au revoir
- Désolé, je n'avais pas réalisé que vous...
- Pas grave, rien n'est arrivé
Bien évidemment puisque je suis arrivé
au pire moment. C'est un de mes talents
- Je peux te poser une question personnelle ?
- Oui, vas-y
Après que ta femme soit morte
Combien de temps as-tu mis avant de...
voir d'autres femmes ?
4 ans
Mais ça venait plus d'une déficience sociale
qu'autre chose
Ça fait plusieurs mois que Luc est mort
Mais si tu as des sentiments envers quelqu'un
Tu devrais les accepter
Ça me semble juste trop tôt
Ça te semblera toujours trop tôt, que ce soit
aujourd'hui, demain, ou dans 4 ans
- Comment tu sais quand tu es prêt ?
- Tu tombes de nouveau amoureux
FERMÉ
Aide-moi Tru
STP, dis-moi...
STP, dis-moi que tu peux réparer ça
Qu'est-il arrivé ?
Papa m'a fait une remarque sur mes cheveux.
Il a dit, tu as l'air d'un foufou.
En tant qu'employé d'une boîte d'avocats
je me suis dit que j'allais lui faire plaisir
Avoir une vraie coupe
pour une fois
- C'est dur de faire mieux pour moins de 6 $
- Allez Tru
Tu es une fille, tu lis les magazines de mode
Tu dois pouvoir faire quelque chose
Voilà, c'est parfait
- C'est ton nouveau costume ?
- Oui
Oui, je me suis dit au diable
je vais me faire un nouveau look, tu aimes ?
C'est très professionnel
Soyons honnêtes, STP
On sait comment on appelle un gars comme moi
portant ce genre de costume
Un accusé
- Allez Harri, tu n'es pas...
- Comment j'ai pu croire que j'allais changer
Je ne peux pas changer qui je suis Tru
Voyons les choses en face
Tu peux changer.
Tu as changé ta coupe.
- Je n'ai rien dit
- Fais attention, pas maintenant
Je dois y aller
Merci pour la casquette
Pas de quoi.
A plus, cheveux d'ange.
- Oh, désolée
- Ce n'est pas drôle
Harrison, tu as oublié ton...
Avery, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
- Il est mort
- Quoi ? Qui est mort ?
Jensen
Jensen est mort
Ep.2-05 Enough
Tru, je suis vraiment désolé
Je ne suis pas ici pour des condoléances
Je suis ici pour tout réparer
STP, avant qu'il ne m'appelle
dis-moi tout ce que je dois savoir
Selon le rapport de police, il y a eu
un hold-up cet après-midi
et Jensen a été touché à la poitrine vers 17h30
Il est mort pendant le transfert à l'hôpital
Où a eu lieu le hold-up ?
Une boutique,
du côté de Broadway Ouest.
Il y est retourné pour le sac
Il y avait ce sac de docteur
en vitrine
Et il savait que je l'aimais
donc il a dû y retourner pour l'acheter
- J'aurais dû prévoir ça.
- Comment aurais-tu pu le prévoir ?
Tu as déjà oublié la dernière fois ?
Tous ceux auxquels je tiens
sont blessés.
Tous ceux que j'aime sont en danger
juste parce qu'ils me connaissent
- Tu as tort là-dessus
- Vraiment ?
Parce que les faits sont là.
Au cours de ces 4 derniers mois
j'ai perdu Luc et Jensen
- Même Harrison est mort une fois
- Oui, mais tu l'as sauvé
Tout ce que ça veut dire, c'est que j'ai
une chance sur 3 de sauver ceux que j'aime
Tru, Davis m'a appris la nouvelle
Je suis vraiment désolée
Elle est psychologue. Je me suis dit
que tu voudrais peut-être lui parler
- Tu peux venir à mon bureau si tu veux
- Je ne vais nulle part
Il a besoin de moi
- On devrait discuter dehors
- D'accord
- Ce n'était peut-être pas une bonne idée
- Non, tu as eu raison de m'appeler
- Elle ne veut pas accepter sa mort
- Il faut lui laisser un peu de temps.
Ok, tu fais pour le mieux
Je suis en haut si tu as besoin
- Ici Jack
- C'est moi, j'ai du nouveau
- Depuis combien de temps elle est là ?
- 4 heures
Je dois y aller. L'avion des parents de Jensen
atterrit dans 30 minutes
Quand je leur ai appris la nouvelle au téléphone
Je n'arrêtais pas de pleurer
Je veux devenir docteur
Je ne peux même pas parler de mort
sans perdre mon contrôle
J'aimerais pouvoir te dire que ça va s'améliorer
Je dois y aller
Occupez-vous bien d'elle
Hey, je viens voir si tu as faim
Tu veux peut-être aller dîner
- Non, pas maintenant, j'ai des choses à faire
- Tu t'en vas ?
Ça fait 4 heures
et il n'a pas appelé à l'aide
Il n'y a pas d'autre corps
donc voici les faits
Si je veux que la journée recommence
je dois trouver d'autres personnes mortes
- Comment tu vas faire...
- La dernière fois que j'ai vérifié
Il y avait 5 autres morgues dans le comté
J'irai à chacune d'entre elles s'il le faut
- Tru
- Je ne vais pas le perdre, je ne peux pas
Bonjour, un paquet pour Davis SVP
C'est gentil, merci
Notre amie fait le tour de toutes les morgues
des alentours ce soir
Ne me raconte pas d'histoires Davis
Je suis au courant pour Jensen
et je sais ce qu'elle essaye de faire
- Elle n'a pas de chance avec ses petit-copains
- Oui, grâce à toi
Oui, l'histoire avec Luc
C'était ma faute, je l'admets
Mais Jensen
C'est le destin qui envoie un message
Non, heureusement pour lui
Tru peut changer le destin
C'est différent cette fois
Elle n'est pas Dieu, Davis
Elle ne peut pas choisir ceux qu'elle veut sauver
Ils doivent la choisir
- Pourquoi me dis-tu tout ça ?
- Deux raisons
Tout d'abord, je me suis dit que
tu serais d'accord avec moi
Au fond de toi, tu sais que ce qu'elle fait
est mal mais tu n'as pas le courage de le lui dire
Ensuite, elle ne fera pas attention à moi
mais, toi, elle t'écoutera
Tu as raison sur une chose
je suis fidèle à Tru.
Si elle a besoin d'aide pour sauver Jensen,
je serai là
Très bien. Je t'aurai prévenu
Je peux t'aider
J'ai juste besoin de plus de temps
Pas de chance avec les autres morgues ?
Désolé
- Tu es fatiguée, tu devrais rentrer
- Je ne peux pas tant qu'un corps n'a pas demandé d'aide
- Ça pourrait prendre des jours, des semaines
- Je peux attendre
- Tu ne devrais peut-être pas
- Quoi ?
Je sais que tu tiens à Jensen
mais il y a probablement une raison
- pour laquelle il ne t'a pas demandé d'aide
- Je m'en fous qu'il y ait une raison
- Je peux l'aider et je vais le faire
- Tu n'es peut-être pas supposée le faire
Ça serait peut-être une violation des règles
Tu n'es pas inquiète des conséquences ?
Je ne sais pas pour toi
mais je n'ai pas eu de manuel des règles
Moi non plus, mais ça ne signifie pas
qu'il n'y ait pas de règles, Tru
Morgue de la ville
Oui, d'accord
- On vient d'appeler pour un ramassage ?
- Oui, à l'angle de la 3ème et de Haughton.
Je sais que c'est difficile
surtout pour quelqu'un avec tes possibilités
Mais tu dois peut-être accepter
le fait que tu ne peux pas aider Jensen
C'est ce que ta psychologue préférée t'a dit
Que je suis en phase de refus
Et bien elle a raison, je suis en phase de refus
Je n'accepte pas ça
Et tu sais quoi, je le peux
Excuse-moi, j'ai un ramassage
La victime s'est échappée des travaux forcés
en fin de matinée
- C'était un prisonnier ?
- Oui, en travail forcé sur la route 101
Il s'est débarrassé de son mouchard
avec une fourchette, et s'est enfui.
On a perdu sa trace pendant quelques heures,
jusqu'au signalement de la course poursuite.
On sait comment ça s'est terminé.
Il y a d'autres blessés ?
Heureusement, il était seul à la terrasse.
C'était la seule victime.
Il est à vous.
Bon courage.
Tru,
Je me doute que tu dois être en colère,
mais s'il te demande de l'aide
et que tu revis ta journée,
promets-moi de penser à ce que je t'ai dit.
Ne t'en fais pas,
je m'en souviendrai.
Allez, s'il te plaît.
Sauvez-moi !
C'est pas trop tôt.
- C'est moi.
- T'as de la chance,
- je partais à la morgue à l'instant.
- Parfait, j'ai une mission pour toi.
Dis-moi que celui qui a tué Jensen
a été arrêté.
- Ça va être difficile.
- Tu l'as dit.
On a 2 corps sans aucun lien entre eux.
Faut espérer un coup de pouce
du bon dieu.
Comment ça c'est passé ?
Ils ont demandé de l'aide en même temps ?
Exactement.
Désolé pour Jensen, ça fait encore
un de tes amis proches qui est touché.
- Il est encore en vie et je vais le sauver.
- Je sais bien.
Je vais m'occuper du prisonnier.
Je comptais sur Harrison pour s'en occuper.
Pour ses antécédents avec la police,
il a pas mal d'expérience.
D'accord
Je vais avoir besoin de toi pour Jensen.
Pour éviter que le scénario se reproduise,
bien entendu.
- Merci Davis.
- C'est tout ?
Oui, si j'ai du nouveau je t'appelle.
- Pardon.
- Ya pas de mal.
Salut
Pourquoi est-elle si pressée ?
Elle a un match de football au parc.
- Harri, j'ai besoin de toi.
- Je suis chez le coiffeur.
Ce que dit papa sur ton look
n'est pas à prendre à la lettre.
- Ta journée à recommencé ?
- En effet.
- Et la coupe de cheveux ?
- Pas beau à voir.
- Je t'écoute.
- Un prisonnier va s'échapper d'ici peu,
il fait des travaux d'intérêt général
sur la route 101.
Il est mort à la suite
d'un accident de la route pendant la poursuite.
Quoi d'autre ?
C'est le problème,
je n'ai pas son nom.
- Il faut que tu y ailles.
- Ça ne va pas sembler suspect ?
- Tu es là ?
- Tu trouveras, je te fais confiance.
Dis-moi à quoi il ressemble.
Allez !
48, rouge !
Désolée, c'était pas volontaire.
Faut pas l'embêter, on dirait.
Pas mal Davies.
Je ne soupçonnais pas ça en toi.
Il faut savoir donner des coups bas
pour gagner.
Tu en sais quelque chose.
Trêve de plaisanterie.
Je suis là pour te dissuader
de sauver Jensen.
Sachant tes visions sur mes flashbacks,
comment sais-tu qu'il est mort ?
Il y a plein de façons de le savoir.
Écouter les infos,
se brancher sur la fréquence de la police.
J'ai le même don que toi.
Épargne-moi ton couplet
sur l'ordre des choses.
C'est déjà mal de sauver
ceux qui te le demandent,
mais que dire de ceux qui n'ont rien demandé.
Tu aggraves encore les choses.
J'apprécie la remarque venant d'un homme
qui a tué une leucémique.
Les enjeux sont importants.
On est peut-être adversaires,
mais chacun a ses règles.
Si tu ne les respectes pas,
les conséquences seront terribles pour toi,
et pour Jensen aussi.
- C'est une menace ?
- C'est un fait.
Crois-le si tu veux,
mais j'essaie de te rendre service.
Laisse-moi planifier sa mort.
Pour votre bien à tous les deux.
S'il y avait des règles,
tu aurais payé le fait d'avoir tué Luc.
Donc je sauverai Jensen.
- Je peux vous aider ?
- Non monsieur.
C'est moi qui vais le faire.
Je travaille pour un cabinet d'avocats en ville.
Vous devez connaître.
Non ? Bref.
Un de mes clients qui est en prison,
souhaite une remise de peine
en dénonçant une tentative d'évasion.
- Cela concerne qui ?
- Je n'ai que sa description.
Environ 45 ans, un tatouage sur le bras
avec écrit Mandy dessus.
Si vous ne me croyez pas,
fouillez le gars.
Il a une fourchette qu'il va utiliser
pour s'emparer d'une arme.
Attendez ici.
C'est moi.
- Tout est réglé.
- Le prisonnier va bien ?
Il est sorti d'affaire, à l'instant.
- Merci, tu as sauvé une vie.
- Ça, je le savais déjà.
- Lâche-ça !
- Posez votre arme !
Pose-le au sol.
Prends tes clés.
Détache mes jambes.
Maintenant !
- C'est ta voiture ?
- Oui, en fait c'est une...
Viens par là !
- Voyons, pourquoi faire ça ?
- Monte !
- C'est bon, je monte.
- Tout de suite !
Allez, plus vite.
Vite !
À plus tard les enfants.
N'oubliez pas, on a rendez-vous
au labo pour ressusciter les cadavres.
Si tu veux je peux te déposer
à la clinique avec ma voiture.
Comment sais-tu que je vais bosser là-bas ?
Avery en a parlé.
Elle a dit que tu étais un saint.
Davis m'a donné mon après-midi
donc je suis disponible.
Oui, bien sûr.
Je t'avertis,
c'est plutôt ennuyeux.
Ça me convient parfaitement.
- Vous comptez faire quoi ?
- La voiture doit être recherchée.
Il faut s'en débarrasser.
Bonne idée.
Désolé pour tout à l'heure.
J'étais sous pression.
Ça m'est déjà arrivé.
En fait je déteste les armes.
C'est la première fois
que j'en tiens une.
On aurait pas dit.
Merci pour la voiture.
C'est ton costume ?
- Je peux l'emprunter ?
- Il est à vous, je suis en vie.
Réfléchis.
Que ferait Tru dans cette situation ?
Vous savez, je connais beaucoup de monde
dans cette ville.
Je peux vous avoir ce que vous voulez.
Des faux papiers...
Ça ira, merci.
Je m'en sortirai.
Mais on ne sait jamais,
je viens avec vous.
Non, cela vaut mieux pour vous.
Je vous comprends.
- Mais vous devriez...
- Il y a un truc que je ne pige pas.
Je vous laisse partir et vous refusez ?
Écoutez, je n'aime pas vraiment la police.
En plus, vous me semblez être un mec bien.
Laissez-moi vous aider.
Suis-moi.
T'es vraiment bizarre comme gamin.
On me dit ça souvent.
<i>C'est Harrison, laissez-un message.</i>
Je n'ai plus eu de tes nouvelles depuis ce matin.
Tout va bien ? Appelle-moi.
Ça va ?
Quelques coupures avec le papier,
sinon ça va.
- Bien.
- Jensen.
Stan Kirby t'attend en salle 1
pour un examen.
Stan Kirby, je m'en charge.
Très bien, Allons-y Monsieur Kirby.
Vous n'êtes pas M. Kirby.
Je doute que vous souffriez d'une sciatique.
- Ça fait plaisir de te voir Jensen.
- Moi de même, Jack. Pourquoi es-tu ici ?
Tout d'abord, je m'excuse
d'être venu de cette façon.
C'était pour éviter la présence de Tru.
- Parce que ?
- Car j'ai besoin de te parler en privé.
Cela concerne Tru.
Elle te cache quelque chose d'important.
Et tu dois savoir.
Tu vois, elle a perdu un proche
il y a peu de temps.
C'était son petit-ami.
Il s'appelait Luc.
- Je ne savais pas ça.
- Normal. Elle ne t'a rien dit.
C'est un peu logique.
Il n'y a rien de bien joyeux dans tout ça.
Mais en fait,
Tru ne s'en est pas remise.
Et depuis cette mort,
elle ne parvient plus
à se confier à personne.
Comment ça ?
Elle est pleine de secrets,
elle s'enfuit sans arrêt sans s'expliquer.
En fait,
Tru est une fille fantastique,
et je pense qu'elle t'aime.
- Je ne veux pas qu'elle sabote votre relation.
- C'est gentil de ta part.
Il y a autre chose que tu dois savoir,
mais...
j'ai un rendez-vous.
Que dirais-tu qu'on en parle plus tard ?
Pour le bien de Tru.
Tant mieux.
Je sais où on pourrait
se donner rendez-vous.
Incroyable !
J'arrive 5 minutes en retard
et mon rendez-vous est annulé.
Épelez-moi votre nom ?
Stan Kirby.
K - I - R - B - Y
C'est étrange, Stan Kirby
s'est présenté il y a 10 minutes.
Je suis Stan Kirby.
Donc cette personne était un imposteur.
- Oups, ce n'est pas la pharmacie.
- C'est ce qu'explique le panneau sur la porte.
Désolée.
Ça ira pour aujourd'hui M. Farmer.
Le docteur va arriver dans un instant.
Très bien.
Je croyais que tu devais voir M. Kirby.
Ils ont dû se tromper de fiche,
ça arrive.
Je dois y aller,
on se voit plus tard ?
On pourrait boire un café ensemble
avant d'aller au labo.
J'ai des livres à récupérer à la bibliothèque.
Viens à la morgue.
Davis a tout ce qu'il faut.
- Je ne veux pas l'embêter.
- Il sera très content.
C'est vrai.
Alors, allons-y.
J'ai déjà vu des films avec des évadés.
Et ils évitent le centre-ville
en pleine journée.
Je dois voir quelqu'un.
- Salut, Barbara.
- Travis !
Je te croyais en...
Qu'as-tu fait ?
Tu le liras demain dans les journaux.
Tu es incorrigible.
- Dis-moi juste où se passe le mariage.
- Non
- Je ferai toutes les églises de la ville s'il le faut.
- Je t'interdis
de gâcher son mariage.
Qui est-ce ?
Un otage.
Un otage ?
Tu viens ici avec un otage.
Jolie coupe de cheveux.
Ils ont un bon traiteur ?
Meilleur que toi.
Tu es ravissante Barbara.
J'appelle la police si tu prends la voiture.
Non, pas de police.
Je vais le faire.
Si vous appelez la police,
on sera poursuivis en voiture.
Il pourrait y avoir des blessés.
Laissez-moi le convaincre
de trouver une solution pacifique.
La voiture a intérêt à revenir intacte.
Promis.
Je voudrais signaler un vol de voiture.
Ça va ?
Oui, j'attends un appel de Tru.
Vous êtes très liés.
Oui, en effet.
Vous êtes sortis ensemble ?
Non, pas du tout.
Alors c'est quoi ?
Tu ne sais pas tout sur Tru.
Elle a un secret.
Je suis le seul à le connaître.
Je t'écoute.
Elle n'est pas vraiment
en poste ici à la morgue.
C'est un peu ma faute,
je n'ai pas rempli son formulaire d'embauche.
- Pardon, on vous dérange ?
- Non.
Vous vous connaissez ?
Jensen, voici Carrie.
- Enchanté.
- Moi de même.
- Est-ce qu'on peut emprunter quelques livres ?
- Oui, dans quel registre ?
Tu as du nouveau ?
Oui, son petit-ami est ici à la morgue.
On a rendez-vous tout à l'heure.
Il faudrait qu'il soit disponible.
- Si tu peux le faire.
- Je le ferai.
Très bien.
Les apparences sont trompeuses.
Oui.
- Ce mariage, de quoi s'agit-il ?
- C'est celui de ma fille, Mandy.
Ça explique votre évasion.
- Qu'allez vous lui dire quand vous la verrez ?
- Rien.
Elle ne sait pas que je suis son père.
Sa mère a épousé David
peu après mon incarcération.
Mandy n'était qu'un bébé,
ils ne lui ont rien dit.
- C'est pas très cool.
- Comme tu dis.
David a pu lui offrir la vie
que je n'aurais pas pu lui donner.
Je lui en suis reconnaissant.
C'est pourquoi je veux juste
assister à son mariage.
Après ça je me rendrai à la police.
- C'est quoi ?
- Une facture d'un fleuriste.
C'était sous le siège.
C'est une grosse commande.
Qui doit être livrée
à Saint-Augustin aujourd'hui.
On connaît le lieu du mariage.
- Je peux vous poser une question ?
- Oui.
Pourquoi avez-vous été emprisonné ?
J'étais chauffeur sur des braquages de banque.
J'ai commencé à ton âge.
Vous n'avez jamais essayé
de retrouver le droit chemin ?
Bien sûr que j'ai essayé !
J'ai compris qu'on ne pouvait pas changer
ce qu'on est.
Mais si on peut changer.
C'est peut-être difficile à croire,
mais, j'ai été pendant un certain temps
fourré dans des mauvais coups.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Maintenant j'ai un job.
Et je m'en sors pas trop mal.
Tu lâcheras prise tôt ou tard.
C'est inévitable pour des gars comme nous.
Bon sang.
Accroche-toi !
Et pour finir,
de la physiologie moderne.
Merci.
C'est lourd.
Je peux te parler un instant ?
Je n'ai plus qu'à lire tout ça.
Un problème ?
À toi de me le dire,
je n'ai pas eu de nouvelles de la journée.
- Pourquoi, c'est obligatoire ?
- Je t'ai laissé 3 messages, sans réponse.
Tout se passe bien.
2 personnes à sauver c'est beaucoup,
même pour toi.
Je ne demande qu'a aider.
Dis-moi s'il y a quelque chose.
Un seul des 2 a demandé de l'aide.
- Et ce n'était pas Jensen.
- Jensen n'est pas mort ?
Il n'a pas demandé de l'aide.
Écoute, je suis désolée de t'avoir caché ça.
Je pensais que tu refuserais de m'aider
si je te l'avais dit.
Voyons,
je sais que c'est toi qui sauves des vies.
Je suis à ta disposition quoi qu'il advienne.
Surtout aujourd'hui.
Où est Davis ?
À côté, il discute avec Tru.
Je vois. Quand ils commencent,
on ne sait jamais quand il vont finir.
Vraiment ?
- Tu as un rendez-vous ?
- Oui, en effet.
Mais je ne veux pas les interrompre.
Je leur dirai, ne t'en fais pas.
Il y avait une autre raison de me cacher ça.
Tu dois douter que ce que tu fais est bien.
Une raison pour laquelle
Jensen n'a pas demandé de l'aide.
- Tu crois que c'était son destin ?
- Pas toi ?
Peu importe la destinée,
vu qu'elle se fiche de ce que je veux.
Comment peux-tu dire ça ?
Regarde ma vie.
Tout ce que je sacrifie pour sauver ces gens.
Mes amis, ma famille.
Tout ça serait le destin ?
Et que me réserve le destin en échange ?
Il emporte mes proches.
D'abord ma mère, puis Luc et Jensen.
La coupe est pleine.
Je me battrai pour Jensen.
Où est Jensen ?
Il est parti,
il avait un rendez-vous avec un ami.
C'est Jack.
J'en suis sûre.
Il a dû le renvoyer à la boutique.
Mais j'ai vu le propriétaire fermer la boutique.
Il a dû le convaincre de rester ouvert.
Touché à la poitrine aux environs de 17h30...
Je vais tenter de l'arrêter.
Essaie d'appeler la boutique.
<i>- Ici la morgue.
- Il n'est pas ici, la boutique est fermée.</i>
Je m'en doutais, ça ne répond pas.
Jack doit être avec lui.
Mais où sont-ils ?
Je crois savoir où.
Sur les lieux de l'accident.
Content de te voir.
Tu as la meilleure place en terrasse.
C'est le boulot.
Je peux ?
- Je me doutais que ce serait toi.
- Ce que tu as fait ce matin n'a pas suffi.
Il s'est évadé et la police le poursuit.
Je suis aux premières loges
si tu vois ce que je veux dire.
Quoi ?
- Je suis dans la voiture avec lui.
- Comment as-tu fait ?
- Comment ?
- J'aimerais bien te raconter tout ça,
- mais je suis un peu occupé en ce moment
- Je suis à 5 minutes
Tiens-le à l'écart de 3rd street
C'est là qu'a eu lieu l'accident hier
Bonne nouvelle
On arrive sur 3rd Street
À propos de notre discussion sur le fait
que je puisse changer.
C'est trop tard.
Avant que l'on commence
Tu veux une bière ?
Ouais, ça serait parfait
Je m'en occupe, je connais le barman.
Reste ici.
Je n'arrive pas à les semer.
Et si on se rendait ?
Ma fille se marie.
Pas question.
Harri ?
Harri, tu es là ?
Attention
JENSEN
- Tu vas bien ?
- Oui, oui
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
- Appelle cela le destin
Ne bouge pas
Je vais voir le conducteur
- Vous allez bien ?
- Ouais
Juste quelques bleus ici et là
T'es sûr ? On ferait mieux d'aller
à l'hôpital pour vérifier cela
Non, non, peut-être plus tard
Travis doit faire quelque chose
Venez
- Elle vaut le detour pas vrai ?
- Oui elle est très belle.
La question est:
Est-ce qu'elle valait cette escapade ?
D'après toi ?
Il est temps pour moi d'y aller.
J'espère ne pas te croiser en prison.
Je vous l'ai dit
- Je ne suis plus ce genre de gars
- Je crois que tu as raison
J'ai pensé que ça t'intéresserait
Deux de sauvés aujourd'hui
Tu dois l'admettre Davis
J'ai sauvé Jensen et ce n'est pas la fin du monde
donc reconnais les faits.
Mes inquiétudes étaient
tout de même justifiées.
Mais en y repensant
Si je pouvais revivre des journées
Et que Carrie était morte le premier jour
J'aurais probablement agi comme toi
En parlant de Carrie, je pense
qu'il est temps de lui dire la vérité
- à quel sujet ?
- Sur ce qu'on fait ici
- On ne la connait même pas
- Je tiens à elle
Et elle pourrait être d'une grande aide
Si elle avait su pour Jensen
Elle ne l'aurait pas laissé partir aujourd'hui
Davis
Ok, d'accord, au moins
j'aurai demandé
Je dois y aller
Je vais être en retard pour mon cours
A demain
- Contente de te voir aussi Avery
- Merci Tru, merci beaucoup
Je leur ai raconté que tu m'avais sauvé la vie.
Mais si ça n'avait pas été le cas, on aurait tous
eu notre semestre et ça aurait été cool aussi
Ouais
je dis juste...
Hey, ça va ?
Oui, je crois que j'ai dû me fouler
quelque chose quand tu m'as poussé
- Désolée pour ça
- Pas grave, je préfère ça
- Je peux regarder ?
- Oui, vas-y, ne te gène pas
- Quoi ?
- C'est étrange
J'ai l'impression d'avoir
déjà vécu cette scène
Tu penses l'avoir déjà fait avant ?
Oui, mais exactement ça
Toi, moi, la blessure, tout
- C'est fou, hein ?
- Ouais, fou
<i>Sous-titrage: Ben, Van & Stinc3

Quelque chose se trame Tru
Je peux le sentir
Vendredi prochain
C'est la fin
Pour toujours
L'important pour le moment
C'est qu'elle me fait confiance
Salut papa
Tru Calling, la fin
Réveillon de Noël :
dîner avec Harryson
Il ne doit rien savoir sur nous
J'ai d'autres responsabilités, ma femme, mon job
Je ne devrais pas m'inquiéter pour toi
Je dois y aller
A plus tard
- Je peux vous aider
- Salut papa
- Je ne voulais pas interrompre ta conversation
- C'est juste une affaire sur laquelle je travaille
- Qu'est-ce que je peux faire pour toi ?
- Laisse-moi réfléchir
J'ai beaucoup travaillé, fait des heures sup
Et je me demandais si...
Si je pouvais être augmenté.
Ils ont augmenté mon loyer.
Je suis habitué au confort d'un appart.
J'aimerais pouvoir t'aider Harryson mais
Une augmentation rapide pour mon fils
Tu comprends qu'on me jugerait...
Je m'en doutais
Ça valait le coup d'essayer
Bien
- Donc, vous fêtez Noël pendant 8 jours
- Tyler, pour la dernière fois, ça s'appelle Hannukah
Et si tu prononces encore une fois Noël,
je t'en colle une.
Je pense qu'on devrait ouvrir
nos cadeaux surprise.
Bonne idée, Ave, tu commences.
Et j'ai droit à...
un peigne.
Et je devine que
c'est de la part de Tyler
Ça devait rester anonyme, non ?
Quand on dit moins de 10$,
ce n'est pas un concours de celui
qui mettra le moins d'argent dans un cadeau.
Ils doivent rentrer chez eux
pour les vacances,
seulement s'ils survivent au trajet
qui les mène à l'aéroport.
Et toi Davies ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ce soir ?
Et bien comme tous les Noël,
Ce sera moi, Harryson et c'est tout.
Le bon côté c'est qu'il y aura
moins de bordel le lendemain
Ou plus de tristesse.
Arrête un peu de la traquer.
Chez moi, on ne traque pas les gens.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe avec toi ?
- D'habitude, tu es tout grincheux
- Pas cette année. Je suis dans l'esprit des Fêtes
Le sapin de Noël, l'église.
J'irai même m'asseoir
sur les genoux du Père Noël.
- Tu aimes le Père Noël ?
- Et comment que je l'aime !
Je ne devrais même pas être là
mais tu m'as sauvé.
Et ça peut sembler idiot
mais chaque jour est un cadeau
Même un jour comme Noël
- Papa nous rejoue ça à nouveau ?
- Ça ?
- Ça, il a une liaison
- Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
Je ne sais pas. Peut-être que sa relation
avec Jordan ne lui apporte pas tout ce dont il a besoin
Non, qu'est-ce qui te fait penser
qu'il a une affaire ?
Hé bien, il y a les appels secrets
Les longs déjeuners qui n'en finissent plus
- Et il y a l'appartement
- Quel appartement ?
Ok, dès qu'il a commencé à agir bizarrement
J'ai commencé à le suivre
- Harry !
- Quoi ? Il va à cet endroit 3 fois par semaine
Il y reste 1/2h, 45 minutes.
Puis il s'en va.
Je sais que papa n'est pas
un modèle de fidélité,
mais n'en tire pas
de conclusions hâtives.
Je sais, je sais
Tu as raison
Oh, je sais ce que je vais ramener au dîner
- Quoi ?
- Des preuves
C'est une blague ?
Quelqu'un a tué le Père Noël ?
Je sais, c'est plutôt effrayant, hein ?
Mais je pense que sa mort est naturelle
Je suis juste venue récupérer un truc.
Tu ne récupères pas ses effets personnels ?
Non, tout ce qu'il a c'est un sac noir
rempli de cadeaux, c'est tout
Les vacances sont plutôt calmes pour la morgue
mis à part les cas de fatalité.
S'il est le seul mort de la ville,
quelles sont les chances
pour qu'il me souffle: "Ho Ho Aide-moi" ?
- Morgue de la ville
- Salut Davis, c'est moi
Je suis désolée. Je vais être
un peu en retard pour le dîner ce soir
- Tout va bien ?
- Oui je suis au centre de la jeunesse
dans le cadre de notre collaboration
avec la communauté.
Nous avons embauché un Père Noël
pour offrir des cadeaux aux enfants,
mais le gars ne s'est pas encore montré.
Ils vont être déçus.
C'est une personne
de plus qui les laisse tomber.
- Carrie, je pense savoir ce qu'il lui est arrivé
- Vraiment ? Quoi ?
- Il est sûrement coincé dans les bouchons
- Tu as probablement raison
- En tout cas, j'arrive dès que possible
- A plus tard
Si ça peut t'aider à te sentir mieux
Tu peux toujours nous rejoindre moi et Harry ce soir
Non, ça fait un moment que je n'ai pas passé
mes vacances avec une femme
- Donc je vais l'attendre
- Très bien
- On se voit demain
- Ok
- Joyeux Noël
- Joyeux Noël
J'aimerais pouvoir lui faire comprendre
mais tu sais que ce n'est pas possible
Si elle découvre pour nous deux,
tu imagines bien sa réaction.
Donc le plus important pour le moment
C'est qu'elle me fait confiance.
Salut papa
Ep.2-06 'Twas the Night Before Christmas...Again
Harry, tu es encore en retard
et j'en ai marre d'espérer ton arrivée.
Donc voici le deal. J'ai une nuit de repos
et je ne vais pas la passer à t'attendre
Donc, aussi peu festif que ça puisse sembler
tu me trouveras au labo, en train de bosser
Je serai en train de charcuter des organes,
en imaginant que c'est les tiens.
J'espère que tu me donneras une bonne raison
pour m'avoir laissée tomber la veille de Noël
Harryson, laisse-moi t'expliquer
Jack. Tu travailles avec Jack Harper
Je croyais que tu avais une liaison
- De quoi parles-tu ?
- Ces appels
Ces appels ne concernaient pas ta femme
Ils concernaient Tru
Elle a mentionné que ce gars lui voulait du mal
Je voulais juste la protéger, c'est un crime ?
Je ne crois pas à tes mensonges
- D'accord, tu veux la vérité ?
- Ça serait bien, pour changer
Jack Harper m'a contacté
avec des histoires très étranges sur ta soeur
Il m'a dit qu'elle avait ce don
Et que si je voulais en savoir plus, je devais
le rencontrer ici aujourd'hui
- Donc c'est la première fois que tu le rencontrais ?
- Oui
Je t'ai vu venir à cet appartement
3 fois cette semaine
- Papa
- Je te croyais intelligent, fils
Tru était douée pour les études,
mais toi...
Tu comprends les gens.
Tu n'as aucune idée de ce à quoi tu te frottes
- Dis-le moi alors
- Je vais être honnête avec toi, fils
Et je veux que tu comprennes
les enjeux.
- Mais tu dois me promettre une chose
- Quoi, qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Tu ne raconteras rien à Tru
- Il faudrait que je sois mort pour ça
Je suis désolé d'entendre ça
Papa
Harryson, je suis vraiment désolé
- Tu m'as fait peur
- Parmi les cadavres c'est moi qui t'effraie ?
Désolée, qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Je te croyais en train de décorer le sapin.
C'est-ce que j'ai fait.
Personne ne devrait être seul la veille de Noël
Même pas notre amie ici
Tu sais, on n'a pas eu l'occasion de parler
à propos de ce que tu ressens
A quel sujet ?
Je veux dire, parfois une expérience près de la mort
peut avoir des effets étranges sur les gens
Honnêtement, je me sens en pleine forme.
Mieux que ça encore,
c'est un nouveau départ pour moi
- J'ai la chance de revoir mes priorités
- Dans quel sens ?
Avoir des priorités par exemple. Je n'en aurai plus
Je ferai tout ce que je veux maintenant
J'aime bien ce nouveau Jensen
mais je ne t'imaginais pas comme ça.
On n'est pas toujours ce à quoi on ressemble
Allez Tru
Allez, décroche
Je viens d'avoir un SMS d'Avery et Tyler
Ils vont passer Noël à l'aéroport
Et c'est probablement mon frère
avec une lamentable excuse
Aide-moi.
C'était la veille de Noël, à nouveau...
- Avery, c'est Tru
- Hola chica, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Je ne pourrai pas venir au petit-déj
Une urgence au boulot
Il faudra que tu trouves un meilleur boulot
ou de meilleures excuses
Je me disais que toi et Tyler devraient
appeler l'aéroport avant d'y aller
Au cas où votre vol soit retardé ou annulé
Personne ne veut passer Noël dans un aéroport
- Merci, joyeuses fêtes Tru
- Toi aussi
- Vous m'avez réveillé hier aussi
- Nuit difficile ?
Non ça va être une dure journée
Harryson vous a suivi à l'appartement
- Heureusement, c'est une nouvelle journée
- Faites attention à ce que vous lui dites aujourd'hui
Soyez gentil avec lui, trouvez ce qu'il sait
Vous savez comment fonctionne ce boulot
On n'aura pas d'autre chance
- Salut patron
- Harryson, qu'est-ce que je peux faire pour toi ?
Laisse-moi réfléchir
J'ai beaucoup travaillé, fait des heures supp
- Et je me demandais si je pouvais être augmenté
- Une augmentation
- Je pense vraiment...
- Et bien, tu le mérites sûrement
Laisse-moi en parler aux partenaires
et voir ce qu'ils en disent
C'est une blague
Qui a tué le Père Noël ?
Mort naturelle
- Avec ta chance, il pourrait ouvrir les yeux et...
- J'ai fait cette blague hier
Il devait donner des cadeaux
au centre de la jeunesse.
C'est là que se trouve Carrie
Je le sais. Elle va manquer le dîner
pour trouver une solution.
- S'il n'a pas demandé de l'aide, qui l'a fait ?
- Un cadavre
- Quelle porte ?
- Pas ici, à l'école
- A l'école, les corps sont morts depuis...
- 6 mois je sais
C'est pour ça que je suis venue t'en parler
Je ne peux pas revenir 6 mois en arrière
Donc pourquoi un corps déjà mort
me demanderait de l'aide
- Il y a un avantage ?
- Lequel ?
Les indices sont toujours sur le corps
et pour une fois, tu as le corps pour t'aider
- Pour info, elle était morte quand je suis arrivé
- Je le savais. Maintenant tire-toi.
Je partais de toute façon.
J'ai une journée de libre.
Tu es douée, mais pas tant que ça en fait.
Un cadavre, pas d'indice
Et si je t'aidais aujourd'hui ?
Si je te proposais d'aller te faire voir.
Marrant.
Prends ça comme une offre de Noël.
Qu'est-ce que je peux faire de mal ?
La personne à sauver est déjà morte, non ?
Il n'y a personne à sauver, pas de combat
Je pourrais t'être utile
Jack, je n'accepterai jamais ton aide
Essaie d'être gentil
Joyeux Noël à tous et bonne chance
Donc tu m'as appelé à l'aide
Qui es-tu et que me veux-tu ?
- Donc tu leur parles aussi
- Oh, tu m'as prise par surprise
Donc tu as annulé le petit-déjeuner
pour travailler à l'école
- Quand tu as parlé du boulot, je pensais...
- Je suis un peu à la traîne ce semestre
D'accord, d'accord
Alors pourquoi tu travailles sur le cadavre
d'un autre groupe que le nôtre ?
- Je regarde leur boulot.
- Je fais la même chose, tu l'as bien choisie.
Tu sens ça ?
On dirait que son crane est fracturé.
Exactement.
Et tu vois les petites rougeurs
autour de ses yeux ?
- Des pétéchies
- Je croyais que tu étais à la traîne
Elle est morte par asphyxie.
Elle a été assassinée de cette manière,
puis a probablement chuté causant la fracture.
J'ai bien écouté le prof en cours.
Il est rare de travailler sur des cadavres
dont la mort n'est pas accidentelle.
Pas à la morgue en tout cas.
J'ai encore quelques courses à faire
Merci pour ton aide
- Quand tu veux
- A plus
Harryson, laisse-moi deviner
Tu crois que papa a une liaison
- Je déteste quand tu fais ça
- Je déteste quand tu me laisses tomber
Tu n'es pas venu au dîner hier soir
Qu'est-il arrivé ?
Dur à dire vu que je ne revis
pas les journées
Donc je t'ai parlé des coups de fil de papa
et de ses déplacements ?
Je pense qu'il se doute d'un truc.
Il est beaucoup trop gentil
- Il cache quelque chose
- Du calme, tout le monde n'a pas une vie secrète
- Juste toi
- Au revoir Harry
Allez
ACCES REFUSE
C'est un sac noir avec des cadeaux dedans
Je me doute de l'ironie de la chose.
Oui, vous pouvez me dire
quand vous viendrez le chercher ?
- Ok, merci. Dieu
- Alors ?
En tant que coroner, on pourrait
croire que je suis influent.
Je sais que tu veux aider Carrie mais
techniquement ces cadeaux sont les siens
Oui, mais il devait les donner
aux enfants
Ça serait plus simple si je pouvais dire
à Carrie ce qui va arriver
Ok désolé
Du nouveau sur le cadavre ?
Tout ce que je sais c'est que la femme
qui m'a appelée a été assassinée
Je n'ai même pas son nom et son identité
est de toute façon confidentielle
- Donc en gros, je n'ai rien
- Il y a une personne qui peut t'aider
Quelqu'un qui voit comment
meurent les victimes
Non, non, tu as perdu l'esprit
Je ne peux pas après ce qu'il a fait
Tu l'as dit toi-même.
Tu ne peux rien faire.
Mais de là à faire copain-copain
avec la faucheuse.
Normalement, j'aurais été d'accord.
Mais comme personne ne mourra,
que peux-t'il faire ?
Je suis désolé Tru
J'aimerais beaucoup t'aider, vraiment
Je vais devoir te demander de me dire
les 2 mots magiques
- STP Jack
- Désolé, ce ne sont pas les mots magiques
- C'est une mauvaise idée
- Allez, dis-le moi une seule fois: aide-moi.
Que dirais-tu de : Tu peux rêver.
Ça n'ira pas, si tu veux l'aide
de mon petit cerveau.
- Aide-moi
- J'ai cru que tu ne demanderais jamais
Je ne sais pas pourquoi on a pris 2 voitures
Pour quelqu'un qui sauve des vies
Tu devrais faire plus attention
à l'environnement Tru
J'ai l'habitude de ne pas monter en voiture
avec un gars qui tue des gens pour son boulot
- Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ici ?
- Tu veux connaître la dernière journée de la victime, non ?
Il est temps que je te livre mes infos
C'était la fin de la journée, un coucher de soleil
Un compteur de taxi, une fille avec des tresses
Un drap avec des fleurs rouges dans le vent
Et puis, cette barrière cassée
Le mieux c'est de terminer par la fin
La dernière chose que j'ai vue
C'était la chute ici
- On n'est pas les seuls à venir ici aujourd'hui
- A ton avis, coïncidence ou connexion ?
Un seul moyen de le savoir
Je viens de recevoir un magnifique bouquet mais la carte
a disparu et je ne sais pas qui me l'a envoyé
J'aimerais pouvoir la remercier
donc... Oui
Anne Moore, la seule personne
qui en a acheté depuis ce matin
- Merci beaucoup, au revoir
- Impressionnant
- Merci pour l'aide Jack
- C'est tout ?
Il me fallait un indice pour démarrer
J'en ai un. Ça n'a rien de personnel
- En fait, c'est totalement le contraire
- Ouais
- Bonjour, Anne Moore ?
- Oui
Je suis de l'université d'Hudson et je fais une enquête
sur ceux qui ont donné un corps de proche pour la science
- Je n'ai pas vraiment le temps
- Ça ne prendra que quelques minutes
Je dois juste identifier un cadavre
qui a récemment...
En vérité, je ne souhaite pas parler de cela
la veille de Noël donc, excusez-moi
Ce que ma collègue a oublié de vous dire
C'est que l'on paye pour cette information
Entrez
- Cet argent arrive au bon moment
- Nous sommes ravis de vous aider
Donc vous êtes ici au sujet
de ma soeur Allison ?
- Oui
- C'est elle
- Que lui est-il arrivé ?
- Elle a été assassinée
Il y a 6 mois, par un homme
du nom de Russell Marks
Ils travaillaient ensemble
et avaient également une relation
Jusqu'à ce qu'Allison découvre
qu'il était marié
Cette nuit-là, elle est allée le voir
pour lui dire que tout était terminé
C'est la dernière fois qu'on l'a vue vivante
- J'ai fini de nettoyer ma chambre
- Ok, prépare-toi pour l'église
C'est la fille que j'ai vue dans
les souvenirs du cadavre
- Jolie fille
- Celle d'Allison
Ma soeur était une mère célibataire
Donc maintenant, je le suis aussi
Mme Moore, si ce n'est pas trop
Qu'est-il arrivé à Russell Marks ?
Et bien, il a été arrêté.
Mais les jurés ont estimé
qu'il manquait des preuves.
Qu'il y avait des doutes sur sa culpabilité.
Je ne peux pas croire
qu'il peut avoir une vie
Acheter des cadeaux
préparer le sapin avec sa femme
Alors que le corps d'Allison est dans une pièce
sombre et froide quelque part
Où est la justice là dedans ?
Je suis désolée
Y a-t'il autre chose ?
Je dois aller à l'église
Il y a du monde la veille de Noël
Non c'est tout
Merci beaucoup
Je n'ai même pas un merci
J'étais brillant là-bas.
Les cavaliers de l'apocalypse
ont besoin de reconnaissance ?
Quoi qu'il en soit, le fait que je sois toujours là
signifie que tu as besoin de moi
Et ça me rend tout joyeux
et velouté à l'intérieur
Fais gaffe,
sinon ton coeur de glace va fondre.
Bien trouvé.
Mais blague à part,
le boulot est fini puisque
personne ne va mourir ?
Comment aider Allison maintenant ?
Empêcher sa mort
n'est qu'une des façons de sauver sa vie.
Sa soeur semblait en vouloir à Russell Marks.
Elle a peut-être voulu se venger.
- Mais il n'y a pas eu de victime.
- Rien ne l'oblige.
Une tentative de meurtre ?
Si elle était jugée coupable,
- La fille d'Allison serait orpheline une 2ème fois.
- C'est une piste.
On devrait aller voir Russell Marks
avant qu'il ne soit trop tard.
Tru il faut que je te dise...
- Que fait-il ici ?
- Ça fait plaisir de te voir Harryson.
Harry, du calme, tout va bien.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Viens.
J'ai discuté avec papa.
Je lui ai demandé s'il avait une liaison.
- Il a dit quoi ?
- Il a rusé.
- Je te l'avais dit.
- Mais,
il a dit rencontrait ses associés
dans cet appart.
Mais j'ai un pote qui est leur chauffeur.
Il ne viennent que la semaine prochaine.
Il y a un truc louche,
j'en suis certain.
- Je vous laisse un instant.
- C'est ça, va faire un tour.
Tu es cinglée ?
Tu couches avec l'ennemi.
- On ne couche pas, il m'aide.
- On ne peut pas lui faire confiance.
Je parie qu'il est en train
de te jouer un tour.
Richard, ton fils a toujours
des doutes sur toi.
Il faut trouver un truc,
sinon, on va être découverts.
Ton frère semblait énervé de me voir.
Il s'est calmé ?
Tu as essayé de le tuer je te rappelle.
Pour vivre heureux,
il vaut mieux avoir la mémoire courte.
Vous désirez ?
Madame Marks, je suis Jack Harper.
Nous souhaiterions rencontrer votre mari.
Russell ne souhaite pas parler aux journalistes.
Nous sommes du quartier, nous cherchons
des bénévoles pour notre association.
Non, désolée.
Nous nous sommes mariés récemment.
Nous venons d'emménager ici.
Russell serait ravi de vous aider
mais il est sorti faire quelques courses.
On doit aller à l'église St Mathieu ensuite.
Pour le bénévolat il n'y a pas mieux
qu'une église comme endroit pour recruter.
- C'est vrai.
- Merci du conseil, on s'y verra peut-être.
Bonne chance.
- La soeur d'Allison sera certainement à l'église.
- Une raison de plus d'y aller.
C'est joli. Ça me plaît.
- Papa Noël ne viendra pas ?
- Mais si.
Il s'est peut-être perdu.
Ça te va bien.
Vous nous avez promis qu'il viendrait.
Je sais.
Parfois le père Noël a des soucis...
Et le voilà !
- Davis ?
- Non, c'est le père Noël.
- Que fais-tu là ?
- Je t'expliquerai.
Allez,
qui veut s'asseoir sur ses genoux ?
Avant tout, une question importante.
Avez-vous pris une douche récemment ?
- Oui
- Vraiment ?
- Tu es sûr d'être à ta place ici ?
- Ce n'est pas moi qui trafique le destin.
Si la foudre devait frapper,
je parierais sur ta pomme.
Alors pourquoi m'aides-tu aujourd'hui ?
Tant que les morts restent où ils sont,
il n'y a pas d'inconvénient à aider les vivants.
Et le fait de passer Noël seul me chagrine.
Le voilà.
M. Marks
Sans vouloir vous offenser,
les Moore sont nos amis
et ils vont assister à cette messe.
Anne vous en veut toujours.
Nous voulons juste éviter
que cela ne dégénère ici.
Je vous remercie de vous en préoccuper,
mais je suis innocent.
J'ai le droit de mener ma vie
comme bon me semble.
Et qu'en est-il de la vie d'Allison Moore ?
Merci de votre sollicitude.
Russell
Je vais assister à l'office avec ma femme.
Excusez-nous.
Et bien.
- On dirait que Marks n'est pas coupable.
- À quoi vois-tu ça ?
Je sais que quand on a tué quelqu'un,
c'est comme une odeur.
On a beau se laver,
elle est toujours là.
Lui, il ne l'a pas.
- Quel cadeau te ferait plaisir ?
- Un furet.
Un furet ?
Je n'ai pas ça mais je peux t'offrir
une scie chirurgicale.
C'est pour couper
des petites branches d'arbre.
Merci papa Noël.
Et toi, que voudrais-tu avoir ?
Une scie chirurgicale.
Il n'y en avait qu'une.
Mais que dirais-tu
d'un masque de protection.
C'est pour protéger
des éclaboussures de sang.
- Vous êtes le papa Noël le plus cool.
- Merci.
Et pour toi,
voici un écarteur.
J'ai aussi un forceps.
Il faut juste éviter qu'ils ne se croisent.
Si c'est le cas...
La voilà.
Rentrons à la maison.
- C'est tout ?
- Il ne s'est rien passé.
- C'est peut-être pour plus tard.
- On doit se séparer.
Un avec Russell, l'autre avec Allison.
Je reste avec Russell.
S'il se passe quelque chose,
souviens-toi que tu es là pour m'aider.
C'est ce que je fais.
Vous ne pouvez pas rester ?
On a pourtant des choses à régler.
Salut Papa.
Que fais-tu là ?
Je pourrais te retourner la question.
La surprise est gâchée de toute façon.
La surprise ?
Je viens de signer le bail.
Joyeux Noël mon fils.
C'est à toi.
Cet appart ?
Pourquoi ?
Il m'était impossible de t'augmenter,
mais mes associés ne peuvent m'empêcher
de te faire un cadeau.
Cela faisait des semaines que je préparais ça
mais tu as failli tout faire capoter.
- Je suis désolé, je pensais...
- Ce n'est pas grave, oublions ça.
Tout est rentré dans l'ordre.
- Joyeux Noël papa.
- À toi aussi.
Que fais-tu ici étranger ?
Je viens voir ce que j'ai manqué
pendant toutes ces années.
Et pour exprimer mes condoléances.
Pour qui ?
Pour mon oncle.
Il est mort d'une crise cardiaque
l'année dernière.
Ça c'est pour mon cousin,
qui est parti quand nous étions gamins.
Si les choses s'étaient passées
différemment la semaine dernière,
tu serais en train
d'allumer un cierge pour moi.
Mais ce n'est pas le cas.
Les âmes pures iront au Paradis.
Et celle là,
pour qui est-elle ?
Personne.
Je dois retourner au labo.
À plus tard.
Je te propose une compagnie plus chaleureuse.
Laisse tomber le labo pour ce soir et rejoins-moi.
On fête le réveillon avec mon frère.
On prendra de bonnes résolutions
pour l'avenir.
D'accord.
À part des mots flêchés,
Anne ne fait pas grand chose.
- Et Russell ?
- Il rentre avec sa femme.
On a dû louper un truc.
Il se peut que ce qu'Allison souhaite
n'ait rien à voir avec la vengeance.
Un instant.
Je crois que j'ai compris.
Ce n'était pas Anne qu'il fallait arrêter.
Mais sa fille.
Vous savez qui je suis ?
Bien entendu.
C'est au procès que vous m'avez vue ?
Je peux vous être utile ?
Avouez ce que vous avez fait à ma mère.
Cambria, tu devrais...
Je devrais quoi !
Vous pardonner ?
Ou vous faire payer
pour éviter que cela ne se reproduise.
Je t'en prie.
J'aimais votre mère.
- Je ne lui aurais jamais fait de mal.
- C'est faux !
J'étais prêt à tout lâcher pour elle.
Mon job, mon mariage.
Juste pour être avec elle.
Vous vous souvenez de moi ?
Je suis un ami de votre tante.
Elle ne veut pas ça.
Allison lui manque autant qu'à vous.
Tuer n'arrange rien.
Ce n'est pas à nous
de juger qui est coupable.
Ça ne marche pas comme ça.
Cela ne dépend pas de nous.
Vous ne comprenez pas !
Il l'a tuée et il est libre.
Et rien de ce que tu feras ne changera ça.
Cela ne te ramènera pas ta mère
et ne réconfortera pas ta tante.
Personne ne mourra ce soir.
Si cela se trouve, tu ne le blesseras même pas.
Si tu le manques,
tu seras la seule à payer ce geste.
Que se passe-t'il ?
- Mon dieu, mais que se passe-t'il ?
- Chérie, rentre.
Un rideau blanc avec des fleurs rouges.
Ce n'était peut-être pas des rideaux.
C'est ce que vous croyez.
Je ne vais pas le manquer.
Alors, tu seras une meurtrière.
Et tu devras vivre avec ça toute ta vie.
N'est-ce pas Madame Marks ?
De quoi parle-t'elle ?
Je... n'en sais rien.
Cambria, ne tue pas un innocent.
Je vous serais très reconnaissant,
si vous ne portiez pas plainte.
Elle a suffisamment souffert.
Tu la laisses s'en tirer comme ça ?
Et nous, on n'as pas assez souffert ?
Vous souhaitez qu'elle paye
pour avoir tenté de tuer votre mari ?
Exactement !
Allison Moore souhaiterait certainement
la même chose.
Vous devriez discuter avec votre femme.
Russell.
Je l'ai fait pour nous.
Ce n'est pas à moi qu'il faut le dire,
mais à la police.
Merci.
Pour tout ce que tu as fait aujourd'hui.
J'aimerais comprendre comment
tu as pu savoir qu'il ne viendrait pas.
J'ai réfléchi à un cadeau pour Noël.
Le meilleur cadeau que je puisse offrir,
c'est la vérité.
La vérité sur ma vie.
Quoi donc ?
Tu m'as demandé comment j'ai su
que le père Noël ne viendrait pas.
C'est une histoire intéressante.
Mais que je ne suis pas censé révéler.
Tu sais que tu peux tout me dire.
Je sais...
C'est au sujet de Tru.
Pourquoi avoir appelé la police
pour Madame Marks ?
L'enquête était close.
Pourquoi ressasser la souffrance dans leur famille ?
Tu dis bien connaître les meurtriers,
je connais aussi bien les victimes.
Et ne pas connaître le coupable
est un vrai carcan.
Autant éviter aux autres les souffrances
que j'ai connues en perdant ma mère.
Je dois dire que
cela ne m'a pas déplu cette journée.
Tu admets que je suis du bon côté ?
Tu sais pourquoi les gentils
avaient un chapeau blanc dans les westerns ?
C'était pour mieux éclairer
leur visage à la caméra.
La couleur du chapeau n'a rien à voir
avec le gentil ou le méchant.
C'est juste deux visions différentes.
Je vais par là.
Moi, par là.
On se reverra, je suppose ?
- Jusqu'au jour où tu prendras ta retraite.
- À moins que tu ne la prennes avant moi.
- C'était une bonne journée.
- En effet.
Joyeux Noël, Tru.
Ou peut-être que je ne veux pas
passer Noël tout seul.
Je n'excuse en rien ce que tu m'as fait.
Et cela ne changera rien à nos rapports.
Mais je ne laisse jamais
quelqu'un seul un soir de Noël.
Enfin, elle arrive.
2 fois dans la journée ?
C'est ma fête ma parole.
Relax Harry.
C'était peut-être une mauvaise idée.
Et ne pas rencontrer tous tes amis ?
Jamais de la vie.
Tu veux une guerre ou quoi ?
Le soir de Noël ?
Joyeux Noël.
J'espère que tu ne m'en veux pas.
J'ai apporté mes 2 acolytes.
On a bien fait de t'écouter,
le vol était annulé.
Sinon on passait le réveillon à l'aéroport.
Donc nous te sommes
aussi redevables que Jensen.
C'était juste mon instinct.
Je croyais que vous dîneriez ensemble.
On a dîné, mais Davis m'a dit
que vous étiez seuls pour réveillonner.
On ne voulait pas que vous soyiez seuls.
Tout va bien ?
Tu ne m'as pas demandé comment
cela s'est passé avec Jack.
C'est vrai.
Alors ?
Bien.
- Tu es sûr que ça va ?
- Oui.
Juste un peu fatigué.
On discutera plus tard.
Tu lui diras quand
que je connais le secret ?
Tu sais qu'on a le meilleur papa du monde ?
Il m'a acheté un appart.
Il est nickel.
- C'est généreux.
- Non, c'est mérité.
- Jack Harper.
- Bonsoir.
C'est mon papa.
Richard, voici Jack.
- Enchanté.
- Moi de même. Vous êtes avec ma fille ?
On est concurrents en fait.
Excusez-moi.
La journée à été longue ?
Comme toutes.
Dans ma quête de sainteté,
il me reste une étape à franchir.
C'est quoi ?
- C'est pas lui dont tu devais t'occuper ?
- Chaque chose en son temps.
- Et notre espion ?
- Elle le tient.
Joyeux Noël
C'est bon je peux partir maintenant.
C'est lui le gars qui sort avec ma soeur.
Venez trinquer.

Et je revis les journées
Tu revis des journées
Jack, ce que tu croyais vivre
Je le vis aussi
- Je me pose des questions parfois
- A propos de quoi ?
les conséquences,
les effets boule de neige
Il n'est pas comme toi
Il est ton opposé
- Tu sauves des vies, lui...
- les prend
Tu n'as pas idée de ce que tu fais
Il y a des conséquences
lorsqu'on sauve des gens destinés a mourir
Tu crois que je perturbe l'ordre établi ?
J'en fais peut-être partie
- Qu'est-ce qui sera différent ?
- Ce week-end, on discutera de tout
Luc, reste avec moi
Ma mère avait cette vocation
et elle me l'a transmise
Si tu penses un seul instant que je vais arrêter
tu as tort
Tu dois savoir une chose
C'est plus important que tu ne penses
Tu n'as aucune idée de ce que tu as commencé
Monte
- Donc dis-moi, que sait ma fille ?
- Je commencerai par ce qu'elle ne sait pas
Que vous faisiez ce que je fais
- Elle est forte, ça ne sera pas facile
- J'aime les challenges
Et bien Jack, Je crois que tu en as un
- Allô
- OK, j'y suis
On en a discuté Tru
Tu sais exactement ce que tu dois faire
- Ok, je suis entrée
- Parfait
Rappelle-toi où tu dois aller
Johnson 201
- Je ne le vois pas
- Tourne à gauche
3ème porte à droite. Calme-toi
C'est ce à quoi tu étais destinée
J'y suis Davis. J'ai réussi
Je ne peux pas y croire
Premier jour à l'école de médecine
- Oui, presque
- Presque ? Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
J'aurais eu du mal à être reçue.
Si tu n'avais pas passé tous ces appels
- Tru, écoute-moi
- Quoi ?
- C'est normal que tu sois fière
- Merci Davis, à plus
- Harrison
- C'est moi
- J'ai des nouvelles intéressantes
- Tu as trouvé Jack ?
Non
- Essaye de faire une phrase sans <i>Jack</i> dedans
- Pardon
Quelqu'un tue mon petit-ami et disparaît pendant 2 mois
Ça devient un peu une obsession
C'est pas faux, mais non
Papa est en ville
- Papa ?
- Tout le monde, asseyez-vous
<i>Il m'a invité a dîner,
il n'a pas dit pourquoi</i>
Je dois vraiment y aller
Je vais être en retard pour cette livraison
Oh, félicite-moi. 6 semaines
avec le même boulot, mon record personnel
Félicitations Harri
- Mlle Davies
- Je dois y aller
Oui, professeur
Mlle Davies,
Ce n'est pas parce que votre ami coroner
a utilisé ses relations pour vous faire entrer ici
que vous aurez un traitement de faveur
par rapport aux véritables élèves
Véritables élèves ?
Je suis une véritable élève
Bien.
Dites-moi quelle artère
se termine à l'artère naso-palatine
C'est l'artère maxillaire
Vous êtes en école de médecine
Vous avez une décision à prendre
Êtes-vous prête à sauver des vies ou non ?
- Oui je suis prête
- Ça nous rassure tous
Maintenant passons aux choses sérieuses
- Tu déménages ici ?
- C'est les affaires
Quand le business va bien,
il ne faut pas hésiter
- Et pour Jordan et les enfants ?
- Je les verrai le week-end
Ce n'est pas l'idéal mais ils comprennent
Donc dis-moi, comment va Tru ?
Je sais combien elle était peinée
après ce qu'il est arrivé à Luc
Elle est forte
Si elle retrouve qui a fait ça,
elle le tuera
Promets-moi une chose
Essaie d'éviter qu'elle ne soit trop obsédée
C'est trop tard
Ok, assez discuté. Je veux te dire pourquoi
je t'ai demandé de venir
Vu que j'ouvre un bureau, j'aurai besoin d'aide
Investigations, recherches, ...
- Quelqu'un comme toi
- Tu m'offres un boulot ?
Tu en dis quoi ?
Tu veux travailler avec ton vieux ?
- Tu as refusé ?
- Je t'ai dit, j'ai déjà un boulot
Ce n'est pas le meilleur, mais c'est le mien
et je l'ai eu tout seul
Toute ma vie, j'ai souhaité
qu'il agisse comme un vrai père
Maintenant que c'est le cas
je n'en ai pas besoin
- Non, non, attends
- Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
- Le fourgon, je l'ai garé ici
- C'est la fourrière ?
Non, j'ai tout fait dans les règles
Du verre brisé. Quelqu'un l'a volé
On me l'a volé, Tru
Ils ont volé...
Mes affaires... C'est pas possible
- Calme-toi
- Me calmer, pour une fois que je réussis un boulot
Tu vois ce qu'il arrive.
Essaye d'avoir une vie honnête et voilà
On va trouver quelque chose, c'est promis
Calme-toi et je te promets
Quoi ?
A l'instant ?
Ok, super, merci
- C'était mon book maker
- Et ta vie honnête ?
- Laisse-moi terminer
Quelqu'un correspondant à la description de
Jack vient de récupérer un gros gain
- Où ?
- 111 Grand Street, mais c'était tout à l'heure
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ? Tru
De rien
- C'était quoi ça Jack ?
- Tru, quelle agréable surprise
Les enfants d'aujourd'hui
Même pas un merci
Donc maintenant tu sauves des vies ?
Un, qui te dit que ce camion l'aurait tué
et deux, pourquoi es-tu si surprise ?
Parce que tu prends les vies
Tu ne les sauves pas
Tu n'écoutes pas très bien Tru
Je préserve le destin
Avant que la journée ne recommence
je ne suis pas si différent de lui ou d'elle
- Ou de toi
- Tu es différent
Parce que je n'ai pas tué le copain de quelqu'un
et disparu pendant 2 mois
Vivre dans le passé peut être
si déprimant, tu ne trouves pas ?
Tu pensais que tuer Luc
m'aurait fait tout arrêter
- Cela m'a rendue encore plus forte
- Tu prêches un converti
Je t'ai vue cet été, toutes ces personnes
censées mourir et que tu as sauvées
C'est vrai, pas un seul échec
pendant que tu faisais quoi exactement ?
- Voyages, détente
- La mort prend des vacances ?
Mais tu sais ce que j'ai fait de plus Tru ?
J'ai espéré. J'ai espéré que
tu reviendrais à la raison
J'ai espéré que tu arrêterais de sauver
des personnes censées mourir
Correction. Elles sont censées vivre
Je te donne un cadeau, la meilleure
excuse de tout arrêter
En fait, tu me donnes toutes les raisons
de continuer
Donc nous voilà
De retour à la case départ
A plus tard Tru
On se verra lors de la répétition
- Je t'attendrai
- Pas si je suis là le premier
Ep.2-01 Perfect Storm
Il est de retour Davis
- De retour pour m'arrêter
- Tu es prête pour ça
Tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter
Tu es prête
C'est toi qui semble inquiet
Je ne suis pas inquiet
Je suis curieux
Pourquoi est-elle surprise de te voir ?
J'ai de plus grosses surprises
en réserve pour elle.
Écoutez, je peux gérer cela
Vous n'avez pas besoin de rester ici
Je connais ma fille, Jack
et tu auras besoin de toute l'aide possible
J'ai des personnes pour m'aider
Toi, Harrison
Mais c'est ma vocation, la mission que
l'on m'a confiée. Je peux le battre
Tu es prêt ?
Parce que je suis certain qu'elle l'est
Vous êtes fière d'elle
C'est mignon
Mais je lui ai donné la possibilité d'arrêter
et elle n'en a pas voulu
Donc je l'arrêterai moi-même
La confiance. Comme moi
quand je faisais ce boulot
Sauf que j'ai gagné
Avant que sa journée ne commence
Suis-la.
Je dois aller à l'étage. Je suis en retard
pour mon évaluation psychologique
C'est vrai. La médecine du travail
Bonne chance Davis
C'est une simple formalité. Tom Jordan et moi
sommes de vieux amis.
- Ok Tom, on fait ça vite
- Vite ?
- Je viens voir Tom Jordan
- Il s'est retiré pour raisons médicales
Je ne le savais pas malade
Désolée. Je suis Dr Carrie Allen
Sa remplaçante
- Et vous devez être ...
- Je suis Davis
Davis, par ici
- Vous avez 2h de retard Dr Davis
- C'est juste Davis
- Je pensais que vous ne viendriez plus
- Non, j'aime les tests psychologiques
Les taches d'encres
Dites que je suis dingue
Vous êtes probablement nerveux
mais ce qui est génial avec mon test
- Il n'y a pas vraiment de réponse
- ok
Tout ce que je vous demande
C'est de regarder cette image
Et dites-moi la première chose
qui vous traverse l'esprit
- Pas vraiment de réponse
- Pas vraiment de réponse
C'est Atlantis, le continent perdu.
Et le chien que je n'ai jamais eu
étant enfant
Oui je pense qu'il devrait accepter ton offre papa
Mais tu connais Harri
- Il veut faire les choses par lui-même
- Du nouveau
Je dois y aller
Je t'appelle plus tard
Mon père s'établit subitement en ville
- Oh non, une policière
- Un officier de la patrouille portuaire
Elle est morte lors d'un sauvetage
Kate Wilson. Elle a répondu
à un SOS à 15h07
Un étudiant a perdu le contrôle d'un bateau
Le Green Hornet
La routine
- Sauf concernant la rafale blanche
- La rafale blanche ?
Une tempête qui arrive sans prévenir
Et bang, tu es en plein milieu
Elle est tombée par dessus bord
- Et son partenaire ?
- Trop de vagues, il n'a rien pu faire
Un miracle qu'il soit toujours en vie
Ah, c'est pour moi
Le devoir m'appelle
Elle est à toi, Tru. À plus
À plus tard
A perdu conscience à cause de l'hypothermie
De l'eau dans les poumons évidemment
- Tu n'as plus besoin de moi maintenant
- Ouais, un jour peut-être
Non je suis sérieux. C'est bien de savoir
que si quelque chose m'arrive
- Tu pourras tout gérer toute seule
- C'est à propos de Jack ?
Ça ne concerne pas Jack
Il s'agit de Carrie
- Carrie ?
- Dr Allen, la remplaçante de Tom Jordan
Mes tests ne se sont pas bien passés
et elle demande une étude approfondie
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
- Peut-être rien du tout
- Ou ?
Ou ça veut dire que je suis cinglé
cliniquement parlant
Et si les tests le prouvent
Je ne serai plus là pour t'aider
Non, ce n'est pas possible
C'est très sérieux
D'abord je me fais humilier à l'école
Puis Jack réapparaît
Et maintenant ça
C'est quoi la suite ?
Sauve-moi
C'est reparti
- Davis, c'est moi
- Pourquoi tu m'appelles maintenant ?
- Tu as cours dans 3 heures
- Je sais, c'est l'une de ces journées
- Ok, qui est la chanceuse victime ?
- Kate Wilson, de la patrouille du port
Elle est morte dans une tempête blanche
On n'entend pas ça tous les jours
Tu as besoin d'une adresse ?
Non je l'ai déjà
J'ai fait mes recherches Davis
- Elle doit arriver dans un instant
- En quoi je peux t'aider ?
Tu peux m'écouter attentivement
parce que tu as manqué une grosse journée hier
Jack est revenu, mon père emménage en ville
Et tu as raté ton test psychologique
- Quoi, ce n'est pas le genre de Tom Jordan
- Non, mais celui de sa remplaçante, le Dr Carrie Allen
Quoi, une femme ?
Je l'ai trouvée attirante ?
Parce que ça pourrait tout expliquer
Je dois y aller Davis
Question stupide. Bien sûr
que je l'ai trouvée attirante
- Officier Wilson ?
- Oui
Bonjour, je suis Tru Davies
J'aimerais rejoindre la patrouille du port
- Et on m'a dit de m'adresser à vous
- Et qui vous a dit ça ?
Tout le monde, en fait
Vous avez beaucoup de fans
Ça fait plaisir
J'aimerais beaucoup discuter avec vous
et parler de l'examen peut-être
- Kate, on doit y aller
- Je suis en retard pour ma patrouille
Mais je fais une pause déjeuner à 13h
On pourra prendre un café et je vous dirai tout
Super, merci
Je vous retrouve à 13h
- Allô
- Salut Harry c'est moi
- C'est bizarre, j'allais justement t'appeler
- Je sais, c'est pourquoi je t'ai appelé la première
Ok, j'ai compris, une de tes journées
Ok, qu'est-ce que je dois savoir ?
Essaye d'être surpris
quand papa te proposera un job
Un job, vraiment ?
Est-ce que je l'ai accepté ?
Non, tu as refusé
Il l'a plutôt mal pris
C'est vrai Tru
parce qu'ils m'adorent dans mon boulot
Peut-être pas pour longtemps
- Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
- Ton fourgon a été volé pendant que tu déjeunais
Je n'ai pas pu t'avertir à temps
Mon conseil est de le garer ailleurs
Ok, je vais le déplacer
- Mlle Davies, merci de nous rejoindre
- Oui je suis désolée
Mlle Davies
Ce n'est pas parce que votre ami coroner
a utilisé ses relations pour vous faire entrer ici
que vous aurez un traitement de faveur
par rapport aux véritables élèves
Véritables élèves ?
Je suis une véritable élève
Dites-moi quelle artère se termine
à l'artère naso-palatine ?
Ça doit être l'artère maxillaire
Bien entendu ces artères
passent d'abord derrière l'os sphénoïde
J'ai bon ?
Oui, c'est juste
C'est entièrement juste
Il n'y a rien à faire ici
On rentre ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
- Attends quelques secondes
Vas-y
- Allez
- J'y vais
Allez
Allez Kate
Vous m'avez sauvé la vie
Je ne sais pas ce qu'il s'est passé.
Tout allait bien, et puis...
Tout va bien maintenant.
C'est fini
- Vous avez eu de la chance.
- Je n'en doute pas
Merci
...quand on croit maîtriser la situation
Au moins on ne s'ennuie pas avec moi
Faites-voir
Ça a dû arriver quand vous avez chaviré.
Asseyez-vous
Heureusement que vous étiez là
Je me souviens juste
d'être monté dans le kayak
Vous naviguez rarement,
je me trompe ?
Ca se voit tant que ça ?
En fait, ma soeur vient faire escale ici ce soir
Et quand elle arrive au port,
on fait toujours la course
Je voulais m'entraîner un peu
avant qu'elle n'arrive
Je crois que l'âge commence
à se faire sentir sur mes performances
Je ne me suis pas présenté
- Je suis Jack Harper
- Kate Wilson
Vous devriez laisser gagner
votre soeur la prochaine fois
Grâce à vous, il y aura une prochaine fois
Officier Wilson !
Oui, Mr Harper ?
Je voulais vous dire.
Ça peut paraître étrange,
mais vous n'êtes pas la première
à m'avoir sauvé la vie
Je ne vous ai pas sauvé la vie
C'était un chirurgien en Californie.
Il m'a retiré une balle du cou
et suturé quelques artères pour me sauver.
Désolée
Le temps que je sorte du coma,
il a été transféré dans un autre hôpital.
Et je n'ai jamais pu le remercier,
comme je l'aurais souhaité.
Alors je me suis juré
que si cela se reproduisait
Je ne manquerais pas d'exprimer ma gratitude.
Votre kayak a chaviré,
vous auriez pu vous en sortir seul.
Laissez-moi vous inviter à déjeuner.
Un déjeuner ?
Laissez-moi finir de ranger mes affaires.
J'arrive dans un instant.
J'attendrai le temps qu'il faudra.
Kate
Salut, Tru
- Vous prenez ce café avec moi ?
- Mince, je suis désolée
Je viens d'accepter un déjeuner
avec Mr Harper
- L'officier Wilson vient de me sauver la vie.
- Quel dommage.
Tru voudrait s'intéresser au métier de garde-côte
- Vous voulez devenir garde-côte ?
- Non
J'attends de voir ce que fait la concurrence
Je vois.
Vous n'aimez pas trop la compétition.
Sans plus.
Pas de quoi en faire un fromage.
Tru, si on remettait ça à une autre fois ?
La semaine prochaine ?
- Non, on ne peut pas
- On ne peut pas ?
Je ne veux pas abuser,
mais je passe l'exam la semaine prochaine.
- On discutera, mais pas cette fois-ci
- Kate, c'est plus compliqué...
Si cette fille vous dérange,
je peux appeler...
Non, merci. Ça ira.
Je ne sais pas quel est votre problème,
mais je vous suggère de trouver
quelqu'un d'autre pour vous aider
Je vais me changer,
à tout de suite.
Faire le coup de la fille passionnée.
Un classique
- Dommage que ça n'ait pas marché
- Dommage que tu ne te sois pas noyé
Tout ça me manque, tu sais
Tu es si drôle quand tu échoues.
Tu n'as rien gagné, je te signale
En effet, mais dans mon boulot
je ne modifie pas le cours des choses.
Je dois juste t'empêcher de le faire.
Et pour l'instant,
Kate est sur le bon chemin
Tu es fier de toi ?
Oui, plutôt
C'était sympa de discuter,
mais j'ai un déjeuner
Et ne t'inquiète pas
pour le dernier repas de Kate.
Il sera mémorable.
Il ne faut pas mourir l'estomac vide.
Il n'y a aucune raison
pour que tu perdes cette fois.
Il nous reste 2 heures
Kate est morte après
avoir répondu à un S.O.S hier à 15h07
Pour l'instant je n'ai rien pu faire.
- Que va faire Jack ?
- Probablement la séduire,
Il l'a invitée à déjeuner.
Il est vraiment vicieux
C'est déjà dur de prévenir les gens,
si en plus il faut s'occuper de Jack.
Si tu ne peux pas empêcher Kate d'intervenir,
il faut essayer d'empêcher qu'il y ait un S.O.S
Exact. Il n'y aura pas de S.O.S
si tout est sous contrôle
Un étudiant a perdu le contrôle d'un bateau,
<i>le Green Hornet</i>
Merci Davis.
J'ai encore besoin d'un service
Je t'écoute.
- Essaye de bloquer le bateau de Kate au port
- Bloquer un bateau de police ?
On doit assurer nos arrières à cause de Jack
Comment veux-tu
que je bloque un bateau de police ?
Tu va trouver, je le sais.
Et dire qu'elle va croire
que je suis un malade mental
Belle machine
Coque en fibre de verre
et motorisation Evenrud
C'est à mon père
Pour se consoler de ne pas
avoir eu le fils qu'il voulait
Je peux vous aider ?
C'est moi qui voudrais vous aider.
Je suis bénévole chez les garde-côtes
Et nous avons eu une alerte de tempête
pour cet après-midi.
Tous les bateaux de loisirs
sont consignés à quai
Vous plaisantez ?
J'aimerais.
Mais on m'a donné le mauvais rôle aujourd'hui
Non, pas à ce sujet...
J'ai cru qu'il était débile
Comment ça ?
Vous êtes Tru, non ?
Oui
Un gars est venu ce matin
me dire que vous pourriez passer
Il m'a demandé de vous donner ça
Un gars ?
Il a dit que vous voudriez
m'empêcher de naviguer.
<i>Je suis déjà passé par là. Jack</i>
Il m'a parlé d'une tempête
Je l'ai pris pour un dingue
Il faut me croire.
Vous courez un danger
Avec tous ces dingues sur le port.
La baie me semble bien plus sûre
Harrison, j'écoute
Volé ? Quoi ?
C'est pas possible !
Comment bloquer un bateau de police.
Allô, ici Edmil Mac Nulty
de la Marine Fédérale
Durant ma tournée sur le port ce matin,
j'ai remarqué qu'un de vos bateaux...
Je peux vous aider ?
Oui, je suis le Docteur Allen
La remplaçante de Tom Jordan
Mon dieu,
mon évaluation psychiatrique
Pouvez-vous patienter un instant ?
Je vous attendais depuis 30 minutes,
alors je suis descendue voir ce qu'il se passait
Et maintenant je sais
Vous faites des blagues téléphoniques
- Ce n'est pas ce que vous croyez
- Vraiment ?
Expliquez-moi alors, Edmil.
Vous allez rire...
Ou peut-être pas
La bonne nouvelle, docteur,
c'est que cette évaluation
n'a plus lieu d'être
Car j'ai déjà de quoi tirer un bilan.
Oui, je suis là
- Merci pour le repas
- Merci encore de m'avoir sauvé la vie
Je vais peut-être un peu vite,
mais je suis libre ce soir
Et il y a un festival en ville
qui serait très amusant à faire.
Oups, vous avez déjà une copine
qui n'apprécierait pas ça ?
C'est vrai, j'ai une copine
C'est ma soeur, elle arrive ce soir.
On a prévu pas mal de choses
Je me doute
En plus ça ne me regarde pas
Mais je suis disponible demain
Très bien
Moi aussi
Kate !
On y va !

Ça serait dommage
- Alors à demain
- À demain
Salut Kate
- Tru, on n'est pas là pour s'amuser
- Écoutez-moi
Vous êtes en danger si vous partez
Ça vous dérange peut-être mais,
mon métier c'est de sauver des gens
- Comme Jack Harper ?
- Exactement
- Les apparences sont trompeuses
- Vous pensez que je ne l'ai pas sauvé ?
Je dis juste que tout est possible
La météo change très vite
et vous le savez bien
- Et ?
- Une tempête peut se déclencher
- Une rafale blanche
- Une rafale blanche ?
Vous regardez trop de films
La météo est calme,
et nous n'avons eu aucun appel ce matin.
Parti à 15h07
<i>S.O.S, ici le Green Hornet</i>
<i>Nous sommes juste à côté de la plate-forme</i>
Ici garde-côte. Bien reçu
Nous arrivons.
Kate, attendez !
- Tout ira bien.
- Non, laissez-moi vous accompagner
C'est une blague ?
Allez on y va !
Je sais ce que c'est de vouloir sauver des gens,
mais on ne peut pas sauver tout le monde
Peut-être vous, mais pas moi
Ici la patrouille portuaire, donnez votre position
<i>Juste après la première plate-forme,
Faites vite...</i>
<i>Green Hornet, répondez !</i>
Mon dieu
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Elle avait raison
On ne peut pas y aller
On n'en sortirait pas vivants
Il le faut,
ils nous attendent
- Il le faut
- <i>Ici la garde-côtière.</i>
<i>Où en êtes-vous ?
Le temps presse</i>
Nous ne pouvons pas intervenir.
Il nous faut du renfort
<i>C'est en route,
la Marine Fédérale nous file un coup de main</i>
<i>Je ne savais même pas
qu'on avait une Marine Fédérale</i>
On se tire
Vous allez bien
La garde-côte à pris le relais
Ils ont été avertis
Bien joué, Davis
Je n'ai pas vraiment compris
ce que vous faisiez
Mais je devine que
vous n'avez plus de raison de me traquer
En effet
Qui a dit que je ne pouvais pas
sauver tout le monde ?
Bien joué avec la garde-côte
- Je pensais que ce n'était pas leur secteur
- J'ai été très convaincant
- Quelle heure est-il ?
- 16h15
- Quoi ?
- Tu as sauvé Kate, tout va bien
Les règles ont changé.
Jack est de retour
Rien n'est acquis
tant que je ne m'en suis pas assurée.
Il doit être ici
Il a sauvé une petite fille hier
à 16h16 précises
S'il veut vraiment préserver
le cours des choses, il doit la sauver
C'est vrai,
j'oubliais le bon samaritain qu'il est
Espérons qu'il soit
aussi efficace qu'il le prétend
Elle est là.
Où est ton skate ?
Un mec me l'a acheté 50$
Désolé de vous embêter encore
Je n'ai pas pu attendre
- C'est le déluge dehors
- Vous ne deviez pas sortir ce soir ?
Si, mais ma soeur a appelé
Elle a du retard donc je suis disponible
Moi aussi
J'ai demandé à un gars cet après-midi
et il a dit non
Quel taré ferait ça ?
Je dois terminer dans 10 minutes
Si vous pouvez patienter jusque là
- Pas de problème
- Ok
- SOS, SOS, nous avons un problème
- Excusez-moi
Ici la patrouille du port, indiquez votre position
et la nature de votre problème
- Le bateau est dans la tempête
- Indiquez votre position
- Il est au nord de la baie
- Le bateau a été identifié ?
Non, attendez, il s'appelle <i>le Jezabel</i>
C'est le bateau de ma soeur. Je viens de lui
parler Elle disait que tout allait bien
Il y a une fille
elle est tombée par dessus bord
On arrive
- Kate
- C'est mon boulot Jack
- Patrouille du port
- Je me doutais que tu allais répondre
- Je me doutais que tu allais appeler
- Qu'as-tu dit pour qu'elle retourne là-bas ?
- Elle est en train de sauver ma soeur
- Ta soeur est morte
Kate Wilson était censée mourir cet après-midi
Jack, et je l'ai sauvée
Oui c'est effectivement le cas
Mais la journée n'est pas encore terminée
Et ma fenêtre d'opportunités
est toujours ouverte
Et chanceux comme je suis...
cette tempête ne fait qu'empirer
Kate aide des gens Jack
Elle sauve des vies
Les bonnes personnes doivent aussi mourir Tru
Tu sais cela autant que moi
Tu dis que tu n'es pas un meurtrier
Mais comment qualifies-tu ce que tu fais ?
Mon boulot
A plus tard, Tru
- Ce n'est pas le bon moment, Harry
- Tu ne croiras pas ce qu'il est arrivé
- Ils ont encore volé le fourgon ?
- Non ce n'est pas le problème
Mes patrons sont un peu louches
Ils ont volé leur propre fourgon
afin de toucher l'assurance
Et j'ai tout fait foirer
en me garant dans un parking sécurisé
Je croyais enfin travailler honnêtement
Mais ce n'était pas le cas
Désolée Harry, je t'appelle plus tard
Ne vous inquiétez pas, tout ira bien
Je sais ce que je fais
Je suis désolée
J'y ai pensé toute la journée
- Kate ?
- Oui
On dînera une autre fois
- Ouais ?
- Tout a fonctionné ?
J'ai presque cru que vous étiez sur ce bateau
Richard. Je suis impressionné
La prochaine fois
Fais-le toi-même
11, c'est la patrouille du port
11, c'est la patrouille du port, merde
Kate
Kate tenez bon
J'arrive
Je vous tiens
Tenez bon, je vous tiens
Allez Kate, tout va bien
- Tout va bien maintenant
- Merci
Docteur
Je montais m'excuser.
Je suis désolé de ce qu'il s'est passé...
Ah bon ?
Je descendais justement vous rassurer
- J'ai parcouru votre dossier cet après-midi.
- Oulala, mon dossier
Et vous savez ce que j'y ai trouvé ?
Des commentaires élogieux allant
du maire au commandant de la police locale.
Dans mon dossier ?
Donc, si vous avez des lubies bizarres,
faites comme bon vous semble
Il faut être un peu fou pour travailler ici
L'évaluation peut bien attendre
Oui
Et je ne crois pas
que nous ayons été présentés.
Enchantée.
Je suis le docteur Carrie Allen
Moi c'est Davis.
Ravi de vous rencontrer
Je suis si content que tu aies changé d'avis
- Ça va être super de travailler ensemble
- Oui
Ça sera super de travailler honnêtement
Écoute
C'est peut-être l'occasion
de rattraper le temps perdu
Pour mes erreurs
On a beaucoup à apprendre
l'un de l'autre
- Oui
- De nos expériences passées
Quoi ?
Ça en étonnerait beaucoup
de nous savoir si semblables finalement
Un autre ?
Non, j'y vais
Je dois être frais et dispo
pour mon nouveau patron
On se voit demain
- Tu as été trop tendre aujourd'hui
- Merci, coach
Ne le prends pas mal.
Je t'avais dit qu'elle est douée
Y'en a au moins un
qui a gagné aujourd'hui
- Harrison
- Il signera demain
- Dans les temps ?
- Oui
Il vient de me rendre fier.
Il faut en garder un peu pour plus tard
C'est un bon garçon.
Un bon atout
Mais il aime sa soeur
et ce lien est fort
Autant que celui d'un père pour son fils
Repose-toi, Jack
Tu en a bien besoin
J'avais entendu quelqu'un rentrer
Je l'ai eu, Davis
J'ai battu Jack
Kate est sauvée,
le destin à repris son cours
mais je ne me sens pas soulagée
Parce que tu n'as pas sauvé Luc
Ça marche comme ça ?
Des étrangers sauvés
contre des proches qui meurent
Ça va, c'est juste un relent...
d'humanité ?
Bref, il est tard,
je vais rentrer
- Bonne nuit, Davis
- Bonne nuit
Au fait
Qu'a dit Jack quand il a su qu'il perdait ?
J'en sais rien,
mais j'aimerais bien savoir
<i>J'ai gagné. Je l'ai sauvée.

Chaque cadavre raconte une histoire.
Occupez-vous en soigneusement,
et il vous délivrera ses secrets.
Je veux un groupe de 4
sur chaque cadavre.
Excuse-moi
Est-ce toi qui a scotché le Pr Sidel l'autre fois
en répondant à sa colle ?
- Je ne sais pas si je l'ai scotché
- C'est elle les gars
C'est toi qu'on veut
Il nous faut un 4ème
pour les TD de labo
- Et vous voulez que ce soit moi ?
- Absolument
Scier le prof comme ça,
c'était génial
Tu es apparemment brillante et ton statut
n'affectera pas notre notation
Tyler pense que tu es la femme qu'il nous faut
- Jensen
- Tru
Son duodénum est en sale état
Tu dois entendre ça tous les jours
C'est gentil. Pardon,
Je travaille de nuit
Je manque de sommeil
On doit vite finir en taule
quand on charcute 6 cadavres
- C'est quoi ce sac ?
- C'est un cadeau pour Lexy
Jensen s'est enfin sorti de ses bouquins
pour trouver une copine
Nous en sommes ravis
- Essence de roses
- Oui, Essence de roses
Mais que fais-tu ?
Je ne pouvais pas le mettre
Et s'il ne me plaît pas ?
Je ne veux pas que tu le sentes,
mais plutôt que tu me dises
si c'est un cadeau approprié ou pas.
Je ne sais pas, ça dépend.
Merci du conseil
Mr Lee, ce n'est pas comme cela
que l'on manipule une vésicule biliaire
Le parfum de Lexy
Désolé
C'est mieux que de sentir le formol
C'est quoi cette odeur ?
Quoi ?
Ça sent la rose...
- et le formol
- Et cet appareil c'est pour quoi ?
Rien, juste mon premier travail
pour le cabinet de papa
Ça va chauffer
Deux gars se sont battus
sur un parcours de golf
L'un d'eux veut attaquer l'autre
pour C et B
- C et B ?
- Coups et blessures
Il prétend être trop amoché
pour sortir de chez lui
Mais je sais qu'il est
fan de Hockey sur glace
Et il a des tickets
pour le match de ce soir
Et tu seras là pour immortaliser
sa soirée au match
Quand papa aura les photos,
il va m'adorer
Je suis contente.
Je sais ce que ça représente pour toi
C'est génial
Qu'on soit tous réconciliés
On est peut-être trop durs avec lui
Peut-être
- Salut, je peut m'asseoir ?
- Dr Allen, je vous en prie
Restez assis
Mince
- J'ai oublié le sucre
- Prenez le mien
Zut
Un problème ?
Ce n'est rien,
juste un fil de polyester
Vous avez eu le memo
sur l'alarme à incendie ?
Non
J'aimerais faire venir quelqu'un demain
Parfois elle se déclenche seule,
soit quand on est
aux toilettes, soit quand on a
les mains dans les viscères
- Bon, je vais rentrer
- Très bien
- Au revoir
- Au revoir
Merci
Je suis maudit
Je suis sûre que ce n'était pas si grave
Le destin a voulu que je sois capable
d'analyser 60 sortes de blessures par balle,
mais archi nul en conversation
Je croyais que tu n'aimais pas ça
- Je déteste ce genre de conversation
- C'est quoi qui te chagrine alors ?
Ça veut dire quoi ce <i>Ahh</i> ?
Juste un <i>Ahh</i>, rien de plus.
- Harry
- <i>C'est moi !</i>
- J'ai les photos
- Bravo
Oui, ça valait le coup
- Mais je me suis pris une droite
- Aïe
Vivement que je les montre à papa
C'est super pour toi.
Je te rappelle plus tard
Au sujet du <i>Ahh</i>
Il faut que vous discutiez encore.
Trouve un sujet intéressant pour vous 2
Mes centres d'intérêt
sont bien loin du genre humain
Thomas Burrell, diplômé de médecine
- On dirait un mémo pour lui-même
- Une liste pour le supermarché ?
Il y a écrit <i>Varden</i>,
et une flèche qui pointe sur <i>DSM3</i>
Ça doit être un psychiatre
Comment tu le sais ?
- En fait...
-<i>S'il vous plaît</i>
Aidez-moi !
Mr Lee. Ce n'est pas comme cela
qu'on manipule une vésicule biliaire
Vraiment désolée
Mlle davies. Je vous prierai
de ne plus apporter vos parfums au labo
Je vais lui dire que c'était à moi
C'est pas grave.
Je dois filer
Je trouve que Tru est un peu versatile
Ep.2-02  Grace
- Bonjour
- Bonjour
- Il est là ?
- Oui, allez-y
La journée a recommencé
Rebelote.
Quelles sont les causes du décès ?
Pendant le marché de Forestreet,
il a reçu une balle dans le dos
J'espère que ton plan est bon
parce que ma fille a fait un parcours
sans faute depuis la mort de Luc.
Qui était en plus une de tes idées
Je te l'ai dit.
C'était pour lui donner une leçon
Elle ne l'a pas perçu comme ça
- Je ne laisserai pas Jack prendre le dessus.
- Tu t'en es bien sorti la dernière fois
Justement, c'est l'occasion
de passer la vitesse supérieure
De ne pas reproduire tes erreurs avec sa mère
- Mon mariage ?
- Non, la tuer était une erreur
On sait que ça ne fait
que déplacer le problème
Il faut rendre Tru inoffensive
Et j'ai une idée pour faire ça
Qui est la victime ?
Docteur Thomas Burrelll.
Ça doit être un psychiatre
Son cabinet est au
87, 3rd Street
J'y vais, je le croiserai peut-être
avant qu'il n'aille au marché
Désolé, mais je me suis permis
car votre secrétaire n'était pas là
Elle va revenir d'ici un instant
Je peux vous aider ?
Je l'espère
J'ai connu pas mal de revirements
dans ma vie ces derniers temps
et j'aurais souhaité en parler
Pouvez-vous préciser Mr..?
Paul Goodwen
Dr Burrelll
Pourquoi souhaitez-vous une thérapie ?
En fait,
j'ai un métier très stressant
et je voudrais mieux gérer ce stress
Que faites-vous exactement ?
Je suis en quelque sorte
un redresseur de torts
Certains trichent, manipulent
Quand cela arrive,
j'interviens pour remettre de l'ordre
Je vois les raisons du stress.
Vous devez subir pas mal d'agressivité
En effet, ils ne comprennent pas
que je n'ai rien contre eux
Je ne fais qu'appliquer la loi
C'est mon métier
- Mardi 17h ça vous va ?
- Très bien
Excusez-moi, je reviens
<i>Dr Burrell, je vous écoute</i>
Il faut que j'y aille.
À mardi, 17h, c'est ça ?
Oui
J'ai oublié de vous dire.
Mon ex est assez jalouse
Elle a embêté mon ancien psy
en le questionnant,
prétextant que j'étais dangereux
Elle veux s'immiscer dans ma vie privée
Ne vous inquiétez pas, le secret médical
est pour moi une règle d'or
- Je m'en doutais. Merci Docteur
- À mardi
Dr Burrell !
Dommage !
Le Docteur vient de partir
Comment étais-tu au courant
de tout ça avant moi ?
- <i>Apple</i> donne t-il ses secrets à <i>Microsoft</i> ?
- On n'est pas dans le business
Il s'agit de vies humaines
Notre business c'est la vie des gens
Bien essayé, mais je ne vais pas
perdre mon temps à discuter avec toi
- J'ai du pain sur la planche
- J'adore ton parfum
À plus
Dr Burrell
Oui ?
Je dois vous parler c'est urgent.
Voulez-vous me suivre ?
Où ça ?
Je vous dirai ça plus tard.
Accordez-moi un instant
Si vous voulez parlez,
prenez rendez-vous à mon cabinet
Il faut faire vite
Dr Burrell !
Police !
Mon dieu !
Elle a tué cet homme
Non
Mains en l'air
Vous êtes en état d'arrestation
Je suis innocente,
il a été touché dans le dos
Ils se sont engueulés,
elle a tiré quand il s'est retourné
- En effet
- Je lui parlais
- <i>Quel est votre nom madame ?
- Pam Olsen</i>
Tru, t'as un problème ?
C'est toi qui est supposée être responsable
Des menottes ?
Et voilà
C'est monnaie courante
Si ça t'arrive encore,
un couteau suisse suffira
J'ai pas ça sur moi
- Un truc pointu fera l'affaire.
- Ça t'es arrivé souvent ?
Finalement, je ne préfère pas savoir.
C'est quoi cette odeur ?
J'ai des problèmes.
Ça a mal tourné
- Il faut que je voies le corps.
- Je te le déconseille
Il y a la police ?
On peut dire ça
Dommage qu'on ne puisse
se voir aujourd'hui
Je suis arrivée trop tard,
Jack était déjà là.
Il m'a piégée.
Tout est allé si vite
J'assistais à son faux témoignage
quand j'ai pu m'enfuir
Il y a peut-être un moyen
de s'en sortir légalement
Tu veux que je me rende ?
Non
Je crois qu'il veut
que j'en parle à papa
C'est une bonne idée
Papa est avocat
d'affaires criminelles
Message reçu, je dois filer.
Je te rappelle.
Qui était-ce ?
C'est mon plombier.
Il devait venir réparer ma salle de bain
- aujourd'hui mais...
- Il n'est pas venu
- Papa, on a un truc à te dire
- Je sais, la police est venue
Viens t'asseoir
Il faut que tu me dises tout
- Tu peux attendre dehors STP ?
- Non, ça ira
Harrison, s'il te plaît
D'accord
Papa, on m'a piégée.
Je ne l'ai pas tué
La police enquête déjà sur toi.
Ils ont trouvé ton nom
sur son carnet de rendez-vous,
donc ils savent
que tu étais sa patiente
C'est faux
Ils ont aussi trouvé
ton dossier dans son cabinet
Je ne l'avais jamais vu auparavant
Plusieurs témoins affirment
avoir vu une querelle entre vous.
De quoi s'agissait-il ?
Je n'avais pas d'arme quand j'ai été arrêtée.
Ça ne me disculpe pas ?
La plupart des procès sont jugés
sans retrouver l'arme du crime
Vu le monde qu'il y avait sur place,
n'importe qui aurait pu la récupérer.
La police ne retiendra pas
cet argument car ils ont un témoin.
Et bien ce témoin est celui qui m'a piégée.
Il s'appelle Jack Harper.
Il cherche à me nuire.
Pourquoi ferait-il ça ?
Parce qu'on a déjà été confrontés.
C'est compliqué
Pourquoi as-tu fait sortir Harrison ?
Parce que je pensais
que tu avais des aveux à faire.
Qu'il valait mieux qu'il n'entende pas.
Je dois y aller
Tru
- Il croit que je suis coupable
- Mais non, il a dû mal interpréter
Il croit que je l'ai tué.
Il s'est fait son idée
bien avant de m'écouter
Quelle idiote !
Tout ça parce que c'est mon père.
Me voilà seule.
Tu n'es pas seule.
Je suis là
Je ne suis pas avocat
mais je connais un gars.
Il pourrait nous faire des faux papiers.
On irait au Mexique, en Thaïlande...
Je suis sérieux.
Je trouverai un boulot.
Tu pourrais ouvrir une morgue
Il y a des morts partout, pas vrai ?
Je ne pense pas que ça marcherait
mais merci quand même.
Allez, on y va.
- Bien joué.
- C'est une méthode humaniste
En prison pendant 50 ans
on ne peut pas sauver grand monde.
Juste quelques malfrats.
Savais-tu que la guillotine
à été inventée par un physicien ?
Par le Docteur Guillotin.
Il pensait lui aussi que c'était humaniste
C'était pas faux
- Tu peux parler ?
- Oui, ça va ?
D'habitude quand ça se passe mal,
la journée recommence. Là c'est déjà le cas
Le corps de Burrell
est ici depuis 30 minutes
Il y a un papier dans sa poche
Il y est écrit <i>Varden</i> et <i>DSM3</i>
Hier, cela t'as permis de savoir
qu'il était psychiatre
- Comment as-tu fait ?
- Probablement <i>DSM3</i>
C'est un manuel de diagnostics
des désordres psychiatriques.
C'est un genre de bible pour les psys.
C'est bizarre car la version 3
est périmée depuis 10 ans
Ça t'aide un peu ?
J'aimerais dire oui
- J'ai bien une idée.
- Je t'écoute
Si tu pouvais t'approcher de Burrell,
il pourrait te demander de l'aide à nouveau
ce qui ferait recommencer la journée.
C'est risqué mais peut-être
notre seule chance
Le problème c'est que la police
est toujours ici
Si je ne peux pas venir,
apporte-moi le corps
Je trouve ça un peu voyant
d'exhiber un cadavre en public
Il y a un endroit tranquille au campus
Le labo d'anatomie sera certainement vide.
On se retrouve là-bas.
Tu disais que l'idée de la Thaïlande
était fantasque.
Je peux me débrouiller seule
mais ils vont chercher ma voiture
- Tu me prêtes la tienne ?
- Je conduis.
Tu fais des câlins avec notre sujet de TD ?
Je revoyais le cours de ce matin,
et toi ?
- Pareil.
- Rejoins-nous
Tu ne préférerais pas faire une pause-café ?
- Tu veux boire un café avec moi ?
- Non, je suis étonnée
Tu es un des rares
que je ne pensais pas voir ici
Tu es brillant,
Entré ici plus jeune que la moyenne
Tu es un crack en chimie.
Les profs t'admirent.
Donc, tu peux faire une pause.
Ils t'ont dit tout ça sur moi
ce matin ?
Peut-être
L'avis des profs m'importe peu
- Tu connais la clinique Bedendorf ?
- C'est l'une des plus réputées
Mon père a été leur premier prodige
Certains disent qu'il est
le meilleur diagnosticien du pays.
- Pas facile de lui succéder.
- Je sais
S'il fallait le comparer à un être humain,
Martha Stewart serait la plus proche
Et moi j'essaye de suivre ses pas
Je comprends
Je n'arriverai jamais
à rattraper mon père
C'est pourquoi tu devrais sortir d'ici.
Tu ne peux pas impressionner ton père
J'ai des ennuis.
Pas le temps d'expliquer, mais crois-moi.
- Ne dis à personne que je suis ici.
- Que fais-tu ?
Tu as quelque chose à me dire ?
Je suis l'inspecteur Gomez
Pouvez-vous m'aider ?
Je recherche Tru Davies
Tru a cours dans cette classe, je crois ?
Oui, le matin.
Mais le cours est fini.
Donc vous la connaissez ?
Oui, elle est étudiante en médecine.
On est en classe d'anatomie ensemble.
Que pouvez-vous me dire d'autre ?
Je peux savoir ce que vous lui voulez ?
Elle est partie prenante
dans une affaire de meurtre
Comme témoin, alors
On voudrait juste lui parler
Quelle est cette odeur ?
C'est du parfum. J'ai cassé le flacon
que j'avais acheté pour ma copine
- Vous le trouvez comment ?
- Je le trouve un peu fort
- Excusez-moi
- Je peux vous aider ?
On peut vérifier ?
Attendez ici
Gomez
Il a fait ça ?
Non je veux l'interroger moi-même
Assurez-vous qu'il ne parte pas
Je dois y aller
Voici ma carte. Vous pouvez me joindre
quand vous le souhaitez
Vous avez quelque chose
à me dire ?
Si c'est le cas
je vous appellerai
Tru, que se passe-t'il ?
Merci
Merci vraiment
Tu as fait ce qu'il fallait
J'espère pouvoir tout t'expliquer un jour
ou alors je n'aurai pas à le faire
Tru, qu'est-ce que....
Merci officier
- Monsieur Davis
- C'est juste Davis en fait
On va avoir une petite discussion
Tru, tu dois retourner à la voiture
Les flics te cherchent
- Tu ne dois pas traîner dans les parages
- Où est Davis ?
Il n'a pas amené le corps
Il ne répond pas au téléphone
Je peux ?
Tru Davies
- Davis, qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
- C'est le détective Gomez, Mlle Davies
Devinez quoi ? Votre numéro était dans la mémoire
du téléphone de votre patron
Vous devriez penser à vous rendre.
Vous êtes une femme intelligente.
Vous ne faites qu'aggraver votre situation
- Et celle de vos amis
- Triangulation en cours
- Je n'ai pas tué cet homme
- Raccroche
C'était un homme bon.
Je devais le rencontrer aujourd'hui
car il m'avait parlé de vous
- Quoi ?
- Il voulait me parler d'un de ses patients
- Je n'étais pas une des ses patientes
- Tru, ils peuvent retracer l'appel
- Le champ de localisation est encore large
- Votre nom était dans son agenda
Et vous voulez me faire croire
que vous ne le connaissiez pas ?
Arrangez votre cas et rendez-vous.
Laissez votre avocat agir
Donne-moi ça. Prends celui-là
J'ai un téléphone dans la voiture
- Tu vas faire quoi avec le mien ?
- Je vais partir loin d'ici
Je vais passer un appel
et le jeter à l'arrière d'un 4X4
Disparaître, c'est le seul truc
que je sais bien faire
Et toi ?
Davis s'est fait attraper
Il n'y aura pas de retour en arrière
Tout ce que j'ai, c'est le contenu de la poche
du docteur :<i>Varden - DSM3</i>
Donc ?
Encore un petit service avant de partir ?
- Tu peux voler un livre à la bibliothèque ?
- Pas de problème
Restez ici et gardez un oeil sur notre ami
Au cas où Mlle Davies reviendrait, on ne sait jamais
Détective. Comme je vous l'ai dit, j'amenais
le corps du docteur à la crypte sécurisée
Là où on garde généralement
les cas plus importants
Je pensais que c'était une bonne idée car
le suspect était un employé de la morgue
Et oui, Mlle Davies est dans mon répertoire
Tout comme Funky Chicken et Charm Pizza
Et 3 autres employés de la morgue
Vous avez votre corps
J'ai une morgue à gérer
Excusez-moi
Merci beaucoup Harrison.
J'apprécie vraiment
J'ai trouvé ça en plus.
Tru, fais gaffe à tes fesses
C'est affiché partout
Merci
- Salut, je peux me joindre à vous ?
- Oui bien entendu
J'ai oublié de demander du sucre
Je voudrais discuter de la confidentialité
entre un thérapeute et son patient.
Étant employée par la ville,
j'ai des obligations,
mais je respecterai ce que vous m'avez dit
lors de votre évaluation
Je parlais au conditionnel.
Je suis en train d'écrire un livre
Vraiment ?
Scientifique et homme de lettres
à la fois.
Dites-moi que vous faites la lessive
et je vous kidnappe
Dans quelles circonstances l'éthique
vous permet-elle de discuter d'un patient ?
Les lois différent suivant les états
mais généralement, quand il y a une menace immédiate
Et la connaissance du passé criminel
serait suffisant ?
Seulement si cette connaissance contribue
à l'établissement d'une menace immédiate
Et les crimes du passé pourraient
aider à prédire le comportement futur
Vous êtes plein de surprises, Davis
De quoi parle le livre ?
- Allô
- C'est moi
Harrison m'a donné ton numéro. Il a parlé
de mettre ton téléphone à l'arrière d'un camion pizza
C'est bon de t'entendre Davis
Tout va bien ?
Oui je vais bien
Ne t'inquiète pas pour moi
As-tu trouvé d'autres infos
sur le docteur ?
Non, mais la nouvelle se répand
Je ne sais pas combien de temps il me reste
On ne sait pas ce que signifie <i>Varden</i>.
C'est peut-être le nom du tueur qui est un patient
Il doit avoir un dossier chez Burrell
J'y ai pensé mais entrer dans son bureau
par effraction, c'est risqué
La police pourrait être là-bas
Et ça ne servira a rien si Varden
n'apparaît pas sur les dossiers
Non pas nécessairement. J'ai parlé à Carrie
Tu dois chercher quelqu'un que le docteur
a considéré comme représentant un danger
Quelqu'un avec un passé violent
- Je n'ai pas toute la nuit
- Tu as raison
J'espère que le dossier
se trouvera en haut de la pile
Encore une chose, sauf si tu as un passé
de cambrioleuse dont je ne suis pas au courant
Je ne sais pas comment
tu vas pouvoir entrer dans son bureau
- La morgue a gardé ses effets personnels
- Je vois où tu veux en venir
A plus tard
Bien reçu
Coursier, bonjour
Vous avez un paquet à livrer ?
- Oui c'est très urgent
- Pas de problème, j'ai compris
- Tu assures aujourd'hui Harry
- Je suis bon dans l'urgence
Etre habitué à vivre au jour le jour, ça aide
Hier, tu étais à un match de hockey
Tu devais prendre des photos pour papa
- Je suis désolée
- C'est plus important
On traverse tout ça ensemble
Papa peut être déçu de nous deux
Ok, casse-toi d'ici
Si un flic se montre
Je t'appelle
Tru ?
Harrison
Varden
Donald Mitchell III
DSM3
Tendances violentes, Névrose
Implication possible dans la disparition
de sa petite amie Grace Varden
Mes infos se sont révélées justes
Détective, écoutez-moi. Je tiens le fichier
du tueur dans ma main en ce moment
Donald Stuart Mitchell
Il est le patient dont le Dr Burell
voulait vous parler
Il a dû découvrir ce qu'allait faire le docteur
S'il était au marché ce matin et
qu'il vous a vus parler
- Il voudra vous tuer aussi
- Taisez-vous, vous n'arrangez pas votre situation
Écoutez-moi, il voudra vous tuer aussi
S'il pense que vous savez qu'il a tué Grace Varden
Grace Varden ?
Merci. Je pense que ce dossier
est le mien
Relax, je ne vais pas te tuer
Non mais la police cherchera
un autre meurtrier
Et je suis le suspect idéal
J'irai en prison pour 2 meurtres
Dont le meurtre d'un flic
- Je leur dirai la vérité.
- Libre à toi de dire ce que tu veux
Car sans ces fichiers, je deviens
une histoire que tu as inventée
Dommage que les circonstances
ne soient pas différentes
Parce que tu es bien plus jolie
que Grace ne l'était
Il m'a explosé
Désolée Harry
Il n'y a plus rien à faire
Aide-moi
Ce n'est pas comme cela que l'on tient
une vésicule biliaire Mr Lee
- Merci
- Merci à toi
Merci à toi, vraiment
Je dois vraiment y aller
Pourquoi est-ce que tu prends ça ?
Je n'ai pas de cutter
Ça vient de moi ou Tru semble
un peu brusque ?
- 3ème journée
- Et deux vies à sauver
J'ai pu trouver que Grace Varden était
une étudiante qui a disparu il y a 3 ans
La police a suspecté un meurtre
mais n'a trouvé aucune preuve
et n'a jamais retrouvé le corps
Sa famille était anéantie mais n'ont aucune
idée de ce qui lui est arrivé
Je dois passer d'autres appels
Tu as compris ce que tu devais faire ?
- Bien reçu
- Ok
Salut soeurette, je vais faire ma première
mission pour papa
Pas le temps, la journée recommence
donc écoute bien
Hier, on m'a arrêtée pour meurtre
Tu as été frappé par Jack
- J'ai été quoi ?
- Sans importance
Aujourd'hui, je vais procéder différemment
mais ce sera également le cas de Jack
Il doit forcément anticiper sur nous
Voilà ce que tu dois faire
Dr Burrell. Vous êtes là pour
rencontrer le détective Gomez
Oui, elle n'a pas pu venir ?
Vous êtes de la police ?
Nous avons des raisons de croire que vous
êtes en danger avec l'un de vos patients
Donald Stuart Mitchell. Il est ici
sur le marché
Si vous suivez cet homme
Il vous mettra en sécurité
Merci
Ça, c'était pour hier, je pense
Harrison, pousse-toi de là
Ta soeur est en danger
Venant de toi, je ne pense pas
Tu as 2 cibles aujourd'hui. Tu veux
être sûr que la femme flic va mourir
Le tueur pense que c'est ta soeur le flic
Ne vois-tu pas
Ta soeur est la cible
- Ça te rendrait heureux ?
- Non car Tru n'est pas morte hier
et elle n'est pas supposée mourir aujourd'hui
Je me fous de ce que tu penses
mais tu es prêt à mettre en jeu la vie de ta soeur ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Je te sauve la vie
Officier, à l'aide
Police, personne ne bouge
Regarde ça.
Elle tombe dans mon piège
C'est le détective Gomez
C'est elle que tu veux
Lâchez ça
Je vous arrête
pour le meurtre de Grace Varden
Je pense que la famille de Grace Varden
va enfin pouvoir faire son deuil
Merci
Et bien, c'était...
C'était déroutant comme à chaque fois
Je dois y aller
J'ai un boulot à accomplir
Ces photos ne vont pas
se prendre toutes seules
Bon match de hockey
et méfie-toi d'un crochet de la droite
On ne s'ennuie pas au moins,
ça change à chaque fois
Oui mais c'est plus sympa au cinoche
avec Cary Grant ou Matt Damon
Là tu n'as qu'Harrison et moi
Davis, STP. Tu es le meilleur complice
dont pourrait rêver une fille
- Salut Davis
- Salut
J'étais dans l'ascenseur
quand j'ai réalisé que je n'avais pas de sucre
Tenez
Merci
- Salut, Tru
- Salut, Carrie
Vous avez vu des bons cadavres dernièrement ?
Oui, c'est le cas. Cet homme est arrivé
et tout son système....
Davis, elle plaisantait
Moi aussi, c'était une blague
- Je dois y retourner, au revoir
- A bientôt
Bon sucre
Bon sucre, mon dieu
Je suis totalement inapte
- Tu l'aimes bien
- Non ce n'est pas vrai
Peut-être un petit peu
- Comment était la 1ère journée ?
- Ça ne s'est pas bien passé
- 2ème journée ?
- Je ne sais pas, j'étais trop occupée
C'était probablement une catastrophe
J'ai des réactions bizarres.
Mon cerveau doit être un spécimen
De tous mes acolytes du sous-sol de la morgue,
tu es de loin le meilleur
Je ne sais pas où est passée
la courtoisie.
Ça fait une semaine...
Tu n'appelles pas, tu n'écris pas
Les gens ne remercient plus ceux
qui leur sauvent la vie ?
Je t'aurais remercié, si tu n'avais pas essayé
de tuer le détective Gomez en même temps
Et toute cette histoire
d'accusation de meurtre
Tu prends les choses de façon
trop personnelle Tru
Voici mon conseil : cette école
de médecine est un beau rêve
Mais tu ne peux pas faire les deux
Tant que tu fais ce que tu fais
tu n'appartiens pas à cet endroit
Mon conseil pour toi
Ne sois pas mauvais perdant
Ok, Tru est là pour dire que j'ai raison
sur le métatarse
- Tu as tort
- Elle a raison
Ça va être comme ça toute l'année ?
Vous deux contre moi ?
Sous-titrage: Ben, Van & Stinc3
<i>http://trucalling.free.fr</i>
J'arrive
Oyeu versaire !
- Quoi ?
- Joyeux anniversaire
- Moins de bruit, s'il te plaît
- Merci de l'accueil
Je sais à quel point tu aimes ton anniversaire
mais j'ai d'autres choses à faire aujourd'hui
Ton cadeau, c'est en cours.
Et papa dit qu'il t'aime.
Non, ce n'est pas vrai. Il a encore oublié
mais merci de mentir
Et qu'est-ce que tu dois faire aujourd'hui ?
Tu n'es pas en congés avec papa en déplacement ?
Oui mais pas aujourd'hui.
Écoute ça
Je dois parler à un gars qui a vu quelque chose
sur quelqu'un, ce qui pourrait aider un autre gars
Ça a l'air plutôt important
Quel est ton programme
pour cet anniversaire ?
J'ai 23 ans, je pourrais utiliser ma carte de crédit
et m'offrir quelque chose de spécial
Peut-être des hot-dogs.
Ton frigo est désespérant, Tru
J'ai flashé sur un magnifique collier.
Ça me change un peu
de mes flashbacks morbides
Les bijoux. Vous souhaitez que les mecs
remarquent ce genre de chose
Mais ce n'est pas le cas
Tous les mecs y prêtent attention,
sauf toi
Tu sais quoi ?
Il faut que je m'habille, alors du balai.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je prends ça
- Salut Avery
- Salut Tru
- Salut Mr Gorensteen.
- Joyeux anniversaire
- J'adore ce collier. Il est nouveau ?
- Effectivement
Un cadeau de ma part
Contente que tu l'aies remarqué
C'est le cas, mais pas pour les mecs
Ils ne remarquent jamais ce genre de choses
En plus, tout le monde ne parle
que des fiançailles
- Qui s'est fiancé ?
- Jensen et Lexy
Lexy. Il en a parlé mais je ne pensais pas
que c'était aussi sérieux
Et bien, il a été très impulsif
Tyler est amoureux de l'amour
Son journal va être bien rempli ce soir
- Salut, félicitations
- Merci
- Elle est tombée sur le bon gars
- J'espère qu'elle le sait
C'est le cas, elle est excitée
Bien que ce ne soit pas le cas de tout le monde.
- Pour une fois qu'on est invités quelque part.
- Exactement, il ne se passe rien pour nous
Je ne me rappelle pas de la dernière fois
où j'ai vu un homme nu
- Hé, joli collier
- Merci
Davis ?
Davis ?
Oh mon dieu
Qui a réuni tout le monde ?
Harrison et moi avons tout préparé
C'était supposé se passer dans un meilleur endroit
Mais ça n'a pas marché
J'ai eu quelques problèmes
logistiques.
Mais j'ai pu tout installer ici
Viens voir
Pince-toi.
Ce n'est pas un rêve.
- C'est un bain bouillonnant
- Ouais
Ne m'en veux pas trop
C'est juste pour ce soir
- Davis, tu l'as laissé faire ?
- J'aime les bulles
Attends de voir à quel point
ta fête va être d'enfer, d'accord ?
On va mettre ça en route
Ça doit être un court-circuit.
Je vais appeler le gars de la maintenance
Attends, ne fais pas ça
C'est mieux comme ça
- Ambiance
- Tru
- Quel endroit
- Oui, c'est morbide et étrange
- Mais on est contents d'être là
- Merci
Suivez-moi
J'ai des personnes à vous présenter
Voici mon ami et patron, Davis
C'est Tyler et Avery, de ma classe d'anatomie
- Oui, on a parlé à Davis lors de l'invitation
- Oui, c'est ça. Content de vous connaître
- Et c'est mon petit frère Harrison
- Avery, Tyler
Salut. Harrison, c'est un bon prénom
J'aime ça
Merci
Vous avez vu le bain bouillonnant ?
Apparemment, mon frère m'a prise
pour une candidate de son Bachelor
J'ai apporté mon maillot de bain
On se change où ?
Venez avec moi
Davis, j'adore ma fête
Merci beaucoup
Oh ouais. Je t'ai aussi apporté un cadeau
Donc je vais le chercher
Super
- Tru, joyeux anniversaire
- Hey
- Je ne pense pas que tu connaisses Lexy
- Lexy, enfin. Tous mes voeux
Merci, c'est un tournant dans la vie.
J'ai hâte qu'on s'installe.
C'est la première morgue que je vois
Cet endroit est fascinant
Il n'y a pas de corps ce soir
mais vous pouvez visiter les lieux
Tu veux visiter les lieux ?
Je suis sûr que tu vas adorer
Ok, d'accord.
Tout mais pas les bocaux à viscères.
- Amusez-vous
- Merci Tru
Salut
- Ça semblait mieux présenté en vitrine
- Ils le mettent d'abord dans une boîte
- Peut-être que je devrais...
- Non, n'essaye même pas
C'est... des chapeaux
Oui, 2 chapeaux. Tu connais l'expression
"Porter deux chapeaux" non ?
Cela symbolise tes 2 activités
Un pour l'école de médecine
Un pour changer les destinées
Zut, Carrie est là
- Ça commence à bien faire cette histoire
- Je sais
- Salut Carrie
- Salut, joyeux anniversaire
Merci
- Vous pouvez nous excuser un instant
- Bien sûr
- Davis, demande-lui de rester
- Je ne vais pas...
Davis
- Carrie, aimeriez-vous rester ?
- J'aimerais beaucoup
- Comment ça se passe là-dedans ?
- Je profite de la vie
C'est pas dangereux ?
- Je ne peux pas faire ça
- Tu dois lui dire la vérité
- Ce n'est pas tes affaires
- Si, et si tu ne dis rien, je le ferai
Lâche-moi
Tout le monde se réunit
Joyeux anniversaire Tru
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Juste une coupure de courant.
Profitez-en avant que la lumière ne revienne.
Personne ne saura que c'est vous.
Tru
- Harrison, c'est toi ?
- Quoi ?
Tru, que se passe-t'il ?
Aide-moi
Pas ce que je souhaitais
Ep.2-03 In The Dark
Ne t'installe pas, Harry
Je me sauve
Quelque chose est arrivé
Je n'ai aucun indice
Je pensais que ton anniversaire, n'était
que fous rires et amour sur la Terre
- J'ai eu cet anniversaire hier
- Tu revis ton anniversaire ?
Je dois faire quelque chose ?
Ou ne pas le faire ?
- Est-ce que j'ai merdé ?
- Tu m'as organisé une fête, très sympa
Super le frère
Ce n'est pas parce que tu es mon frère
que tu es le frère
Et cette fois-ci, ne m'organise pas
une fête surprise à la morgue
Surtout avec un bain bouillonnant de location
Ce n'est pas mon style de cadeau.
Attends, j'ai organisé ta fête
à la morgue ?
Ce n'est pas important. Annule tout
et ne me fais plus de surprise
Ferme bien quand tu pars
- Hot-dogs. Étage du bas
- Merci
- Donc la voix ne te disait rien ?
- C'était un long chuchotement
C'était rauque. Je ne sais même pas
si c'est un homme ou une femme
Et tu n'as aucune idée de qui
aurait pu t'appeler à l'aide ?
Il n'y avait aucun corps à la morgue
Ce n'était pas toi, ni Harrison
- Vous étiez à côté de moi
- C'était un invité
Super, ça nous avance bien.
Je suis maudite. Va savoir combien d'amis
je vais devoir surveiller.
Ce n'était peut-être pas un de tes amis
mais quelqu'un qui est venu avec l'un d'eux
J'aime ta façon de m'aider.
Ok, écoute-moi un instant
Qui était présent ?
Tu veux dire ici
Toi, moi, Harrison, Carrie
- Des amis de l'école, Jensen
- Carrie était là ?
Oui, elle est passée et
tu l'as invitée à rester
- J'ai fait ça ? Elle est restée ?
- Tu as été remarquable
J'espère qu'elle va bien
Je ne m'en remettrais pas si j'étais
le responsable de ce qu'il lui arrive
Davis, je suis sûre qu'elle va bien
Essayons de reconstituer la scène.
Tyler était dans le bain bouillonnant
Et il y a eu un problème d'électricité
Donc c'était lui ou le gars de la maintenance
- Un bain bouillonnant ?
- Et il faisait très sombre
- N'importe qui a pu glisser et tomber
- Il y avait un bain bouillonnant ici ?
Et avant la coupure de courant
Avery et Lexy se disputaient violemment
Si tu ne lui dis pas, je le ferai
- Qui est Lexy ?
- La fiancée de Jensen
Je ne pense pas que tu connaisses Lexy
Cela semblait pouvoir dégénérer
Lexy a pu la frapper ou l'étrangler
Avery lui disait un truc du genre
Si tu ne lui dis pas, je le ferai
Je pense qu'elle est la victime
On dirait que Lexy a un secret
et qu'Avery l'a découvert
A mon tour de le découvrir
Harrison
Regarde-toi, mec. Tu as l'air en forme
Robuste, tel un homme qui a pris les choses en main
Donc le fait que je vive encore
ne te dérange pas ?
Tu veux dire vis à vis de l'univers.
Tous les jours, qui ont des conséquences
qui affecteront la race humaine.
Pourquoi ça me dérangerait ?
À plus, Jack
Connard
Sacrée veinarde
Sacrée Veinarde, Kentucky Rascall, Better off-sailing
Dans les 5,6 et 7ème courses
Et Rascall a une petite cote
donc mise gros.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je n'ai pas parié depuis des mois
Pourquoi pas ? Aucune règle n'empêche
de profiter d'un retour en arrière Harrison
Tru pourrait te faire confiance, si elle le voulait
Ça m'horripile de voir comment elle te traite
C'est trop sympa. Tu t'es rappelé
de ces noms rien que pour moi
Non, je m'en suis souvenu pour moi
Il faut bien que je vive
Mais si tu n'es pas intéressé
Oublie ce que je viens de te dire
C'est déjà fait
C'est déjà fait
- Salut Avery
- Tru, bon anniversaire
- Tu dois vraiment aimer ton anniversaire
- Je suis de bonne humeur c'est tout
- Donc, que se passe-t'il ?
- Tu ne vas pas y croire
- Jensen et Lexy se sont fiancés
- Vraiment ?
Je ne l'ai même pas rencontrée
De quoi elle a l'air ?
Elle est bien. Elle est folle de lui
donc ça doit être une bonne chose
C'est plutôt concis comme réponse.
C'est pas ton style d'habitude.
Je sais,
J'aime ce côté changeant en moi.
Je l'aime bien,
mais ça semble trop rapide
Et terriblement romantique
- Bonjour
- Jensen, félicitations
Vous savez quoi, je vous invite
pour un déjeuner de félicitations
Juste après le labo, au café Geneva
Nous tous, plus Lexy, on pourra la rencontrer
C'est très généreux de ta part. Je vais l'appeler
Elle sera probablement heureuse de venir
Oui, je viens
J'aime les desserts
Mes mains tremblent sur l'intestin grêle
On pourra parler bouffe plus tard ?
- Ils ont des tartes
- J'aime les tartes
Donc vous êtes sûr de l'avoir
déposé à l'aéroport ?
Oui, j'en suis certain
Il était en retard pour un vol
Il parlait à sa copine au téléphone
Elle était déjà à l'aéroport
Elle était furieuse.
Il lui a promis un voyage au Caraïbes
pour la calmer.
La Sacré veinarde.
Sacrée veinarde.
En tout cas, j'ai conduit comme un dingue
Je l'ai amené à l'heure
Il n'a pas voulu me donner de pourboire
Donc oui, je m'en souviens
Sacrée veinarde
- C'est tout ?
- Oui, c'est tout
- Je ne dois rien signer ?
- Non, non, c'était parfait
C'est bon, je suis dans le hall.
Il est encore trop tôt. Quel que soit le secret de Lexy,
Avery n'est pas encore au courant
Je les ai invités à déjeuner
Donc je vais pouvoir y travailler Et les regarder ensemble
J'entends des oiseaux
Où es-tu ?
Je suis à l'atrium en train de surveiller
Carrie qui prend un café
- C'est du harcèlement
- Non c'est de la surveillance
- Je veux m'assurer qu'elle n'est pas en danger
- On n'a aucune raison de croire en son implication
Il faut que j'y aille.
Je te rappelle
...Tru et Davis m'ont beaucoup parlé de vous
- Ils sont sympas
- En effet
Je voulais me présenter à vous
C'est gentil
Au revoir
Excuse-moi
Que faisais-tu ici ?
Je ne faisais que me présenter.
Je suis un peu de la maison.
Ne t'approche pas de Carrie.
Tu as bien compris ?
Que t'arrive t-il ?
Tu es amoureux ?
C'est adorable.
Vraiment.
Je protégerai tous ceux
que tu approcheras.
J'ai parlé à ma concierge ce matin
et pourtant je ne t'ai pas vu.
C'est plus profond que ça,
avoue-le.
À bientôt
Tru, les données ont changé
Écoute-moi.
Jack lui tourne autour,
il veut s'assurer
qu'elle meure à nouveau
Tu dois revenir à la morgue.
Je voudrais bien, mais je dois
découvrir le secret de Lexy
Tu dois t'en charger en attendant
Mon Dieu !
Carrie mourra si nous n'enquêtons pas
sur son passé.
- Trouver le mobile, le coupable...
-<i> C'est ce qu'il faut trouver</i>
J'ai une idée,
Harrison peut nous aider,
la filature c'est son job.
Il la suivra pendant que tu enquêtes
Un instant
Je voudrais miser 2 $ sur...
La vie est dure,
elles sont toutes folles de moi.
Il n'est pas joignable pour l'instant
Je n'y arriverai jamais
Bien sûr que tu le peux.
Parle-lui, trouve un moyen
d'engager la conversation
Avery était menacée par Lexy
lors de mon anniversaire.
J'ai déjà vu des meurtres pour moins que ça.
J'ai compris, mais viens
dès que tu as terminé de ton côté.
C'est une très bonne idée, Tru.
Très heureuse de te rencontrer
Moi de même
C'est vos fiançailles
qui m'ont amenée à faire ça.
- Jensen m'a dit que tu étais du coin.
- Oui
Je suis allée au lycée Adam High,
à deux pas d'ici.
Les filles du lycée doivent m'envier
d'être fiancée à un docteur.
- Ça fait un peu cliché.
- Je ne suis pas encore docteur.
Et tu travailles en ville ?
Je suis hôtesse d'accueil
dans une compagnie d'assurances.
Désormais je n'aurai plus besoin de travailler.
Champagne !
Pas pour moi,
je suis bénévole de garde à la clinique.
- Tu ne devrais peut-être pas boire.
- C'est vrai, pas pour moi
Merci
Pas de champagne ?
Tu es enceinte ?
Avery !
Pardon.
Je dis parfois des bêtises.
Sinon, dis-moi, tu es alcoolique ?
Je le dis ?
Vas-y, ils le sauront de toute façon.
Je suis enceinte
C'est vraiment...
- Félicitations.
- Merci.
Je voulais éviter que vous pensiez
que c'était la raison de nos plans de mariage.
Mais c'est-ce qui m'a fait dire oui.
C'est une fille fantastique...
Excusez-moi un instant
- Que fais-tu là ?
- C'est génial ils ont de la fondue au menu !
Ça ne t'est jamais arrivé
d'avoir envie d'une bonne fondue ?
Ne t'approche pas de mes amis
Je les ai vus, mais je ne les connais pas,
tu veux me les présenter ?
D'accord.
C'est en l'honneur de ton anniversaire.
J'ai failli oublier
Je voulais un truc en rapport avec la mort,
la résurrection mais je n'en ai pas trouvé.
Donc, je me suis contenté d'une carte
avec un gâteau en couverture.
<i>Bon anniversaire Tru.
Amitiés. Jack</i>
Tu peux t'en aller maintenant
Tu ne veux pas me présenter tes amis
et me faire profiter de la fondue.
Je te dérange ?
Si c'était le cas,
ça me vexerait presque
Salut Carrie,
comment ça va ?
Plutôt bien ?
Tu ne m'as pas beaucoup parlé de tes amis.
Carrie,
j'aime votre blouse.
<i>Mon Dieu !</i>
- Que se passe-t'il ?
- Rien
Je sais qu'on ne se connait que depuis peu
mais tu peux tout me dire.
On croit que ça n'arrive qu'aux autres,
d'épouser un homme violent et alcoolique.
Mais j'espérais...
que ça s'arrangerait avec le temps.
Je suis désolé
Ce qui m'étonne le plus,
c'est que malgré ça,
il m'a énormément manqué,
après sa mort.
De quoi est-il mort ?
Il s'est noyé,
dans la baignoire.
Il s'est assoupi en prenant son bain.
La police a enquêté,
j'ai été interrogée.
J'ai compris qu'ils me considéraient
impliquée dans cette mort
Impliquée ?
Oui
Il avait pris des cachets
qui n'ont pas été retrouvés.
Donc ils ont pensé
que je l'avais drogué,
avec des sédatifs que j'aurais volés
à l'hôpital où j'exerçais
Qu'est-il advenu ?
Ils n'ont pas retrouvé les cachets,
donc l'enquête s'est arrêtée là.
Mais sa soeur est persuadée
que je suis coupable.
J'ai tout quitté
et je suis venue m'installer ici.
Je me croyais en sécurité
jusqu'à aujourd'hui.
<i>Je sais que c'est toi</i>
C'est les deux mêmes.
J'en ai trouvé un dans le journal de ce matin.
Et j'ai trouvé l'autre juste avant
que tu n'entres dans le bureau.
Il était dans mon sac.
Je peux peut-être t'aider.
J'ai pas eu de tuyau.
En fait, j'en ai eu un.
Tu étais injoignable.
Écoute.
Lexy est enceinte et c'est ce qui pousse
Jensen à l'épouser, et je connais le secret.
C'est quoi ?
Lexy veut se faire une place au soleil
en épousant un docteur
Quel secret qui puisse tout faire capoter
Avery aurait-elle trouvé ?
Si Jensen n'est pas le père.
C'est un coup classique.
Elle serait prête à tout
pour garder son secret.
Je ne suis pas d'accord
Avery est de garde à la clinique cet après-midi,
et supposons
que Lexy ait un dossier là-bas
qu'Avery ait pu consulter.
Je vais essayer d'en savoir plus à la clinique,
et peut-être éviter le pire.
Quoi ?
Le mari de Carrie est décédé il y à 18 mois
et sa belle-soeur la croit coupable.
Je pense que c'est Carrie la victime
et Jack va s'assurer qu'elle meure.
Jack est venu nous voir,
donc Avery peut aussi être la victime.
- Il essaye de nous pertuber
- Tu penses que Carrie passe après Avery ?
Davis, s'il te plaît, pas de ça maintenant.
J'aurais bien aimé suivre les 2 pistes.
- Mais tu devras t'en charger.
- Pour que tu puisses rester avec tes amis.
Quoi ?
- Tu n'es pas objective sur ce coup là.
- Pourquoi, tu penses l'être toi ?
Je sais que tu tiens à elle
et je sais ce que c'est de perdre quelqu'un.
- Mais Davis...
- Tru, tu ne peux pas me faire ça !
Il ne s'agit pas du pauvre Davis
qui perd ses moyens face aux filles
Ce n'est pas pour rigoler,
c'est sérieux !
Et tu veux que je m'en charge seul ?
Et si elle meurt
parce que tu n'es pas là pour la protéger,
Je ne te le pardonnerai jamais.
- Depuis combien de temps viens-tu ici ?
- Des années.
C'est Jensen qui avait eu cette idée
quand on était en prépa.
Vous vous connaissez depuis longtemps.
On avait pas mal de cours ensemble.
- Vous sortiez ensemble ?
- Il y a très longtemps, oui.
- Et ?
- On est devenus amis.
Et c'est bien mieux comme ça.
- Tu le protèges.
- Et lui fait pareil avec moi.
Enfin, il essaye mais
je ne me laisse pas faire.
Et on s'arrêtera là
pour les confessions.
Compris.
- C'est quoi ?
- C'est la feuille de rendez-vous.
- Tu cherches quelqu'un ?
- J'essaye de m'intégrer rapidement.
Il y a pas mal de dossiers,
je vais commencer par ça.
Ça consiste en quoi ?
Des dossiers nous ont été retournés.
Je vais les classer dans les archives.
Je peux le faire
Tu veux aussi des quilles pour jongler ?
Reste zen, Tru
T'es une crack mais
tu ne peux pas sauver tout le monde.
C'est vrai que parfois j'aimerais le faire.
Alexander Keely, c'est le père de Lexy.
Tu ne devrais pas regarder
Il faut que j'y aille.
Attends, dis-moi ce qu'il y a ?
- Ne va pas la voir.
- Tu ne sais pas de quoi il s'agit.
- Je m'en doute.
- Lexy a menti à Jensen.
Je sais que tu veux le protéger
mais il doit y avoir une autre solution.
- Parlons-lui ensemble.
- Excusez-moi.
- Où est l'accueil s'il vous plaît ?
- Par ici.
Davis, j'ai peut-être le mobile du crime d'Avery.
Le secret c'est qu'elle n'est pas enceinte.
J'ai vu son dossier médical.
Elle a subi une hystérectomie il y a 2 ans.
Donc elle est stérile.
C'était juste pour obliger Jensen à l'épouser.
C'est pour ça qu'elle ne voulait pas
parler de sa grossesse.
Tu as encore une nouvelle théorie.
- Et la mienne au sujet de Carrie ?
- Davis, j'en suis consciente.
- J'essaye d'empêcher un meurtre.
- Je te laisse,
j'ai rendez-vous avec le vrai meurtrier.
Merci pour le thé,
il est bien chaud
Je ferai tout mon possible pour relancer
l'enquête sur le meurtre de mon frère
La morgue n'est pas responsable
de la réouverture d'enquêtes.
Nous nous attachons à reconstituer les faits.
Il s'agit ici de la noyade
de votre frère dans une baignoire.
C'est-ce qu'elle a raconté,
mais c'est faux.
Ça n'a aucun sens.
Il buvait, non ?
Pas au point de s'évanouir dans son bain.
Et les pilules n'ont pas été retrouvées.
Elle s'est débarrassée de la boîte,
car ça pouvait lui nuire.
- Il est facile d'égarer une boite de pilules.
- Non
Elle l'a tué
Je suis certain qu'elle sera punie.
Mais la vengeance ne résout rien.
Docteur.
Mon frère était quelqu'un de bien.
Il ne l'a jamais frappée et ne s'est
pas évanoui saoul dans sa baignoire.
Et ne me parlez pas de justice,
je sais très bien ce que cela donne.
Je sais très bien ce qu'elle a fait.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Tu n'es pas en sécurité ici.
Suis-moi
Entre
Ce n'est pas grand chose,
mais il y a la clim.
C'est utile car lorsque
celle de la morgue tombe en panne,
on est obligés de se mettre à poil
pour tenir le coup.
C'est magnifique
Je les ai ramenées du Mexique.
Mais on ne peut pas manger dedans.
L'argile cause des traumatismes cérébraux.
Veux-tu une glace ?
Non, merci
J'aime bien ton appart.
On s'y sent en sécurité.
Désolée de t'avoir embarrassé avec ces mots.
C'était sûrement une farce
des enfants du voisinage.
Je ne pense pas.
Tu es en lieu sûr en tout cas.
Je sais
Elle n'est pas revenue de la journée ?
Avery ?
Non, mais elle a appelé.
- Ah bon ? Tant mieux.
- Elle disait qu'elle devait voir son ami Jensen,
- et sa fiancée.
- Elle a dit où c'était ?
Au Standard Diner, vous connaissez ?
Surprise !
Tu croyais que j'avais tout annulé.
Mais le message que je t'ai laissé t'as guidée.
- Ce n'est pas le cas
- L'essentiel c'est que tu sois là.
- Tu as vu Avery ?
- Qui ? Qui est Avery ?
Pas grave, excuse-moi
Merci Harrison, j'adore la surprise
De rien, Tru
- Hey, joyeux anniversaire
- Merci. Tu as vu Avery ?
- Je ne crois pas qu'elle soit ici
- Où est Lexy ?
Dans l'autre pièce, il me semble
Je ne sais pas, pourquoi ?
Écoute. je ne sais pas si c'est quelque chose
que je doive te dire
- Tru ?
- J'étais à la clinique aujourd'hui
- Le dossier de Lexy était là
- Oui je l'ai transféré là
pour le bon déroulement de sa grossesse.
C'est quoi le problème ?
J'ai vu son dossier
et elle te cache quelque chose
- Attends, tu as vu son dossier ?
- Oui, j'étais là avec Avery et...
Je m'en fous. Je ne sais pas ce que c'est
Ce que tu as vu est personnel
Si elle veut m'en parler
Elle m'en parlera
Jensen, elle n'est pas enceinte
- Quoi ?
- Elle a subi une opération
Une hystérectomie.
Il fallait que tu le saches.
Merci d'avoir décidé de mon sort.
Elle ment, elle veut épouser un docteur
Les choses vont mal tourner
J'adore les apéricubes
Qu'est-ce qui se passe avec Jensen ?
Délicieux
- Je lui dirai la vérité
- Ça ne te concerne pas
Si c'est le cas, et si tu ne lui dis pas
Je le ferai
Lexy, tu dois lui dire que
tu n'es pas enceinte
Maintenant c'est une fête
Un combat de nanas, un combat de nanas !
J'adore ça
Je viendrai à ton anniversaire
tous les ans
Ce n'est pas bon
- Il va finir par l'apprendre
- Je sais
Je sais qu'il le saura
et alors tout sera terminé
C'est encore mieux qu'un combat de nanas
Mais tu vois, il est clair que Lexy est vivante
Et en bonne santé, malgré un utérus sans bébé.
Mais je ne pense pas que ce soit une meurtrière
Joyeux anniversaire
Harrison, c'est une super fête. Je savais
que tu ferais pour le mieux avec cet argent
Tu vois, réunir tout le monde ici
Jack m'a donné le nom de ces chevaux
et j'ai utilisé l'argent pour la fête
Mais je pense qu'il voulait cela
Il voulait que tu sois ici...
plutôt qu'à un autre endroit.
Mais tu serais capable de créer un bateau ?
Oui, avec de bons ingénieurs tout est possible.
J'ai rencontré ma femme
pendant une régate en fait
Son équipe a gagné
puis ils nous ont jetés à l'eau.
J'ai attrapé une infection
mais je m'en fichais.
- C'est très mignon
- C'était il y a longtemps
Ça ne me fait plus mal d'y penser
Ça sera la même chose pour toi
Tu y es pour beaucoup.
Il y a quelqu'un dans le couloir
Va te cacher dans ma chambre
Attend ! C'est... Tu avais raison
Ça n'a jamais été Avery
C'est Carrie et je suis vraiment désolée
de ne pas t'avoir écouté
- Ok, tu es là maintenant
- Elle est là ? En sécurité ?
Elle est dans l'autre pièce
Elle est en sécurité
D'autres mots ? Tu as trouvé d'autres suspects
en dehors de la belle-soeur ?
Rien d'autre. Et la soeur n'aurait rien fait elle-même
Elle aurait engagé quelqu'un
Et les mots ressemblent
vraiment à du chantage
Je ne suis pas sûr
Oh Davis, arrête
Tu sais qui a écrit ces mots
C'étaient des leurres.
Ce n'était ni Avery, ni Carrie
La mort va toujours avoir lieu
et ça va arriver à la morgue
Il n'y a personne à la morgue
Comment ça peut arriver à nouveau ?
Car quelqu'un est là-bas
Et il était là-bas la première fois
- Qui ?
- La lumière ne s'est pas éteinte à cause du bain
Elle s'est éteinte car le câblage est mauvais
Et le gars de la maintenance est là-bas en ce moment
Non
C'est frustrant, n'est-ce pas ?
Tu aurais pu le sauver
si tu étais arrivée à temps
Tu as ton brevet de secouriste,
mais c'est inutile, Tru
Il faut le laisser frire.
Tu dis faire ça pour le bien de tous
et tu prends ton pied à le regarder mourir.
Tu crois que ça m'amuse, Georges ?
Georges ne répond pas.
Tu savais qu'il s'appelait Georges ?
Je ne pense pas.
Mais c'est peut être mieux.
C'est moins douloureux
quand on ne connaît pas la victime.
Malheureusement non.
Je sais que tu l'as déjà vu
donc ne fais pas semblant d'être surprise.
Je t'ai dit la symbolique ?
2 chapeaux, 2 boulots.
J'ai de bonnes idées, parfois.
Oui, c'est une belle réflexion,
merci Davis
Mais j'ai l'impression que
j'aurai du mal à assumer les 2.
On s'est trompés tous les 2.
Avec Jack c'est plus difficile qu'avant.
Il est fûté.
Il est plus que fûté.
Il sait des choses.
Jack n'était pas à la fête mais il savait
pour la dispute entre Lexy et Avery
Et pareil avec Carrie.
Comment sait-il tout ça ?
J'attendais cette réaction.
Merci pour les chapeaux.
Je t'en prie
Allez, file à l'école,
montre-moi que tu peux porter les 2 chapeaux.
Salut Avery.
Cool ta fête hier soir.
Je t'ai cherchée pour te le dire,
après mon accrochage avec Lexy,
mais je ne t'ai pas trouvée.
- Comment va Jensen, tu l'as vu ?
- Oui
Je crois qu'il m'a pardonné.
Mais tu dois aller le voir aussi
vu que tu as lu le dossier de Lexy.
D'accord.
Tu as pourtant essayé de me dissuader
de regarder ces dossiers.
- Je ne savais pas que celui de Lexy y était.
- Je sais, mais tu l'as fait.
Comme quand tu manques les cours,
tu sais des détails sur ce qui s'est passé.
- Ce genre de choses.
- Bizarre, je n'avais pas remarqué.
Je ne te traque pas,
je voulais juste te dire que je l'avais remarqué.
Allez, va voir Jensen.
Je suis désolée.
Ce n'est pas grave
Je t'ai révélé le contenu
d'un dossier médical, ce n'est pas bien.
C'est Lexy qui est à blâmer.
Elle a menti, elle voulait épouser un docteur.
Elle a choisi un imbécile capable
d'épouser une fille parce qu'elle est enceinte.
J'aime bien ce genre d'imbéciles
Je suis content de l'avoir appris à temps.
C'est vrai, tu as l'air content.
Je dirais plutôt qu'elle te manque.
Non
Non, ce n'est pas ça.
C'est la fille que j'aurais aimé qu'elle soit,
qui me manque.
Charmante, rieuse...
Qui aurait apprécié mon geste.
Qui aurait des amis auxquels elle tient.
Tu trouveras cette personne.
On espère tous trouver quelqu'un qui...
La bonne personne.
Bien sûr.
Chacun a son âme soeur quelque part.
- Tu pars ?
- J'ai un moment pour parler si tu veux.
Merci pour hier soir.
C'était bien de te savoir à mes côtés.
Tu m'as rassurée quand ça n'allait pas.
C'est bien.
Au sujet du baiser,
on a peut-être été trop loin.
C'était bien aussi.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui
- Désolée, je dois y aller.
- D'accord.
Je pense que le destin
m'a amenée à te rencontrer.
J'aime bien cet endroit.
C'est 100 fois mieux que le truc miteux
où l'on s'est rencontrés la première fois.
On ne pouvait pas faire pire comme endroit.
L'alcool était frelaté et les cacahuètes pourries.
- Je t'ai pris une bière
- Merci
- La journée était longue hier ?
- À peu près 48h.
Mais c'était facile,
je n'avais qu'a brouiller les pistes.
- Et toi ?
- C'était pas mal.
J'en ai appris sur Davis.
- Il est marrant.
- Et ?
Il a gobé tout ce que je lui ai dit.

Tru
- Tu as un emploi du temps chargé aujourd'hui ?
- Après le cours de chimie,
j'ai quartier libre.
Ça tombe bien car j'ai 2 places
pour un concert de Jazz.
- Désolée, mais je déteste le Jazz.
- Moi aussi.
C'est Lexy qui voulait y aller
On pourrait en tirer 50$ au marché noir.
- J'ai jamais essayé ça.
- Alors à tout à l'heure.
Devine quoi ?
Tu ne devineras jamais,
à moins que... mais tu m'en aurais parlé.
- Mon cours débute dans 2 minutes.
- Très bien.
Un des clients de papa va se faire voler
du matos électronique ce soir.
Il a été averti et il a besoin de photos.
C'est moi qui ferai clic-clac.
- C'est risqué ?
- Seulement si je me fais remarquer.
Tu t'en tireras très bien.
Ça m'aurait plus touché si ça avait été
un jour que tu as déjà vécu.
Mais c'est gentil quand même.
J'ai attendu une semaine,
il est temps que l'un de nous
propose à l'autre de sortir ensemble.
Pourquoi pas un dîner ?
Il n'est que 9h30.
Je pensais plutôt à ce soir.
Oui, bien sûr.
D'accord.
Très bien,
c'est moi qui cuisine.
On le fait chez toi ?
Ma cuisinière ne fonctionne pas bien.
D'accord, il faut juste
que je parte plus tôt pour ranger un peu.
- Disons 19h.
- Très bien.
Pour être prêt à 19h
je devrais y aller maintenant.
J'aurai voulu savoir jouer de la guitare.
Je vous ai déjà croisé ici.
Plusieurs fois d'ailleurs.
Vous travaillez dans le secteur ?
- Oui, mais pas que dans ce quartier.
- Je ne vous traque pas.
C'est juste que,
même si ça peut paraître farfelu,
C'est mon jour de chance.
Et j'ai 2 billets
pour un concert de Jazz ce soir.
Si cela vous tente, je vous invite.
Je ne peux pas.
J'ai des horaires difficiles.
Peut-être une autre fois.
2 billets de concert de Jazz pour 20$
15$ ! 10$ seulement !
On a 2 billets à vendre.
- 20$ les 2.
- 5$ ! Je vous les donne
Vous les voulez ? non ?
Tout ça a été fait dans ma cuisine ?
Oui, tu ne cuisines pas chez toi ?
J'ai fait du gaspacho.
Mais rien de comparable à ça.
C'est délicieux.
C'est quoi ?
Du thon à la provençale.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Rien
Il fait un peu chaud,
Ça me donne très soif.
Le vin est bon.
Relax
Ce n'est que moi
Désolé
Je suis nerveux car c'est la première fois
qu'une femme cuisine pour moi.
Je comprends
Mais cette soirée pourrait être
pleine de premières fois.
Mon dieu, quel idiot.
Je croyais que c'était un chien.
En place les ringards
Billy
Qu'as-tu fait ? tu as jeté la pellicule ?
Que voulais-tu que je fasse ?
C'est un ami d'enfance.
Si je ne bossais pas pour papa,
je serais dans la même situation que lui.
- Et qu'as-tu dit à papa ?
-<i>J'ai menti</i>
J'ai dit que la lumière était trop faible,
que les photos étaient inexploitables.
Il était furax.
<i>Prendre des clichés de mon pote,
c'est pas mon truc.</i>
Tu t'en sors bien.
Rien n'est facile.
Si seulement c'était moins compliqué.
- Je me doute.
- <i>Bon, je te laisse</i>
- 6 sucres, c'est ça ?
- 7, mais ça ira.
Fantastique, merci d'avoir appelé Avery.
J'ai gagné 100$ sur un pari au lycée
pour une mise de 10$.
Du marché noir, des paris sur des combats.
Et oui, c'est ça la vie de gangster.
Je crois que je n'ai pas réussi à séduire Davis,
j'y suis peut-être allée un peu fort.
Que s'est-il passé ?
J'ai essayé de lui montrer
qu'il me faisait de l'effet.
- Et il n'a pas réagi ?
- Si, il a réagi
Il a sursauté de peur.
Certains mecs ont besoin
de plus de douceur.
Je te rappelle
Que dirais-tu si on sortait ensemble samedi ?
On revendrait des billets de concerts ?
Oui, c'est ce à quoi je pensais.
Elle a sauté,
j'appelle les secours.
Jack
Aidez-moi !
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
C'était différent. Cela ne ressemblait pas
à ce que je ressens d'habitude.
Personne ne t'a demandé de l'aide ?
Il n'y avait pas de cadavre aux alentours.
- Peut-être tu ne l'as pas entendu.
- Je les ai toujours entendu.
C'est peut-être toi qui est morte alors ?
Tu veux me filer la trouille ?
Que faisais-tu quand c'est arrivé ?
J'allais...
faire un truc personnel.
Décris-moi ton flash-back.
C'était bizarre,
des images sans liens apparents.
Il y avait un tableau
Une affiche de concert
Un étui à guitare avec de la monnaie dedans.
Il y avait un billet de 20$,
c'était sûrement un musicien de rue.
Il y en a toujours du côté d'Atlantic Plaza.
C'est la bas !
J'ai vu l'horloge de la tour Edison.
Il était 23h15,
l'horloge s'éloignait comme si je tombais.
- J'ai une idée, un peu farfelue mais,
- Quoi ?
Ça pourrait expliquer la mort de la victime.
Elle a chuté.
C'est vrai qu'il y a un observatoire.
Mais on n'est même pas sûr
qu'il y ait une victime.
Ou même si quelqu'un est mort.
Ça m'énerve.
Je commençais à peine à m'en sortir.
Les règles ont changé,
c'est un nouveau défi.
Ce retour en arrière
avait quelque chose de mauvais.
De froid
Comme si une partie de moi mourrait.
J'espère ne plus jamais ressentir ça.
Je n'ai jamais ressenti un truc comme ça.
Je ne sais pas quoi dire.
Je n'avais jamais entendu parler de ça auparavant.
- Elle m'a demandé de l'aide.
- Ne te laisse pas perturber par ça.
- Bien agir est toujours plus difficile.
- Mais si les règles ont changé,
- il doit y avoir une raison.
- Ton boulot est simple
Faire qu'aujourd'hui ressemble à hier.
Et que dois-je faire ?
Ton boulot
Attends
Non, ne me dis pas
que c'est un de ces jours.
Relax, il ne t'arrivera rien de grave
Tant mieux
Je voulais te dire en personne
que papa va te donner un boulot
où tu devras photographier un délit.
Ça c'est cool
Ton pote Billy fait partie des délinquants
et si tu fais le boulot, il ira en prison.
Pas cool.
Si je refuse le boulot,
y'en a un qui sera furax.
Papa !
Quelle bonne surprise
Ça va ? Tu as l'air un peu fatiguée
Tu sais, je travaille à la morgue.
Si la mort prend des vacances,
j'en prendrai aussi.
Carrie c'est un jour qui recommence.
Voici ton emploi du temps,
Pendant le dîner avec Davis, ne l'allume pas.
Il est très sensible. Vas-y mollo.
J'aurais voulu savoir jouer de la guitare.
- Moi aussi
- On peut encore le faire
Ça prendrait des années,
c'est difficile de trouver le temps.
J'ai un peu de temps devant moi aujourd'hui,
ça vous dirai un petit-déjeuner avec moi ?
- Ça me va
- Très bien
Vous devez penser que
je suis vieux-jeu à cause du petit-dèj.
Pas du tout.
Au contraire
Un billet de 20, vous avez de sacrés fans.
En fait c'était plutôt un mec
qui voulait impressionner une fille.
- Une fille ?
- Ils viennent juste de partir.
Vous devez avoir un bon boulot,
avec des horaires à la carte.
Je suis en quelque sorte
un garde du corps.
J'essaie d'empêcher que les choses tournent mal.
Et vous ?
J'étais réceptionniste à St Lukes
jusqu'à hier.
Vous avez démissionné ?
Quels sont vos projets ?
Qui vivra, verra.
Mais, en ce qui concerne aujourd'hui
- J'ai ma liste
- Une liste ?
J'ai comme l'impression
qu'on me cache quelque chose.
Fais-moi voir ça.
Non, c'est personnel.
C'est juste des choses à faire en ville.
Des choses qu'on ne fait jamais
comme visiter la tour eiffel quand on vit à Paris.
Qu'est-ce qui est en premier dans ta liste ?
- Tu ne serais pas en train de t'inviter ?
- Seulement si tu le veux,
- et qu'il ne s'agit ni d'opéra ni de clowns.
- C'est bon, alors tu peux venir.
J'espère que tu aimes les canards morts
C'était sa dernière peinture.
J'ai étudié l'histoire de l'art,
et mon premier coup de foudre
a été pour ce peintre.
J'ai passé une nuit entière
à lire la larme à l'oeil, un bouquin sur ce tableau.
Il voulait ce que chacun de nous souhaite.
Fonder une famille.
À 29 ans, il avait plus de 200 toiles à son actif.
Il n'en n'a vendu aucune de son vivant.
Il s'est suicidé avec du poison,
ignoré de tous.
Convaincu que personne
ne s'intéressait à lui ou à ses toiles,
Il pensait être plus apprécié mort que vivant.
Tu pleures ?
Ça va ?
Toujours aussi courtois.
Je suis Tru Davies.
Megan Roberts, enchantée.
Alors, quoi de neuf Jack ?
- Excuse-moi un instant.
- Oui
Je sais où tu trouves tes infos.
- Tu vois ce que voient les victimes.
- Perspicace.
6 mois pour comprendre.
Laisse-moi deviner,
Tu as vu la toile.
Et comme par hasard
elle est dans le premier musée du coin.
Elle t'a demandé de l'aider, pas vrai ?
C'était évident.
Ils ont du se mélanger les pinceaux là-haut.
Peut-être pas.
- Il y a peut-être une raison à ça.
- Alors tu va l'aider ?
- Aider ne signifie pas forcément sauver.
- Cela signifie quoi d'après toi ?
Je n'en suis pas encore certain,
mais je sais une chose.
Elle ne t'as rien demandé
donc tu n'as rien à faire ici.
À moins que tu veuilles la tuer.
Je ne voudrais pas empiéter
sur ton territoire.
- Le plus dur est devant elle.
- Que dis-tu ?
Elle va se suicider
Comme elle ne veut plus vivre,
tu n'es d'aucune utilité.
Tu avais raison Davis,
Megan Roberts est la victime.
- Elle s'est jetée de la tour Edison.
- Voyons voir. Megan Roberts
28 ans, diplômée d'université
en 1997.
Elle vit en ville
au 1025, Burch Lane
avec Wendy Roberts,
peut-être sa soeur ou sa mère.
Pourquoi quelqu'un qui se suicide
demande de l'aide ?
Elle l'a demandé à la mort en personne,
non à toi.
Une fois morte que pouvait-elle bien
lui demander d'autre ?
Il faut surtout savoir,
en quoi tu peux l'aider.
Je savais que tu traînerais ici.
Incroyable
Alors, quoi de neuf ?
Toujours pareil.
On t'appelle chaque vendredi soir
pour taper le carton mais tu ne viens jamais.
Je sais, j'étais débordé.
- C'est ça
- Non, sérieusement, j'ai un boulot.
- Je bosse pour mon père.
- C'est génial
- On pensait que tu nous snobais.
- Non
2 bières !
Alors, raconte-moi un peu.
- Et Larry ?
- Il est en prison.
- Tu déconnes.
- Il a pris 8 ans.
T'es venu juste boire un coup ?
C'est un peu compliqué.
Je connais ce regard, j'ai compris.
Quel regard ?
Celui qui veut dire <i>j'ai besoin de cash.</i>
- C'est pas ça.
- Reste zen
Laisse faire grand frère Billy.
Ce soir, il y a un coup à faire.
Un camion à décharger.
Non
J'ai mieux.
On va chez moi, on se fait livrer des pizzas
et on regarde le match.
- Comme avant, toi et moi.
- T'en fais pas, viens par ici
Assieds-toi.
Wendy ?
- Oui.
- Tru Davies
J'ai connu Megan à l'université.
- Elle vit ici, non ?
- Oui.
Depuis quand vous ne l'avez pas vue ?
On a échangé nos voeux
par courriers ces dernières années.
En fait je m'inquiétais un peu
car elle n'avez pas donné suite à mes appels.
Et lors de notre dernière conversation
elle semblait distante.
Tout va bien ?
Écoutez,
entrez un instant.
On devrait discuter un peu.
Tu as fini tard ?
- Comme d'habitude.
- Moi aussi.
J'ai pensé
qu'on pourrait dîner ici ensemble ce soir.
- À la morgue ?
- Bien sûr
Ça sera un peu comme un picnic
avec des draps blancs
à la place de la nappe à carreaux rouges.
Vas-y, je te rejoins.
Je dois parler à Megan.
Ne t'en mêle pas.
Elle est mourante.
C'est sa soeur qui me l'a appris.
Elle a une leucémie.
Tu vois, il n'y a rien à faire ce soir,
elle mourra de toute façon.
Tu m'as entendue ?
Oui
- Où est votre billet ?
- Combien il coûte ?
C'est complet depuis 15 jours.
2 billets pour un concert de Jazz.
Personne ?
Je les prends !
Ça alors !
J'ai essayé de t'appeler tout à l'heure.
- Combien pour les tickets ?
- Pour ça ? Rien.
- Tu les veux ?
- Viens avec moi.
Non, je déteste le Jazz.
Moi aussi,
mais c'est comme les endives au jambon.
En grandissant on les apprécie mieux.
Allez viens.
- Tout va bien ?
- Oui
- Tu détestes le Jazz ?
- Non
Est-ce que tu me caches quelque chose ?
Je te dis ça parce que je t'aime bien
et j'apprécie cette journée à 2.
- Alors continuons comme ça.
- J'aimerais bien,
mais j'ai le sentiment
qu'il n'y aura pas de prochaine fois.
Admettons.
Je souhaite te revoir ce week-end.
Que dirais-tu ?
- Je ne pourrais pas ce week-end.
- Où seras-tu ?
Il y à 6 mois,
j'ai appris que j'avais une leucémie.
On me donnait 1 an maximum.
Les premiers symptômes sont vites apparus.
Ma soeur a du quitter son job
pour s'occuper de moi à plein temps.
Cela ne peux qu'empirer.
Certains jours, comme aujourd'hui,
la douleur se calme.
Puis cela reprend.
La plupart des malades
passent leurs derniers mois à l'hôpital.
Sous assistance respiratoire
et perfusion constante.
Je ne mourrai pas comme ça
Cette liste.
Ce sont 10 choses à faire
avant de mourir.
Je n'en ai fait que 4.
Je ne pourrais pas toutes les faire.
Fais les autres à ma place.
Un jour on se reverra,
et tu me raconteras tout.
C'est ta liste,
tu devrais faire toutes ces choses.
Quand j'étais au plus mal ces derniers temps,
Je me suis promis que si je pouvais
encore vivre une belle journée,
j'en profiterais au maximum.
J'ai une assurance vie qui n'est valable
qu'en cas de mort accidentelle.
Elle est de 100 000 $
Ils iront à ma soeur.
- Et tu vas te suicider ?
- Pas tout à fait.
L'assurance ne paie pas en cas de suicide.
Il faut que cela ressemble à un accident.
J'aurais du m'en douter.
- C'est Tru. Une de tes ex ?
- C'est une longue histoire
Quelle coïncidence.
Jack, Megan. Voici Jensen.
- Salut, ça va ?
- Bien, merci.
Après le musée, on se rencontre ici.
On devrait passer la soirée ensemble.
- Je vais chercher à boire
- D'accord.
J'y vais aussi.
Reste avec Megan,
je reviens tout de suite.
- C'est quoi le truc entre eux ?
- Je n'en sais rien,
mais ça doit être une sacrée histoire.
Elle a une assurance vie de 100 000 $
La première fois, on a cru au suicide.
Ce soir, il faut qu'on croit à un accident.
Pour faire marcher l'assurance.
C'est pourquoi elle m'a demandé de l'aide.
Et tu vas le faire.
C'est son souhait.
Elle ne veut pas souffrir.
C'est sa vie, c'est à elle d'en décider.
Je vais lui parler,
que tu le veuilles ou non.
Après toi.
- Tu as une tête très dure.
- Merci, euh... pardon
- Ça va ?
- Oui, je crois
Tu ne devais pas chercher à boire ?
J'ai oublié.
Tu veux bien le faire ?
Je sais que c'est un peu bizarre
mais on s'amuse aussi, non ?
- Pas trop.
- Encore 5 minutes.
Je discute un peu avec Megan
et je te paye un resto.
- D'accord, je vais me rincer la bouche.
- Bonne idée.
Il faut y aller,
y'a une livraison qui nous attends.
Pour ce soir, laisse tomber.
- Tu délires ?
- Non, laisse tomber.
- On va se faire 300$ en 30 minutes.
- Je me doute.
À moins de se faire pincer.
Allez, tu m'as dit que
la moitié de nos potes sont en prison
Billy, t'as joué avec le feu depuis tout petit.
Tu ne t'en tireras pas toujours.
Une autre fois si tu veux mais pas ce soir.
Si je comprends bien,
tu es venu pour me dire ça.
Pour me dire d'arrêter les coups ?
Tu ressurgis du jour au lendemain,
- et tu viens prêcher la bonne parole.
- Je dis juste...
- que tu n'es pas forcé de le faire ce soir.
- Je fais quoi à la place ?
J'appelle mon père pour un job ?
Mais il y a un problème.
Mon père vis sous un abris bus.
La dernière fois, il m'a demandé une pièce
sans me reconnaître.
- On devrait se voir moins souvent.
- J'essaye juste de t'aider.
- Ne me touche pas !
- Désolé pour ton père
Mais écoute mon conseil.
La vie ne donne pas de 2ème chance.
Il n'y en a qu'une seule.
Fais-moi confiance, Billy.
Reste chez toi ce soir.
Je ferai comme je veux.
Alors, entre toi et Jack,
c'est l'amour ou la guerre ?
J'aimerais que cela soit si simple.
Vous avez l'air de bien vous entendre.
Vous vous connaissez ?
Juste aujourd'hui.
C'est fou ce qu'on peut faire en une journée.
Pour info, il n'y a rien entre Jack et moi.
- Donc il est libre.
- Je n'envisage pas de relation.
Parfois c'est plus amusant comme ça.
J'avais un ami très proche
qui est devenu mon petit ami l'année dernière.
Et il est mort.
J'en suis vraiment désolée.
J'étais si furieuse quand il est décédé.
J'avais du mal à respirer.
Peu à peu j'ai réalisé
la chance que j'avais,
d'avoir eu de bons moments avec lui.
Et ce que je pensais impossible arriva.
Quoi exactement ?
J'ai eu une journée formidable.
Alors que je n'y croyais plus.
Parfois, le destin nous réserve
aussi de bonnes choses.
On dirait que Jack t'as dit
que j'étais mourante.
J'ai une assurance vie
et je ne compte pas passer noël.
Je ne remets pas en question
ce que tu as prévu de faire.
Je me doute que ce que tu subis
est inimaginable.
Si il y avait un autre moyen
de toucher cet argent ?
100 000 $ ? À moins d'un braquage,
je ne vois pas comment.
Et si je pouvais le faire ?
Il n'y a pas que l'argent en question.
Je comprends
Mais tu as passé une belle journée.
Tu peux toujours reporter ta décision
à demain, à la semaine prochaine
ou au mois prochain.
Il n'y a aucune raison d'en finir ce soir.
Alors comment ça va ?
De mieux en mieux.
J'étais contente de vous voir,
mais je dois filer.
Maintenant ?
Oui
Pense à ce que je t'ai dit.
Où va-t'on ?
Voir le combat
On laisse tomber le jazz pour voir de la boxe ?
Excellent.
Tant mieux
Merde
50 et 100
Bonjour
Ce qui nous fait...
100 000 $ !
Pas mal
Ce sera sous forme de chèque.
Parfait, mettez le à l'ordre
de Megan et Wendy Roberts
Bien sûr
Tu veux être épatée ?
J'ai gagné 100 $
- C'est super
- Il faut que vous signez ici et ici.
Tu avais parié ?
Oui
Combien t'as gagné ?
Quelques dollars
Tu aurais pu les avoir en liquide.
C'est par rapport aux impôts.
Voilà
Merci
- Tu préfères les chèques ?
- Non, en espèces c'est mieux.
Elles sont fantastiques.
Harrison, tu as été parfait sur cette affaire.
Je suis fier de toi.
Ces gars vont être condamnés ?
Emprisonnés pour la plupart.
Beau boulot, fiston.
Merci
On en est où sur ta liste ?
Il nous reste du temps.
Je sais, mais pour l'instant
je dois voir ma soeur.
J'espère qu'elle ne dort pas.
Wendy ?
Tu ne vas pas le croire.
Ton amie Tru est passée,
et m'a laissé ça.
Elle m'a parlé d'une oeuvre de charité.
La fondation <i>revivez votre journée</i>.
C'est sérieux ?
On dirait bien
Tu te rends compte ?
On aura les meilleurs docteurs,
les meilleurs traitements.
- Et ce voyage en Grèce que tu voulais faire.
- Il était numéro 10 sur ma liste.
On y va !
- Je t'aime tant
- Moi aussi
Cette journée était...
Comment dire ?
C'était bizarre
Je sais, désolée.
Ma vie est parfois déconcertante.
J'avais remarqué
Mais ta présence a été bénéfique.
- Ça l'a rendu presque agréable.
- Presque agréable
Ça c'est du compliment.
Je me comprends.
Je peux aussi être très conventionnelle,
aller au ciné après un resto.
Conventionnelle,
c'est un peu abusé quand même.
Alors ?
Quelle journée
Ça, tu peux le dire.
- On a eu une discussion.
- Avec ta soeur ?
Avec Tru
Elle ma fait réfléchir sur pas mal de choses.
J'ai été égoïste, voire stupide.
Comment ça ?
Je n'ai pensé qu'au problème d'argent.
Maintenant que l'argent est là,
le temps semble plus important.
Je croyais que tu ne voulais pas
d'assistance médicale.
C'est vrai
Mais comme Tru l'a dit,
j'ai toujours le temps de me raviser.
Si il me restait quelques jours à vivre,
avec toi
je ne veux en manquer aucun.
Je voulais m'y rendre seule,
mais maintenant
si tu le souhaites
on pourrait y aller ensemble.
Quand j'étais petite,
mon père travaillait à la tour Edison.
Il m'emmenait au sommet
et me montrait l'horizon,
en me disant que
tous mes rêves se réalisent là-bas.
Tout ce que tu peux imaginer
t'attends là-bas
Il est décédé quand j'avais 10 ans,
mais j'y retourne souvent
pour regarder la ville
et rêver à la vie que je souhaiterais
J'ai suffisamment regardé
je l'ai souvent aperçu.
Viens avec moi ce soir.
Que va-t-on voir ?
L'aube d'un nouveau jour.
Je vais chercher mon manteau
- Allô ?
- Elle allait se suicider
Elle voulait juste que je l'aide à faire
passer ça pour un accident
Félicitations
Mission facile
- Elle a changé d'avis
- Ce n'est pas une option
Je ne vais pas la tuer
Ce n'est pas une option non plus
Tu connais les règles
Oui, un corps appelle Tru à l'aide
et je m'assure qu'il reste mort.
Mais je n'ai pas changé les règles cette fois
Donc pour moi, le client est roi.
Jack, quand le destin est modifié
Il y a des conséquences
Tu es prêt à accepter ces conséquences ?
Tu dois être fort et faire ton boulot
Allez, rendons cette nuit inoubliable
"Le quizz Seigneur des Anneaux"
Qui a guidé les héros
à travers les montagnes vers Minas Thirit
- Je le sais
- Non, on ne dirait pas
- Celebrembor...
- Je t'ai eu. C'est les Gondorians
- Tu as un gage
- D'accord
Sauvé par le gong
- Allô ?
- Davis ?
- Non, c'est Jean Paul II.
- J'ai besoin de ton aide. Tu as bu ?
Juste un petit peu
Je suis avec Carrie
Mais j'ai les idées claires
Je t'écoute.
J'ai réussi à convaincre Megan et Jack.
Mais je vais aller à la Tour Edison
pour m'assurer que tout est normal
Tu sais jusqu'à quelle heure est ouverte
la tour d'observation ?
La tour d'observation est ouverte
de 9h à minuit
Ok, je vais être un peu en retard au boulot
Je vais les surveiller de près
- Vas-y ma poule.
- Vas-y mollo sur la bouteille ok ?
D'accord, salut
- Je dois aller au petit coin
- D'accord
Tru se rend à la Tour Edison
Elle veut y être avant toi
Bien reçu, merci
- Mauvaise nouvelle ?
- Un rendez-vous annulé.
- Ils t'appellent toujours aussi tard ?
- Ils ne dorment jamais
- Je suis ravie que tu ais pris ta journée
- Moi aussi
Sinon, la mienne
se serait terminée tout autrement.
Je vais te dire un secret
Je déteste mon boulot
- Pourquoi ne pas démissionner ?
- Je ne m'en sens pas capable
Prend un peu de temps libre
et réfléchis-y
- Ça ne serait pas la fin du monde
- Je l'espère
Tu ne m'as pas vraiment expliqué
ce que tu faisais
J'aide des personnes, même si la plupart du temps
ils ne s'en rendent pas compte
Je m'assure que leur vie
suit son bon déroulement
- Comme un conseiller ?
- Oui en quelque sorte
Aider les gens
Ça ne semble pas si mauvais
Tu sais ce qu'on devrait faire ?
On devrait fermer nos yeux
Tourner, tendre le doigt, et quelque soit
la direction, nous y allons
Voiture, bateau, train, peu importe
On part à la première heure
Ça serait super
C'est bizarre. J'ai l'impression
d'avoir eu une deuxième chance
- Tu connais ce sentiment
- Oui
Hé Megan
Ta liste
Tu devrais la garder maintenant
- Megan je suis désolé
- Je m'en occupe
- Non attend
- C'est ma liste
Megan attend
Megan, Megan !
- Jack
- Je te tiens
Aide moi
Jack, aide moi
Jack, aide moi
Ne me lâche pas, STP
Je ne peux pas
Je ne peux pas
Je n'ai pas assez de force.
Jack, STP, aidez moi
- Je suis vraiment désolé
- Jack
Tiens là mec
Jack, tiens moi
J'aurai aimé que ce soit toi
Alors on est deux

Randall, droite
- 26
- Allez
Je t'ai eu.
Super, vous êtes fortes
Bonne réception Davies
- Merci, joli lancer.
- Arrêtez avec les compliments
Y'a rien de mal à se renforcer positivement
Je suis sûre que Joe Montana
savait remonter le moral de ses coéquipiers.
Ça devait pas être évident à comprendre
avec les casques et les protège-dents.
Ok, 48 rouge !
48 rouge !
- Tu vas bien ?
- C'est mon poignet qui me fait mal.
Laisse-moi voir ça
Ce n'est pas cassé. Tu as dû distendre
ton ligament radio-carpien.
T'es plutôt forte pour quelqu'un
qui vient d'entrer en médecine
Tu devrais t'arrêter
et mettre un peu de glace dessus
À 10 yards de la victoire ?
Pas question
- Allons-y
- Ok Rambo
Belle partie les enfants
On a rendez-vous au labo.
Personne ne part tant
qu'on n'a pas ressuscité les cadavres.
- Je vais être en retard au boulot
- Tu veux que je t'accompagne ?
- Ouais
- Super
Tu le jures ?
Tu n'avais jamais joué à ce jeu avant ?
- C'était mes débuts professionnels
- Tu es douée.
Et physique en plus.
Ce gars s'en souviendra longtemps.
- Tru ?
- Ce sac
- Quoi ?
- C'est le même que celui du Dr Kendall
Notre médecin de famille
quand j'étais petite
Dès qu'on l'appelait chez lui, il arrivait
avec un sac comme ça
- Vous l'appeliez chez lui ?
- L'homme le plus gentil que je connaisse
Il a été le premier à me dire
que je devais être docteur
- Tu devrais l'acheter
- Je ne suis pas docteur, juste une simple étudiante
Mais un jour, tu le deviendras, non ?
Allez, Davis doit se demander
où je suis
Hey, tu es certain de ne pas vouloir
de glace sur ta blessure ?
Merci, je dois aller faire du volontariat à la clinique
cet après-midi. Je soignerai ça là-bðæÿ¿
Hey Tru, c'est toi ?
- Euh oui
- Oh salut
- Euh... donc, on se voit en cours
- Oui, c'est ça
- A plus tard mec
- Au revoir
- Désolé, je n'avais pas réalisé que vous...
- Pas grave, rien n'est arrivé
Bien évidemment puisque je suis arrivé
au pire moment. C'est un de mes talents
- Je peux te poser une question personnelle ?
- Oui, vas-y
Après que ta femme soit morte
Combien de temps as-tu mis avant de...
voir d'autres femmes ?
4 ans
Mais ça venait plus d'une déficience sociale
qu'autre chose
Ça fait plusieurs mois que Luc est mort
Mais si tu as des sentiments envers quelqu'un
Tu devrais les accepter
Ça me semble juste trop tôt
Ça te semblera toujours trop tôt, que ce soit
aujourd'hui, demain, ou dans 4 ans
- Comment tu sais quand tu es prêt ?
- Tu tombes de nouveau amoureux
FERMÉ
Aide-moi Tru
STP, dis-moi...
STP, dis-moi que tu peux réparer ça
Qu'est-il arrivé ?
Papa m'a fait une remarque sur mes cheveux.
Il a dit, tu as l'air d'un foufou.
En tant qu'employé d'une boîte d'avocats
je me suis dit que j'allais lui faire plaisir
Avoir une vraie coupe
pour une fois
- C'est dur de faire mieux pour moins de 6 $
- Allez Tru
Tu es une fille, tu lis les magazines de mode
Tu dois pouvoir faire quelque chose
Voilà, c'est parfait
- C'est ton nouveau costume ?
- Oui
Oui, je me suis dit au diable
je vais me faire un nouveau look, tu aimes ?
C'est très professionnel
Soyons honnêtes, STP
On sait comment on appelle un gars comme moi
portant ce genre de costume
Un accusé
- Allez Harri, tu n'es pas...
- Comment j'ai pu croire que j'allais changer
Je ne peux pas changer qui je suis Tru
Voyons les choses en face
Tu peux changer.
Tu as changé ta coupe.
- Je n'ai rien dit
- Fais attention, pas maintenant
Je dois y aller
Merci pour la casquette
Pas de quoi.
A plus, cheveux d'ange.
- Oh, désolée
- Ce n'est pas drôle
Harrison, tu as oublié ton...
Avery, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
- Il est mort
- Quoi ? Qui est mort ?
Jensen
Jensen est mort
Ep.2-05 Enough
Tru, je suis vraiment désolé
Je ne suis pas ici pour des condoléances
Je suis ici pour tout réparer
STP, avant qu'il ne m'appelle
dis-moi tout ce que je dois savoir
Selon le rapport de police, il y a eu
un hold-up cet après-midi
et Jensen a été touché à la poitrine vers 17h30
Il est mort pendant le transfert à l'hôpital
Où a eu lieu le hold-up ?
Une boutique,
du côté de Broadway Ouest.
Il y est retourné pour le sac
Il y avait ce sac de docteur
en vitrine
Et il savait que je l'aimais
donc il a dû y retourner pour l'acheter
- J'aurais dû prévoir ça.
- Comment aurais-tu pu le prévoir ?
Tu as déjà oublié la dernière fois ?
Tous ceux auxquels je tiens
sont blessés.
Tous ceux que j'aime sont en danger
juste parce qu'ils me connaissent
- Tu as tort là-dessus
- Vraiment ?
Parce que les faits sont là.
Au cours de ces 4 derniers mois
j'ai perdu Luc et Jensen
- Même Harrison est mort une fois
- Oui, mais tu l'as sauvé
Tout ce que ça veut dire, c'est que j'ai
une chance sur 3 de sauver ceux que j'aime
Tru,  Davis m'a appris la nouvelle
Je suis vraiment désolée
Elle est psychologue. Je me suis dit
que tu voudrais peut-être lui parler
- Tu peux venir à mon bureau si tu veux
- Je ne vais nulle part
Il a besoin de moi
- On devrait discuter dehors
- D'accord
- Ce n'était peut-être pas une bonne idée
- Non, tu as eu raison de m'appeler
- Elle ne veut pas accepter sa mort
- Il faut lui laisser un peu de temps.
Ok, tu fais pour le mieux
Je suis en haut si tu as besoin
- Ici Jack
- C'est moi, j'ai du nouveau
- Depuis combien de temps elle est là ?
- 4 heures
Je  dois y aller. L'avion des parents de Jensen
atterrit dans 30 minutes
Quand je leur ai appris la nouvelle au téléphone
Je n'arrêtais pas de pleurer
Je veux devenir docteur
Je ne peux même pas parler de mort
sans perdre mon contrôle
J'aimerais pouvoir te dire que ça va s'améliorer
Je dois y aller
Occupez-vous bien d'elle
Hey, je viens voir si tu as faim
Tu veux peut-être aller dîner
- Non, pas maintenant, j'ai des choses à faire
- Tu t'en vas ?
Ça fait 4 heures
et il n'a pas appelé à l'aide
Il n'y a pas d'autre corps
donc voici les faits
Si je veux que la journée recommence
je dois trouver d'autres personnes mortes
- Comment tu vas faire...
- La dernière fois que j'ai vérifié
Il y avait 5 autres morgues dans le comté
J'irai à chacune d'entre elles s'il le faut
- Tru
- Je ne vais pas le perdre, je ne peux pas
Bonjour, un paquet pour Davis SVP
C'est gentil, merci
Notre amie fait le tour de toutes les morgues
des alentours ce soir
Ne me raconte pas d'histoires Davis
Je suis au courant pour Jensen
et je sais ce qu'elle essaye de faire
- Elle n'a pas de chance avec ses petit-copains
- Oui, grâce à toi
Oui, l'histoire avec Luc
C'était ma faute, je l'admets
Mais Jensen
C'est le destin qui envoie un message
Non, heureusement pour lui
Tru peut changer le destin
C'est différent cette fois
Elle n'est pas Dieu, Davis
Elle ne peut pas choisir ceux qu'elle veut sauver
Ils doivent la choisir
- Pourquoi me dis-tu tout ça ?
- Deux raisons
Tout d'abord, je me suis dit que
tu serais d'accord avec moi
Au fond de toi, tu sais que ce qu'elle fait
est mal mais tu n'as pas le courage de le lui diðæÿ¿
Ensuite, elle ne fera pas attention à moi
mais, toi, elle t'écoutera
Tu as raison sur une chose
je suis fidèle à Tru.
Si elle a besoin d'aide pour sauver Jensen,
je serai là
Très bien. Je t'aurai prévenu
Je peux t'aider
J'ai juste besoin de plus de temps
Pas de chance avec les autres morgues ?
Désolé
- Tu es fatiguée, tu devrais rentrer
- Je ne peux pas tant qu'un corps n'a pas demandé d'aidðæÿ¿
- Ça pourrait prendre des jours, des semaines
- Je peux attendre
- Tu ne devrais peut-être pas
- Quoi ?
Je sais que tu tiens à Jensen
mais il y a probablement une raison
- pour laquelle il ne t'a pas demandé d'aide
- Je m'en fous qu'il y ait une raison
- Je peux l'aider et je vais le faire
- Tu n'es peut-être pas supposée le faire
Ça serait peut-être une violation des règles
Tu n'es pas inquiète des conséquences ?
Je ne sais pas pour toi
mais je n'ai pas eu de manuel des règles
Moi non plus, mais ça ne signifie pas
qu'il n'y ait pas de règles, Tru
Morgue de la ville
Oui, d'accord
- On vient d'appeler pour un ramassage ?
- Oui, à l'angle de la 3ème et de Haughton.
Je sais que c'est difficile
surtout pour quelqu'un avec tes possibilités
Mais tu dois peut-être accepter
le fait que tu ne peux pas aider Jensen
C'est ce que ta psychologue préférée t'a dit
Que je suis en phase de refus
Et bien elle a raison, je suis en phase de refus
Je n'accepte pas ça
Et tu sais quoi, je le peux
Excuse-moi, j'ai un ramassage
La victime s'est échappée des travaux forcés
en fin de matinée
- C'était un prisonnier ?
- Oui, en travail forcé sur la route 101
Il s'est débarrassé de son mouchard
avec une fourchette, et s'est enfui.
On a perdu sa trace pendant quelques heures,
jusqu'au signalement de la course poursuite.
On sait comment ça s'est terminé.
Il y a d'autres blessés ?
Heureusement, il était seul à la terrasse.
C'était la seule victime.
Il est à vous.
Bon courage.
Tru,
Je me doute que tu dois être en colère,
mais s'il te demande de l'aide
et que tu revis ta journée,
promets-moi de penser à ce que je t'ai dit.
Ne t'en fais pas,
je m'en souviendrai.
Allez, s'il te plaît.
Sauvez-moi !
C'est pas trop tôt.
- C'est moi.
- T'as de la chance,
- je partais à la morgue à l'instant.
- Parfait, j'ai une mission pour toi.
Dis-moi que celui qui a tué Jensen
a été arrêté.
- Ça va être difficile.
- Tu l'as dit.
On a 2 corps sans aucun lien entre eux.
Faut espérer un coup de pouce
du bon dieu.
Comment ça c'est passé ?
Ils ont demandé de l'aide en même temps ?
Exactement.
Désolé pour Jensen, ça fait encore
un de tes amis proches qui est touché.
- Il est encore en vie et je vais le sauver.
- Je sais bien.
Je vais m'occuper du prisonnier.
Je comptais sur Harrison pour s'en occuper.
Pour ses antécédents avec la police,
il a pas mal d'expérience.
D'accord
Je vais avoir besoin de toi pour Jensen.
Pour éviter que le scénario se reproduise,
bien entendu.
- Merci Davis.
- C'est tout ?
Oui, si j'ai du nouveau je t'appelle.
- Pardon.
- Ya pas de mal.
Salut
Pourquoi est-elle si pressée ?
Elle a un match de football au parc.
-  Harri, j'ai besoin de toi.
- Je suis chez le coiffeur.
Ce que dit papa sur ton look
n'est pas à prendre à la lettre.
- Ta journée à recommencé ?
- En effet.
- Et la coupe de cheveux ?
- Pas beau à voir.
- Je t'écoute.
- Un prisonnier va s'échapper d'ici peu,
il fait des travaux d'intérêt général
sur la route 101.
Il est mort à la suite
d'un accident de la route pendant la poursuite.
Quoi d'autre ?
C'est le problème,
je n'ai pas son nom.
- Il faut que tu y ailles.
- Ça ne va pas sembler suspect ?
- Tu es là ?
- Tu trouveras, je te fais confiance.
Dis-moi à quoi il ressemble.
Allez !
48, rouge !
Désolée, c'était pas volontaire.
Faut pas l'embêter, on dirait.
Pas mal Davies.
Je ne soupçonnais pas ça en toi.
Il faut savoir donner des coups bas
pour gagner.
Tu en sais quelque chose.
Trêve de plaisanterie.
Je suis là pour te dissuader
de sauver Jensen.
Sachant tes visions sur mes flashbacks,
comment sais-tu qu'il est mort ?
Il y a plein de façons de le savoir.
Écouter les infos,
se brancher sur la fréquence de la police.
J'ai le même don que toi.
Épargne-moi ton couplet
sur l'ordre des choses.
C'est déjà mal de sauver
ceux qui te le demandent,
mais que dire de ceux qui n'ont rien demandé.
Tu aggraves encore les choses.
J'apprécie la remarque venant d'un homme
qui a tué une leucémique.
Les enjeux sont importants.
On est peut-être adversaires,
mais chacun a ses règles.
Si tu ne les respectes pas,
les conséquences seront terribles pour toi,
et pour Jensen aussi.
- C'est une menace ?
- C'est un fait.
Crois-le si tu veux,
mais j'essaie de te rendre service.
Laisse-moi planifier sa mort.
Pour votre bien à tous les deux.
S'il y avait des règles,
tu aurais payé le fait d'avoir tué Luc.
Donc je sauverai Jensen.
- Je peux vous aider ?
- Non monsieur.
C'est moi qui vais le faire.
Je travaille pour un cabinet d'avocats en ville.
Vous devez connaître.
Non ? Bref.
Un de mes clients qui est en prison,
souhaite une remise de peine
en dénonçant une tentative d'évasion.
- Cela concerne qui ?
- Je n'ai que sa description.
Environ 45 ans, un tatouage sur le bras
avec écrit Mandy dessus.
Si vous ne me croyez pas,
fouillez le gars.
Il a une fourchette qu'il va utiliser
pour s'emparer d'une arme.
Attendez ici.
C'est moi.
- Tout est réglé.
- Le prisonnier va bien ?
Il est sorti d'affaire, à l'instant.
- Merci, tu as sauvé une vie.
- Ça, je le savais déjà.
- Lâche-ça !
- Posez votre arme !
Pose-le au sol.
Prends tes clés.
Détache mes jambes.
Maintenant !
- C'est ta voiture ?
- Oui, en fait c'est une...
Viens par là !
- Voyons, pourquoi faire ça ?
- Monte !
- C'est bon, je monte.
- Tout de suite !
Allez, plus vite.
Vite !
À plus tard les enfants.
N'oubliez pas, on a rendez-vous
au labo pour ressusciter les cadavres.
Si tu veux je peux te déposer
à la clinique avec ma voiture.
Comment sais-tu que je vais bosser là-bas ?
Avery en a parlé.
Elle a dit que tu étais un saint.
Davis m'a donné mon après-midi
donc je suis disponible.
Oui, bien sûr.
Je t'avertis,
c'est plutôt ennuyeux.
Ça me convient parfaitement.
- Vous comptez faire quoi ?
- La voiture doit être recherchée.
Il faut s'en débarrasser.
Bonne idée.
Désolé pour tout à l'heure.
J'étais sous pression.
Ça m'est déjà arrivé.
En fait je déteste les armes.
C'est la première fois
que j'en tiens une.
On aurait pas dit.
Merci pour la voiture.
C'est ton costume ?
- Je peux l'emprunter ?
- Il est à vous, je suis en vie.
Réfléchis.
Que ferait Tru dans cette situation ?
Vous savez, je connais beaucoup de monde
dans cette ville.
Je peux vous avoir ce que vous voulez.
Des faux papiers...
Ça ira, merci.
Je m'en sortirai.
Mais on ne sait jamais,
je viens avec vous.
Non, cela vaut mieux pour vous.
Je vous comprends.
- Mais vous devriez...
- Il y a un truc que je ne pige pas.
Je vous laisse partir et vous refusez ?
Écoutez, je n'aime pas vraiment la police.
En plus, vous me semblez être un mec bien.
Laissez-moi vous aider.
Suis-moi.
T'es vraiment bizarre comme gamin.
On me dit ça souvent.
<i>C'est Harrison, laissez-un message.</i>
Je  n'ai plus eu de tes nouvelles depuis ce matin.
Tout va bien ? Appelle-moi.
Ça va ?
Quelques coupures avec le papier,
sinon ça va.
- Bien.
- Jensen.
Stan Kirby t'attend en salle 1
pour un examen.
Stan Kirby, je m'en charge.
Très bien, Allons-y Monsieur Kirby.
Vous n'êtes pas M. Kirby.
Je doute que vous souffriez d'une sciatique.
- Ça fait plaisir de te voir Jensen.
- Moi de même, Jack. Pourquoi es-tu ici ?
Tout d'abord, je m'excuse
d'être venu de cette façon.
C'était pour éviter la présence de Tru.
- Parce que ?
- Car j'ai besoin de te parler en privé.
Cela concerne Tru.
Elle te cache quelque chose d'important.
Et tu dois savoir.
Tu vois, elle a perdu un proche
il y a peu de temps.
C'était son petit-ami.
Il s'appelait Luc.
- Je ne savais pas ça.
- Normal. Elle ne t'a rien dit.
C'est un peu logique.
Il n'y a rien de bien joyeux dans tout ça.
Mais en fait,
Tru ne s'en est pas remise.
Et depuis cette mort,
elle ne parvient plus
à se confier à personne.
Comment ça ?
Elle est pleine de secrets,
elle s'enfuit sans arrêt sans s'expliquer.
En fait,
Tru est une fille fantastique,
et je pense qu'elle t'aime.
- Je ne veux pas qu'elle sabote votre relation.
- C'est gentil de ta part.
Il y a autre chose que tu dois savoir,
mais...
j'ai un rendez-vous.
Que dirais-tu qu'on en parle plus tard ?
Pour le bien de Tru.
Tant mieux.
Je sais où on pourrait
se donner rendez-vous.
Incroyable !
J'arrive 5 minutes en retard
et mon rendez-vous est annulé.
Épelez-moi votre nom ?
Stan Kirby.
K - I - R - B - Y
C'est étrange, Stan Kirby
s'est présenté il y a 10 minutes.
Je suis Stan Kirby.
Donc cette personne était un imposteur.
- Oups, ce n'est pas la pharmacie.
- C'est ce qu'explique le panneau sur la porte.
Désolée.
Ça ira pour aujourd'hui M. Farmer.
Le docteur va arriver dans un instant.
Très bien.
Je croyais que tu devais voir M. Kirby.
Ils ont dû se tromper de fiche,
ça arrive.
Je dois y aller,
on se voit plus tard ?
On pourrait boire un café ensemble
avant d'aller au labo.
J'ai des livres à récupérer à la bibliothèque.
Viens à la morgue.
Davis a tout ce qu'il faut.
- Je ne veux pas l'embêter.
- Il sera très content.
C'est vrai.
Alors, allons-y.
J'ai déjà vu des films avec des évadés.
Et ils évitent le centre-ville
en pleine journée.
Je dois voir quelqu'un.
- Salut, Barbara.
- Travis !
Je te croyais en...
Qu'as-tu fait ?
Tu le liras demain dans les journaux.
Tu es incorrigible.
- Dis-moi juste où se passe le mariage.
- Non
- Je ferai toutes les églises de la ville s'il le faut.
- Je t'interdis
de gâcher son mariage.
Qui est-ce ?
Un otage.
Un otage ?
Tu viens ici avec un otage.
Jolie coupe de cheveux.
Ils ont un bon traiteur ?
Meilleur que toi.
Tu es ravissante Barbara.
J'appelle la police si tu prends la voiture.
Non, pas de police.
Je vais le faire.
Si vous appelez la police,
on sera poursuivis en voiture.
Il pourrait y avoir des blessés.
Laissez-moi le convaincre
de trouver une solution pacifique.
La voiture a intérêt à revenir intacte.
Promis.
Je voudrais signaler un vol de voiture.
Ça va ?
Oui, j'attends un appel de Tru.
Vous êtes très liés.
Oui, en effet.
Vous êtes sortis ensemble ?
Non, pas du tout.
Alors c'est quoi ?
Tu ne sais pas tout sur Tru.
Elle a un secret.
Je suis le seul à le connaître.
Je t'écoute.
Elle n'est pas vraiment
en poste ici à la morgue.
C'est un peu ma faute,
je n'ai pas rempli son formulaire d'embauche.
- Pardon, on vous dérange ?
- Non.
Vous vous connaissez ?
Jensen, voici Carrie.
- Enchanté.
- Moi de même.
- Est-ce qu'on peut emprunter quelques livres ?
- Oui, dans quel registre ?
Tu as du nouveau ?
Oui, son petit-ami est ici à la morgue.
On a rendez-vous tout à l'heure.
Il faudrait qu'il soit disponible.
- Si tu peux le faire.
- Je le ferai.
Très bien.
Les apparences sont trompeuses.
Oui.
- Ce mariage, de quoi s'agit-il ?
- C'est celui de ma fille, Mandy.
Ça explique votre évasion.
- Qu'allez vous lui dire quand vous la verrez ?
- Rien.
Elle ne sait pas que je suis son père.
Sa mère a épousé David
peu après mon incarcération.
Mandy n'était qu'un bébé,
ils ne lui ont rien dit.
- C'est pas très cool.
- Comme tu dis.
David a pu lui offrir la vie
que je n'aurais pas pu lui donner.
Je lui en suis reconnaissant.
C'est pourquoi je veux juste
assister à son mariage.
Après ça je me rendrai à la police.
- C'est quoi ?
- Une facture d'un fleuriste.
C'était sous le siège.
C'est une grosse commande.
Qui doit être livrée
à Saint-Augustin aujourd'hui.
On connaît le lieu du mariage.
- Je peux vous poser une question ?
- Oui.
Pourquoi avez-vous été emprisonné ?
J'étais chauffeur sur des braquages de banque.
J'ai commencé à ton âge.
Vous n'avez jamais essayé
de retrouver le droit chemin ?
Bien sûr que j'ai essayé !
J'ai compris qu'on ne pouvait pas changer
ce qu'on est.
Mais si on peut changer.
C'est peut-être difficile à croire,
mais, j'ai été pendant un certain temps
fourré dans des mauvais coups.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Maintenant j'ai un job.
Et je m'en sors pas trop mal.
Tu lâcheras prise tôt ou tard.
C'est inévitable pour des gars comme nous.
Bon sang.
Accroche-toi !
Et pour finir,
de la physiologie moderne.
Merci.
C'est lourd.
Je peux te parler un instant ?
Je n'ai plus qu'à lire tout ça.
Un problème ?
À toi de me le dire,
je n'ai pas eu de nouvelles de la journée.
- Pourquoi, c'est obligatoire ?
- Je t'ai laissé 3 messages, sans réponse.
Tout se passe bien.
2 personnes à sauver c'est beaucoup,
même pour toi.
Je ne demande qu'a aider.
Dis-moi s'il y a quelque chose.
Un seul des 2 a demandé de l'aide.
- Et ce n'était pas Jensen.
- Jensen n'est pas mort ?
Il n'a pas demandé de l'aide.
Écoute, je suis désolée de t'avoir caché ça.
Je pensais que tu refuserais de m'aider
si je te l'avais dit.
Voyons,
je sais que c'est toi qui sauves des vies.
Je suis à ta disposition quoi qu'il advienne.
Surtout aujourd'hui.
Où est Davis ?
À côté, il discute avec Tru.
Je vois. Quand ils commencent,
on ne sait jamais quand il vont finir.
Vraiment ?
- Tu as un rendez-vous ?
- Oui, en effet.
Mais je ne veux pas les interrompre.
Je leur dirai, ne t'en fais pas.
Il y avait une autre raison de me cacher ça.
Tu dois douter que ce que tu fais est bien.
Une raison pour laquelle
Jensen n'a pas demandé de l'aide.
- Tu crois que c'était son destin ?
- Pas toi ?
Peu importe la destinée,
vu qu'elle se fiche de ce que je veux.
Comment peux-tu dire ça ?
Regarde ma vie.
Tout ce que je sacrifie pour sauver ces gens.
Mes amis, ma famille.
Tout ça serait le destin ?
Et que me réserve le destin en échange ?
Il emporte mes proches.
D'abord ma mère, puis Luc et Jensen.
La coupe est pleine.
Je me battrai pour Jensen.
Où est Jensen ?
Il est parti,
il avait un rendez-vous avec un ami.
C'est Jack.
J'en suis sûre.
Il a dû le renvoyer à la boutique.
Mais j'ai vu le propriétaire fermer la boutique.
Il a dû le convaincre de rester ouvert.
Touché à la poitrine aux environs de 17h30...
Je vais tenter de l'arrêter.
Essaie d'appeler la boutique.
<i>- Ici la morgue.
- Il n'est pas ici, la boutique est fermée.</i>
Je m'en doutais, ça ne répond pas.
Jack doit être avec lui.
Mais où sont-ils ?
Je crois savoir où.
Sur les lieux de l'accident.
Content de te voir.
Tu as la meilleure place en terrasse.
C'est le boulot.
Je peux ?
- Je me doutais que ce serait toi.
- Ce que tu as fait ce matin n'a pas suffi.
Il s'est évadé et la police le poursuit.
Je suis aux premières loges
si tu vois ce que je veux dire.
Quoi ?
- Je suis dans la voiture avec lui.
- Comment as-tu fait ?
- Comment ?
- J'aimerais bien te raconter tout ça,
- mais je suis un peu occupé en ce moment
- Je suis à 5 minutes
Tiens-le à l'écart de 3rd street
C'est là qu'a eu lieu l'accident hier
Bonne nouvelle
On arrive sur 3rd Street
À propos de notre discussion sur le fait
que je puisse changer.
C'est trop tard.
Avant que l'on commence
Tu veux une bière ?
Ouais, ça serait parfait
Je m'en occupe, je connais le barman.
Reste ici.
Je n'arrive pas à les semer.
Et si on se rendait ?
Ma fille se marie.
Pas question.
Harri ?
Harri, tu es là ?
Attention
JENSEN
- Tu vas bien ?
- Oui, oui
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
- Appelle cela le destin
Ne bouge pas
Je vais voir le conducteur
- Vous allez bien ?
- Ouais
Juste quelques bleus ici et là
T'es sûr ? On ferait mieux d'aller
à l'hôpital pour vérifier cela
Non, non, peut-être plus tard
Travis doit faire quelque chose
Venez
- Elle vaut le detour pas vrai ?
- Oui elle est très belle.
La question est:
Est-ce qu'elle valait cette escapade ?
D'après toi ?
Il est temps pour moi d'y aller.
J'espère ne pas te croiser en prison.
Je vous l'ai dit
- Je ne suis plus ce genre de gars
- Je crois que tu as raison
J'ai pensé que ça t'intéresserait
Deux de sauvés aujourd'hui
Tu dois l'admettre Davis
J'ai sauvé Jensen et ce n'est pas la fin du monde
donc reconnais les faits.
Mes inquiétudes étaient
tout de même justifiées.
Mais en y repensant
Si je pouvais revivre des journées
Et que Carrie était morte le premier jour
J'aurais probablement agi comme toi
En parlant de Carrie, je pense
qu'il est temps de lui dire la vérité
- à quel sujet ?
- Sur ce qu'on fait ici
- On ne la connait même pas
- Je tiens à elle
Et elle pourrait être d'une grande aide
Si elle avait su pour Jensen
Elle ne l'aurait pas laissé partir aujourd'hui
Davis
Ok, d'accord, au moins
j'aurai demandé
Je dois y aller
Je vais être en retard pour mon cours
A demain
- Contente de te voir aussi Avery
- Merci Tru, merci beaucoup
Je leur ai raconté que tu m'avais sauvé la vie.
Mais si ça n'avait pas été le cas, on aurait tous
eu notre semestre et ça aurait été cool auðæÿ¿
Ouais
je dis juste...
Hey, ça va ?
Oui, je crois que j'ai dû me fouler
quelque chose quand tu m'as poussé
- Désolée pour ça
- Pas grave, je préfère ça
- Je peux regarder ?
- Oui, vas-y, ne te gène pas
- Quoi ?
- C'est étrange
J'ai l'impression d'avoir
déjà vécu cette scène
Tu penses l'avoir déjà fait avant ?
Oui, mais exactement ça
Toi, moi, la blessure, tout
- C'est fou, hein ?
- Ouais, fou

Quelque chose se trame Tru
Je peux le sentir
Vendredi prochain
C'est la fin
Pour toujours
L'important pour le moment
C'est qu'elle me fait confiance
Salut papa
Tru Calling, la fin
[Theme music]
[Somber instrumental music]
MOTHER: <i>Tru?</i>
TRU: Yes.
MOTHER: <i>It's okay, Tru.</i>
TRU: Okay, Mommy.
PRlEST: Before her time, to a person....
-[Whispering] She forgave me.
-[Whispering] What?
-Who?
-Mom.
She forgave me
for not being able to help her...
and she said she's okay.
You have a vivid imagination.
But Mom was murdered, in front of you.
What part of that is okay?
PRlEST: ...a wife and mother...
taken before her time.
God, he's so full of crap.
TRU: l just wish--
MERE: You just wish what?
That l could go back to that day
and help her.
You can't.
None of us can.
PRlEST: ''A time to be born,
and a time to die.''
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
TRU: Hey, the garbage man says
the elevator's out again.
NElGHBOR: Elevator's out.
PROFESSOR: <i>Dominick Barren.</i>
PROFESSOR: <i>EIizabeth Christianson.</i>
<i>Tru Davies.</i>
Where is she?
PROFESSOR: <i>Tru Davies.</i>
[Tense instrumental music]
[All cheering]
[Fast-paced instrumental music continues]
TRU: l've got a drinking game.
lt's called ''You graduated from college
and your family didn't show up.''
A drinking game, or ''Next on Dr. Phil''?
l'm so sorry, Tru. l know
they missed all your track meets, but....
To be expected.
Harrison probably met a girl...
Meredith probably met a client,
and my father....
No acknowledgment of children
from his first marriage.
Thanks, Cameron, but l think l'm out.
-Already? But we just got here.
-What?
lnternship starts tomorrow at the hospital.
l thought l'd make a nice first impression
by not showing up hung over.
Tru? Prof. Evans.
Lindsay, would you stop it already?
She thinks l've got a thing for him.
But l've told her,
professors aren't exactly my type.
Good night, guys.
And congratulations. We made it.
[Lindsay whoops]
[Alarm blares rock music]
[Sighs]
[Neighbors moaning in ecstasy]
[Bed creaking]
Unbelievable.
MARK: Congratulations.
Yesterday, you were an ethics violation...
and today you are a faculty girlfriend.
[Tru chuckles]
l meant what l said, Tru. Now that
you graduated, we could go public.
l'm sure the Dean
will be very happy to hear it.
Well, the Dean's opinion
no longer matters.
ln fact, l'm gonna see her tonight
at the faculty banquet.
Maybe it's time l told her about you.
TRU: What are you gonna say?
MARK: Not a word.
l'm just gonna show her
those Polaroids that l took.
[Cell phone ringing]
WOMAN: [On TV] <i>HeIIo, and weIcome to</i>
<i>another</i> Monday Morning Money.
TRU: Hello?
HARRlSON: <i>Tru, it's your favorite brother.</i>
l'm in a bit of a situation.
What's it this time, Harrison?
Don't tell me you played cards all night.
No, not all night.
HARRlSON: Just since 2:00.
Look, whatever you have would help,
$1,000, $200 even.
<i>It's just a Ioan.</i>
<i>I'm teIIing you, Tru. I am on a streak today.</i>
lf you're on a streak,
why do you need to borrow money?
<i>You know I don't have that kind of cash.</i>
l have to get to the hospital.
But l'll see you tonight, right?
HARRlSON: <i>Yeah, right. Sure.</i>
Anyway, l'll go Plan B on this one.
<i>ProbabIy shouId've started there anyway.</i>
<i>And Tru?</i>
l hope it was nice yesterday.
-l would've been there if l could, but--
-l know, Harry.
TRU: You lost your funding?
But my internship.... What happens now?
DR. GREEN: l'm sorry, Tru. Really.
l know. You were counting on this job...
for a little cash and credibility
for med school.
There's this other job l heard about.
Now don't get excited,
it may not be the exact right fit.
You were a track star, right?
Well, why don't you run down,
see this guy as soon as you can?
DR. GREEN: Tell him l sent you.
lt's a good job?
Trust me. People would die for it.
DAVlS: You ever been to a morgue before?
Just once, when l was 12.
Well, that sounds like a story.
Are you sure
you're interested in working here?
Because, l'll be honest, most girls
as pretty as you that come here....
Well, they're dead.
l'll be applying to medical school
in the fall...
and my advisor thought
it might be a good idea.
What?
Your eyeliner. ls that MAC Number 5?
Seven.
Seven. Nice.
DAVlS: The opening is for a forensic
attendant, who retrieves the body...
weighs it, measures it,
attaches the toe tag...
charts the vitals,
and collects the standards.
''Standards''?
Head hair, pubic hair, nail clippings.
And then they prepare the body
for storage.
DAVlS: lt's called the crypt.
lt's where every unnatural death
in the city comes to rest...
waiting for an autopsy.
-You said ''unnatural death''?
-Most of them.
DAVlS: Because if there's even a hint
that a death might be unnatural...
murder, suicide, they come here.
-So every crypt....
-Has a body. That's right.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
[Davis sighs]
Can you imagine the pain
of losing someone before their time?
Bottom line...
most of these people
shouldn't be dead yet.
Go ahead, you can open one.
[Rhythmic instrumental music swells]
DAVlS: <i>I need you to start tonight.</i>
<i>The graveyard shift.</i>
-And you're going to take it?
-l just told you l was.
l mean, if it looks good to medical schools,
who am l to say no?
Look at me. lf l don't get some sleep soon,
l'm gonna get bags under my bags.
You haven't been sleeping again?
Let's not play this game tonight, okay?
l feel good.
Hey, Tru.
Remember when it didn't take her
death anniversary to get us all together?
l'll see you inside.
Mere, you forgot your...
[Somber instrumental music]
bag.
So, what's Harrison's excuse this time?
A girl? A truckload of DVDs?
A girl with a truckload of DVDs?
Well, l guess we all
deal with the anniversary differently.
-Harrison plays cards.
-You pretend it didn't happen.
And you,
l guess you'd call them old habits.
You went through my bag? Damn it, Tru.
What are you doing?
People like you can't just use once, Mere.
Or didn't they teach you that in rehab?
l'm sorry. Look, l just....
You must be doing something right.
You've got a great career, lots of money--
You know,
maybe Harrison had the right idea.
-He doesn't even pretend anymore.
-Don't walk out, Mere. Please, we can....
[Cell phone rings]
Hello.
Harrison? Oh, my God, look at you.
TRU: Hospital called and said--
HARRlSON: l prayed for a 10 of clubs...
and this is what l get.
A nice reminder
of why l don't believe in God.
Ten of clubs? What happened?
They did this to you?
Those guys you were playing cards with?
TRU: l'm coming with you.
HARRlSON: No, Tru.
Harrison, look at you.
You had your chance, Tru.
You can't help me now.
DOCTOR: Clear.
[Defibrillator whining]
MARCO: First one?
Congratulations.
But they're all not as pretty as...
Rebecca Morgan.
What happened to her?
MARCO: You mean, aside from the cap
in the back of her neck? Nothing.
The neighbors heard a gunshot
around 10:00.
<i>We found her in her apartment.</i>
lt's a nice one-bedroom,
if you know anyone.
Do me a favor.
Hold that bag open, will you?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Do you know who did it?
You're new here,
so maybe nobody told you.
We don't solve the crime.
We just deliver the body.
MARCO: Anyway, have a good night....
TRU: Tru.
Tru? Catchy.
But wait. You're leaving?
<i>Because Davis said</i>
<i>my first night I wouIdn't be aIone.</i>
You won't be.
You'll have 32 friends right next door.

[Eerie instrumental music]
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOlCE: <i>Tru.</i>
TRU: Hello?
TRU: Marco?
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOlCE: <i>HeIp.</i>
Very funny, hazing the new girl.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOlCE: <i>HeIp me.</i>
[Eerie instrumental music continues]

GHOSTLY FEMALE VOlCE: <i>HeIp me.</i>
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOlCE: <i>Save me.</i>

Help me.

[Bed creaking]
MARK: Congratulations.
Yesterday, you were an ethics violation...
and today you are a faculty girlfriend.
But l meant what l said, Tru.
Now that you graduated, we can go public.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
What's wrong?
What was l thinking?
l never should have taken that job.
-What job?
-At the morgue.
The graveyard shift.
That place creeps me out.
The morgue? Sweetie, your internship
starts this morning at the hospital.
No, Green's funding was cut.
The job has been eliminated.
l saw him yesterday.
Yesterday was Sunday.
You graduated yesterday.
MARK: You had a drink with some friends,
you went to bed with me.
MARK: Nobody had to go to work
at a morgue.
lt was just a bad dream,
or one too many margaritas.
TRU: Yeah, it just seemed--
MARK: By the way...
tonight's the faculty banquet, and
l think it's time the Dean knew about you.
TRU: Tonight?
MARK: Actually l wasn't gonna say a word.
<i>I was just gonna show her</i>
<i>the PoIaroids that I took.</i>
[Cell phone ringing]
WOMAN: [On TV] <i>HeIIo, and weIcome to</i>
<i>another</i> Monday Morning Money.
TRU: Hello?
HARRlSON: <i>Tru, it's your favorite brother.</i>
l'm in a bit of a situation.
We were through this yesterday, Harrison.
l don't have that kind of money.
HARRlSON: What are you talking about?
Look, are you mad
because l didn't go to your graduation?
<i>And your second number...</i>
TRU: Four.
HARRlSON: <i>Are you Iistening?</i>
WOMAN: [On TV] <i>...is four.</i>
HARRlSON: <i>Tru?</i>
Listen, Harrison,
maybe you shouldn't go back to that table.
Maybe you should walk away now.
Yeah. See you, Tru.
WOMAN: [On TV] <i>Your third number...</i>
TRU: Twenty-nine.
<i>...is 29.</i>
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
TRU: <i>You never met me?</i>
l have never met you.
Then again, l haven't been
going to the gym lately so....
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
MAC Number 7.
The crypt. This way, right?
You sure you haven't worked
in a morgue before?
So this is the crypt. This is where every....
<i>Is there something I can heIp you with?</i>
Last night,
a woman named Rebecca Morgan died.
TRU: She was brought here.
DAVlS: A friend of yours?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Who was on duty last night?
Marco, l think.
<i>No, she never came in.</i>
You said.... l mean, someone said...
that the bodies brought here,
they're unnatural deaths.
Some of them, yes.
So those people
shouldn't actually be dead.
Not yet, anyway.
ls it hard to see people dead
before their time? Yes.
<i>But if you're gonna work here...</i>
you've got to accept the fact
that there's nothing you can do about it.
<i>That was a job offer,</i>
<i>in case you missed it.</i>
TRU: What happened to her?
The neighbors heard a gunshot at 10:00.
The truth is we're shorthanded...
and you seem
to already know the operation.
TRU: l'll take it.
DAVlS: Great.
DAVlS: l'll need you tonight.
Tru?
303 West 23rd Street.
LlNDSAY: <i>Who is she?</i>
TRU: l don't know yet. Hopefully, no one.
LlNDSAY: <i>Each time I hope</i>
<i>someone is no one...</i>
they always turn out to be someone.
Maybe you'll have better luck.
So anyways, are you really serious
about this job at the morgue?
Because l got to be honest...
l think it's really gonna cut into
our post-college slacking off.
TRU: <i>Lindsay, I'II caII you back.</i>
Oh, Tru.
Tru?
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
She's alive.
TRU: For another 10 hours.
[Fast-paced instrumental music continues]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Dialing phone]
WOMAN: <i>HeIIo?</i>
Coffee, please.
REBECCA: You okay?
TRU: Yeah.
l'm just having a strange day.
Maybe you'd like something
a little stronger than coffee, then.
Coffee's fine.
The truth is l shouldn't complain.
l have this friend
who's about to have a worse day...
and she doesn't even know it yet.
-This is gonna sound crazy, but--
-Hold on.
Hello? What are you....
Aaron, we've been through all this.
No, l can't do this right now.
<i>Goodbye, Aaron.</i>
[Suspenseful instrumental music
continues]
Some people just don't know
when it's over.
Rebecca, l'm gonna tell you something.
How do you know my name?
We know each other?
That friend about to have the bad day--
Hey.
You know what, never mind. My bad.
REBECCA: <i>HeIp me.</i>
l don't know how to say this,
so l'm just gonna say it.
-You're gonna die today, Rebecca.
-What did you just say?
You have to trust me.
Maybe we can stop it. We have nine hours.
-You asked for my help. Now l need yours.
-l asked for your help? You're crazy.
Just tell me
why someone would want to hurt you.
REBECCA: Gary?
TRU: Why would they want....
REBECCA: Can you come here?
GARY: What's up?
REBECCA: There's this girl
saying strange things.
GARY: What girl?
REBECCA: The one right at the bar.
REBECCA: Come outside.
GARY: What did she say?
REBECCA: She said l was gonna die today.
GARY: What? Where?
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
lt would've been perfect with Rebecca...
if only l could've convinced her
to fall in love with me.
lt's funny. Tru, right?
She never mentioned you before.
Well, l just started there. Weekends.
Gary thought we needed some extra help.
What kind of trouble do you think she's in?
lt's hard to say. l know it's a long shot...
but do you know anyone
who would want to hurt her?
No, although she didn't need any help
in that department.
She beat herself up
over the smallest things.
Bad day, blow an audition.
-Actors, sure.
-Dance. She's a dancer.
Well, thanks.
Like l said,
she'd kill me if she knew l was here so....
lt's funny. A girl's in trouble,
and everybody suspects the ex-boyfriend.
Aaron, no, that's not what--
No, l'm saying lucky for me
l'm not the only one.
His name's Elliot Winters.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
Do you have a résumé for me,
or should l just call security?
Actually, l'm not here for an interview.
l'm here about Rebecca.
-Rebecca?
-Rebecca Morgan.
l'm not passing judgment. Obviously--
My daughter's dance teacher.
Why would you....
Okay, l don't understand.
So you two weren't....
Was she interested? Sure.
Was l flattered? Absolutely.
But those pictures over there
aren't for show.
ELLlOT: That's my life.
l don't know what she told you...
but sometimes being a good friend
means not listening so closely.
<i>Anyway, Iots to do.</i>
<i>So why are you so worried</i>
<i>about Rebecca?</i>
Because she's gonna die today.
Don't worry about calling security.
l'll show myself out.
Are you sure you're okay?
My God, that actually sounds
like genuine concern.
Wait a second. Who is this,
and what have you done with my sister?
lt's just, l know how stressed you get.
Especially today.
MERE: <i>I can't taIk right now, Tru.</i>
<i>I'II see you tonight, okay?</i>
And call me crazy, but l actually think
Harrison's gonna make it this year.
[Tru gasps]
You tell your friend Rebecca
that if this is a threat...
it's not gonna work.
We've been down this road before,
she and l. We're over. Done.
lf she insists on going to my wife,
l'll do everything in my power to stop her.
ELLlOT: Everything.
[Elevator bell dings]
[Gasping]
l'll see you.
[Tense instrumental music]
Can't win them all, right?
Where's the fun of that?
Guys, relax.
HARRlSON: She's my sister.
TRU: <i>Leave now.</i>
l'm telling you,
cash in and walk away now.
Are you kidding me?
You saw the stack of chips l had in there.
l'm up!
Now, Harry.
You're up now, but it's not gonna last.
l thought you said you were short.
-l took a marker from the house.
-What?
A loan.
Great, so you're playing
with house money.
Are you okay?
HARRlSON: ls everything okay?
TRU: l'm having a day, Harrison.
A day l'd gladly explain to you if l could...
but l can't, so l'm not even gonna try it.
And l heard another voice.
Wait.
l don't understand. You mean, like Mom?
TRU: <i>Okay, Mommy.</i>
No, not her. Someone else.
Dead?
-Oh, boy.
-And that's not even the half of it.
Believe it or not,
that's the half that makes sense.
l don't get it. Me, of all people,
why do they come to me?
Maybe because they know
that you'll listen.
[Soft instrumental music]
Do you think l'm crazy?
l never thought you were crazy.
l gotta get back, okay?
Just do me a favor. Slow down the betting
to give me more time.
-For what?
-For figuring out a way to save your ass.
TRU: <i>Gary, I reaIIy need to taIk to her.</i>
l told you, she wasn't feeling well.
Needed some air.
<i>It seems to be happening a Iot IateIy.</i>
ANNOUNCER: [On TV] <i>One-one deIivery.</i>
TRU: What's the score?
GARY: Seven-one, Sox. Top of the ninth.
l'll bet you $100 they lose.
-What, are you crazy?
-Maybe. Don't know yet.
REBECCA: Sorry, Gary. l lost track of time.
GARY: This girl says she knows you.
Stay away from me. Don't come near me.
l know you don't understand.
Me, neither, but l wanna help--
You want to help?
Why don't you start by leaving me alone?
GARY: You know what,
maybe you'd better listen to her.
TRU: Gary, she's in trouble.
And she has no idea how much.
GARY: Why should l believe you?
TRU: All right. Here's the thing.
lf the Sox win, l'm good for the $100.
But if they lose, you help me.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
MAN: Got a letter for Meredith Davies.
Tru, this is a surprise.
Guess l thought it was about time
l saw your office.
l see. Trying to make me feel guilty
about missing your graduation?
-l'm sorry, Tru--
-God, what happened to us?
We used to be close, all of us.
Now l find myself doing more for strangers
than l do for my own family.
What are you talking about?
Any second, someone's gonna
hand you an envelope.
An envelope with coke inside.
Just don't touch it, Mere.
Tru, your newfound concern is touching.
MERE: lt's psychotic, but touching.
Because no one is bringing me coke.
Much less an envelope full of it
to my office. Really, Tru, trust me.
Boy, you have some imagination,
you know that?
You know, l'm not sure
where you get all your facts but....
[Somber instrumental music]
ls this how you get your kicks?
By convincing yourself you're not
the most screwed-up one in the family?
You can't fix people, Tru.
You can't save them.
Not Mom 10 years ago, not me.
And at this rate,
probably not even yourself.
-Why do l think you're lying to me?
-l shouldn't have looked through the files.
TRU: l just have a few questions.
DAVlS: What about? Unsolved murders?
TRU: Exactly.
DAVlS: <i>So Iet me get this straight.</i>
DAVlS: ln the eight hours
since you've been here...
you've decided to solve old cases?
<i>Very ambitious.</i>
You know what l did today?
l bought socks.
TRU: l'm just curious.
What can you say about a woman
who comes in with a bullet in her neck?
-That she's dead?
-Davis.
Okay, fine. Bullet in the neck.
l'm guessing
her death was execution style.
Meaning she did something to someone
to make them angry.
DAVlS: Small caliber bullet. Probably a .22.
How so?
From what you said,
there was no exit wound.
The bullet just lodged itself in her neck.
<i>And I'II be honest with you.</i>
<i>You don't have to go through this troubIe</i>
<i>to impress me.</i>
<i>AII I need is for someone</i>
<i>to show up to work on time.</i>
Davis, thanks. l gotta run.
DAVlS: A pretty girl's nothing but trouble.
[Tense instrumental music]
Beaten up. What?
-How could you possibly know that?
-Just trust me, okay?
And take this.
TRU: Think of it as an answer to a prayer.
HARRlSON: There are 52 cards in a deck.
The chances of this saving me
from a beating....
Have a little faith in your sister, okay?
Remember when l said you weren't crazy?
l may have to rethink my position,
you know.
[Cell phone rings]
How the hell did you know
the Sox were gonna blow it?
TRU: Where is she, Gary?
GARY: <i>She went to see Winters.</i>
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Charles, hello.
Mrs. Winters: lt's wonderful.
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>
[Cell phone rings]
Want to know what's worse than watching
academics congratulate themselves?
lt's watching them eat.
Are you feeling any better?
This morning you seemed a little--
l can't even begin to describe to you
what this day's been like.
-Don't worry. lt'll be over soon enough.
-Yeah, let's hope so.
Mark, l gotta go.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
Don't do it. He'll kill you.
l still don't understand
how could you possibly know...
that Elliot would kill me?
Let's just say
l've seen what he's capable of.
lt's amazing how charming a man can be
when he wants to get in...
and how callous he can be
when he wants to get out.
God, l thought going there
would change his mind.
AARON: Rebecca.
[Rebecca sighs]
-Aaron, what are you doing here?
-l was worried about you.
l thought you said
you couldn't find that key?
She came to see me,
said you might be in some sort of trouble.
REBECCA: l'm fine, Aaron.
Everything's fine. You can go now.
AARON: l don't want to leave.
l want to work things out.
You don't have to be alone,
especially now.
REBECCA: l'm not gonna start this again
with you. l want you to go.
AARON: Rebecca, l came here to help you.
TRU: No, you didn't.
[Tense instrumental music]
He came here to kill you.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
What are you talking about? This is crazy.
Right. About as crazy
as the .22 caliber in your pocket.
-What, this?
-Oh, my God.
This is for you to protect yourself.
Don't be so blind, Rebecca. You need this.
You know what he's capable of. Elliot.
Why don't you give me the gun, Aaron?
And by the way,
who the hell are you really?
You think you're doing her a favor,
messing with her life?
lf you ask me,
l think it's a really good way to get hurt.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
One.
Elliot would never hurt me. lt's you, Aaron.
What are you talking about? What is me?
Why are you defending him?
You're always defending him...
-even after what he did to you!
-Did to me?
-He didn't do anything to me. l'm just--
-Pregnant.
You're pregnant.
Folic acid prescribed for pregnancy.
Aaron, listen to me.
You don't even know it...
but you're getting a second chance
to not kill two people...
so just give me the gun.
Becky, l never wanted to hurt you.
l just wanted to help, you know that.
You need to go, Aaron. Now.
No, just leave him.
Lock the door.
Stay inside and call the police.
He has to go home some time.
What?
l just realized.
l never said ''thank you.''
[Slow instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Speaking in Asian language]
Mr. Chiang wants to remind you...
all debts must be settled immediately
following the last hand.
Yeah, l got the memo.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Harrison whoops]
HARRlSON: A pleasure, fellows.
<i>How did you know?</i>
l mean, the 10 of clubs. Right there.
Seriously, how did you know?
Let's just say
l've been a step ahead of everyone all day.
Of course, l didn't make a dime.
Every penny l won went back
to the Tram to pay off the marker.
There's a story here, right?
Yeah, there's a story.
l almost didn't recognize you guys.
l said, ''That can't be my family.
Too much damn happiness.''
-lt was good to see you today, Tru.
-Was it?
MERE: Yeah, it was.
See, l told you
Harrison was gonna show this year.
l'll be right back. Order me a club soda.
You and Meredith, getting along?
Just when l thought
things couldn't get any stranger....
[Sniffing]
[Somber instrumental music]
Do you ever think
Mom's still watching us?
God, l hope not...
because l'm not sure
she'd like what she sees.
Yeah.
Maybe she's trying to change that.
[Cell phone rings]
HARRlSON: That's a nice outfit, by the way.
TRU: Hello?
Hi, is this a bad time?
Because l can call back.
No, it's fine.
<i>Is everything okay, Davis?</i>
Yeah, l was thinking about that girl,
you know, the dead one?
And l thought of another reason
there might not be an exit wound.
What's that?
Order what you want. l'll split it with you.
You know the entry wound in her neck?
DAVlS: Maybe that wasn't an entry wound.
Maybe that was an exit wound.
That would mean
the bullet went through--
Her mouth. Yes, exactly.
<i>Which, if you ask me, sounds seIf-infIicted.</i>
-Meaning it wasn't a homicide.
-lt was suicide.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music]
The thing is
l always wanted to be a mother.
[Melancholic instrumental music]
A house, the kids, all of it.
My only mistake was believing
that he wanted it, too.
Rebecca.
REBECCA: Maybe he did.
Just not with his mistress.
Because when l told him about the baby...
he made it clear that's all l ever was.
But it's not all you're gonna be.
You're gonna be a mom, Rebecca.
Take it from someone
who lost hers way too soon.
You're supposed to live.
<i>There's no better reason to.</i>
Your mother?
Was killed...
ten years ago, in front of me...
by a man they never found.
lt wasn't her time then...
and it's not yours now.
Rebecca, will you give me the gun?
[Clock ticking]
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Door opens]
MARCO: Hey, you new here?
TRU: Sort of. Do you mind?
An eager one.
Go ahead. Knock yourself out.
MARCO: We found her in her apartment.
You should've seen this place.
lt was a nice one-bedroom,
if you know anyone.
<i>Cancer. It's a bitch.</i>
So, first one?
No. Second.
MAN: [On radio] <i>It's sunny and miId on</i>
<i>this beautifuI Tuesday morning, May 27.</i>
<i>Traffic copter reports</i>
<i>no major deIays en route.</i>
[Soft instrumental music]
TRU: <i>It's been the strangest day.</i>
<i>An understatement, I know.</i>
<i>Did you have anything to do with it?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I onIy know I wish this day had come</i>
<i>10 years earIier.</i>
<i>Then maybe I couId've saved you, too.</i>
<i>Instead I'II wait...</i>
<i>for others.</i>
<i>Some who have needed me</i>
<i>Ionger than most.</i>
<i>So maybe I couIdn't save you.</i>
<i>Maybe, just maybe...</i>
<i>this is your way of saving me.</i>
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Rock music]
[Loud rock music playing]
Actually, it' a summer internship...
but sky's the limit. That would be me,
you know? lt's always....
-What's going on?
-Come on. lt's time.
-Okay. Call me.
-l will.
She's not gonna call me.
Move. Watch it!
l didn't miss it, did l? Did l miss it?
No, you did not.
- Where the hell is Blake?
- Late.
-Why should tonight be different?
-Because it's our last night together.
BLAKE: Hey, sorry l'm late.
- l ran into my ex.
ETHAN: Which one?
To be honest,
l can't even tell them apart no more.
All right, glasses up.
Gentlemen, it took us four years.
Excuse me, Ethan, five.
But as of tonight, we are free men.
The scenery may change,
but our friendship won't.
To the best night of our lives!
[All cheering]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Pretty out here.
l should get outside more often.
Harrison, l came here to talk.
Okay, someone dies, asks for help,
and you repeat a day.
There, we talked.
Not quite what l meant by talking.
We all have our things:
HARRlSON: Meredith has her drugs,
l have....
l got everything else.
And you got this:
your strange belief that you go back a day
and save innocent lives.
l know where it comes from.
No one expected you to save her, Tru.
This is not about our mother.
l took a semester of psych
back in high school.
HARRlSON: lt's always about
someone's mother.
Maybe you should just try
and leave the past alone.
l can't...
because it won't leave me alone.
[Theme music]
Help me.
[Door opening]
[Pop music playing softly]
Who would have thought of hiding
the spare under the doormat?
You might consider a lighting fixture.
Both unique and efficient.
Please tell me you brought coffee.
Blueberry Danish,
tuna, dry on whole-wheat...
and a veggie burrito
from that place you like on Larkin.
With your bizarre hours, l couldn't decide
what meal you'd be on by now.
You are a good woman.
So, how are you?
-Pick a subject.
-l'll take ''Boys'' for $200.
Okay, l know Evans didn't end well,
but you have to get back out there.
l just read
in a very legitimate publication...
that one out of every seven guys
is a keeper.
More like one in a million.
Look, l gotta shower.
ls there anything you want to say to me?
Yes. Thank you for my breakfast goodies.
You're welcome.
That's what friends are for.
Nasty.
WHlSPERlNG VOlCE: Tru.
[Tense instrumental music]
Gardez?
[Tru screams]
Oh, my God!
[Laughing]
ls everything all right here?
Yeah, Gardez is an ass.
Everything's normal.
-You should've seen the look on her face.
-Hysterical.
GARDEZ: Tru, come on. Lighten up.
[Pager beeping]
Looks like l got a pickup. A real one.
-You okay?
-Yeah, whatever.
Davis, do you think he's right?
Do you think
l take everything too seriously?
Gardez sees dead bodies.
You see the people they used to be.
He doesn't understand that.
But you do?
Just don't let him get to you.
[Soft instrumental music]
MEREDlTH: Hi, come on in.
l know we're all working late
these days, Meredith...
but the firm's board is insisting...
that we implement a random
drug-testing program for our employees.
Now?
Unbelievable. Can l have my assistant
back when he's done?
Actually, we're all being tested.
Liability issue.
[Slow instrumental music]
BOSS: Just check in at the table
in front of the restrooms.
Yeah, sure.
Nice.
Did l do that yesterday?
Harrison.
lt's a reasonable question,
for someone like you.
-You gotta admit, it's frigging weird.
-l told you, not every day repeats.
ln fact, most of them don't.
HARRlSON: That's too bad.
'Cause if your little fantasy was real,
today would be a hell of a day to do over.
-What do you mean?
-You know, the whole Meredith thing.
HARRlSON: She didn't tell you?
Drug test at her office today.
She failed it and they fired her.
Oh, my God.
HARRlSON: So you see my point?
You could actually go back today,
bail Meredith out...
and we wouldn't be
having this conversation.
Harrison, l can't control when it happens.
So what do we do?
TRU: Nothing tonight.
We'll check in with her tomorrow.
See how she's doing.
What if tomorrow is just today
all over again?
Bite me, Harrison.
DAVlS: Can l ask you a question?
Sure, Davis, anything.
Does this lab coat make me look portly?
No, you look fine.
l just overheard you mention
that black was more....
l think you called it ''slimming.''
DAVlS: l was gonna see
if they came in a different color, maybe.
Gardez must have been driving
all over the city.
Actually, they all came in
on the same pickup.
lt's five dead males, mid-to-late-20s.
Time of death is between 10:30 and 1 1 :00.
l lifted the personals,
if you want to start bagging.
TRU: Any lDs?
DAVlS: Wallets were missing.
The prelim tox report shows four of them
had pretty high levels of alcohol.
Enough to kill them?
DAVlS: Probably not.
But there is something strange
about this fifth guy.
He had no alcohol in his system...
but he did have a trace
of a chemical called Avlocardyl.
One of them was married.
DAVlS: That's a shame.
What else can you tell me?
[Soft rhythmic instrumental music]
TRU: And one of them was making friends.
ls there anything you want to say to me?
l suck.
[Knocking on door]
Hello.
-l'm looking for Gardez. ls he....
-Out on a pickup.
Can l take a message?
MAN: Sure, yeah.
l'm a friend of a friend.
He hooked me up with a job interview...
and in case l don't get the gig...
l thought l'd thank him
while l was still in town.
Job interview. Those are always fun.
What was it for?
Photographer.
TRU: Postmortem?
Crime scene. Upstairs. Sheriff's office.
Right, of course. How'd it go?
l don't know.
l was meeting with the Sheriff
about half an hour.
Then l walked out and realized
l had something stuck in my teeth.
Sexy.
l'm not sure the Sheriff thought so.
l should get your name for the message.
lt's Luc, with a ''C.''
Tru, with a ''U.''
ls this man bothering you?
Yes, Davis. Please have him escorted
from the building.
Really?
TRU: No.
-Davis, this is Luc.
-Yeah, we met earlier.
l got lost on my way to the interview.
Thanks for the directions.
l'm sure Gardez will be back pretty soon,
if you just want to hang out till--
GHOSTLY VOlCE: <i>HeIp me.</i>
[Tense instrumental music]
You okay?
Yeah, l'm fine. l just have to--
GHOSTLY VOlCE: <i>HeIp me.</i>
Would you mind waiting here
for one second?
l just need to.... l'm sorry.
TRU: Excuse me, Davis.
She does that a lot.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
-Help me.
-Save us.
-We need you.
-Please.
-Help me.
[Door closes]
Who would have thought of putting
the spare key under the doormat?
Very clever.
Okay, so l brought you....
Blueberry Danish, tuna on whole-wheat,
and a veggie burrito?
-Okay, how'd you know that?
-The same way l know it's your birthday.
My God, you remembered.
<i>The sad thing is no one eIse did.</i>
-Thank you.
-Of course. How could l forget?
Harrison, l don't need you to believe me.
l just need your help.
This is the first time it wasn't
just one body asking for help. lt was five.
l didn't see their faces,
they came with no lDs...
which means it's gonna be
five times harder for me to save them.
l gotta be honest.
lt's early in the day
to have this conversation.
l think one of them was poisoned, but
l've no idea what happened to the others.
-And you're telling me this because....
-Because l need info...
and you're more familiar with this world
than l am.
Listen, Starsky,
if you're asking me to be your Hutch...
l'm gonna have to say,
''Thanks, but no, thanks.''
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
TRU: Strippers, Harr?
Okay. l'm in.
[Pop music playing]
l was wondering if you could tell me
where l could find a girl named Turquoise?
We don't give that information
to customers.
-l'm not really a customer.
-You here to audition?
-Do l look like a stripper to you?
-A little bit.
l thought you said
bartenders knew everything.
l got nowhere with that guy.
-Did you work it?
-What do you mean ''work it''?
You gotta have an angle
to get information, Tru.
HARRlSON: By the way,
that Turquoise girl you're looking for?
Her real name is Tara.
She's got a day job doing telemarketing
in the Hancock Building.
No way!
Come on, Tru.
You know l got a way with the ladies.
<i>My friend here toId me everything.</i>
Harrison, thank you. Seriously.
l'll call you later, okay?
Right, yeah. l'm right behind you.
l'm just gonna....
l'm just gonna stay, and check it out here.
What's up?
She's right over there.
WOMAN: l just need to take down
your information.
-Tara?
-Yes.
Hi, l'm putting together a little party...
and was wondering
if you were booked for the night?
-l'm sorry?
-Or are you working at the club?
Why are you coming in here
and asking me questions like that?
l'm sorry, my bad.
l didn't know how--
TARA: lt's okay.
lt's just that no one here
really knows what my other job is.
l can relate.
But anyway, l am booked for the night.
Got an out-call gig.
Some bachelor party at the Pierpont.
A bachelor party.
Would you happen to know
who hired you?
Everything's handled by a booking service.
-Right.
-Look, l gotta get back to work.
TARA: Good luck with whatever it is
you're planning.
CONClERGE: Can l help you?
TRU: l'm here about the bachelor party.
Right, Room 1712. lt's called for 7:00...
but the entertainment
doesn't usually get here until after dark.
Why does everyone think
l look like a stripper?
lt's a bachelor party.
Who else would you be?
Right, good point.
So help me out, you know,
to know what to expect.
ls there anyone else working the party?
A waiter, bartender?
They've declined those options.
So no one but the guests
will be in the room tonight?
-And you.
-And me.
And one more thing.
l had a question for the groom,
but l can't seem to find his number.
lt's not our practice
to give out guests' personal information.
Too bad. He hadn't decided
whether he wants me naughty or nice.
There's no way
l'll cancel my bachelor party.
-lt's my last night of freedom.
-No, you don't understand.
GROOM: No, l think l do.
Robin sent you, didn't she?
TRU: No, that's not--
She hates it that l'm having this party...
almost as much as she hates
the guys l invited.
Robin's not a fan of your friends?
Okay, now this is starting to freak me out.
lf Robin didn't send you,
then who the hell are you?
l'm with the hotel,
and there's a problem with your room, sir.
So they sent me personally
to explain the situation.
-What's wrong with the room?
-We're overbooked.
lt has been way too long
since these guys have gotten together.
There's nothing that's gonna get me
to call this off.
TRU: Right, but--
GROOM: Know what?
l'll just call the hotel manager
and straighten this out.
No need.
l'm sure we can figure something out.
Avlocardyl? This newfound fascination...
-with this obscure drug stems from--
-Homework.
Just studying for the MCATs.
l can save you a lot of time.
This will never be on the test.
-l like to be really prepared.
-Okay.
Avlocardyl is a white, odorless,
crystalline powder that's soluble in water.
-ls that better?
-Much.
So it can be ingested
without the victim's knowledge?
ln a liquid, yes. But what victim?
ls there any way to tell if someone
has Avlocardyl in their system?
Not right away.
But after two or three hours, sure.
-How?
-They'd be dead.
l think there's something in the drinks.
Only that makes sense.
l have to replace all the alcohol
in the suite before the boys arrive.
Then l have to find out who put it there.
Yeah, and this involves me how?
l need you to find a girl.
Her name is Robin Wilson.
-Jackpot. That l can do.
TRU: <i>I got her name off a bridaI registry.</i>
She's gonna get married in a week--
Rewind. Married?
Look, Tru, l got my hands full, you know?
<i>You've been having fun aII day.</i>
Five guys are gonna be dead by 10:30
if l don't find a way to stop it.
Do l have to list the number of times
l've bailed you out...
-because l'm running out of time here.
-Fine.
But playing the guilt card's
really not like you, Tru.
You're starting to sound
like somebody else.
TRU: Who?
HARRlSON: <i>Meredith.</i>
To what do l owe the pleasure?
Can't a girl hang out with her sister?
Yeah, as long as her sister's not
in the middle of a huge case, which she is.
Mere, l just....
-ls everything okay?
-Yeah, like l said, just busy.
With you, l mean.
ls everything okay with you?
l love you. You know that, right?
So don't take it too hard
when l tell you to kiss my--
Tru, you have three looks:
One is, ''Have you heard from Harrison?''
Two is, ''l miss Mom.''
And three is, ''Are you clean, Meredith?''
And judging by the downcast eyes,
l'm gonna go with Number Three.
l'm clean, Tru.
My last slip-up was over a month ago.
lt's in the past. God, leave it there.
What if, l don't know...
there were a random drug test today.
lt could happen. Would you pass?
This is ridiculous.
l'd pass, Tru.
That's good to hear.
Sorry for doubting you.
TRU: She's not with you?
l figured since it was Lindsay's birthday,
she might be with her sister.
All right. Thanks, anyway. Bye.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Hello? Housekeeping.
l have to replace all the alcohol
in the suite.
[Suspenseful instrumental music
continues]
GROOM: Here she is.
HAT: Sweet.
ETHAN: Yeah, it's nice.
What are you doing?
-l'm the bartender.
HAT: Nice.
[All laugh]
GLASSES: This room is sick!
Nice to see you again.
l didn't know you were the bartender.
That's funny,
l could've sworn l didn't ask for one.
TRU: You didn't.
The hotel threw me in gratis
to make up for the problem with the room.
Nice.
-Anyway, what would you like?
GROOM: Scotch. Straight.
GROOM: Gentlemen, a toast.
MEN: Yes.
To the best night of our lives.
<i>Cheers.</i>
BLAKE: Sorry l'm late.
You know, as a rule,
the best man should never be late.
No one ever said l was the best.
l'm just better than the rest of you idiots.
GLASSES: Look at this guy.
GROOM: Come here.
[Tense instrumental music]
Yeah, what's up?
A sixth guy just showed up.
HARRlSON: <i>So?</i>
Only five bodies came into the morgue.
TRU: Somebody here doesn't die.
HARRlSON: <i>Let's say you're not crazy.</i>
So the sixth guy did it?
No, l never saw any of their faces.
lt means any one of them could've done it.
<i>Whoever didn't come in dead,</i>
<i>that's the kiIIer.</i>
That's a hell of a pour, girl.
You do know that Seven and Seven
isn't seven shots of alcohol, right?
Of course. You think this is my first day?
GLASSES: What's going on?
You look rough. Things okay?
l've just been going through some stuff.
A night out with the boys
is probably just what you need. Thank you.
You don't think it's wrong,
all of us being here together?
l think what's wrong
is you bringing that up.
<i>Why don't you just reIax,</i>
<i>have another drink, and just chiII out?</i>
<i>AII that stuff is in the past.</i>
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Blake clears throat]
-Can l get you something?
-No, l'll get it myself.
You don't want any of that, trust me.
The hotel always buys the cheap stuff.
We need to teach you to appreciate
a smooth, well-aged scotch.
BLAKE: So, John says you're a gift
from the hotel.
BLAKE: Be sure
to tell your manager thanks.
-No problem.
-Better yet...
why don't you give me his name?
l'd like to do it myself.
Actually, he's probably home
with the wife and kids by now.
But if l do my job right, l'll make sure
he finds you first thing in the morning.
MEN: [On TV] <i>Go!</i>
MAN 1 : <i>Now do the other one.</i>
MAN 2: <i>Do the other one.</i>
Hey, who brought this? Ethan? Cordoza?
[Somber instrumental music]
[Knock on door]
Hello, boys. Entertainment's here.
l'm gonna go get a little more comfortable.
<i>Why don't you aII do the same thing?</i>
[Dance music playing]
HAT: Shake this way.
[Men laughing]
HAT: All right!
Everything okay?
TRU: l mean, can l get you a cocktail?
How about a club soda
made to look like a vodka and soda?
Okay. You driving or something?
-No, l'm just sober. Eighteen months.
-Congrats.
ETHAN: l used to drink pretty hardcore
back in the day.
That's how l dealt with things.
But l don't want to bring everybody down,
you know?
l'd rather keep it quiet.
<i>No traces of aIcohoI in his system.</i>
Don't worry. lt'll be our little secret.
Thanks. Cheers.
Would carbonation
speed up the effects of Avlocardyl?
l'm doing great, thanks.
Did you know if you squeeze
all the bacteria out of the intestines...
you have enough to fill a coffee mug?
Hello, Davis. Now about my question?
Carbonation. Not that l know of.
DAVlS: <i>I don't think....</i>
Are you at a party?
l'm guessing
this isn't the Sheriff's office, is it?
Hold on a second.
lt's down the hall, up the stairs.
TRU: <i>Is that Luc?</i>
-Wish him luck on his interview.
-Good luck on your interview.
Thanks.
And tell him to check his teeth.
DAVlS: <i>Is he a friend of yours?</i>
-Could be. Just tell him.
Excuse me.
You may want to check your teeth.
Thanks.
So, what about alcohol?
How does it react with Avlocardyl?
DAVlS: <i>It wouIdn't.</i>
Alcohol acts as a masking agent,
covering all signs of the drug in the body.
So, say l would take a swig,
and then have three or four martinis.
DAVlS: <i>ShouId I be concerned with--</i>
-lt's a simple question.
Avlocardyl plus liquor equals a dead body
with no traceable cause of death.
They were all poisoned.
The alcohol covered it up.
Thanks for the assist.
[Dance music continues playing]
Go!
Looks like somebody's married.
Yeah, he's got a kid on the way, too.
<i>It means any one of them couId've done it.</i>
You don't look so hot.
lf l didn't know you weren't drinking,
l'd cut you off.
l needed some air. lt's a tough room.
You guys haven't seen each other
since college, right?
TRU: l mean, shouldn't this be
one big, happy reunion?
Right. Everyone says
they're the best years of your life.
lt doesn't always work out that way.
Are you okay?
Just some things l wish
l could go back and undo, you know?
<i>Make right.</i>
Do you ever feel that way?
All the time.
Maybe some of these guys
can deal with what happened but....
TRU: What? Did something happen
back in college?
-We didn't even know her name.
-Who?
The girl from the video?
BLAKE: Hey, buddy.
ETHAN: Hey, Blake.
Where you been?
l bought you a lap dance.
She's waiting on you. Get in there.
l think your break is over.
MEREDlTH: Hi, come on in.
l know we're all working late
these days, Meredith...
but the firm's board is insisting...
that we implement a random
drug-testing program for our employees.
Unbelievable.
Anyway, it shouldn't take
more than a few minutes.
BOSS: lf you want to check in at the table
in front of the restrooms.
Yeah, sure.
[Slow instrumental music]
No, that's fine. Her name's not Lenny.
Don't worry, you've got two hours
to scrape the frosting off and start over.
Hey, we're taking up a collection
to keep the party moving.
-You seen Blake?
-No.
[Dance music playing]
HAT: Oh, she's all snuggly.
<i>They aII got girIfriends, sweetheart.</i>
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
-What are you--
-You want to tell me what this is?
l was trying to keep track of your orders.
l was forgetting--
l checked with the hotel.
No record of them sending a bartender.
-More importantly, no record of you.
-All right. Nice work. l'm busted.
l'm calling security
and having your ass thrown out of here.
TARA: Hey, knock it off! l said, stop!
Get your hands off me.
Come on, it's a party.
-You think that's funny? You're sick.
-lt's fine. He didn't mean it.
Settle down. l think you're blowing this
out of proportion.
TARA: You know what, l'm just gonna
take a couple of minutes. Cool down.
[Tense instrumental music]
GROOM: Nice work.
TRU: Tara, are you....
Wait, what are you doing?
TARA: You ask too many questions.
Get out.
Listen, don't do this.
How did you know?
<i>WaIIets were missing.</i>
-You're just ripping them off?
-What did you think l was doing?
TARA: Look, l have never done this before,
l swear.
-Are you gonna call the cops?
TRU: No.
-What's that?
-Tequila.
l didn't bring tequila.
l found it behind the bar.
l've been drinking it since l got here.
[Tense instrumental music]
Wait a second.
lf it's not in the alcohol, then what's it in?
Oh, my God.
<i>There's something in the drinks.</i>
<i>A vIocardyI is soIubIe in water.</i>
The ice.
<i>It's in the ice.</i>
-Davis, it's me.
-For information, please dial 41 1 .
Just one more question, l promise.
ls there any way to save a person
once Avlocardyl's in their system?
DAVlS: <i>That must be some party.</i>
<i>Let me check.</i>
Yeah, and it looks like
glucagon is the only known antidote.
Do we have it at the morgue?
Glucagon is a substitute for insulin...
<i>in diabetic emergencies,</i>
<i>so we might have it in the med kit.</i>
-l think it's time you left.
-Hello?
Wait, you can't. You don't understand.
-Something is gonna happen.
BLAKE: That's right.
You're gonna be escorted
from the building.
TRU: You're making a mistake.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
DAVlS: l'm impressed.
You scared the hell out of me.
lt took me four months
before l stole anything from the office.
Davis, l'm sorry--
Tru, don't.
l've been listening to
your mildly entertaining stories all day.
Obviously, something's up in your life.
l don't know if you're in trouble.
l just hope that one day you'll realize
you can be honest with me.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
-Maybe l didn't make myself clear.
-Maybe l wasn't listening.
l know something happened in college
and what you're willing to do to cover up.
No one knows anything
except the five guys in that room.
What happened to the girl? Who was she?
-You can't hide from the past.
-Don't you think l know that?
Was it Ethan? What did he say?
No, nothing. He just....
lce.
l thought it was you,
but you didn't plan tonight, did you?
No. What does that have to do
with anything?
[Cell phone ringing]
HARRlSON: <i>Don't know</i>
<i>what you're up to...</i>
but l finally found Robin Wilson.
Only she isn't any bride.
-Who's that?
-What?
Get off the phone. Now.
She caught the guy cheating on her,
called the wedding off.
-That was three months ago.
-Right.
You've got 10 seconds to explain yourself.
This isn't a bachelor party, Blake.
The wedding was called off months ago.
That's crazy.
Why else would John want us all here?
Because you share a secret
he doesn't want you to tell.
Whatever happened in college, whatever
happened to that girl, it was John.
John did it.
Let me help you.
[Slow instrumental music]
What's she still doing here?
l thought l told you to get rid of her.
She's got an interesting story
you all might want to hear.
Not to be a pain in the ass,
but we had her thrown out.
-Now you want us to listen to her?
-l think we've all been silent long enough.
This isn't a bachelor party.
Not anymore.
You scared off the stripper,
we're running out of booze--
John and his fiancée broke up months ago.
Any of you guys know that?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
ls that true, John?
Look, l can explain everything.
Come on, guys.
The best night of our lives, remember?
Thanks, guys.
-No, don't.
-Just give me a minute.
Going somewhere?
What's the point in hanging around?
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends.
TRU: They can't be that good friends, John.
They still thought
you were getting married.
lt's not exactly an easy thing...
to admit that your relationship failed,
you know?
l was gonna tell them all tonight.
l thought everybody
could use a good party.
With plenty of drinks.
On the rocks, right?
God, that's a long way to go
to cover up a murder.
-l don't know what you're talking about.
-Let me fill you in on a few things.
The first is one of your friends
wasn't drinking alcohol tonight.
So, sure,
he's got the Avlocardyl in his system...
but without the alcohol to hide it...
at some point,
someone's gonna figure out what you did.
And second,
it's a little bartending trick l picked up.
Even if you're drinking it straight,
like you...
if you want to keep the drink cool...
you shake a little crushed ice
in the bottom of the glass.
<i>Yes, every gIass, John.</i>
Of course, if you didn't mess with the ice...
then you won't need the antidote
your best man has in the next room.
[Slow instrumental music]
-Five years late.
TRU: That's what l don't get.
Why now, after all this time?
Three weeks ago, l sent him a letter
saying l was going to the police.
TRU: You?
l couldn't take it anymore...
and l tried to make it right.
lnstead, l almost got us all killed.
What happened?
Catherine Hill.
We didn't even know her name
until we read it in the papers.
She was a freshman, made the mistake
of coming to a graduation party.
<i>John got her aIone in a room.</i>
lt's a little close, isn't it?
That hurts. Stop it. l told you, no!
-Who said it was up to you?
-Let go of me.
[Tense instrumental music]
A girlfriend once said he slapped her.
He denied it and we believed him.
When he told us what happened that night
was an accident, we didn't believe him.
<i>We didn't say anything.</i>
<i>To anybody.</i>
And you sent a letter? That's something.
l didn't have the guts to sign it.
He didn't know which one of us
was turning him in.
So he had to kill all of you.
l'm sorry for not trusting you.
But with everything...
l barely trust myself.
You did the right thing.
Five years too late.
[Soft instrumental music]
Surprise!
Surprise!
[Sentimental instrumental music]
MAN: [Whispers] Tru.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
-You need something?
-How'd you know?
You take the fun out of everything.
lt was fun for me.
[Cell phone ringing]
Hello?
l'm sure you won't be surprised to hear
there was a drug test at my office.
Obviously, you knew something
and opted not to tell me...
so l just called specifically
to not say ''thank you.''
MEREDlTH: <i>But in case you're curious,</i>
<i>I passed the test.</i>
Maybe now you'll get off my back
and let my past stay in the past.
Meredith, l wasn't trying to prove a point.
l was just trying to help.
-And l did, didn't l?
-Good night, Tru.
-You wanted to see me?
-Close the door.
MEREDlTH: Thanks for covering that
for me.
No problem.
l've never been paid
to provide a sample before.
But l gotta ask, how did you know
there was gonna be a drug test today?
l just had a feeling.
TRU: l just don't get it.
l went through all this
to save these five guys...
and now there's a chance they'll go to jail.
What's the point?
Look, Tru, this thing you're dealing with....
Maybe for you,
it's about more than just saving people.
HARRlSON: See, these guys had a secret,
and they put it to rest.
Maybe, l don't know....
Maybe you can try and do the same.
So Lindsay has this theory.
One out of every seven guys is a good one.
l've spent an entire evening
with six guys that were bad.
So does that make you Number Seven?
l wouldn't bet on it.
Don't worry, Tru.
He's out there.
[Upbeat pop music]
You know him?
TRU: No, not yet.
[Theme music]
[Slow rock instrumental music]
TRU: So, Lindsay, this is the sign-in room...
and this is what we call
the standards room.
Nice. Very goth.
So what happens in here?
This is where we measure and weigh
the dead bodies.
Okay, Tru.
Okay, let's be honest here.
You're cute, you're 22 years old.
There are better career opportunities
out there for you.
l told you, working here will help me
get into med school.
Then at least get off the graveyard shift.
l mean...
all the good parties start after midnight,
and who am l gonna go with now?
You'll survive. Besides, l think l might
be able to do some good by working here.
How? Everyone's already dead.
TRU: Not everyone.
DAVlS: You're not gonna believe this.
l just fished a tennis ball
out of a guy's large intestine.
Hello.
Remind me to cancel
my tennis club membership.
Lindsay, Davis, my boss.
-Davis, Lindsay, my best friend.
-Hi. lt's nice to meet you.
l'm good, really.
l was just leaving.
Tru, thank you for the tour.
And we're still on for shopping tomorrow?
TRU: Absolutely.
LlNDSAY: Okay, great.
See you tomorrow.
DAVlS: Look, Tru...
l know that the morgue
is not exactly Party Central...
but don't worry, things will pick up.
Actually, that's what l'm afraid of.
[Siren wailing]
[Police radio chattering]
[Crackling]
My kid's in that building! He's upstairs!
Someone's gotta get him ! Please go!
FlREFlGHTER: Yes, ma'am, we'll get him !
[Somber instrumental music]
[Coughing]
NlCK: Come here. l got you.
[Heroic instrumental music]
[Both exclaiming]
[Nick exclaiming]
How about those Giants today?
That's seven in a row, my man.
Talk about really being on fire.
[exclaims in pain]
[gasps]
NlCK: Go downstairs!
KEVlN: You're stuck!
NlCK: l'm fine! Go!
KEVlN: No, come on!
NlCK: Listen to me.
l'll be down in a minute, okay?
Don't worry about me.
Go on.
NlCK: Go!
[Anguished cry]
[Theme music]
Help me.
[Lively pop music]
[Tru moans]
Hey, gorgeous.
l didn't want to wake you.
Where are you going?
l am having breakfast with Dean Hazelton.
Oh, yeah?
MARK: Yeah, it looks like a post's
opened up in the psych department...
and if l kiss up to the old windbag...
you will be dating
a fully tenured professor.
MARK: Let me ask you.
What do you think of this?
Very suave.
How was work last night?
Pretty dead.
That's funny. That's clever.
Why don't you
get back to sleep, beautiful?
HARRlSON: They said five minutes
for a table. lt's been 10 minutes already.
You okay?
Yeah. What could be wrong?
[Harrison stuttering]
Let's see...
last time we talked, you told me
that dead people were talking to you...
so l thought l might be remiss
if l didn't follow up.
TRU: l'm fine, Harrison. Everything's fine.
WAlTRESS: Two?
WAlTRESS: Your table's ready.
HARRlSON: Finally.
See, you're a lousy liar, Tru.
l want to know what's going on.
-Trust me, you don't.
-What?
All of a sudden, you can't confide in me?
Your brother?
You really want to know?
[Upbeat rock music]
So let me get this straight.
You know, to recap.
The dead people,
they ask for your help in the morgue.
Just once.
lt happened once. Hopefully, only once.
And then you got propelled.
That's the word you used, right?
Propelled back to yesterday?
l relived the day, yes.
So you were able to save the lady's life
because she wasn't dead yet?
Tru, what can l say?
You're my sister, and l'll always love you.
l know it sounds a little crazy, but....
Smooth move.
A little crazy? No.
The run with the bulls
is a little crazy. Skydiving.
Dating actresses is a little crazy. This?
This is certifiably insane.
Harrison, l'm not lying,
and l don't think l'm nuts, either.
You really relived the day?
Then you tell me this...
who's gonna win the Tigers game today?
[Car horns honking]
What?
OFFlCER: Rosemary and 24th.
[Car horn honking loudly]
Great. Traffic's gonna be jammed
clear downtown.
[Police siren wailing]
Catch you later.
[Slow instrumental music]
You dog.
You were dating a professor and,
telling me just what, slipped your mind?
l knew you wouldn't approve.
LlNDSAY: l'm stunned.
TRU: Me, too.
-l thought things were good with him.
-No, l'm talking about us.
We're friends. Best friends.
[Rock music]
Okay, now l get why
you've been acting so strange lately.
Okay, you can't keep secrets
from your friends. Especially me.
l just feel so stupid. l mean, you know me.
l don't even fall for guys often.
But when you do fall, you fall hard.
Excuse me?
Very nice. Yeah.
So anyway, what did you do
when you caught him with the bim?
Nothing.
-Nothing?
-l froze.
You caught your boyfriend in the act,
and you froze.
LlNDSAY: God, do you know what
l would have done to him?
l would have humiliated him.
l would have made him wish
he'd never ever met me.
Tru, you just blew the perfect opportunity
to put that jerk in his place.
TRU: l gotta go.
LlNDSAY: Where?
More abuse. Bye.
-l'm worried about you.
-Me?
Yeah. What's with this morgue thing?
lt's my job. And it's a good thing to have
on my résumé for med school.
MERE: lt's a little odd, don't you think?
To work at the same morgue where
they brought Mom after she was killed?
What?
What are you talking about?
My God, you really don't remember,
do you?
[Slow instrumental music]
Still, working there's kind of ghoulish,
don't you think?
Tru, whatever you're trying
to accomplish...
Mom's gone.
Nothing can bring her back.
[Melancholic instrumental music]
DAVlS: What's so interesting?
TRU: Nothing.
DAVlS: Are those intake files from '<i>9</i>3?
TRU: lt's nothing, Davis.
'<i>9</i>3 was a very bad year.
Why's that?
The death rate in the city was low,
maybe the lowest in the country...
and then, after '<i>9</i>3,
it just went up like a skyrocket.
GARDEZ: lncoming.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
GARDEZ: This is Samantha Block.
TRU: My God.
GARDEZ: Died of smoke inhalation.
GARDEZ: The fire started
on the fourth floor around 5:00.
GARDEZ: The firemen thought
they'd cleared the building.
She was hiding under the bed.
What started the fire?
GARDEZ: Gas explosion.
This one here is Nick Kelly, a civilian.
He saved a 12-year-old boy,
smoke got him, too.
The victim has a broken ankle.
Probably trying to get out.
Old buildings are death traps.
DAVlS: Discoloration of the cheeks.
TRU: From what?
Might indicate inhalation
of a chemical compound.
l'm guessing dimethyl benzene.
ls this guy a genius or what?
Genius, you owe me $20.
The Tigers shut them out tonight.
Patterson threw a two-hitter.
What's dimethyl benzene?
lndustrial uses, mainly.
DAVlS: Her, too. They must have
ingested it from the smoke.
Cotton fibers plastered
on the epidermal layer.
And it's red and something else.
<i>It's hard to teII.</i>
So young.
Damn tragedy is what it is.
l don't know if l can take this.
Believe it or not, it actually gets easier.
[Solemn instrumental music]
Besides, l like to think
they're going to a better place.
You believe that?
Well, if you're gonna work here,
you gotta believe it.
GARDEZ: Of course, the dead get off easy.
lt's the ones left behind
that gotta deal with all the pain.
GARDEZ: Renee says she ain't gonna
hook you up.
GARDEZ: No more of her friends.
DAVlS: Why not?
'Cause you're scaring them off, man.
You're a nice guy,
but you come on too strong.
lt was only eight e-mails.
MALE VOlCE: [Whispering] <i>HeIp me.</i>
GARDEZ: You just gotta play it cool.
Did you guys hear that?
Hear what?
Nothing. Never mind.
GARDEZ: Tru, let me ask you.
When you go out with a guy...
you want him to lay back a little, right?
And make you earn it.
MALE VOlCE: [Whispering] <i>HeIp me.</i>
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
l'll be right back.
[Door opening]
She's hot. Weird, but hot.
[Eerie instrumental music]
MALE VOlCE [Whispering] <i>HeIp me.</i>
[Tense instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[Tense instrumental music continues]
Help me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Lively pop music]
Hey, gorgeous.
Where are you going?
l've got a breakfast with Dean Hazelton.
MARK: Tru!
Sorry, what?
l asked what you thought of this.
How's this look?
Yeah, it looks fine.
Breakfast with the Dean?
That's a surprise.
Yeah, there's a post that's gonna open up
in the psych department.
lf l kiss up to the old windbag...
then you will be dating
a fully tenured professor.
That's a good one.
-What?
-Opportunity.
lt's a good opportunity.
So you're sure about the jacket?
Yeah, very suave.
So suave, in fact...
that l think you should
stick around for a while.
l can't. l gotta go meet the Dean.
But l will see you tonight.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Crypt door closing]
DAVlS: Um....
You realize you were hired
for the night shift, don't you?
Do you ever actually go home?
l could ask you the same question.
l just thought if l'm gonna do a good job,
l'd better get to know the system.
Diligent.
TRU: Enough with the crypt.
Let's check out the database, yeah?
DAVlS: Municipal database.
What are you doing with that?
TRU: Just a little research.
DAVlS: Who's Nick Kelly?
What do you know.
TRU: He's a fireman.
[Slow instrumental music]
[Men laughing and chattering]
-Can l help you, miss?
-Yes. l'm looking for Nick Kelly.
FlRE CAPTAlN: Hey, Nick?
NlCK: Yo.
FlRE CAPTAlN: Somebody to see you.
Hi, l'm Nick.
Hi. Can we talk?
-<i>8</i>4 Hastings?
-Yeah, that's the one.
That's right down the block from me.
What makes you think that
that building's a fire hazard?
No reason in particular.
l'm doing a fire risk assessment
in prewar buildings...
for my architecture class.
-That's a weird assignment.
-Weird professor.
Yeah, l'd be happy to go down
and take a look at that unit for you.
What do you say, about 5:00?
The fire started around 5:00.
5:00 is too late. l'm supposed to be
in my professor's office at 2:00.
And this really can't wait?
Not if l want to pass.
Okay, what the hell.
NlCK: Things are slow around here,
anyway. Let me ask you something.
-Why me?
-Sorry?
You could've asked any one of these guys
for help, but you asked for me.
l have the calendar.
[Nick exclaiming and laughing]
That was for charity.
lt's the Widows and Orphans Fund.
Okay, Mr. September.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
SUPER: l wasn't here for the last
fire inspection. l spent the night in the ER.
Wedding ring dropped down
the garbage disposal.
l put my hand in, almost lost two fingers.
l said to my wife, ''lf that doesn't
scream commitment, what does?''
-We just want to check the furnace.
-No problem. The basement's down here.
-That shirt was a gift from your father.
-l hate it.
lt makes me look like a geek.
lt's what a loser would wear.
DlANE: You're wearing it, and that's final.
What's gotten into you?
<i>Take your sister outside and pIay.</i>
What do you say, Samantha?
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
TRU: She's a sweetheart.
DlANE: She is, isn't she?
She turns 7 next week.
Yeah, l hope so.
[Door creaking]
TRU: Creepy.
NlCK: Come on.
Watch your step.
TRU: What are we doing?
NlCK: First rule of fire risk assessment...
you want to check all mains
and all pipelines for gas leaks.
[Somber instrumental music]
NlCK: You might want to take some notes.
For your report.
-lt's okay. Photographic memory.
-Really?
TRU: What's that?
NlCK: This is what we call a gas sniffer.
NlCK: lt's used to detect
the source of a leak.
TRU: Won't we smell it?
lf the concentration's high enough,
we will.
TRU: Hold on a sec.
NlCK: What?
You've got a little bit of soot right there.
Thank you.
l should take you on all my inspections.
NlCK: Here, come on down.
NlCK: Careful. You never know
what you might find down here.
TRU: Be careful.
NlCK: Wait a minute. Here we go.
You see that?
TRU: What?
NlCK: Right there.
-lt's a leak?
-Yeah.
NlCK: lt sure is. Would you hold that?
TRU: Yeah.
NlCK: Let me see that.
NlCK: Yeah, see that?
There you go.
You know, it's a good thing
you contacted us.
We wouldn't have found this without you.
TRU: You're sure it's patched?
NlCK: Yeah, it's fine.
Positive? l mean, there's no chance
this thing's gonna explode or anything?
No, it's fine.
Good. No fires here today.
Not in the building, anyway.
Listen, l'm off duty in 10 minutes.
You want to get some coffee?
l could give you the whole sordid history
of fire risk in prewar buildings.
-Actually, l'd like to, but....
-Boyfriend?
You know, let me get back to you
on that one.
My roommate really wants to meet you.
Maybe we could double this weekend.
Gina, l'm an associate professor.
l don't double.
All right. l'd love to meet your friends,
just don't drag me to a pep rally, all right?
l'll be right back.
l just have to use the ladies' room.
MARK: Tru?
TRU: Hi.
This is a....
-What are you doing here?
-Thought l'd surprise you.
We haven't had much quality time
on account of my job and all.
What, aren't you glad to see me?
Yeah, of course l am. lt's.... l'm surprised.
Where's the Dean?
Canceled. Pancreatitis.
GlNA: Mark?
l'm sorry. l just wanted to come
and say hi to my favorite professor.
Yeah, this is Tru.
She was one of my star pupils.
Are you in his class now?
You'll learn a lot from him.
Things you don't expect.
TRU: Things you might not want to learn...
but he has a way of
making things very clear.
You must really miss his class.
l thought l would.
But l know now
that it's gonna miss me much more.
Anyway, l've taken enough
of the professor's time.
Goodbye, Mark. He's all yours.
Wait. Tru.
-You did that?
-lt was amazing.
To have the chance to say
everything you want right in the moment.
God.
l could never do something like that.
You're so strong, Tru.
l really admire that about you.
And l'm sorry about Evans.
Not surprised, but sorry.
Cute.
So from now on, no more secrets, okay?
Okay.
Then there's something
l have to tell you, Lindsay.
-l think l met someone new.
-Already?
You little slut.
-Can l ask you a question?
-Sure.
[Upbeat rock music]
Did you know Mom's body
was sent to the morgue where l work?
No. But then again,
l was 10 when she died.
Come on, Tru. You gotta forget
about that stuff. You were a kid.
You gotta cut yourself some slack.
-How did you know that?
-Know what?
You knew that top was loose
before it even came off. Seriously.
Last week you knew about my cards,
and now this.
<i>Are you gonna teII me what's going on?</i>
TRU: l can't.
HARRlSON: Why not?
-Because you won't understand.
-Me?
-Come on, Tru. How do you know that?
-l just do.
For the same reason l know
it's gonna rain at 3:00...
or that Patterson's gonna throw
a two-hitter for the Tigers.
Talk about answering a question
with a question.
<i>Honest, I just don't</i>
<i>get you sometimes, Tru.</i>
ls Patterson gonna throw a two-hitter?
NlCK: l love that shirt, by the way.
Love this? l just pulled it out of the closet.
What?
-Nothing.
-No, what?
lt's just nice to meet someone
who's not a jerk.
-Well, we're not all jerks.
-No, you're not.
NlCK: So maybe you don't mind me
asking you how come you lied to me...
about being a student?
What makes you think l lied?
You're supposed to be
in your professor's office at 2:00...
with your report, and it's 2:15.
We did a good thing, right?
Stopping that leak?
Yeah, we did.
So let's just leave it at that.
Okay. Strange, but okay.
Do you like being a firefighter?
Yeah, l like helping people.
TRU: Don't you worry
about how dangerous your job is?
TRU: You see it on the news all the time.
A firefighter goes into a building and....
l don't really think about it.
Sometimes a job just chooses you.
You know what l mean?
Yeah, l do.
l mean you're good at it.
lf we hadn't found that leak...
who knows what could've happened
this afternoon.
This afternoon?
You don't know who could've been killed.
Actually, l do.
No one.
What do you mean?
That wasn't anywhere near
the accumulation necessary...
to cause an explosion.
TRU: That leak wasn't dangerous?
NlCK: ln time, yeah.
A week,
two weeks down the line, maybe...
but that leak wasn't gonna
cause a fire today. Not a chance.
The type of fire
you're hypothetically describing...
would be caused by dipping a cotton rag
in some sort of accelerant.
Like dimethyl benzene?
Why are you so interested
in discussing arson scenarios?
-Do you have a grudge against someone?
-l'm here to learn.
Dimethyl benzene
is found in cleaning solvents.
You soak a rag with the stuff,
put it next to a fuel source and kaboom.
DAVlS: The fibers you described...
would be seared into the skin of anyone
within proximity of the blast.
So this was arson.
Hypothetically.
Hypothetically, yes.
lt's quick to ignite, it's hard to trace.
lf you get it on your hands,
watch out, it's nasty burns.
l wasn't here for the last fire inspection.
l spent the night in the ER.
Thanks for your help, Davis.
lf you ever need help with
other hypothetical research projects...
l'm always here...
and if l'm not here,
you can call my cell phone.
<i>We couId even maybe discuss it</i>
<i>over drinks or something.</i>
Do you have company?
Someone who's meeting me. A friend.
-His name's Nick Kelly.
-Mr. September?
lt's for a good cause.
[Jazzy instrumental music]
So you work here?
Sometimes a job chooses you.
Anyway, l'm thinking arson.
You said the gas leak
couldn't have started a fire today.
-That means it happened another way.
-What are you talking about?
-There's no fire at <i>8</i>4 Hastings.
-No.
Not yet.
l don't understand why you suspect
him for a fire that hasn't happened.
He was indicted for insurance fraud.
And you think he's planning
to burn down the building?
What's this about, Tru?
Why did you bring me here?
l believe <i>8</i>4 Hastings
may be a target for arson today.
lf you have information
related to an arson...
you need to tell the police,
not run around like Nancy Drew.
-lt's just a hunch.
-What kind of a hunch?
[Medium-paced instrumental music]
Listen, l'll make you a deal.
l'm listening.
Wait till tonight, and l'll tell you
anything you want to know.
And a whole lot more.
You're very lucky l have a soft spot
for strange women.
lt's 3:30. l'll meet you back at your place
as soon as l can.
Grab a couple of beers,
order some Chinese...
and do not leave until l get there.
You promise?
Very, very strange.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Hello?
ls anybody down here?
[Tense instrumental music]
Mr. Ford.
Let me guess. You lost an earring.
No. l'm here to tell you something.
What's that?
This building's being watched
by the police and fire departments.
They suspect a potential arson may occur.
Okay, l'll bite. Why?
You tell me.
Who the hell are you?
You were indicted for insurance fraud
two years ago.
-So what?
-How about taking that bandage off?
What the hell is this?
l'm just giving you a warning.
DlANE: Don't talk to me like that, okay?
How was school, honey? Was it good?
SAMANTHA: Fine.
GARDEZ: This is Samantha Block.
Died of smoke inhalation.
[Tense instrumental music]
Come on, Samantha.
We don't talk to strangers.
Excuse me, ma'am?
[Phone ringing]
Harrison, l can't talk right now.
l'm kind of putting out fires.
The Tigers won today, just like you said.
TRU: Glad l could help.
HARRlSON: <i>I want some answers, Tru.</i>
-How did you know?
-l don't have time....
TRU: How much did you win?
HARRlSON: <i>A IittIe probIem there.</i>
l would've won if l had the bucks.
So here's the way l see it.
To prevent future mishaps,
every morning...
<i>you and I, we get together,</i>
<i>we go over the game scores.</i>
HARRlSON: <i>First we'II start with footbaII--</i>
TRU: l gotta go.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Might indicate inhalation
of a chemical compound.
DAVlS: l'm guessing dimethyl benzene.
lndustrial uses, mainly.
[Door opening]
[Glass tinkling]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
TRU: Hi.
KEVlN: l heard a noise.
l'm Tru. l think we met earlier.
Yeah, l remember.
What do you say we get out of here?
Come on, l'll buy you a soda.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
That little girl with you upstairs,
was that your sister?
Yeah.
-You don't sound too thrilled.
-She's okay.
This place sucks. My dad blew us off.
He lives in Washington
with some new wife.
Why'd you break into Mr. Ford's office?
lt was an accident. l knocked too hard.
You could've just picked the lock.
lt's a hundred years old.
Kevin, l need you to do me a favor.
But l need you
to not ask any questions, okay?
-What?
-When 5:00 rolls around...
make sure you, your sister, and your mom
are out of the building...
-and anyone else you can tell.
-Why?
-We said no questions, right?
-Okay. Done.
Cool. l'll be just a second.
[Phone ringing]
TRU: Hello?
You're where?
Nick, l asked you to wait for me
at your apartment.
And l asked you for an explanation...
as to why you're trying
to put out nonexistent fires.
l mean, it's a beautiful day,
and l'm sitting in my apartment...
because some girl who works in a morgue
asked me to.
TRU: l think it's the super.
NlCK: l told you...
-prior convictions aren't proof.
-His office was full of accelerants.
For equipment cleaning.
He's a building super.
There's something going on with him.
Even if there is, there is still no fire.
NlCK: You can't arrest a guy
for thinking about doing something.
Luckily, we can't be arrested
for our thoughts.
You think l'm insane, don't you?
Honestly? lt's touch and go.
Look, maybe l'm doing this wrong,
l don't know.
-l just want to stop a fire.
-A fire that hasn't happened.
TRU: But it could.
NlCK: How do you know?
l just do.
NlCK: lntuition again?
l was right about the gas leak.
Look, you have to trust me.
NlCK: That's the weird thing.
l do.
lt's almost 5:00.
She's beautiful, and she tells time, too.
-No.
-What's wrong?
TRU: l can't right now.
NlCK: Sure you can.
-No, l can't.
-We're here.
lf l kiss you, l'll fall for you,
and l can't do that. That would be bad.
Why would that be so bad?
NlCK: What?
DAVlS: Cotton fibers were plastered
on the epidermal layer.
lt's red and something else.
DlANE: That was a gift from your father.
KEVlN: l hate it.
-l was wrong.
-About what?
How it started. lt's the kid.
NlCK: What kid?
Kevin. The kid from the building.
He's gonna start the fire.
So some kid is gonna start a fire?
<i>A minute ago you said it was the super.</i>
He's angry.
Lonely. Feels invisible.
He could pick the lock
to the super's office.
What better way to get attention?
lt makes sense.
To you maybe.
l have to get to that building.
That kid's sister is in trouble.
-Tru, l--
-Promise me you'll go home.
NlCK: But if there's a fire--
TRU: No.
You're right. There's no fire.
<i>I'm wrong. Crazy, even.</i>
So then go home. Wait for me there.
Promise me, Nick.
-l'm tired of this game.
-Nick, please.
l like you.
l really do.
And l think you feel the same way.
-l'm not imagining this, am l?
-No.
-Then l need to know what--
-l told you...
you'll get all the answers tonight.
And before this day ends,
we'll have that kiss. But just go home.
[Tense instrumental music]
Everybody, out of the building! Come on!
The building's on fire! Everybody, out!
You gotta get out, there's a fire!
Please, let's go!
TRU: Get out of the building!
Come on, you gotta get out! Please!
[Fire alarm ringing]
-What are you doing here?
-l followed you.
TRU: You promised!
NlCK: l was worried!
You gotta get out of here right now!
Trust me! Come on!
-lntuition again?
-Let's go.
-No, l can't leave.
-Why not?
-l'm a fireman.
-You don't have your gear.
l rang the alarm.
They'll be here any minute.
Great. Traffic's gonna be jammed
clear downtown.
They're gonna be delayed by traffic.
That's why you went in.
You live down the block.
Listen. l want you to get out.
l'm gonna check upstairs.
TRU: No, Nick, wait!
NlCK: Come here. l got you.
[Nick exclaiming]
How about those Giants today?
That's seven in a row, my man.
Talk about really being on fire.
[Tru coughing]
TRU: Nick!
NlCK: Yeah, coming! Got a rescue!
The victim has a broken ankle.
-Nick, stop!
-What?
The floor's weak! Watch out!
How did you.... Never mind.
[Siren wailing]
My God!
See, l knew we'd have the kiss
before the day was over.
But Sam, she's supposed to be at the park.
My God. My daughter's still inside!
She's still in the building!
-Where are you going?
-l'm going after her.
She was hiding under the bed.
She's hiding under her bed.
But send someone else, please.
lt's my job, Tru.
And l'm stubborn as you are.
TRU: Nick, no!
NlCK: Listen to me.
l'll be down in a minute, okay?
FlREMAN: Get this gear.
TRU: No, Nick!
NlCK: No time, there's a little girl upstairs.
l know where she is.
[Solemn instrumental music]
MARK: Tru!
-l can't talk right now.
-You're crying.
Yes.
l know. lt's been rough on both of us.
l get it.
No, you don't.
l wish that l could rewind
the day and have it back.
l would do everything differently.
l would show you
how much you mean to me.
You had your day.
You only get one.
l thought when you asked me for help,
it was for you.
Now l know it was for Samantha.
TRU: You saved her.
Everyone's calling you a hero.
l don't want to sound selfish...
but l wanted both of you.
[Melancholic instrumental music]
You said your job
was a chance to help people.
All they have to do is ask.
So is mine.
So ask me, Nick.
TRU: Please?
l'm not leaving till you ask.
So please ask me, Nick.
TRU: Please, just ask.
[Rock music]
[Footsteps approaching]
Help me.
[Sinister instrumental music]
[Light bulb flickering]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
DAVlS: There you are, Tru.
<i>Can you do me a favor?</i>
TRU: Yeah, sure.
DAVlS: Hand me the other bulb.
TRU: Can l ask you a question, Davis?
DAVlS: Absolutely.
Do you like it here?
DAVlS: Been here eight years.
Not sure what else l'd do.
But do you like it here?
ls everything okay?
Doesn't it ever get to you...
seeing all these dead people
day after day?
Yeah.
Sure, l guess some days
l wish l was in Ear, Nose and Throat...
but most of the time, it's okay.
My friend Lindsay works
in public relations.
So do we.
Our public just happens to be dead.
Here's what l think, Tru.
DAVlS: We're all someplace for a reason.
Just sometimes we need to accept
what that reason is.
[Slow instrumental music]
[Harrison grunts]
[Alternative rock music]
[Alternative rock music intensifies]
[Alternative rock music continues]
[Grunting and moaning]
[Theme music]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Gunshot firing]
[Phone ringing]
[Vase shattering]
Damn.
TRU: Hello?
HARRlSON: <i>Hey, sis.</i>
Sorry. Were you sleeping?
TRU: <i>It's fine.</i>
l have to wake up in 12 hours anyways.
l wanted to make sure we were
still on for brunch today at your place.
-Yeah, absolutely.
-Great. See you then.
But--
l got to go. Battery's dying.
<i>See you, Tru.</i>
[Sighing and moaning]
-So, you think she'll like me?
-Listen, l told you, Tru is the best.
But she has been tough
on some of the girls l bring around.
There's been others?
But none that matters.
Sounds like a line.
The same one you used
to get me in bed in the first place.
HARRlSON: Serious.
When l think of all the other girls
l wasted time with...
thinking, you know, she's the one, but....
HARRlSON: Then l meet you.
SARAH: You'll jinx it.
HARRlSON: Superstitious?
Just about certain things.
Parking, love.
ls that what we're talking about here?
Love?
l'm gonna hit the showers...
make sure l look presentable
for your overprotective sister.
Come here. What is that?
SARAH: What?
HARRlSON: On your back. Let me see that.
lt's nothing, really.
l slipped when l was working out.
-You slipped?
-Yeah.
This had nothing to do with--
SARAH: No, this had nothing
to do with anything.
Just a...
clumsy girl on a StairMaster.
[Slow pop music]
He tried to pick me up.
-l did not try to pick you up.
-Then what would you call it?
lt was a diner.
You were alone, l was alone.
-l was just trying to make conversation.
-You tried to pick her up.
Anyway, l wouldn't talk to him.
Not some stranger who was
way too cute to be good for me.
But he was persistent.
He got my number, called, called again.
Finally, l agreed to meet him for lunch.
That was three weeks ago.
And the rest is history.
TRU: <i>My brother's in Iove.</i>
-Already? l thought he just met her.
-He did.
The boy moves fast.
God, l hate people in love.
They always act so superior.
So they found someone
that will actually put up with them.
Speaking of,
what's happening with James?
Third date tonight,
and you know what that means.
The third-date rule.
One of the great overlooked inventions
of our time.
LlNDSAY: Thank you.
HOST: You're welcome.
So, you gonna sleep with him?
lt's the third date, Tru. Fish or cut bait.
You believe in the third-date rule,
don't you?
l believe in you. So if you believe in it....
He's so sweet. A little shy.
My God, you like him.
TRU: l liked her.
HARRlSON: Sarah. Really?
TRU: Yeah, l thought she was great.
HARRlSON: But?
There's no buts. She's a keeper, Harrison.
HARRlSON: Yeah. That's great, Tru.
l mean, we both know how you can be
a little tough on some of my girls.
Let's be honest. You've had some winners.
l'm not even talking about
the stripper years.
No, but Sarah, she's different, Tru.
l don't know.
l mean, when l'm with her, it's....
l'm better, you know?
[Glass shattering]
Nice.
l'll tell you, her ex-husband's a real fool
to let her get away.
Wow, she's divorced?
Yeah. The guy sounds like
a real piece of work, too.
But she believes in me.
HARRlSON: Damn, l don't even
believe in myself half the time.
But here's this girl, this....
No, this woman...
who thinks l'm someone special.
[Man screaming]
MAN: l love this girl!
This is a weird night.
We got to find somebody for you...
because this whole third-wheel stuff?
New.
[Phone ringing]
Hello? Hey, sweetie, how are you?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
-What, now?
-ls everything all right?
No, don't worry, Sarah. l'll be right there.
l'm sorry, got to go.
-ls she okay?
-Don't worry. Nothing l can't handle.
But l'll call you later, okay? l promise.
lt was awful. lt was awkward and fast.
And afterwards,
he wouldn't even look at me.
He just made up some excuse...
that he had to get up early
the next morning...
and ran out of my apartment.
TRU: What did you do?
LlNDSAY: <i>What couId I do?</i>
l said goodbye
and ate a tube of cookie dough.
So, not only did l just have the worst
sex of my life with a guy l really liked...
but l also gained two pounds.
Okay, you know what?
l'm officially over the third-date rule.
lt's just another male invention
to get us into the sack.
GARDEZ: Honey, l'm home.
-l got to call you back.
-Yeah, okay.
GARDEZ: <i>9</i>1 1 took the call at 10:30.
GARDEZ: The body was found
in his ex-wife's house.
GARDEZ: Bullet in the chest.
lt's nice to know some people
got a worse relationship than l do.
GARDEZ: Bag that for me?
TRU: Yeah.
Andrew Webb, lives at the harbor.
Nice. Should've spent some of that money
on a bullet-proof vest.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
[Slow, dramatic instrumental music]
Oh, my God.
TRU: Sarah.
MAN: <i>I'II try pIaying President Truman.</i>
ALE<i>X</i> TREBEK: <i>1979.</i>
HARRlSON: [On machine] <i>Hey,</i>
<i>this is Harrison. Leave me a message.</i>
Hi, it's me again.
l really need to talk to you...
so just call me back
as soon as you get this, all right?
-Are you okay?
-l'm fine.
l mean, these people are such brainiacs.
TREBEK: <i>...tropicaI fIowers.</i>
LAD Y: <i>What are orchids?</i>
TREBEK: <i>Correct.</i>
l mean, the only questions l know
are about <i>GiIIigan's IsIand.</i>
TREBEK: <i>1972. Ken Howard</i>
<i>as this decIaration writer....</i>
TRU: Hello?
MERE: <i>Tru, it's Meredith.</i>
Listen, l really need to reach Harrison.
<i>You haven't heard from him</i>
<i>by any chance?</i>
Actually, l have.
MERE: He's under arrest, Tru.
TRU: <i>For what?</i>
They haven't filed yet,
but my guess is murder one.
What?
MERE: <i>They're saying that he kiIIed</i>
<i>his girIfriend's ex.</i>
Andrew Webb?
-Yeah, that's the guy. How do you know?
-His body just came in.
But there's no way.
Harrison could never kill someone.
lt doesn't look good.
His blood is in her living room.
-His prints were on the gun.
-Where is he now?
They're taking him downtown.
Listen, l got to run.
-l'll call you when l know more.
-Mere, wait.
TRU: Gardez, l'm gonna need you
to cover for me.
Just tell Davis l'll be back as soon as l can.
Are you okay?
TREBEK: <i>This fIower's name</i>
<i>is an aIIusion....</i>
l don't know yet.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Crypt door opening]
Not that l'm not cool
with the whole concept...
of corpses speaking to me...
but if you were going to ask for my help...
now would be the time.
Help me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
TRU: Hello?
HARRlSON: <i>Hey, sis.</i>
Were you sleeping?
Harrison, l need you to listen to me,
and listen carefully.
TRU: l'm going to tell you something.
HARRlSON: <i>Can this wait tiII brunch?</i>
Wait, you're still having us
for brunch, right?
Yes, but something's gonna happen today.
Something important.
l know. You're meeting Sarah.
Don't be such a drama queen.
l got to go. Battery's dying.
Harrison, no. Wait.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Help me.
DAVlS: You're here early.
By about...12 hours.
l'm not staying.
For someone who doesn't like it here,
you sure are around a lot.
You ever think that maybe
you just belong here?
l'll let you know in about 12 hours.
lssues.
[Fast-paced instrumental music continues]
TRU: lt's Harrison. He's in trouble.
MERE: <i>Harrison's aIways in troubIe.</i>
You pulled me out of a meeting
to tell me that?
-Today's different.
-Okay, l'll bite. How's today different?
This is gonna sound strange...
but do you think Harrison
could ever kill someone?
-What? What kind of question is that?
-Do you?
MERE: <i>He's our brother.</i>
l mean, we haven't been that close
over the years, but....
l just need you to be honest.
Do you think Harrison
could ever kill someone?
Yes.
[Fast-paced instrumental music
ends abruptly]
TRU: l don't think he would ever--
MERE: <i>What is this about?</i>
<i>Or is this just one of</i>
<i>your crazy hypotheticaIs?</i>
Yeah. That's what it is.
But look, l'm gonna need your help today,
no questions asked.
Okay, fine. But next time,
not during meetings, okay?
Right. l'll be in touch.
You'll be in touch.
[Slow pop music]
HARRlSON: You're late.
lt's a good thing l didn't return
that spare key...
or l'd have to shimmy up
that drain pipe again.
-l'm glad to see you.
-Yeah, you, too.
Feel free to let go any time.
l want you to meet....
TRU: Sarah.
SARAH: You must be Tru.
-l've heard so much about you.
-Mutual.
You have a lovely place.
These old buildings are just great.
-Can l talk to you for one sec?
-Come on. We just got here.
Besides, there's nothing you can't say
in front of Sarah.
Okay.
l ran into Andrew yesterday.
Andrew?
My ex-husband.
Tru? Word?
ln the future, two topics that are off-limits
when meeting my new girlfriends:
my exes and their exes.
l need you to stay away from Sarah today.
Man, you never change.
Every girl l bring around,
you find something wrong with.
So, she's divorced. What is the big deal?
Half the country is divorced.
lt's nothing against her.
lt's you that l'm worried about.
HARRlSON: l'm a big boy.
lf l get my heart stomped,
l get my heart stomped.
HARRlSON: You can't protect me forever.
No, but l can protect you for today.
Look, go to the movies,
go play the horses, whatever.
-But just stay away from her, please.
-l don't get you sometimes.
Which lately, has been most of the time.
Just do this for me, okay? Just for today.
Why do you always have to do things
the hard way?
Because l can.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
[Seagulls cawing]
Can l help you?
l didn't realize anyone was here. l'm sorry.
You're taking pictures of my home.
You'll have to do better than that.
We're putting together
a book on the harbor.
You know, sights and sounds, all that.
ANDREW: A book?
A book proposal, actually.
l won't bore you with the details...
but we wouldn't use any of the pictures
without your permission.
Your boat is just so beautiful.
l'm sorry about the inconvenience.
lt's got an inside, too.
So, tell me about the book.
Beer, wine? Can l get you something?
Why do l think
you're not interested in the book?
Why do l think you're one of the more
perceptive women l've met lately?
She's very pretty.
That's Sarah.
l'm sure we have better things
to talk about than my wife.
<i>-You sure you don't want a drink?</i>
-Sorry. l'm on the clock.
But, it's nice to see divorce
doesn't slow you down at all.
Sarah and l aren't divorced.
We're separated.
-Sarah isn't your ex-wife?
-No, she's my current wife.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
Hello?
Where are you?
l've been waiting for half an hour.
l'm sorry. Something's come up.
LlNDSAY: <i>I'II try</i>
<i>not to take that personaIIy.</i>
Look, l'll just call you tonight, then.
Just remember one thing.
The third-date rule was invented by men
to try and get us into bed.
Whatever you do, don't fall for it.
SARAH: You take this overprotective-sister
role pretty seriously l see.
Why didn't you tell Harrison
you're still married?
He said you were tough.
But l didn't think your blessing
would require an interview...
and a background check.
l'm sorry. He's my little brother.
Sometimes l get carried away.
Look, just because we don't have
signed divorce papers...
doesn't make it any more of a marriage.
Do you know anyone
who would want to hurt your husband?
People don't hurt Andrew.
Andrew hurts them.
[Slow instrumental music]
l married him when l was young.
Too young.
Maybe that's why l thought
it was my fault.
That somehow
l had done something wrong.
SARAH: l deserved it.
Deserved what?
Call it what you want.
Domestic violence, physical abuse.
lt all hurts just the same.
l finally got the courage to leave.
l thought the hard part was over.
lt took me a year to realize
the hard part hadn't yet begun.
He won't divorce you?
No. Giving up control
doesn't really appeal to Andrew.
Which is why these make sense.
l found them in the mailbox this morning.
SARAH: No name, but it doesn't take
a genius to know who sent them.
Look, should l have told Harrison sooner
that l was still married?
Probably.
l just didn't want to scare him off.
He doesn't scare easy, you know?
l know. That's what l love about him.
Like it or not, l do love him.
So do l.
You tell me to stay away from Sarah,
and you go and hassle her.
You know she called me, near tears.
She thinks you hate her.
l don't hate her, Harrison.
That's not what this is about.
HARRlSON: Then what is it about?
You have to trust me, okay?
Trust that l know what l'm doing.
Or maybe l don't. l don't know.
You were making a lot more sense...
when you thought
dead people were talking to you.
Thanks.
And when did you become
such a hypocrite?
You sleep with your college professor...
and you're all over me because
l'm dating a woman who's separated.
No, it's not about that.
The reason she's not divorced, Tru,
is 'cause she's scared to file.
HARRlSON: Damn it, Tru.
You know what l think?
l think it's 'cause l'm happy.
Yeah. 'Cause l met someone,
and it kills you...
that your pathetic little brother's
having a better life than you.
All this time you had me convinced
that Meredith was the selfish one.
But it's been you all along.
TRU: Harrison, you're getting it all wrong.
HARRlSON: Am l?
lt seems to me for the first time,
l'm getting it right.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music continues]
Let me guess. There's no book.
l'd like to ask you
a few questions, Mr. Webb.
You better talk fast,
because the police will be here shortly.
ANDREW: You know, l should've known.
-How much is Sarah paying you?
-For what?
To dig up dirt, to force my hand
in granting her a divorce.
Oh, God, you know we've been
playing this game for months.
And frankly, her lack of originality
is beginning to surprise me.
This is Andrew Webb at the harbor.
l don't work for your wife.
l'm here to help you.
l have an intruder onboard.
Help me with what?
Live to see tomorrow.
ls that a threat?
No, it's not.
But if l'm gonna help you,
you must be honest with me.
-Why are you having Sarah followed?
-What?
-Why won't you grant your wife a divorce?
-Because she married me for my money.
ANDREW: lf l give her a divorce,
she gets half.
lf l stay married, she gets what l give her.
Oh, so you're punishing her.
She's making me out to be the bad guy.
That's brilliant.
You know, she's smarter than l thought.
ANDREW: Did she tell you that l beat her?
-Are you saying that you didn't?
-l have never hit Sarah.
And l have never hit a woman.
Now, why don't you just run along
before l have to change my answer.
ANDREW: Sarah!
Sarah!
Just tell me what happened.
[Sarah crying and quivering]
He came in here,
and he was out of control.
Did he hit you?
HARRlSON: Did he--
SARAH: No.
Not this time...
but he threatened me.
[Whispering] He threatened to kill me.
What? Why?
Because of you. Because he hates you.
He hates me? What did l do?
You made me fall in love with you.
Maybe it would just be safer for me
if we weren't together right now, okay?
For both of us.
Oh, l don't know, Harrison, you know.
Then l'm just giving in to him.
l'm giving him exactly what he wants.
God, what can l do? He comes over here
and l'm helpless to protect myself.
Maybe you shouldn't be helpless.
What are you saying?
SARAH: l should take a self-defense class
or go buy a gun?
You wouldn't be helpless.
[Slow instrumental music]
HARRlSON: Look at me.
l know a guy.
SARAH: You know a guy?
HARRlSON: Yeah.
He could set you up today with a gun.
-Do you love me?
-You know l do.
HARRlSON: Then trust me.
l know a guy.
OPERATOR: <i>91 1.</i>
SARAH: <i>Yes, this is Sarah Webb.</i>
OPERATOR: <i>Are you okay?</i>
SARAH: <i>My husband just--</i>
OPERATOR: <i>Speak up, ma 'am.</i>
<i>Your husband just what, ma 'am?</i>
SARAH: <i>Hit me.</i>
<i>I'm bIeeding.</i>
OPERATOR: <i>Is he there with you now?</i>
SARAH: <i>No, he drove away.</i>
SARAH: <i>PIease hurry, if he comes back,</i>
<i>he threatened....</i>
SARAH: <i>He said he wouId kiII me.</i>
OPERATOR: <i>Where are you?</i>
SARAH: <i>Oh, my God, he's here.</i>
<i>Andrew, stop it. PIease.</i>
A friend of mine in the DA's office tracked
it down from a year ago last December.
He was lying.
-What's that?
-Nothing. Just thinking out loud.
So, Harrison knows
you're investigating his girlfriend?
lt's for his own good, Mere.
You gotta trust me.
So what happened
when the police showed up at her house?
The husband was gone,
the police issued a warrant for him.
-And?
-And nothing.
Sarah went in the next day to make sure
they dropped all the charges.
-Why?
-Classic battered woman syndrome.
l see it all the time.
lf you're done with your research project,
l really have a ton of work to do.
-Thanks, Mere. l owe you.
-Yeah, you do.
Well, if it's home protection
you're looking for...
l would say a semi-automatic,
nine millimeter.
-l sell a lot of those.
-Nine millimeter, what does that mean?
lt's the size of the bullet.
lt's like what cops use.
Of course there's a good argument
to be made to stepping it up a bit...
to 10 millimeter or 45.
Both very good choices.
What about this?
Sure. lf your home's being invaded
by grizzly bears.
HARRlSON: The nine millimeter is fine.
SERGE: Good choice.
Does the little lady want me to wrap it up
or is she gonna wear it home?
l can't do this. Harrison, l'm sorry,
l can't do this.
Whoa, hey.
HARRlSON: We talked about this.
You need it.
What does it solve? l mean, do you think
that it gives me my life back?
And besides, l read somewhere,
what was it...
that my own gun is more likely
to be used against me.
-Hey, you want me to hold it?
-No, Harrison, it's--
'Cause l will.
You need it,
but you don't want it in your house.
So l'll keep it. Problem solved.
And if he ever gives you a hard time...
all you got to do is call me.
l don't know. l've already gotten you
so mixed up in all of this.
We're in this together now.
HARRlSON: Wrap it up, Serge.
SARAH: God, l hate this.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
l know you don't want to talk to me,
but l need you to listen.
HARRlSON: So, you wanted to talk to me?
TRU: Please.
Look, l'm sorry.
About Sarah. For doubting her.
l know her husband's a bad guy.
l know everything.
lt's cool.
-That's big of you, Tru. l mean, that's--
-l'm not done.
Because you're still in danger.
Damn it, Tru.
Why can't you leave well enough alone?
You apologized. And now this. You know...
have a great night.
Hey, Harrison, wait.
You're carrying a gun.
Hey, yeah, don't give me any gun-safety
lectures, l know my way around a piece.
Oh, my God.
Do you think Harrison
could ever kill someone?
MERE: <i>Yes.</i>
You killed him.
HARRlSON: What are you talking about?
You're gonna kill him.
You're gonna kill Andrew tonight.
What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?
TRU: Because l know.
HARRlSON: You know what?
Every single thing
that's gonna happen today.
What are you, psychic all of a sudden?
lt's not psychic. At least l don't think so.
l mean, l'm not sure
what the name for it is scientifically.
But in layman's terms, l relive days.
You relive days?
People ask for my help. Dead people.
l know, l already told you that.
But then the day restarts...
and l have a chance
to save them from dying.
lt doesn't happen every day.
TRU: Not that that makes it
any less strange, but....
How do you think l knew your card?
Take this.
How do you think l knew
who was gonna win the ball game?
-Even you were curious.
-Okay, Tru, l love you, you know that.
But you need help. A lot of it, okay?
TRU: You see that waiter?
ln two seconds,
l bet you he drops his tray.
HARRlSON: Oh, what are you talking--
TRU: And that guy across the room?
HARRlSON: Tru--
He's gonna stand up
and profess his love for his girlfriend.
l love this girl!
[Tense instrumental music]
What's going on?
ls this one of those reality shows
where you try to freak a guy out?
ln one minute, your cell phone's
gonna ring. lt's gonna be Sarah.
Upset and in trouble. Listen to me.
She's gonna ask you to come see her.
You're gonna run out of here,
you're gonna kill her husband.
You're gonna kill her husband
and be arrested for his murder tonight.
Look, you had me with the waiter,
and lover-boy, okay? But this?
This is a little wack, don't you think?
[Phone ringing]
[Phone continues ringing]
Hello?
lt's Sarah. Says she needs me.
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: Harrison, wait.
HARRlSON: l'm going, Tru.
TRU: You can't.
She needs me.
l love her and she needs me.
You can't save her.
lt's not your responsibility.
lf you go there tonight,
you're gonna kill him.
-But he deserves what he gets.
-And then what? You end up where?
ln jail for life, or worse?
What? Do you want me to be like Dad?
Stand by helplessly and watch
the woman l love get murdered?
ls that what you want?
-Don't make her into Mom, either.
-What?
Harrison, she's not Mom.
Don't make this about saving Mom.
Look, l don't even know
what you're talking about.
Harrison.
Look at me.
Would you look at me?
l'm 22 years old.
And one way or another,
l've lost everyone l've ever loved.
Our mother to a bullet,
our father to lack of interest...
Meredith to coke and ambition.
Don't you see?
l can't lose you, too.
Otherwise l'll have no one left.
l'm cursed because l can see the future.
And if you go there right now,
l'll have no one.
Without you, l am all alone.
[lntense instrumental music]
You will never lose me, Tru.
But l have to go.
l gotta go.
Har...
[Car tires screeching]
TRU: Taxi.
[Phone ringing]
Hello.
Thought you'd like to know,
Andrew Webb was cited for speeding...
on December 20 of last year.
Actually, l don't think this is the best time.
MERE: ln California.
TRU: <i>So?</i>
So, that's the same night
that Sarah called <i>9</i>1 1 here.
<i>Remember, who actuaIIy saw Andrew</i>
<i>that night?</i>
Only Sarah.
The cops never found him. Why?
Because he wasn't there.
He won't divorce you?
Oh, my God. She set him up.
She's setting Harrison up.
She married me for my money.
Mere, let me ask you a question
about divorce law.
lf you divorce your husband in this state--
You get half community property.
-And if you kill him?
-You go to jail.
What's this about?
But if you have someone else kill him,
you get it all...
and the poor schmuck goes to jail.
You said it was gonna be unlocked.
l was surprised when you called me.
l thought you couldn't stand
being around me.
Usually l can't.
Except when my electrician is unavailable.
Charming as always, Sarah.
All right, your wiring looks fine.
[Alternative rock music]
How can you listen to this music?
l can't even hear myself think.
-Could you hear that?
-No. l didn't hear anything, Andrew.
[Security alarm beeping]
Okay, l heard that. Andrew, be careful.
-All right, just call the police.
-Okay.
[Grunting and moaning]
Kill him, Harrison.
Kill him or he'll kill us both.
[Tense instrumental music]
No.
-l can't.
-You're a coward.
l may be...
but, God, l'm not a killer. l can't do it.
SARAH: You are now.
Your blood is in my house,
your prints are on the gun.
Luckily, l was able
to wrestle it away from you.
Sarah.
Take my advice and claim self-defense...
although that would be hard to prove
with you breaking in and all.
OPERATOR: <i>91 1.</i>
Yes, hi.
l would like to report a murder.
SARAH: My husband is dead.
What is going on here?
Conspiracy to commit murder, l'd say.
l got the strangest phone call today.
l know you don't want to talk to me,
but l need you to listen.
Some girl begged me
to wear a bullet-proof vest.
l would have protected you.
You know that, right?
Goodbye, Sarah.
[Slow instrumental music]
You should've taken half.
[Police radio chattering]
You know, l'm not sure l can buy
that whole ''reliving a day'' thing.
Can't say l blame you.
But let's say that l did...
if what you said is true.
Do you think yesterday l killed him?
l don't know. Maybe.
Probably.
TRU: How's your head?
lt hurts. Like my pride.
Of course, if you can really do
what you say...
l'll tell you,
we've really turned a nice profit.
[Up tempo instrumental music]
l already did.
[Up tempo instrumental music continues]
LlNDSAY: <i>So, I took your advice.</i>
<i>We came back to my apartment,</i>
<i>James and me.</i>
We just talked.
TRU: <i>You just taIked?</i>
LlNDSAY: Yeah.
TRU: Good, Linds. l'm proud.
LlNDSAY: <i>And you know what I reaIized?</i>
That James is one boring guy.
So l just slept with him.
l figured that was one way to shut him up.
TRU: And?
LlNDSAY: <i>It was nice.</i>
lt was very nice.
We're going for sushi tomorrow night.
Good thing l didn't take your advice, huh?
Yeah. Good thing.
Oh, you made it.
l wasn't sure if you would.
-You were right, Davis.
-l was? About what?
l think there is a reason l'm here.
A good one.
Yeah. l thought you might come around.
MAN: <i>Presidents. $1,600.</i>
TREBEK: <i>1979.</i>
-Hey, Tru.
-Hey, yourself.
lt's a slow night.
Not one pickup since lunch.
GARDEZ: These guys are such brainiacs.
The only questions l know
are about <i>GiIIigan's IsIand.</i>
What are orchids?
LAD Y: <i>What are orchids?</i>
<i>FIowers. $1,600.</i>
What, a rerun?
TREBEK: <i>...are sometimes known</i>
<i>as crane fIowers.</i>
Not for you.
[Rock music]
[Tense instrumental music]
You can't keep avoiding me.
Really? l thought l was doing a good job.
l know what you can do.
l heard you the first time.
That doesn't make it any funnier.
DAVlS: lt's not a coincidence
that there've been fewer deaths...
since you started working here.
l have no idea what you're talking about.
DAVlS: Tru, l've watched you.
l've seen how you behave.
<i>You can do things.</i>
Things that others can't.
l don't even know how to....
Tru, it's okay.
You can talk to me.
They ask me to help them.
l wake up, the same day starts over and--
DAVlS: You save them.
Try to. Sometimes l can't.
You don't think l'm crazy?
DAVlS: No, do you?
Sometimes.
You're not.
Why isn't this just
completely freaking you out?
l've seen a lot of strange things here.
Very little shocks me.
l can't. l can't live like this.
l keep secrets from people that l love.
l can't have a normal relationship.
DAVlS: You're saving lives.
lt's a gift.
No, candles are gifts.
Boots, bath salts maybe, but this is....
l don't know what this is. Do you?
l don't. Not yet. But tell me, Tru.
DAVlS: How does it feel...
to know that somewhere out there...
someone is about to die...
and they're gonna ask you for your help?
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[Phone ringing]
Hello?
Yeah, l'm ready.
l know we have to do this.
l love you, too.
[Theme music]
Help me.
WOMAN: [On TV] <i>No, reaIIy,</i>
<i>who do you think I am?</i>
MAN: <i>Baby, I think you're my girI.</i>
<i>Anything wrong with that?</i>
<i>You shouIdn't be so certain.</i>
MAN: <i>Can't heIp it if I'm certain.</i>
<i>Come on, Iet's take a waIk, huh?</i>
WOMAN: <i>No, I'm not faIIing for that.</i>
MAN: <i>You're faIIing for somebody.</i>
[Romantic instrumental music playing]
Tru, love is never like it is in the movies.
<i>I mean, when was the Iast time you kissed</i>
<i>and music sweIIed?</i>
You're lucky if you can find
a guy that can tell time.
TRU: l'm not asking for much, Linds.
Just a solid guy,
some decent conversation.
Maybe when he smiles,
he'll have this little crease above his lip.
Oh, God, who is he?
His name is Luc.
And he's a crime scene photographer.
But what's the point?
With the hours l keep,
we'll never have time together.
That'll lead to issues and....
LlNDSAY: You're planning the breakup...
and you haven't even
gone out with the guy yet.
LlNDSAY: Look, l'm just saying,
know what you want, and act accordingly.
For example, what l want
is out of my cube at the office.
So tonight, over drinks...
l am gonna show the big boss man
my take on a new account.
l don't want a promotion.
l just want a first date.
Fine.
<i>But if it's romantic settings...</i>
and movie moments that you're after...
my advice, keep them a mystery.
Because real life is not like the movies.
Sorry.
Okay, l really hope you like my take on this.
Let's take a look.
You've put a lot of work into this, Lindsay.
-Nice job.
-Thank you.
lt's exactly this kind of motivation
that moves you forward.
Knowing what you want, and going for it.
That is so funny.
l just said that exact thing
to my friend today.
[Rock music playing loudly]
GARDEZ: l just got back from a pickup...
so just make sure there's nothing
left in the truck, okay?
-No problem.
-Good.
Hey.
Hey. What are you doing here?
One: l work here.
Right. And two?
LUC: Look, um...
l was thinking how we've been
seeing a lot of each other...
here in the morgue.
l was thinking how maybe it'd be nice
to see each other outside of the morgue.
<i>I know this isn't</i>
<i>the most appropriate pIace to ask...</i>
but would you be interested
in going out sometime?
l know this isn't
the most appropriate place to say yes...
but, yeah, l'd really like that.
How's tomorrow?
Tomorrow might be risky.
l never really know
how my days are gonna go.
GARDEZ: Look, you got an hour.
Okay, so take it.
<i>I got it covered. Don't worry about it.</i>
You guys have been doing
the mating dance for weeks now.
Get it over with.
You got an hour?
Yeah.
Thanks.
[Classical music playing]
So....
You grew up wanting
to take pictures of dead people?
l grew up wanting to take pictures.
The dead people...
came later.
-l know the feeling.
-What'd you say?
-l said, l know the feeling.
-What?
[Dishes clattering]
l said, l....
Never mind.
How's it possible that you're still single?
My friend Lindsay always says:
''lf the wrong guy's in the room,
l'll find him.''
l mean, not now. l mean, not you.
TRU: l didn't mean....
[Phone ringing]
Just a minute.
Sorry.
That's all right.
What's up?
Total disaster.
Tell me about it.
LlNDSAY: Okay, l will.
l just got busted down to receptionist.
You're kidding. What for?
LlNDSAY: <i>My boss made a move,</i>
<i>I said no...</i>
and he said,
''Maybe you'd enjoy answering phones.''
Okay, don't worry, we'll fix this.
l'll call you later, okay?
Okay. Bye.
[Baby wailing]
MAN: You okay?
Are we having fun yet?
Yeah.
[Exclaiming]
-Oh, my God.
-No, l got it.
[Phone ringing]
Yeah?
DAVlS: Yeah, you've got a pickup on-site.
lt's two bodies and Gardez needs help.
No, a pickup?
l didn't know that was part
of the job description.
Great.
Surprise.
This was going so well.
Sorry.
GARDEZ: So, how'd it go with photo boy?
You know those nights where things
click and you never want it to end?
That bad, huh?
l'm surprised we didn't get called out
to Lakewood Cliff sooner.
Looks like the guardrail finally gave way.
TRU: Hey, you got any advice
for a first-timer?
Thanks. Yeah, don't think so much.
Any theories?
Young love.
<i>How many times have you seen a death...</i>
that doesn't have
something to do with love?
<i>You see that neckIace there?</i>
<i>Not something a high-schooI girI</i>
<i>wouId buy for herseIf.</i>
lt probably came from him.
Do we know who they are?
The guy's name's Adam Whitman,
a student at Highland Prep.
<i>The girI's name's Jen DeLuca,</i>
<i>just a Iearner's permit.</i>
<i>See that tattoo? It means ''ambition. ''</i>
Looks like his was cut a little short though.
GARDEZ: Damn, the bodies
are all jacked up.
<i>We need a coupIe of stokes.</i>
l'll be right back.
You were in love, weren't you?
[Tense instrumental music]
ADAM: Help us.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Romantic instrumental music
playing on TV]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
So you're saying yesterday a guy and a girl
went over a cliff in a car accident?
Yeah.
DAVlS: Was l wearing this shirt?
Unfortunately, yes.
License plate was....
6<i>89</i>-TYH.
You memorized the license plate?
l memorize everything l can.
Once they ask for help,
l lose the body, any evidence.
The only thing l can go on
is what l remember.
<i>Okay, the car was Adam 's,</i>
<i>so I'II find him first.</i>
l guess l'm going to Highland Prep.
[Funky instrumental music]
LUC: Slow down there.
Yeah, l'm kinda in a rush.
LUC: That's funny, l was just thinking...
how we've been seeing a lot of each other
here in the morgue.
Yeah. Funny.
Then l was thinking...
how maybe it'd be nice to see each other
outside of the morgue.
l'm right in the middle of something.
Come on. lt'll be fun.
LUC: No, l got it.
Yeah?
lt could be.
l would love to. l would.
l just.... Not right now.
<i>I can't right now.</i>
Let me just get back to you, okay?
-Yeah.
-Okay.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
TRU: Keys?
You be careful with her.
l know. You won her in
the best poker game of your life.
Come on, l'm in a hurry.
Hold up. ls this one of your crazy days?
Keys? Yes, or no?
l just want her back, that's all.
TRU: Without a scratch.
Not the car. My sister.
[Phone ringing]
TRU: Yeah?
Where are you?
Oh, God, Linds, l'm sorry.
l had to bolt. Something came up at work.
HARRlSON: lncoming call
from Planet Bitch. Come back now.
Harrison says, ''Hi.''
ls it visitation day at the penitentiary?
She sends big hugs.
TRU: Can we hook up later?
Can't. l have to meet up
with my boss for drinks.
<i>I'm showing him</i>
<i>my take on a new account.</i>
LlNDSAY: <i>I just got busted</i>
<i>down to receptionist!</i>
You know, Linds, l really think
you should cancel.
<i>You know,</i>
<i>maybe keep work meetings in the office.</i>
Thanks. But l really think
he's gonna be impressed. Trust me.
<i>I'II caII you after? Bye.</i>
Harrison.
TRU: l'm gonna need one more favor.
[Upbeat instrumental rock music]
So l'm a mature 17.
[Upbeat rock music]
Excuse me.
Do you know
where l can find Adam Whitman?
Thanks.
BOY: l don't get you.
You're dating the hottest girl in school,
and you're sad.
l don't love her 'cause she's hot, Cole.
Come on.
You know what? You don't....
ADAM: Just forget it.
COLE: What?
You don't think l understand
the plight of star-crossed lovers?
l got a C-plus on that paper.
-Ambition.
-Good luck.
Nice ink.
TRU: Hardly any bleed-off.
Good work, too.
-Adam.
-Tru.
ADAM: lmpressive.
What's your deal? You new?
Checking it out for the day.
My family's thinking of moving here.
GlRL: Run, don't walk.
We're all stuck here,
but you still got an out.
That bad?
ADAM: Not if you find the right person.
This is my girlfriend Amy.
Your girlfriend?
GARDEZ: Young love.
This is Tru.
Prospective student.
Amy. Nice to meet you.
We hitting the café or what?
Yeah. Whatever you want.
l couldn't give the okay to a school
without checking out the grub first.
A girl after my own heart. Tag if you want.
Cool.
So where you from, anyway?
Does it matter?
Not to me, but to some.
ADAM: Most of us pay to go here.
Some of the other kids,
they're here on scholarship...
so they actually have to
work their way through.
What's the big deal?
lt's stupid, really.
lt's like this decades-old thing.
The two sides of the town just don't mix.
So it seeps into the school.
ADAM: We avoid them, they avoid us.
Boy, it's fun to grow up
in the middle of a cliché.
Let me get this for you.
ADAM: First meal's on me.
AMY: l'm just gonna get us a table.
[Tense instrumental music]
Hey.
-Do you know that girl?
-Who?
The one at the register.
ADAM: Not really.
She's on scholarship.
Like l said, oil and water.
TRU: <i>It's</i> Romeo and Juliet.
<i>Kinda. Two worIds.</i>
He's rich, she's poor.
Things wouldn't be kosher
if they were dating.
Are they?
TRU: <i>Neither of them are fessing up.</i>
And he's got a very public girlfriend.
This is kinda cool.
We're like a team.
A team?
Yeah, like the Wonder Twins,
except we're not twins...
l don't have any super powers.
Yeah. l should get back.
Romeo's getting me nowhere.
l'll try my luck with Juliet.
Good luck, because you know
how well that turned out.
Yeah.
[Slow instrumental music]
TRU: l was wondering
if you could help me. l'm lost.
Who isn't?
Not a fan of this place?
Of high school?
l see your point.
l saw you in line in the cafeteria.
-Tru.
-Jen.
TRU: DeLuca.
l caught your name tag.
Adam was showing me around.
He seems to have a way with the ladies.
Yeah. l wouldn't know.
He's not really my type.
Yeah, not my brother's either.
That's one headache l don't need.
Your brother doesn't like Adam?
JEN: No. Derek hates everybody.
You ask a lot of questions
for a prospective.
JEN: See you.
Who's your new friend?
Shut up and drive.
[Engine revving]
[brakes squealing]
[Phone ringing]
Morgue.
TRU: <i>Run a DMV check for me.</i>
Someone nicked my brother's car
and didn't leave a note.
The guy's name is Derek DeLuca.
The guy who stole your car gave his name?
Look, not a lot of time here.
GARDEZ: <i>AII right.</i>
Bingo. Derek DeLuca.
<i>Looks Iike he's got a coupIe</i>
<i>of outstanding speeding tickets.</i>
TRU: You wouldn't
happen to have an address?
[Funky instrumental music]
Hey.
Hey.
Aren't you the girl from the school?
l was giving myself a tour around town,
and l saw you in the driveway.
TRU: What are you working on?
l'm just tweaking the air mixture.
How come you don't go to Highland?
DEREK: You've seen
those trust-fund casualties.
Why do l want to hang out with them?
What, you don't like chilling with rich boys
and their expensive rides?
Can't say l'm a fan.
Of expensive rides,
or the boys who drive them?
Like Adam Whitman?
Don't tell me you're a friend of Whitman's.
TRU: l'm not a friend of anybody's yet.
But why, what's your issue with him?
His dad runs the glass factory out on 22.
He fired about 300 people last month.
My dad was one of them.
DEREK: You seen Adam's new ride?
Probably bought it with the savings
from the layoffs.
l think you and l both know
it's not about the car.
lt's about the driver.
Guess we'll see tonight.
What do you mean?
DEREK: l'm racing Adam.
You should come see for yourself.
Car race.
Where?
Lakewood Cliff. Two hours.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
l've got a where, but not a how.
lf it happens at the race,
it'd explain Adam's death but not Jen's.
l don't know how they ended up
in the car together.
Maybe they weren't.
What do you mean?
DAVlS: <i>'Cause it Iooks Iike an accident...</i>
doesn't mean that it is.
You should know, in our business...
<i>things aren't aIways</i>
<i>what they appear to be.</i>
Thanks, Davis.
l've never had anyone help me before.
l've never had anyone to help.
[Soft instrumental music]
Do you have a booth?
Something quiet? We have work to do.
All right. Right this way.
[Rock music playing loudly]
Lindsay, is that you?
Harrison.
LlNDSAY: What a surprise.
Tru told me you were gonna be here.
HARRlSON: Come here.
lt is so great to see you!
LlNDSAY: lt is?
[Harrison exclaiming]
What's up, my man? Harrison Davies.
l'm an old friend of Lindsay's.
LlNDSAY: You are?
HARRlSON: Are you guys eating?
Because l am starving, and they have
this little shrimp thing...
that is just to die for.
So when l finally stopped,
everyone behind me was covered.
l'm talking head to toe.
And everyone was just glaring at me,
like l meant to do it.
So anyway, that's the most l ever puked.
What about you, Greggers?
Excuse me.
LlNDSAY: What the hell are you doing?
You are deliberately sabotaging drinks
with my boss.
Apparently, l'm doing this
for your own good.
Giving him every reason
to demote me to phones?
No. Preventing it.
At least that's what l'm told.
Not that l know what to believe anymore.
Harrison, l swear to God....
Look, let's just say l have this friend.
Yeah, you got friends?
Okay, more like a friend of a friend.
Anyway, she used to work for Greg
until she found out...
that ''after-hour drinks'' were a quick way
for him to get into her--
Okay, stop, please.
You're the only one
that would take it there.
Gregory and l are here to work.
Whatever you say.
COLE: How much horsepower?
Hitting 425, going for 12 seconds.
10<i>8</i>?
AMY: You don't have to do this.
ADAM: lt'll be over before you know it.
And then we'll have
the rest of the night for us.
Hey.
Got a minute?
ADAM: l didn't know
you were gonna be here.
How did you know we were gonna....
You can't do this. This race.
l'll be fine.
TRU: No, you won't.
Something's gonna go very wrong.
This thing Derek has against you--
ls that what this is about?
Don't sweat it. l'm way ahead of you.
Yo, Derek.
Ready to go?
ADAM: Only if l'm riding with insurance.
TRU: lnsurance?
Yeah. He takes one of mine,
l take one of his.
<i>Make sure you know</i>
<i>no one's pIaying around.</i>
Fine. l'll take him.
[Tense instrumental music]
l'll take her.
No, you can't do this. l'm serious.
Just watch. You'll love it.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
You look worried.
How should l look when someone l love
is doing something stupid.
l'm sorry, l can't watch this.
[Car engines revving]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
You ready for the ride of your life?
Go, Derek. lt's your birthday.
[Tires screeching]
[Fast-paced rock music]
[Exclaiming]
[Engine racing]
JEN: Watch out!
DEREK: What's she doing?
<i>She's crazy!</i>
Come on! You just cut me off!
[Fast-paced rock music continues]
[Whooping]
[Crowd whooping and yelling]
[Rock music playing loudly on stereo]
ADAM: You jumped out
in the middle of the street.
<i>Are you insane?</i>
There's no way
l was gonna go over the cliff.
Let it go. You're alive, and you won.
l'm happy, you're happy.
Fair enough. Look, have you seen Amy?
l can't believe she just took off like that.
TRU: Here's a hint:
Girls in the movies like guys for their cars.
But girls in real life like guys
for who they are.
ADAM: Thank you.
Hey, where you going?
Back to real life.
[Phone dialing]
Hey. What are you doing right now?
[Classical music playing]
So, nice work. The table.
l usually get stuck by the kitchen.
Yeah, l do what l can.
Since our time always gets cut short...
l want to skip all the work talk...
and move right to anything
other than work.
Good call. But first, no interruptions.
LUC: Okay.
LUC: All right, l'll start.
What sport did you play growing up?
-Track. You?
-Baseball.
Red Vines or Twizzlers?
Twizzlers, of course.
l'm strictly a Red Vines guy.
lt's hopeless.
Tragic. l'm dating a Red Vines guy.
My turn. First kiss?
Mandy Banks. Fifth grade.
Worst gift you ever gave a girl?
LUC: To Adrian O'Malley when l was 13.
l didn't realize that a gold necklace
should cost more than $3.<i>9</i>5.
Necklace.
GARDEZ: You see that necklace?
She wasn't wearing it.
LUC: Not after it turned
her entire neck green, no.
This isn't gonna make any sense at all,
but l have to go.
LUC: Are you okay?
No. Really, l'm insane...
because l'm about to walk out
on a date that's working.
But it's just
there's somewhere l have to be.
LUC: Right now?
There are times when l do this.
Take off. l really wish l could explain why...
but l guess l'm just not
your average 22-year-old girl.
Whether you believe me or not,
l'll call you...
and if you're willing
to give it another try, that's great.
lf not, l'll understand.
No, l won't.
l'll be completely crushed, but l'll get it.
Thanks. Really, l had a good time.
[Rock music playing loudly]
COLE: Yeah, right.
TRU: Where's Adam?
COLE: He's around somewhere.
TRU: Where's Adam?
COLE: He's around somewhere.
What about Jen?
l saw her over there a few minutes ago.
[Soft instrumental music]
ADAM: What the hell is going on?
[Tense instrumental music]
Amy.
-What are you....
-Adam, l'm so sorry.
l knew things weren't great between us,
but how could you--
-Adam, why don't--
-Okay, shut up.
l wanted to tell you.
l didn't know how.
Looks like you figured it out, huh?
l'm so sorry.
For what?
They're all gonna know.
Everyone's gonna know.
Then we'll deal with it.
Remember what we always said
we'd do if people found out?
l don't know.
l've lived here my whole life.
l mean, it's messed up, but it's home.
How they'll look at us?
lt won't work here.
We won't work here.
We have to leave, Jen.
Please.
All right. Go home and pack.
l'll pick you up in half an hour.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Remember how l said
this was <i>Romeo and JuIiet?</i>
l was wrong. lt's Juliet and Juliet.
Are you joking?
No. Amy and Jen.
They're the ones in love.
<i>They didn't die during the race.</i>
l don't know what's gonna happen, but....
-Hello?
-l gotta go.
Tru.
Okay.
My round. Lindsay?
Greggers, my man?
No, thanks.
Fine. Keep my seat warm.
l am so sorry.
This is not what l wanted for tonight.
Neither did l.
LlNDSAY: We have a few minutes.
l could at least go through
some of the proposals that l--
lf we've only got a few minutes...
then let's not waste it on work.
He was right?
You should--
HARRlSON: You should call it a night.
lt's getting late.
You're an important guy.
You want to be fresh
for those morning meetings.
You're probably right.
See you tomorrow.
Gregory.
Don't forget this.
<i>We can discuss it tomorrow at the office?</i>
Right.
Good night.
Wow. This is a first.
Thanks, Harrison.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
Hello?
Are you ready?
Yeah, l'm ready.
<i>I know we have to do this.</i>
l love you.
l love you, too.
AMY: <i>I'II be there in a few.</i>
<i>Meet me out front.</i>
DEREK: What are you doing?
Who were you talking to?
Nobody.
No? You said, ''l love you.''
lt's none of your business.
DEREK: Where are you going?
JEN: Get out!
lt's Adam. l knew when he
picked you there was something.
You have no idea
what you're talking about!
He picked me because l'm your sister.
DEREK: Just tell me where you're going.
JEN: Out of my way!
[Door banging shut]
[Tense instrumental music continues]
What are you doing here?
-Please, just, can you get in?
-No way.
Come on, Jen, just get in.
l've chilled. Seriously.
l just want to talk to you.
About what?
Look, l can't find Amy.
<i>So the Ieast you can do</i>
<i>is give me a minute.</i>
You owe me that.
One minute.
Exactly!
Damn it, Harrison!
Change your oil once in a while!
TRU: Derek.
DEREK: Babe, l'm kinda busy!
TRU: l know it's none of my business...
but your sister's with Adam,
and we gotta stop them.
DEREK: You read my mind. Hop in.
He's upset. And with the way he drives,
l think something might happen.
You said you wanted to talk.
You don't have to drive fast.
How long has this been going on?
-A few months.
-A few months?
l wanted her to tell you.
ADAM: No.
[Tense instrumental music]
l can't believe he thinks
he can bag my sister.
She's not sleeping with him.
What do you think they're doing?
Playing Candyland?
Adam, can you slow down?
l'd just like a few answers.
l got in the car
because you need to know something.
Talk fast.
lt's not your fault.
<i>ReaIIy, Adam.</i>
<i>She didn't know how to teII you.</i>
She loves you.
But she's in love with you.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[brakes squealing]
ADAM: The necklace.
l was gonna get it for her.
She was looking at it in the window
of this jewelry store forever.
<i>Now I know why.</i>
She wanted to give it to you.
You're her best friend, Adam.
<i>That's why it was so hard.</i>
She didn't want to hurt you.
DEREK: Thinking he's all hard, huh?
What are you doing?
Trying to tap my sister in daddy's car?
ADAM: You gotta get out of the car.
JEN: l can't! lt won't. The door's jammed.
TRU: Your sister's in that car! Stop it!
DEREK: Just shut up!
You're gonna kill her!
l'm not gonna hurt my sister.
She needs a little scare.
Stop, you'll push them over!
There's a guardrail. l'm just bumping them.
lt won't hold.
GARDEZ: The guardrail gave way.
Stop! lt won't hold!
DEREK: Poor little rich boy!
Derek, your sister's not in love with Adam.
She's in love with Amy.
That's who she's running away with.
What?
AMY: l saw Derek's car.
[Soft instrumental music]
So you're saying that at exactly this time...
you were with those two dead kids
at the crash site?
That's what l'm saying.
So the girls aren't running away?
No. But it's not like it's all wrapped
up in a neat little bow.
They've still gotta deal with life
now that their little secret is out.
lf it weren't for you,
they wouldn't even have that.
lf it weren't for us.
Sometimes just being able to talk
to someone can make it a lot easier.
Who are those for?
Amy and Jen gave them to me...
for helping them deal with their secret.
And l'm giving them to you...
for helping me deal with mine.
TRU: <i>Yo, Bro.</i>
Tru?
How you doing?
TRU: <i>Fine.</i>
Aren't you gonna ask me about your baby?
What baby?
TRU: <i>Your car.</i>
Thought that'd be
the first thing out of your mouth.
HARRlSON: <i>Yeah, right.</i>
Sorry, l'm just a little busy right now.
Just real quick,
tell me how things went with Lindsay.
Great. No worries. Mission accomplished.
You okay?
Yeah, l'm fine. Look, where are you?
My apartment.
<i>I gotta change to go meet someone.</i>
l don't know if that's the best...
idea.
Oh, my God.
Harrison.
LUC: You know, when most girls get up
and run away during the first date...
it's usually a bad sign.
l said l'd call.
Yeah. l thought you meant, like, Tuesday.
Yeah, my timing's been a little off lately.
Can you handle it?
l think l can.
'Cause maybe l'm not looking
for an average 22-year-old.
So you're free all night?
Not going anywhere?
l'm all yours.
You know, a friend of mine was saying...
that real life can't be like the movies...
that maybe sometimes
things are better left to mystery.
What good is a mystery
if you don't try and figure it out?
[Slow instrumental music]
[Romantic instrumental music]
[Rock instrumental music]
[Slow instrumental music]
-You're happy.
-Why shouldn't l be?
l'm 22 years old, l'm healthy.
l have a nice guy that l work with.
-Who, me?
-Yes. You, Davis.
l have good friends.
A cute boy,
who l can almost call my boyfriend.
And, every week or so,
l get a shout-out from a corpse and....
You relive the day.
lt comes in handy, you know?
Bad day? Do it over.
Bad outfit, quick wardrobe change.
-Premature death?
-Prevent it from happening.
Well, Wonder Woman has nothing on you.
Except for the pointy bras
and the invisible plane, no.
[Snorts]
lt's nice to see you making peace with it.
Let's be honest.
lt's not like l really have a choice.
l don't think those people
will take no for an answer.
DAVlS: Just out of curiosity, who else
have you told about what you can do?
Just my brother. Not that he believes me.
Except when he thinks
he can make a buck on the ponies.
-Anyone else?
-No.
Not my sister, or Lindsay.
And definitely not Luc.
lt's hard enough to date
without dropping that bomb.
What about your father?
lt's kind of hard to tell someone
who doesn't want to talk to you.
And it's funny. l can prevent death...
but l can't make a father
take interest in his own daughter.
-Tru--
-l know.
TRU: Too much information.
DAVlS: No.
l just want you to remember
that a gift like yours is never simple.
DAVlS: But there's someone...
who's gonna be very grateful
for what you can do.
Maybe even today.
[Tense instrumental music]
Jake.
We just got your CAT scan back.
And?
Why don't we talk for a moment?
[Tense instrumental music]
Jake.
What are you doing out of bed?
And why are you wearing your uniform?
You know you're supposed
to be in your robe. Jake?
Jake.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
MP 1 : No go. You know the rules.
JAKE: l need to get out of here.
Jake, l'm sorry.
You know the doc said to take it easy.
l'll be back in a couple of hours.
l just gotta do something. One thing.
Come on, back inside.
MP 1 : You're not supposed to
be out here anyway.
MP 1 : Jake, you okay? You all right?
JAKE: l'm just....
-What are you doing? Don't be stupid.
-l told you, l gotta get out of here.
Jake, come on, listen to me.
l just talked to the doc and....
l'll be back in a couple of hours.
You won't even miss me.
MP 1 : What the hell was that?
He had a gun. l saw he had a gun.
lt was Jake, for God's sake. lt's just Jake.
He's dead.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[Theme music]
[Phone ringing]
TRU: [On phone] <i>Hey, it's Tru.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>
MR. DAVlES: <i>HeIIo, Tru, it's your father.</i>
<i>I know it's been a whiIe...</i>
<i>but I'd Iike to taIk to you</i>
<i>when you get a chance.</i>
<i>You know where to reach me. Goodbye.</i>
Dad called you, too?
-Yeah, why? You?
-Yeah. And Harrison, also.
He's sweet like that.
Every five years,
no matter how busy he is...
he drops everything and he calls.
What'd he say?
HARRlSON: lt was a short,
unpleasant conversation.
He asked if l had a job yet.
He asked if l had a husband yet.
Just like the old guy. Charming as ever.
So what did he ask you?
-Nothing.
-Nothing?
l didn't call him back yet.
l will, just a little later, though.
You believe that SOB?
Doesn't talk to us in ages.
And when he does,
all he wants to do is criticize.
l wonder what he would've said to me.
HARRlSON: ''You work in a morgue?''
MEREDlTH: And ''You're not a doctor yet?''
-Sounds about right.
-Look at the bright side.
-At least you've got a job.
-Yeah. And a guy.
[Phone ringing]
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me.
How's Grandma? How's Rochester?
One is feeling better,
the other is way too far away from you.
Good news.
Davis is letting me take an early shift
so we can finally have our night alone.
-That's great.
-But?
But there's a small problem.
Train derailment.
LUC: <i>They shut down aII routes</i>
<i>up and down the entire seaboard.</i>
-Wonderful.
-But don't worry.
LUC: <i>I'II figure it out.</i>
lt's gonna take more
than a train derailment to keep us apart.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
Well, what the hell.
MARJORlE: You don't have a résumé?
HARRlSON: Let's be honest.
What is a ''résumé'' anyway?
A list of jobs that didn't work out.
No, seriously, l believe in starting fresh.
l'm always looking forward. Never back.
And tell me, what are
some of the unique qualities...
that you could bring to this job?
Laughs. A lot of laughs, Marjorie.
You mind if l call you Marjorie?
[Door squeaking]
Not quite as creepy as l thought it'd be.
Meredith, what a surprise.
l figured we're actually
getting along today...
why not push our luck.
l also thought you'd like to know
our brother went on a job interview today.
Dad really got to him, huh?
Yeah, well, not enough to keep him
from totally tanking the interview.
TRU: Why, what happened?
MEREDlTH: Same old thing.
Wore the wrong thing,
said the wrong thing...
didn't even bring a résumé.
MEREDlTH: Face it,
Harry's not exactly the nine-to-five type.
That's what you came here to tell me?
No, actually.
l came to find out what Dad said to you.
Don't know. l haven't called back.
-But you will, right?
-Why should l?
So he can pass judgment on me, too?
<i>I mean, Iook how he made you feeI,</i>
<i>and Harrison.</i>
Look, Dad's off in Connecticut
with a new wife, a new life...
and every five years he calls his kids
and we're supposed to jump?
He's still our father, Tru.
Yeah. Our father, who art in Greenwich.
MEREDlTH: Who's that?
Davis, my boss.
Cute.
ln that he's-so-not-my-type kind of way.
Wait a second,
l know what Dad said to you...
but tell me
you're not thinking what l think--
-He's a doctor, am l right?
-Yeah, but--
DAVlS: Thought l'd let you know
l'll take my lunch break now.
l'm sorry, l didn't know you had company.
-Hi, l'm Tru's sister, Meredith.
-Hi.
DAVlS: Tru didn't tell me
she had a younger sister.
Actually, l'm her older sister.
l'm shocked.
Your epidermal layer is flawless.
You know, l haven't eaten all day.
l mean, if you wouldn't mind
some company....
Really?
[Soft instrumental music]
So the gentleman's aorta...
was literally wrapped around
his left ventricle...
and l'd never seen anything like it.
<i>And not to mention</i>
<i>that his inferior vena cava...</i>
which, an interesting thing about that--
ls there anything else that
we could talk about besides autopsies?
-Sure.
-Great.
So, you a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fan?
No, sorry.
Would you like me to
finish the autopsy story...
'cause it contains
a lot of interesting things.
No, thank you.
Look at that.
lsn't that the bailiff
from Judge Stern's court?
l'll be right back.
MEREDlTH: Jim. What a surprise.
So nice to see you.
<i>I didn't recognize you</i>
<i>without your uniform.</i>
TRU: She walked out on you?
DAVlS: Not literally.
[Clears throat]
Okay, literally.
She spotted some bailiff she knew.
The next thing l know,
she's riding off on his motorcycle.
Davis, l'm so sorry.
She's a little unpredictable sometimes.
Not to mention, my father
has us all acting a little crazy today.
lt's not the first time it's happened.
Just the quickest.
l should've known a girl like that
wouldn't be interested in a guy like me.
[Davis sighing]
[Phone ringing]
Morgue.
You're where?
About <i>8</i>0 miles west
of where l'm supposed to be.
-What happened?
-The rental agency gave me directions.
-Bad ones?
-Not if l wanted to go to Cleveland.
l know we were both looking forward
to tonight...
but it doesn't look like
l'm getting home before dawn.
-That'll teach us to make a plan.
-We'll have our night soon. Promise.
GARDEZ: lncoming.
Okay, l gotta go.
TRU: Drive safe, okay?
LUC: <i>Bye.</i>
[Tense instrumental music]
GARDEZ: Cpl. Jake Voight, 21, just
got home from a tour of the Middle East.
-What happened?
-A disturbance at the Army Hospital.
One of the MPs had an itchy trigger finger.
-Time of death?
-10:00 a.m. on the dot.
Slight jurisdiction problem,
otherwise we would've had him sooner.
lt looks like a clean shot.
Probably died instantly.
GARDEZ: He survived the war.
Couldn't survive coming home, huh?
DAVlS: Shipped out from Fort McAllister
1<i>8</i> months ago.
He was wounded in battle.
Took a bullet in the thigh.
<i>CIean biII of heaIth</i>
<i>and they sent him home.</i>
The doc said he was a hero,
saved his entire squad in Afghanistan.
TRU: You know anything else about him?
GARDEZ: You writing his biography?
DAVlS: Maybe rewriting it.
TRU: The Army notify his family?
GARDEZ: No one to notify.
GARDEZ: The Army said
there is no next of kin.
DAVlS: lt's a shame.
No one should have to die alone.
DAVlS: Do me a favor.
Take him to Number 2...
l'll do an autopsy tonight.
[Tense instrumental music]
l need you.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
TRU: [On phone] <i>Hey, it's Tru.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>
Mr. DAVlES: <i>HeIIo, Tru, it's your father.</i>
<i>I know it's been a whiIe...</i>
<i>but I'd Iike to taIk to you</i>
<i>when you get a chance.</i>
l can't make it to breakfast today.
How about one of these days,
let me know the night before...
-so l don't have to wake up so early?
-Sorry.
l never know when these things
are gonna come up.
By the way,
l got an interesting call this morning.
TRU: Me, too.
HARRlSON: <i>You know what he said to me?</i>
Wondered when l was gonna get a job.
Look, here's the thing, Harry.
None of us will ever be
good enough for him.
-Nothing we do will ever--
-You don't think l know that?
l stopped trying to impress the guy
when l turned 14.
-Harry?
-Yeah?
l just wanted to say
employers like résumés.
They like applicants who dress nice
and who know their business.
-Tru, what's this about?
-Nothing. Nothing at all.
TRU: <i>Just one more thing.</i>
Make sure Meredith doesn't stop by
the morgue today, okay?
-Okay. Whatever.
-Hi.
-Who was that?
-Tru. She can't make breakfast.
No surprise there.
And she said not to stop
by the morgue later.
Stop by the morgue?
Why would she think
l'd ever stop by the morgue?
l don't know.
Why would she ever think
l'd need a résumé?
[Thunder rumbling]
TRU: No, l'm serious.
LUC: Train derailment?
You haven't heard?
Because it's all over the news down here.
lt's a good thing you told me.
l'd hate to get stuck in Rochester all day.
Why don't you take the bus?
l know for a fact there's one
that leaves in half an hour.
That's impressive. Weird, but impressive.
But l'm not much for buses.
l think l'll just spring for
the rental car instead.
-No.
-Don't you want to see me tonight?
No, of course l do.
lt's just l want to make sure
you have the proper directions.
Why do l have a feeling
you're gonna tell me what they are?
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
TRU: Hi, Jake Voight?
-Down the hall, Room 24<i>8</i>.
-Thanks.
l need you.
Hi, l'm here to see a patient.
l'm sorry, visiting hours
don't start until noon.
Noon?
-Time of death?
-10:00 a.m. on the dot.
l can't wait until noon.
ln fact, l can't wait much longer at all.
l can't wait until noon.
ln fact, l can't wait much longer at all.
Jake's an old friend of mine from basic.
l heard he was here.
l'm sorry, miss.
He'll still be here in two hours.
-Please, you don't understand.
-l understand fine. We'll see you at noon.
Jake.
We just got your CAT scan back.
And?
DOCTOR: Why don't we talk for a moment?
[Tense instrumental music]
Jake.
What are you doing out of bed?
And why are you wearing your uniform?
You know you're supposed
to be in your robe. Jake?
NURSE: Excuse me, Nurse?
-Yes?
-The patient wants a second opinion.
l've got a healthy male with a swollen leg.
lbuprofen and bed rest?
MP 1 : No go. You know the rules.
PATlENT: l've done that for four days.
l think l should see the doctor.
-Smoker?
-Once in a while.
He could have DVT.
You might wanna do an ultrasound.
That's just me.
JAKE: l need to get out of here.
l'm sorry, Jake.
NURSE: Maybe you should stick around
a little longer.
MP#1 : What are you doing? Don't be stupid.
TRU: No.
JAKE: l told you, l gotta get out.
l just talked to the doc and--
Jake, put down the gun, please.
MP 1 : Listen to her, Jake.
l'll be back in a couple of hours.
Okay? You won't even miss me.
TRU: No, don't.
Jake, let her go.
l told you, l just gotta get out of here.
Don't move.
MP 1 : Just take it easy.
[Tru gasping]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
JAKE: l'm sorry. l didn't mean to scare you.
Listen, tell them
l'll be back as soon as l can.
Wait, where are you going, Jake?
MP 1 : You okay, Nurse?
TRU: Yeah, l'm fine.
[Men screaming]
MP 2: Stop!
So is Jake.
-l'm not sure l'd say that.
-Why?
Because if we don't find him soon,
next time you see him, he'll be dead.
[Suspenseful music intensifies]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
DOCTOR: Jake was wounded overseas.
The doctors removed the bullet and
sent him back to the States to recuperate.
DOCTOR: Two weeks ago,
we learned that a bullet fragment...
had become dislodged
and settled in his pulmonary artery.
So you removed the fragment?
We tried, but he began hemorrhaging
during surgery.
When do you try again?
Well, until this morning we had no plans.
What happened this morning?
A CAT scan revealed
that an embolism had formed.
<i>We have no other choice</i>
<i>but to open him up again.</i>
'Cause if the embolism
ruptures the artery....
He'll die immediately.
That kid has a time bomb ticking
inside of him.
So let's just hope that
the MPs find him before it goes off.
TRU: l don't get it.
l save a guy only to learn
he could be dead by the end of the day.
Once the symptoms set in,
shortness of breath, sweating...
it's only a matter of hours.
Even if l find him
before the embolism kills him...
there's no guarantee he'll survive.
Okay, let's just think.
You told me that Jake said
he had something to do.
TRU: Yeah. That's what l heard him
tell the MP.
lf you knew that you were gonna die
in a matter of hours, what would you do?
l don't know. Cry. Get drunk.
Say goodbye.
TRU: According to his enlistment papers,
Jake has no family, no next of kin.
There was a photo in his wallet.
A picture of a girl.
TRU: Her name is Bridget Elkins.
She couldn't be older than 1<i>9</i>.
DAVlS: There's no Bridget.
There is a George Elkins
at 567 Charleston Road.
-lt could be her father.
-l'll take it. Thanks.
By the way, you just missed your sister.
-She came here?
-Yeah.
You guys didn't happen to make plans
by any chance?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
l can take it. How bad did it go?
She dumped you
for a bailiff on a motorcycle.
Davis, look, she's my sister
and l love her, but she's complicated.
l should've known a girl like Meredith
would never go for a guy like me.
-You really liked her, huh?
-Yeah.
l may regret this, but take notes...
'cause l'll tell you everything
you need to know about my sister.
London, yes.
But to be honest,
the city that l really love is Dublin.
MEREDlTH: l lived there my junior year.
DAVlS: That's amazing. That's so cool.
The next thing you know...
you'll tell me you're thinking about
moving back there.
Now this is getting weird.
[Meredith laughing]
DAVlS: Someone you know?
MEREDlTH: No one important.
Of course, l would be remiss
if l didn't mention my love for animals.
DAVlS: l love all kinds.
Dogs, cats. l adore horses.
l see.
So Tru did a pretty good job, huh?
Telling you exactly what to say?
Let me tell you something
Tru doesn't know about me.
MEREDlTH: l don't want a guy to be
just like me.
l want a guy to be himself.
That's what really impresses me.
-Be myself?
-Yeah.
-Okay, l can do that.
-Good.
So....
You a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fan?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
567 Charleston.
TRU: Jake.
You okay?
She's gone. They left.
[Soft instrumental music]
You're that nurse from the hospital.
TRU: lt's okay, l'm alone.
You have to go back.
Without that surgery, you'll die.
And with it, l hear my chances
aren't that much better.
Anyway, l'm not going back until l find her.
Bridget?
JAKE: l was 1<i>8</i>.
JAKE: l was stationed at McAllister.
JAKE: She was finishing her senior year
in high school.
You were in love with her.
Yeah. Crazy love.
l saw her...
and l just knew.
JAKE: Luckily, she felt the same way.
That's what l thought.
What happened?
l don't know. That's just it.
l had a 4<i>8</i>-hour pass
before l was shipped out.
The greatest two days of my life.
JAKE: Just me and Bridget.
Then l deploy, and a telegram shows up.
JAKE: She said she never wanted
to see me again...
that we were over. Done.
l called, but her number was changed.
l wrote, but the letters came back to me.
And if you don't mind me asking,
what makes you want to see her now?
As much as l'd like to...
there are a lot of things l can't forget.
About war...
about seeing your best buddies shot down
in the desert...
<i>8</i>,000 miles from home.
But the one thing l can't remember...
is the one thing l swore l'd never forget.
Her face.
All l have left is this.
l could die...
on the table, or right now.
-And if l do....
-You don't know that.
And if l do...
l don't want to close my eyes...
and not be able to see her face.
Of course, now she's gone.
Can't find her anywhere.
There are a lot of ways
to find someone, Jake.
Really?
lf l help you, you promise me
you'll go back and get that surgery?
Sure.
Still, l don't know how l'm gonna find her.
The house is empty. They moved.
Look inside, all that's left
are light bulbs and old magazines.
Old magazines?
TRU: Hi, this is Bridget Elkins.
How am l? To tell you the truth,
not too good.
l've called three times this month...
and l still can't get you people
to send your magazine to my new address.
Yeah.
Just so it doesn't happen again,
could you do me a favor...
and confirm that you have
the correct forwarding address?
Yes? 4<i>9</i>63 Denson.
That's it. Thanks very much.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Woman laughing]
You have no idea how many applicants
show up without a résumé.
-No.
-Yes.
l mean, just having one
puts you at the top of my list.
Of course, l don't notice
any prior experience in real estate.
That's because l don't have any.
But look, l've been selling something
to someone since l was 16...
and what l found is that
as long as you listen to the customer...
you can be successful
no matter what your product is.
All right then,
what are some of the unique qualities...
that you could bring to this job?
Laughs. A lot of laughs, Marjorie.
But, seriously. Passion, sincerity...
and a little thing l like to call ''persistence.''
Unique? Maybe not.
But what this company needs? Absolutely.
TRU: Here we are.
JAKE: Looks like Mr. Elkins
has been doing okay for himself.
-How do l look?
-Great.
Well.
-Not bad for a dead man anyway.
-Come on, stop that.
Hey.
You're sweating.
Once the symptoms set in,
shortness of breath, sweating...
it's only a matter of hours.
[Tense instrumental music]
You stay here, l'll get her.
You promise, as soon as you see her,
it's right back to the hospital.
Yeah. Just one thing.
lf her father answers the door,
don't mention my name.
-Why not?
-Bridget's a smart girl.
He's got big plans for her.
Falling in love with a soldier was not one.
Probably can't blame him.
l mean, does your dad like the guys
you bring home?
He never met them.
l'm sorry. He's dead?
Just by choice.
[Rhythmic drumbeats]
-Hello.
-Hi. ls Bridget home?
-No, she's out right now.
-Could you tell me where l might find her?
-l'm sorry, you are?
-A friend of hers from high school.
You must not recognize me. Tru Davies.
No, l can't say that l....
New nose. And l lost, like, 20 pounds, too.
Don't be embarrassed.
You wouldn't be the first.
Tru. Yes, of course.
Why don't you come in for a moment?
MR. ELKlNS: Now, what's so urgent?
l'm only in town for a few hours.
ln fact, l'm on my way to the airport
and if l didn't see her--
She's at school.
She's got class all afternoon.
l'll tell her you stopped by, if you'd like.
Or l could swing by campus,
if you point me in the right direction.
Look, she'll back from the JC
in a few hours.
Junior College,
but Bridget was a valedictorian.
She could've written her own ticket.
[Car tires squealing]
MP: Come on, Jake. We're going back
to the hospital right now.
Jake?
Who are you?
Did you bring Jake here?
ls that why you came?
Yes, but you don't understand.
He needs to see Bridget.
You leave my house.
And you stay away from my daughter.
JAKE: l said let go.
TRU: You have to go with them.
JAKE: l came to see Bridget.
-l didn't see her.
-l know where she is.
l promise you, Jake, l'll find her.
Just please go.
Oh, my God. Hurry.
-Get him back now.
-Come on, let's go.
MP: They're not too happy
about that jeep, by the way.
l'll find her.
You know, l don't even know your name.
Tru.
Tru. You're not really a nurse, are you?
What makes you say that?
You're some sort of angel.
[Soft instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
MAN: Can l help you?
TRU: l'm looking for Bridget Elkins.
The registrar said she was here.
MAN: She was, yes.
But you just missed her.
MAN: The class ended five minutes ago.
TRU: Do you know where she is now?
ls Bridget in some sort of trouble?
lt's her grandmother. Nothing serious.
She slipped in the tub again,
and Mr. Elkins asked me to find her.
Let me see, if it helps you,
she normally meets Phillip after class.
-Phillip?
-Yeah.
They're quite
the popular couple on campus.
Try the Metzler Building, 212.
He should be finishing up there.
Thanks.
[Children babbling]
[Slow instrumental music]
Thanks, Regina. Say bye, Phillip.
Bye.
-Bridget?
-Yes?
-He's beautiful, your boy.
-Thank you.
He looks just like his father.
What?
Listen, l'm a friend of Jake's.
He needs to see you, both of you.
What?
l haven't heard from Jake
in a year-and-a-half--
He may not survive the day.
This is all a little bit much, okay?
l haven't heard from Jake in 1<i>8</i> months.
-Suddenly you show up--
-He doesn't know about Phillip.
Why does that sound
like some sort of accusation?
lt's not.
l found out l was pregnant
the day he was shipped out.
BRlDGET: And l tried to contact him,
but l couldn't.
Obviously, he had no interest
in reaching me.
You sent him a telegram.
You told him not to contact you.
What? Telegram?
l don't know what he's told you, but....
l'm over him.
l don't know why l'm getting so upset.
He wants to see you
before he goes into surgery.
We could be at the hospital
in under an hour.
Ten years ago, l lost someone that l love.
And not a day goes by that l don't wish
l could see her one more time.
You still have that chance, Bridget.
Sorry. l can't.
l lost him once, l can't lose him again.
[Soft instrumental music]
Guardian angel or stalker?
You decide.
l was in the neighborhood.
[Jake moaning]
TRU: How are you feeling?
As soon as l'm stable,
they're taking me to surgery.
After that, anyone's guess.
-l'm so sorry, Jake.
-For what?
l was supposed to help you.
You wanted to see her,
and l couldn't do what you asked.
Don't do that.
-You tried.
-l failed.
What? You didn't fail.
Why are you being so hard on yourself?
l saw where she lives.
l know she's in school.
She sounds happy. Healthy.
JAKE: She was more alive for me today
than she has been in two years.
That's nothing to apologize for.
l thought he was never gonna go down.
MR. ELKlNS: You hungry? There's--
BRlDGET: No, thanks.
[Sighs]
A crazy thing happened today.
This woman came by...
-said Jake wanted to see me.
-Really?
She seems convinced that l sent him
some stupid breakup telegram.
Listen, there's a lot of odd people
in the world.
Nothing to take to heart.
[Tense instrumental music]
Please, tell me it wasn't you, Daddy.
Sweetheart--
BRlDGET: Tell me that
you didn't sign my name.
-That you didn't send it.
-Look at me.
BRlDGET: Not until you say
that you didn't send it.
Because he's sick.
He could die.
You had your whole future ahead of you.
Princeton, Stanford,
you could have gone anywhere.
My God.
-l knew it.
-You got knocked up by a soldier.
You were the top of your class.
He was enlisted--
-l loved him !
-Where did that get you?
Running between daycare
and some third-rate community college.
You could've been great.
You are my father, you're supposed
to love me no matter what l am.
You ever wonder how one little decision
can change your whole life?
All the time.
lf l didn't join the Army....
You never would've been stationed here.
You never would've met Bridget.
Maybe l would have met her
somewhere else.
l would've had a nine to five,
a house and kids.
Man, we would have had some cute kids.
TRU: Jake, listen....
l'm sure you would have.
[Phone ringing]
Excuse me.
TRU: Hello?
HARRlSON: <i>Hey, hey.</i>
HARRlSON: Why don't you come meet me
so we can celebrate?
TRU: <i>I can't make it tonight.</i>
But congratulations, Harry.
HARRlSON: <i>Not sure how you knew,</i>
<i>but thanks to you...</i>
she offered it to me on the spot.
TRU: <i>That's great.</i>
l'm so happy for you.
And, thanks to me, l turned it down.
You know, screw the guy
if he can't love me for who l am.
HARRlSON: <i>I'II see you, okay?</i>
-Bridget.
-Hi, Jake.
[Soft instrumental music]
You came.
God, look at you.
You look beautiful.
Jake, there's someone l want you to meet.
You have a son.
We do. Phillip, say hi to your daddy.
JAKE: Hey.
[Baby chuckling]
[Jake chuckling]
JAKE: How did we screw things up so bad?
[Shushing]
-Don't talk.
-Were we too proud?
Too stupid?
NURSE: Here we go, Corporal.
All that matters is l'm here now.
So whatever happens to me,
l want you to have a good life.
l want you to marry.
l want Phillip to have a father.
He has a father.
Have a good life, Bridge. Promise me.
Jake, you're gonna be fine.
Promise me, Bridge.
Take care of him.
[Soft instrumental music]
lt's taking so long.
-lt was a risk. We all knew that.
-What?
Oh, my God.
TRU: [Whispering] l am so sorry.
[Bridget sobbing]
l lost him.
You didn't lose him, Tru.
His time was just up.
Jake knew he wouldn't survive the surgery.
That's why he asked you for your help.
But it's my job to prevent death.
To save people. All that.
Well, maybe Jake wasn't the one
who needed saving.
Maybe you saved the person
you were supposed to.
Bridget.
DAVlS: You let her say goodbye,
because yesterday, she wasn't able to.
-This job's just confusing sometimes.
-l know.
That's why you have me.
<i>[AngeI</i> by Sarah McLachlan playing]
Key under the mat, right?
TRU: You made it.
LUC: Yeah. Did you ever think l wouldn't?
[Tru sighing]
TRU: No. Never.
-You okay?
-Better now.
Why don't you relax?
There's just one thing l gotta do.
MR. DAVlES: [On phone] <i>Leave a message</i>
<i>at the beep.</i>
Hey, Dad. lt's Tru.
l know we haven't talked in a while...
but l want you to know l'm doing okay.
l have a new job.
l guess you could say l help people.
Sometimes, if l'm lucky, they even help me.
That's why l'm calling.
Because l know how hard it is
for two people to find each other.
Especially when one of them
doesn't want to be found.
So, good night, Dad...
l hope you're happy and well, because l am.
And from now on,
you don't have to try to find me...
because suddenly...
l don't feel lost.
<i>[AngeI</i> by Sarah McLachlan continues]
Sorry.
Long day.
Tell me about it.
[Theme music]
[Mellow pop song playing on radio]
[Knocking at door]
[Knocking continues]
LUC: So you finally did it.
Thirty-nine straight days at the morgue,
and you finally took one off.
-l had to see it for myself.
-l was this close to the record.
l thought that we could celebrate
over breakfast.
This is pathetic.
50 people coming here tonight...
and all l have in the way of munchies...
is a bottle of olives
and a box of baking soda.
l don't get this. You moved
into this place six months ago...
and you're throwing
a house warming party tonight?
What can l say? l've been busy.
TRU: So, are you nervous?
LUC: About what?
Tonight. Meeting my friends
for the first time. My brother.
They're going to study my every move
and report back to you.
-Why would that make me nervous?
-You'll be great.
[Phone ringing]
TRU: Hello?
MARK: <i>Tru?</i>
MARK: Hey, it's me. Come on,
it's only been a couple of months...
-don't tell me you've already forgotten?
-Mark.
[Soft instrumental music]
MARK: <i>Look, I know</i>
<i>what happened was my fauIt...</i>
<i>and you have every reason to hate me.</i>
But l just can't stop thinking about you,
Tru, and l want you back.
[Tense instrumental music]
MARK: <i>Hey, are you stiII there?</i>
Yeah, but now really isn't a good time.
Maybe l could come by later?
We could talk, face to face.
See, here's the thing.
What you want really doesn't matter.
Know why?
'Cause you're the one who cheated.
And it was the biggest mistake of my life,
Tru, and l know that now.
Yeah, well, you should've known it then.
Besides, l've met someone new.
And he's great.
Please, Tru, it'll never happen again.
You're right, it won't.
TRU: <i>I got to go, Mark.</i>
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Theme music]
Help me.
[Soft instrumental music]
-ls everything okay?
-Yeah. Why?
You looked a little freaked
when you answered the phone.
l thought maybe it was bad news.
Well, the truth is that was my ex.
And he wanted to see me.
l can't say that's the answer
l was expecting, but....
Hey, whatever you need.
You and l have only been out a few times--
l told him no.
[Romantic instrumental music]
Even better.
l'm sorry. lt's weird.
l shouldn't have told you.
No, l'm glad you did.
lf you and l can't be honest
with each other, what hope do we have?
You're probably wondering
why l asked you to meet me here today.
-l meet you here all the time.
-Whatever.
HARRlSON: lt's Lindsay.
Ever since we hooked up,
l can't stop thinking about her.
-You're kidding me, right?
-Crazy as it sounds, l'm not.
You know me. l can't stand Lindsay.
l never could.
And, yet, she just keeps
popping into my head.
lt's confusing the hell out of me.
And you're telling me this now because....
You're meeting her
to shop for your party, right?
l thought maybe you could feel her out.
See where her head's at. You know?
Vis-á-vis yours truly.
[Grunts hesitantly]
Come on. Help a brother out.
Look, all l'm looking for
is a simple yes or no.
LlNDSAY: <i>Maybe.</i>
TRU: Maybe you're interested
in my brother?
He's cute, don't get me wrong.
He went all weird after we made out,
like he was embarrassed or something.
-Typical guy stuff.
-He was probably just nervous.
Still, post-hookup, you give a girl a call.
You know, maybe some flowers.
Make the girl feel special.
We don't need that.
Got to cut the limes with something.
Besides, it's on sale.
Okay.
Oh, my God, Pez. l forgot Pez.
You and your candy.
l just love those little dispensers.
They're so kitschy.
[Phone ringing]
Hello, Davis.
For the last time, yes.
But what if a dead body comes in
and asks for help? What do l do?
First, they don't talk to you,
they talk to me.
Okay, but--
Also, they don't ask for help
every night. lt's not how it works.
Just come in for five minutes.
lf no one asks for help,
then you can go home.
TRU: <i>Did you hear what I said?</i>
l worked eight days this week, literally.
-But what l'm trying to say is that--
-Davis, l need a break.
Okay. So l'll see you tomorrow?
l'll see you then. Bye.
MARK: Chips, dips, a whole lot of beer.
Looks like somebody's having a party.
[Tense instrumental music]
What's wrong?
Nothing, l'm just surprised
to see you here, is all.
Real coincidence.
l live three blocks from here,
remember that?
This is my market where l shop.
-l'm not following you or anything.
-Okay.
Since l have you here,
l just wanted to apologize...
because l feel like l came on strongly
this morning. lt was rude.
TRU: That's fine.
MARK: Anyway...
it was nice to see you.
Yeah.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
l still can't believe
you had a stalker moment and l missed it.
lt wasn't a stalker moment.
Mark and l just happened to be
in the same place at the same time.
That's what stalkers do.
They just happen to be in your market...
and then they just happen
to follow you home...
and then they just happen to
chop your head off and seal it in a baggie.
TRU: Linds!
LlNDSAY: l'm just saying.
First the phone call, and now this?
[Phone ringing]
Hello?
HARRlSON: <i>What'd she say?</i>
<i>And teII me everything.</i>
TRU: <i>ActuaIIy, I'm pretty satisfied</i>
<i>with my Iong-distance pIan.</i>
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
lt means you should maybe
call back another time.
She's right there, isn't she?
Yes, that's right.
Telemarketer.
Just give me a hint.
Tell me something. Anything.
l think if you want your customer
to change plans...
you should show her
some special consideration.
Special. Like a gift or something?
TRU: Not bad.
HARRlSON: <i>What shouId I get her?</i>
Hey, she's very happy
with the plan she's got now. Thanks.
[Exclaims]
Only way to handle those guys.
[Fast-paced rock music playing on radio]
Hey, Tru. Cool party.
lt's good to see you again.
Thanks!
Who is that?
Oh, my God,
Marty's actually on time for once.
Marty. That's who that was.
Can you believe
this thing came with instructions?
-For a knife?
-Yeah.
-Apparently you can cut through rebar.
-Good to know.
[Exclaims]
[People applauding]
Thank you. Thank you very much.
-Hey, Sam.
-Tru, l'm so sorry about the vase.
Don't be. You know what they say:
''Priceless heirlooms
are made to be broken.''
So, how are you? How's med school?
You're at Hopkins, right?
No. That kind of fell through.
SAM: l missed the final
because of a big family emergency...
and this jerk professor
wouldn't give me a make-up.
Sorry to hear that.
So, now l'm selling shoes with my dad
in his store until l can reapply.
-What about you?
-Tagging toes at the morgue.
Man. And l thought l had it bad.
[Fast-paced rock music
continues playing on radio]
Harrison, it's beautiful.
That's just a little something
from me to you.
Actually, it's from Bill to Sally.
-What?
-Yeah, there's an inscription on the back.
-''To Sally from Bill.''
-That. No, that can be removed.
Where did you get this thing?
A pawn shop?
ls that a problem?
[Upbeat rock music playing on radio]
-Happy house warming.
-Thank you.
Come here one second.
HARRlSON: Whatever happened to,
what is that saying:
''lt's the thought that counts''?
lt counts if it's yours.
This thought here happens to be Bill's.
Hi. You must be Luc. l'm Lindsay.
-Nice to meet you.
-This is my brother, Harrison.
HARRlSON: How's it going?
LUC: A pleasure.
Tru, can you help me
with the punch real quick?
Let me ask you a question, guy to guy.
Wanna buy a watch?
LlNDSAY: Okay, your brother
is so hopeless.
l mean, a pawned watch? How tacky.
Harrison just has his own way
of doing things.
Right. The cheap way.
-Lindsay.
-Okay, sorry. Change of subject.
LlNDSAY: Your new boyfriend is hot.
l just hope he's having a good time.
lf he isn't, so what.
lt's your party, remember?
l've already had a few.
l should probably slow down.
Nights like this do not happen that often,
especially with a job like yours.
LlNDSAY: Cheers.
TRU: Cheers.
[Upbeat rock music
continues playing on radio]
Tru, there's an angry guy at the door.
He says he's your neighbor.
Turn the music down,
or else l'm calling the police.
All you had to do was ask, Brian.
No, l'm not asking, l'm telling.
Turn the music down.
TRU: Fine.
BRlAN: Yeah.
'Cause me and the landlord,
we're like that.
One call from me,
he's gonna take away your parking spot.
l don't have a car.
ln case you get one.
Why didn't you invite
your next-door neighbor?
-Are you kidding me? That guy's a creep.
-All the more reason to invite him.
lf he's helping make the noise,
he can't complain about it, right?
TRU: Well, it's too late now.
Bye. Bye, you guys.
l'll call you, okay?
[Mellow pop music playing on radio]
l need to talk to you.
l know that l shouldn't be here,
it's inappropriate...
but l cannot stay away, and l am sorry.
You need to go. Now, Mark.
-l need you to talk to me.
-We're through talking.
All l'm asking for
is five minutes of your time.
[Tense instrumental music]
Five minutes, Tru, and then l will go.
Fine. But not here.
Okay. Then meet me upstairs on the roof.
Promise me.
Just wait for me there.
Hey, what was that about?
That was the guy
who called me this morning.
Your ex?
He just kind of showed up.
He wants to talk to me.
So talk to him.
You're okay with that?
l trust you.
Thanks.
[Tense instrumental music]
Mark?
[Dramatic instrumental music]
What the hell's the matter with you?
The first time l ever kissed you
was on this roof.
-And l thought maybe if--
-Mark.
No. Stay.
Talk to me
about how great we are together.
You need to go home.
Don't come near me again.
[Tense instrumental music]
Great.
[People chattering]
TRU: Drive safe.
Call you a cab, Sam?
No, but if you know of a good place
to throw up, that would be great.
Down the steps, hook a right,
anywhere in the alley's fine.
You rock.
[Soft pop music playing on radio]
-You okay?
-Yeah. Where did everybody go?
Without you here,
no one really felt like partying.
That, and we ran out of booze.
ls everything okay with the party-crasher?
Fine.
You tired?
Lindsay's punch kind of got my head
doing summersaults.
-Go to bed. l'll clean up after you.
-Just leave it till tomorrow.
All right. Let's get you to bed.
Thanks for everything.
l had such a good time tonight.
Me, too.
You want to stay?
l would love to.
But tonight, you need to sleep.
-So l'll see you tomorrow?
-Count on it.
[Romantic instrumental music]
[Car alarm beeping in the distance]
Luc? l thought you said
you were going home.
[Gasps]

[Tense instrumental music]
[Crying]
[Sobbing]
WOMAN: <i>91 1 emergency.</i>
<i>May I have your name and Iocation?</i>
Tru Davies, 1723 Oracle.
l'm calling to report a murder.
WOMAN: <i>Can you teII me what happened?</i>
l just woke up and he was here.
l don't know how.
MARK: Tru?
[Eerie instrumental music]

WOMAN: <i>Stay on the Iine, pIease.</i>
Tru, l need you.

[Fast-paced instrumental music]
LUC: So you finally did it.
Thirty-nine straight days at the morgue
and you finally took one off.
<i>I had to see it for myseIf.</i>
l don't get this. You moved
into this place six months ago...
and you're throwing
a house warming party tonight?
Tru?
Sorry. What's that?
[Phone ringing]
Hello?
MARK: <i>Tru? It's me.</i>
Mark.
MARK: <i>Yeah. You haven't forgotten.</i>
<i>I'm gIad.</i>
There's something
that l'd like to talk to you about...
but l don't want to
talk to you over the phone.
Standard Diner. One hour.
MARK: Yeah. Okay.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
That was Davis.
He needs me to work today.
You're kidding.
Can it wait until after breakfast?
He said it was an emergency.
You're not mad, are you?
No, l just feel bad for you.
lt seems like you never catch a break.
TRU: l'll see you tonight, right?
LUC: Yeah.
TRU: l turned him over, there was
a single wound below the heart.
l called <i>9</i>1 1, but then he asked for help,
and the day restarted, and here l am.
So, if l'm to understand you correctly,
you had a party and didn't invite me?
Davis.
-l thought we were friends.
-We are friends.
Sure, when you wake up
next to some dead guy.
l apologize. Can we please focus here?
Okay.
So you have no idea
how Mike ended up in your bed?
Mark. And, no, l don't.
Look, l had a lot to drink last night.
-What about suspects?
-So far, l can only think of one.
-Who?
-Me.
Come on, Tru.
l don't know.
Mark was acting so weird yesterday.
Maybe he got violent,
maybe l fought back.
-There's no way did you kill him.
-How do you know?
Because l know you.
You save lives, you don't take them.
DAVlS: The victim was stabbed once
in the chest.
<i>Was that the onIy wound?</i>
[Tense instrumental music]
There was a pretty deep cut
in the palm of his right hand.
What else?
There was blood
on the wall behind my bed.
TRU: lt looked like sort of a half circle.
lnteresting. Any place else?
l just woke up and he was here.
l don't know how.
Yeah, on the doorknob.
And you said
you found the knife on the floor.
Beside the bed.
Only the first couple inches
of the blade were bloody.
That indicates a shallow wound.
You don't think it was suicide?
No. The slash on his palm
sounds like a defense wound...
meaning he was trying to protect himself,
which suggests murder.
Here, let me show you something.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
DAVlS: lt's a forensic simulator program.
Helps investigators recreate a crime scene
that has been tampered with or destroyed.
So you're gonna recreate
my apartment on the computer?
DAVlS: l put in these variables.
l might be able to extrapolate
some ballpark description of the killer.
-How ballpark?
-Height, weight, sex.
lt'll take a few hours.
l'm meeting Mark in 15 minutes.
Aren't you forgetting something?
-The party. l'm invited tonight, right?
-There isn't gonna be a party.
DAVlS: No, there has to be a party.
There has to be a party.
ln order to save Mark's life...
you have to recreate the circumstances
that led to his death exactly.
DAVlS: Not only can you not
cancel the party...
you have to make absolutely sure
that he shows up.
DAVlS: Otherwise, the killer
could strike some other place.
Some place where you will not be able
to protect him.
All right.
Sorry, Harrison. We'll do lunch tomorrow.
Actually, there was something
l needed to talk to you about.
-Lindsay, right?
-Yeah. How did you--
lf you want her to like you,
you got to make her feel special.
How do l do that?
l don't know. Pick some flowers,
or burn her a CD mix.
Could l just go buy her something?
Fine. Just make sure it's not a watch
with another woman's name on it.
Come on. l would never do that.
Unless l did that. Did l do that?
l thought you don't believe
that l relive days.
l don't. l mean, look, l'd like to. l would.
But don't change the subject.
HARRlSON: <i>AII I wanted was advice.</i>
Okay, then just remember.
Think personal, not personalized.
Personal, not personalized.
MARK: lt's been a while.
You okay? You seem a little....
MARK: lt's been a while.
You okay? You seem a little....
Yeah, it's nothing. l'm fine.
-lt's kind of strange seeing me, isn't it?
-Kind of.
-Anyway, the reason l called--
-Yeah, what's been going on with you?
Me? You know, the usual. Just classes,
grading papers, praying for tenure.
And what else? Personally?
l was seeing somebody.
But l broke it off, if that's what you mean.
-Another student?
-Yeah.
-lt's not one of my best qualities, is it?
-Anyone l know?
Got to admit, Tru, this isn't
the conversation l thought we'd be having.
MARK: Her name is Julie Spence.
She graduated last spring,
and now she works in the Mayor's office.
How'd she take it?
-Take what?
-The breakup.
Actually, she kind of went psycho on me...
and she even slashed my tires
the night l broke things off with her.
But you don't want to hear about this.
[Tense instrumental music]
lt's really good to see you again, Tru.
Yeah. You, too.
This is great.
lt was strange, but it was great.
Yeah, it was good to see you.
You know, we talked so much
during lunch, l never got to...
tell you why l called.
MARK: l've been thinking about you
a lot, Tru. About us.
About how great we were together.
And l miss you so much.
And l want you back.
Look, l know we have a lot to work out,
but l will do whatever it takes.
l'm seeing someone.
And l know how this is gonna sound,
but l want us to stay friends.
Friends. Yes, l've heard that one before.
No, really. l'm having a party tonight.
You should come.
We could talk some more,
you know, about everything.
Okay. That sounds great.
MARK: l have a late class,
but l'll swing by right after.
TRU: Okay.
MARK: Okay.
Bye.
[Somber instrumental music]
l guess Davis didn't need you after all.
-What are you doing here?
-l'm on my way to work.
Which, by the way,
is where you're supposed to be.
Look, the guy you just saw me with
is my ex-boyfriend.
He's the one that called this morning.
That's why you ran out on breakfast?
So you could meet him?
Luc, he's in trouble.
He needed to talk to me.
What kind of trouble?
lt's hard to explain.
You just have to trust me.
Like l trusted you when you said
you had to work this morning?
LUC: You know what?
Have fun at your party tonight, all right?
Luc, wait.
[Somber instrumental music continues]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
TRU: You called me here
to look at a watermelon?
How's that supposed to
help us solve a murder?
Observe.
[Soft instrumental music]
Notice there's no leakage.
The knife has sealed the wound.
DAVlS: But when you pull the knife out....
DAVlS: Does that look familiar?
[Soft instrumental music continues]
You're saying
Mark pulled the knife out himself?
That's not all.
The blood on the doorknob suggests...
he opened the door
with his wounded hand...
indicating that he was stabbed
outside of your apartment.
Okay, here's the sequence of events
as l see them.
Mark Evans is attacked.
[Mark screaming]
Left there for dead.
He gets to his feet,
he staggers towards your apartment.
[Panting]
With his wounded hand,
he opens the door.
[Tense instrumental music]
DAVlS: Makes his way
to the foot of the bed...
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
<i>pIaces his hand on the knife--</i>
And yanks it out of his own chest.
[Gasps]
Precisely.
But how's he supposed to walk around
with a knife in his heart?
Because the knife sealed the wound.
For the first few minutes
there was probably very little blood loss.
-Then why pull it out?
-More than likely, he was in shock.
l know what you're thinking.
None of this proves you're the killer.
Yeah, none of this proves
that l'm not the killer, either.
You know what l was
supposed to be doing right now?
Making bean dip,
decorating for my party, having fun.
Nobody said this job was gonna be easy.
Yeah, no one said
it was gonna suck, either.
DAVlS: Tru, Tru.
You're not alone.
We are gonna crack this together.
[Soft instrumental music]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Turn the music down,
or else l'm calling the police.
Hey, Brian. l'm having a party tonight
and l'd like you to come.
Seriously?
Yeah. What fun would it be
without my neighbors?
BRlAN: All right.
TRU: See you tonight?
Sure. Yeah.
l mean, l'm always up for a party.
Great.
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: ''Julie Spence.''
[Knocking at door]
[Sam exclaims]
Tru, a little help here.
-Ever heard of two trips?
-lf someone hadn't bailed on me.
Sorry about that. How much do l owe you?
$140 plus change.
Don't look at me like that. lt was on sale.
You made me come all the way over here
to get rid of a knife?
-A perfectly good knife, l might add.
-Just lose it. l don't care how.
HARRlSON: Hey, l still haven't figured out
a gift for Lindsay.
l mean, any other chick,
l'd buy candles or something.
But with Lindsay,
she's got such weird taste.
So get her something weird.
Just make sure--
l know. Get rid of the knife.
Something weird.
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: Excuse me? Julie?
You don't know me,
but my name's Tru Davies.
TRU: l'm a friend of Mark Evans.
Actually, l know exactly who you are.
-Mark used to talk about you all the time.
-He did?
He was obsessed with you,
even when he and l were together.
You here to gloat?
-About what?
-Getting him back.
l always knew he wasn't over you.
l didn't get him back.
l don't even want him back.
-Then what do you want?
-To warn you.
No matter how strong
your feelings are for Mark...
you can't let them get the best of you.
l have no idea what you're talking about.
He said you slashed his tires
the night he called things off.
JULlE: No, it wasn't me.
But whoever did that terrible thing,
l'm sure Mark deserved it.
-Stay away from him.
-What are you, his bodyguard?
No. l'm just worried about him, that's all.
Whatever happened between us
is our business, not yours.
Whatever happened between us
is our business, not yours.
l'm not so sure about that.
-l'll deal with my exes my way, Tru.
-Yeah, that's what l'm worried about.
l think l finally get why you and Mark
were so perfect together.
You're both psychotic.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Come in.
l thought l might find you in here.
Yeah. A photographer in a darkroom.
Go figure.
l'm sorry l lied.
l only met Mark
because l was worried about him.
lt won't happen again.
The first time we went out...
you warned me there'd be times
you'd take off with no explanation.
<i>And before today, I was okay with that.</i>
But now l'm curious.
When you leave, where do you go?
Come on. l mean, you said
you were gonna be honest with me.
-And l will.
-So tell me. What's the deal?
Do you have some secret life?
LUC: Another guy stashed somewhere?
TRU: Of course not.
Then why won't you tell me
what's going on with you?
[Somber instrumental music]
Great.
LUC: Honesty.
TRU: Hey, Luc--
No, it's okay 'cause we're just starting...
and it's better this happened now
instead of later.
Listen, if you're looking for
neat and easy...
then, yeah, you're probably right.
You've got the wrong girl.
But if you think you can handle something
a little more complicated...
then stick around. You won't be sorry.
[Phone ringing]
LUC: Yeah.
TRU: Hello?
DAVlS: <i>I need to see you. Now.</i>
[Somber instrumental music continues]
TRU: l've got to go. Davis needs me.
Yeah. l've heard that before.
DAVlS: l finished running the numbers
through the simulator.
Based on the victim's
own height and weight...
and the location
and moderate depth of the wounds...
l believe that the killer
was approximately 5'4'', right handed...
and lacking upper body strength.
Mostly likely a female. What do you think?
l think you just described me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music continues]
Don't put words in my mouth.
l still don't think you did it.
5'4'', right-handed,
my apartment, my knife. Who else could....
l'll deal with exes my way, Tru.
-Julie.
-Who?
Mark's ex-girlfriend.
She and l are about the same size.
There. All we have to do is go to the party,
keep an eye on Mark...
and if the ex shows up,
you and l will be there to stop her.
And if l'm the killer?
l will not let you
make the same mistake twice.
[Fast-paced rock music playing on radio]
Hey, Tru. Cool party.
lt's good to see you again.
Thanks, Marty. Glad you could make it.
-Hey, neighbor. Kicking party.
-Thanks, neighbor.
You okay? You look a little worried.
The last party l had was kind of a disaster.
Before l moved in, l guess.
BRlAN: That's okay. Don't worry.
lf things start to slow down...
l'll go get my karaoke machine.
People love that stuff.
So here's a little something
from me to you.
l know you got, like, a ton.
But this one's supposed to be pretty rare.
LlNDSAY: Oh, my God!
Popeye, 1<i>9</i>52, blue base, no feet.
There was only 2,000 of these made.
How did you know?
You said something about
a collection once.
Guess l wanted you to know
that l was listening.
[Fast-paced rock music
continues playing on radio]
Look what your brother gave me.
-Sorry. He means well.
-Are you kidding? l love it.
TRU: You do?
LlNDSAY: Yeah.
l don't know, l'm thinking
maybe l was wrong about him.
LlNDSAY: Maybe he is special.
You haven't seen Mark, have you?
As in your ex? Why would he be here?
-l invited him.
-What?
Why would you do that? What about Luc?
lt's a long story.
You know what you need?
Some of my special punch.
Thanks, but not tonight.
Hi.
How's it going?
No sign of Mark or Julie yet,
but it's still early.
l'm glad you're here.
Thanks for having me.
Where should l stand?
[Upbeat rock music playing on radio]
Where is that knife l bought?
BRlAN: Need something?
'Cause if you do, you know,
l live just right next door.
Got a knife?
[Dance music playing on radio]
Now l'm selling shoes with my dad
in his store until l can reapply.
SAM: How about you?
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: Would you just excuse me one sec?
SAM: Yeah. No problem.
-Where did you get that?
-Your neighbor.
LlNDSAY: l can't find the one
l bought today. Have you seen it?
No, just be careful, okay?
-Okay.
-Sis, you got a sec?
l don't think it's gonna happen
for me and Linds.
-But she loved your present.
-Yeah, but...
she's so into me now, it's sort of a turnoff.
HARRlSON: You mind if l turn on the TV,
check out some scores?
TRU: Yeah, whatever.
HARRlSON: Okay.
[Dance music continues playing on radio]
You made it.
Yeah. Sorry l'm late.
My class ran kind of long.
Not a problem. l'm glad you're here.
Yeah. Me, too.
-Do you have a second?
-Sure.
lt's kind of loud in here.
Do you think we can go to the roof?
-l'm the hostess, l shouldn't.
-Come on, it'll take a second.
[Tense instrumental music]
l thought you had a boyfriend.
What happened? He go missing or....
No, he's not here.
-Trouble in paradise?
-Something like that.
Trust me. He's a fool
to walk away from a girl like you.
Take it from someone who knows.
Thanks.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
-What are you doing?
-l'm sorry, you invited me to the party--
Mark, l told you. l just want to be friends.
But friends isn't enough.
l won't give you up, Tru.
You're gonna have to.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
Maybe he got violent,
maybe l fought back.
Look, just stay away from me, Mark.
For your own good.
MARK: Tru.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
Downstairs, hook a right,
anywhere in the alley.
You rock.
Bye.
-So your brother took off on me.
-You're kidding.
He said something about
a card game downtown...
and then he just split.
Can you believe that?
-What's that for?
-Your vase. Sam knocked it over.
l shouldn't have let him
drink so much tonight.
LlNDSAY: lt wasn't a drunk thing.
lt was more like an angry thing.
TRU: What do you mean?
He got all worked up
over some professor...
that cost him a slot in med school.
...and this jerk professor
wouldn't give me a make-up.
The killer was approximately 5'4'',
right handed--
Then meet me upstairs on the roof.
Sam.
[Tense instrumental music]
Johns Hopkins!
The most prestigious medical school
in this entire country!
And they wanted me.
l'll make a telephone call
and explain what happened.
lt's too late for that now!
lt took me months...
but l was finally
getting my life back together...
and then you just go
and show up at my friend's party?
l just knew l couldn't let it go this time.
l couldn't let it go.
Put it down, Sam.
Tru, this is the guy.
This is the guy l was telling you about.
You're drunk. You don't want to do this.
No, l had a plan.
l had one chance, Tru.
And he took it from me.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
So take it back.
What are you talking about?
lf you don't like how
things went down the first time...
-do something about it.
-l am !
TRU: No, you're giving up.
lf you hurt Mark...
your life actually becomes
the sob story you think it is.
You could spend 20 years in a cell
feeling sorry for yourself.
ls that what you really want?
God!
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[Mark panting]
Tru, l don't know how to thank you.
You could say goodbye.
[Somber instrumental music]
DAVlS: Ex-student with a carving knife
on the roof.
The simulator would've
never figured that one out.
l still don't get how Mark made it
all the way back here...
with a knife in his chest.
Well, he loved you, Tru.
That always makes a person stronger.
[Door opening]
[Romantic instrumental music]
l hope l'm not too late.
You know what?
l'll just see you guys at work.
Thanks, D.
So l've been thinking.
TRU: About?
LUC: That nothing good comes easy.
lf l need to work a little harder
to keep you in my life, then so be it.
<i>I have a feeIing you're worth it.</i>
What about when l take off?
Think you can handle it?
l guess we'll find out.
[Romantic instrumental music continues]
Sorry l missed your party.
lt's not over yet.
-No?
-No.
Not tonight.
[Rock music]
[Somber instrumental music]
[Man exclaiming angrily]
PAlGE: Daddy, l'm leaving.
SANDERS: But you won't even
let me finish.
Sweetheart, please don't go. Not like this.
Paige, l promise you,
there's nothing wrong with my baby girl.
l'm not a baby. And l'm not your girl.
SANDERS: Paige....
PAlGE: Don't touch me.
SANDERS: God, have you ever considered
that nothing happened?
SANDERS: That this is all just
a figment of your imagination?
l give myself more credit than that.
Because pretty soon,
the truth is gonna come out.
And when it does,
l can promise you one thing.
l'm not the only one
who's gonna have to deal with it.
<i>You are, Daddy.</i>
[Car starting]
SANDERS: Paige!
[Somber instrumental music continues]
DAVlS: Okay, hotshot. Bonus question.
You ready?
TRU: Hit me.
Riddle me this: The odontoid ligaments
serve to limit the extent to which?
The cranium's rotation can be carried...
which is why they're also known as
check ligaments.
-You gonna eat that?
-lt's all yours, smarty-pants.
l am finished with
cramming for your MCATs.
Davis, come on.
We haven't even started
on the sympathetic nervous system.
You know the secret for acing the MCATs?
Quit cramming. Get some sleep.
Go home, Tru.
l'm just so excited.
lf l ace the MCATs tomorrow,
l get into medical school.
l do that, l become a doctor.
And if l become a doctor,
l can finally say goodbye....
To working here?
Come on, l didn't mean it like that.
Don't worry.
l got a feeling it's not gonna happen.
You think l won't pass?
l nailed every question you asked.
Plus the ones you made up.
No, that's not what l meant.
l'm sure you'll ace them.
l just meant that...
sometimes l get the feeling that
some people don't belong here.
And some people do.
So which am l? l belong here or not?
What do you think?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Theme music]
Help me!
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
Hello?
Bitch Cakes. Hey, it's Lindsay.
l guessed.
So listen. l found a guy.
TRU: l'm shocked.
LlNDSAY: <i>Not for me. For you.</i>
His name's Jeremy.
l haven't met him, but he's your type.
lf you've never met him,
how do you know he's my type?
Tru, it's my gift.
So stop asking questions...
and start looking for that
black Dolce & Gabbana dress...
l got you last Christmas.
Lindsay, we've been through this.
l'm not on the market,
and l'm taking my MCATs this afternoon.
LlNDSAY: <i>Perfect. You'II meet him after.</i>
And don't worry, l'll be there to chaperone,
so now you're all out of excuses.
LlNDSAY: <i>Say you'II be there.</i>
TRU: l'll be there.
LlNDSAY: <i>Smart girI.</i>
LlNDSAY: Good luck on your test.
TRU: <i>Thanks.</i>
[Light instrumental music]
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look like crap.
Thanks, Harrison. Very sweet.
l told you l've been up studying all night,
because in 45 minutes...
l'm gonna take the biggest test of my life.
-Right. The Top Cats.
-MCATs.
l just want to know you're okay.
Outside the big test jitters,
l'm fine, thanks.
ls everything else copasetic?
Feeling good? Having fun?
Look, you know me.
l'm always looking out for you.
Because l know you'd do
the same thing for me.
-All right, what do you want?
-Nothing, man. What?
A guy can't worry about his own sister...
without being
accused of working an angle?
Jeez. l'm offended.
How could you actually say that to me?
lt's about what l told you, isn't it?
About me.... You know, what l can do.
Okay. A: l don't even believe you.
And B: Even if l did,
l would still need some cold, hard...
proof.
TRU: The racing form?
You want me to believe you, right?
<i>WeII, here's a way.</i>
<i>I go to the track, I see who wins.</i>
l call you up on the phone,
tell you the horses' names...
and tomorrow should you, you know,
do that voodoo you do so well....
-You make money.
-Yeah.
Harrison, l don't think that's how it works.
l'm not even sure it works at all.
But l've heard of weirder systems,
so l say, what the hell, give it a shot.
[Upbeat rock song playing on radio]
Are you down with this,
or do l have to go work for a living?
l'll see what l can do. But now l gotta go.
l love my sister.
Go. Go take your MCATs.
Kick much academic ass.
Thanks.
[Tense instrumental music]
Time.
Time's up, people. Pencils down.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
LlNDSAY: To my best friend, Tru,
who just aced her MCATs...
and who will make
a wonderful doctor someday.
-Cheers.
-l'm not done yet.
And who will always squeeze me in
on short notice...
and accept
whatever health insurance l carry.
-Of course.
-Okay. Cheers.
[Upbeat dance music playing on stereo]
TRU: ls that him?
LlNDSAY: lt's gotta be.
God, can l pick them, or can l pick them?
LlNDSAY: Hey, Jeremy?
JEREMY: Yes.
Hi.
TRU: Jeremy.
JEREMY: That's me.
But you can't be Tru,
you're too good to be true.
Yeah, my name does lend itself
to more obvious puns.
l spent all day thinking that up.
Do you mind?
JEREMY: l don't usually go on blind dates.
Who knows what you're gonna get?
<i>So at first I was aII, Iike, wait,</i>
<i>she works in a morgue?</i>
'Cause l mean, come on,
you're too hot to work in a morgue.
You ought to switch jobs.
You ought to be in, like,
videos or something.
-l have to go.
-Right. Night shift. Creepy.
JEREMY: So, l'll call you.
Wait, you forgot to give me your number.
[Upbeat instrumental music
playing on stereo]
[Romantic instrumental music]
-Luc. Hi.
-Hi.
-Have we met?
-Yeah.
ln the we've-never-actually-met
kind of way.
l heard there might be a new guy.
That would be me. Luc.
Tru.
-Dress code?
-Blind date.
Bad one.
Well, is there any other kind?
My friend, Lindsay,
thinks it's her life's work to fix me up.
She worried you can't meet a nice guy?
Worried l can't meet a living one.
She shouldn't worry.
-l mean....
-Why? Know someone for me?
Give me some time.
LUC: Anyway, l gotta run.
My folks are in town,
but it's nice to meet you.
Yeah.
Tru.
Luc.
[Cell phone ringing]
TRU: Hello?
HARRlSON: <i>Hey, it's me.</i>
And l hold in my hands
the key to financial freedom.
TRU: A job application?
HARRlSON: <i>That's very funny.</i>
But no.
What l have are the winning horses
from the last race at Del Mar.
Great.
HARRlSON: <i>It's a 40-to-1 trifecta, Tru.</i>
So write this down.
Today's lucky ponies are...
Cherry Top, Sky Marker, and Whirligig.
You know, l have no idea
why l can do what l do...
but l'm pretty sure
it's not so l can pick the ponies.
HARRlSON: <i>TeII me you got them.</i>
TRU: l got them, okay, you happy?
No. But l will be tomorrow...
if my big sister's
as lucky as she claims to be.
l gotta go. l love you.
DAVlS: Tru?
TRU: l didn't hear you come in.
DAVlS: Hi.
l meant to tell you,
you got a call from County Records today.
Something about
an autopsy report you requested.
Yeah, my mother's.
Stupid.
-ls there a problem?
-l'm sorry.
Had l known,
l would've authorized delivery.
-But since l didn't know, l just didn't--
-lt's okay. l'll get them tomorrow.
DAVlS: No, not likely.
The clerk went on vacation tonight
for a couple of weeks.
<i>With aII the red tape downtown...</i>
you'll probably have to wait
till he gets back.
lt's okay. l've waited ten years.
Another few weeks won't kill me, right?
Still, l can't help but wonder...
if those are the answers
you're really looking for.
Why, what are you--
GARDEZ: We got a cold one.
[Tense instrumental music]
GARDEZ: The name's Paige Sanders.
Medical student at Hudson.
Well, until 4:31 today.
Hudson? That's the top medical school
in the state.
GARDEZ: Didn't do her any good.
TRU: How'd she die?
DAVlS: Here's a guess.
Knowing the high-pressure world
of most med students...
l would posit this one worked hard.
DAVlS: But apparently played
a wee bit harder.
Overdose? God, that makes no sense.
<i>Hudson gets their pick of the best</i>
<i>and the brightest. She had it aII.</i>
DAVlS: What can l tell you?
DAVlS: Some students
can hack the pressure.
GARDEZ: And some can't.
Yeah, but why would she--
Never met a newbie as curious as you.
Relax. You can't help her now.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
Come on, Davis,
what more can you tell me?
lt looks like we have
a little petechial imaging in the eye.
<i>UsuaIIy associated</i>
<i>with some sort of trauma.</i>
Could be a side effect of the drug intake.
Coughing, vomiting,
internal pressure of some kind.
Wow. Someone's gonna do well
on their MCATs.
<i>That's good.</i>
Just to be sure, we should prepare
the body for a toxicology report.
l want to know exactly what chemicals
were in the student's body when she died.
GARDEZ: Hey, wait up, Davis.
You have no idea how lucky you were.
Save me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
Hello?
Bitch Cakes. Hey, it's Lindsay.
<i>Too tired to taIk? Okay, fine.</i>
<i>'Cause I found a guy. His name's Jeremy.</i>
And he's totally your type.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
DAVlS: Good morning.
You ever have, like,
one of the greatest days of your life?
l mean, a really truly great day...
and then just feel like
the whole thing got erased?
You're assuming
l've ever had a great day?
DAVlS: What are you doing?
TRU: l'm just checking for something.
Hey, did we get any
medical students last night?
The only medical student here is you
in a couple of hours.
-Aren't you taking the MCATs today?
-l did.
l will. l just have to do one thing first.
You have quite the life, don't you?
Unfortunately, yeah.
And, Davis,
if County Records just happens to call...
go ahead and authorize the delivery.
l want those files.
TRU: My God, Luc, l'm sorry.
Here, let me help you.
No, thanks. Really. l got it.
TRU: Tell me it's fixable.
Well, l would.
But then l'd probably be lying.
[Soft instrumental music]
How did you know my name?
What?
You called me Luc just now,
but we've never met before.
l'm a lucky guesser.
Yeah, well...
nice running into you.
Tell me this day gets better.
[Tense instrumental music]
Check again. My records have to be here.
Are you sure you're using
that thing right?
[Cell phone ringing]
TRU: Hello?
HARRlSON: <i>Tru? Where are you?</i>
Oh, God. Harrison, breakfast.
Why did you blow me off?
l've been waiting half an hour.
lt's not my fault.
l'm having one of those mornings.
So, you're telling me what?
We already had this conversation?
Do you have the racing form
in front of you?
lt proves nothing.
Except that if you're having
one of your so-called lucky days...
you should be telling me
today's winning horses.
l don't remember.
What?
They were horse things.
How am l supposed to remember them?
You know, you talk a good game,
but l knew you couldn't do it, Tru.
<i>I knew it. See you.</i>
lt's Hansen. Jessica Hansen.
The transfer should've come in hours ago
from Harvard Medical.
l'll be sure to let you know
the moment they come in.
You do that.
Hi.
Just a thought,
but when her files come in...
you should bounce them back
to Harvard just for laughs.
Don't give me any ideas.
WOMAN: What can l do for you?
My friend, Paige Sanders, is a student.
l want to surprise her.
Do you know where l can find her now?
-l'm not allowed to say.
-l get that.
Too bad, though.
She just got a residency
at the Mayo Clinic...
and l'd love to see the look
on Harvard's face...
when she learns my friend got in
and she didn't.
WOMAN: Goddard Building, Theater C.
-But you didn't hear it from me.
-Didn't hear what from you?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Mr. Taggert, would you tell
your fellow surgeons in training...
what exactly you're doing
to this poor dead man's heart?
Like you taught, sir...
l'm just making a cut
between the inferior vena cava....
And the what? Anyone?
STEVEN: Eustachian valve.
PROFESSOR: Good.
Taking particular care not to sever....
Miss Sanders?
GARDEZ: <i>Name's Paige Sanders.</i>
Save me.
PROFESSOR: Miss Sanders?
PAlGE: The....
[Whispering] Anterior margin.
The....
The answer l'm looking for
is the anterior margin.
Right. No, and l knew that. l just--
We all knew the answer, Miss Sanders.
The question is time. Time matters.
<i>To us, time is the difference</i>
<i>between Iife and death.</i>
Time has value, Miss Sanders.
And please do not waste our time.
<i>For those of us</i>
<i>who may actuaIIy become doctors...</i>
our minds are the most valuable tools
we possess.
And we must keep them sharp
at all times.
Thank you. See you next week.
Take your notes.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
''The mind's the most valuable tool.''
He should know.
He's the biggest tool on campus.
He acts like he's Zeus or something.
l hate that.
Well, the least he can do is realize
that he's not a god.
l am.
DAN: Hey, Sanders.
Nice work in there. Very impressive.
Give me a break, both of you guys, okay?
l'm not in the mood.
STEVEN: Relax, Sanders, it's us.
Excuse me?
[Tense instrumental music]
Hi. You guys are second-years, right?
Yeah, that's right. Who's asking?
The name's Hansen. Jessica Hansen.
l just got in from Harvard today.
Jessica Hansen.
-Yeah, l saw you inside.
-You were observing us.
Yeah, what can l say?
l'm just naturally curious.
Good for you. Welcome to Hudson.
But as you've observed,
we are second-years...
which means we're busy.
Hey, is it true what they say
about you guys?
[Tense instrumental music continues]
Don't know.
What is it exactly they say about us?
-That you're good.
-They'd be right about that.
What else do they say?
That you throw the best parties,
well-connected...
got some heavy-hitting careers
lined up for yourselves.
But that's not the whole story, is it?
Look, l'm cool with it, you guys.
l came here to hook up
with some color-outside-the-lines types.
Maybe we are. Maybe we aren't.
My question would be, what's it to you?
Like l said, l'm just trying
to make some new friends.
By the way, that professor
had no right to talk to you that way.
The name's Paige,
and l can take care of myself.
l believe it.
Listen, l just got out of
one Alpha Boys' Club.
<i>I'm new in town.</i>
<i>Come on, heIp a sister out.</i>
Just welcome me to campus.
l'll buy you a meal.
-l can't. We....
-We're busy.
-Doing what?
-Nothing that concerns you.
But go ahead, enjoy your meal.
We're not doing anything without you.
PAlGE: Okay.
l can't remember the last time l sat down
and ate a solid meal.
l thought you might need a break.
You got that whole ''overachiever''
thing going for you.
Yeah, right. l'm doing everything l can
just to keep up.
You seem to push yourself pretty hard.
Yeah, but l mean, who doesn't?
You, me. l mean,
it's the whole med school thing, right?
You pass your MCATs...
always busting your ass
trying to max out your potential.
lt must be nice.
[Pop song playing on radio]
l just, you know, have to stop
and appreciate it sometimes.
Not everyone's so lucky. We got in.
TRU: So let me ask you.
ls everyone here
as uptight as your friends?
Those guys, you know, they're all right.
You know what
the competition can do to you.
Sure. But that doesn't mean...
we have to hurt ourselves
just to keep up with them.
What are you talking about?
Sorry.
Hello? Now?
Yeah. No, l'll be right there. All right.
PAlGE: Listen, thanks for lunch,
but l gotta run.
Paige. l know.
You know what?
About the drugs.
l don't know if you do it to keep up,
or to wind down--
Drugs? What are you talking about?
[Dramatic instrumental music]
What kind of freak are you?
-Okay, now l'm confused.
-Don't touch me.
PAlGE: Don't come near me.
l don't know what your psycho agenda is,
but screw you.
PAlGE: Stay away from me.
[Upbeat rock music]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Machine beeping]
[Tense instrumental music continues]
[Beeping quickens]
DAN: Finally.
PAlGE: Yeah, we are up and running.
DAN: Congratulations, Doctor. We did it.
He's dead.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Warning alarm sounding]
Looking good. Keep him steady.
DAN: Time?
PAlGE: Eight seconds.
Death looks good on you, Steve.
Twelve seconds. We're getting close.
[Tense instrumental music]
All right, 20 seconds.
Time to do your thing.
Clear.
PAlGE: No change.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
[Machine beeping normally]
[Soft instrumental music]
Now, that was a trip.
Did it work for you, Steven?
DAN: l've got a better question.
What the hell is she doing here?
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: l could ask you the same thing.
l'll bet your answer's a lot more
interesting than mine.
-Guess again.
-l'm guessing what l just saw...
could get you all kicked out of med school
by lunchtime.
Or we could talk.
So let me get this straight.
You got this little hobby.
-You kill yourselves?
-For starters.
TRU: And then you resuscitate.
PAlGE: That's the plan.
But what's the point?
The point, Jessica, is that
when you come back, you're not the same.
You know the urban myth about
how the moment you die...
your whole life flashes before your eyes?
lt's true.
Memories. You're unlocking
repressed memories.
And what are they, anyway, memories?
Just chemicals locked in the brain...
between your occipital fissure
and the temporal lobe.
And the best part is, they're just
lying there, waiting to be tapped into.
You guys are good.
Too bad your little experiment kills you.
Almost kills you.
l saw my father's face the day he left me.
l was two-and-a-half when it happened,
and now it's as clear as....
Let's just say hi-def video can kiss my ass,
'cause l have clarity.
Crystal clear memory of that day,
and so much more.
l'm next.
No. Paige, you can't.
You want to dig into your past, l get it.
But there's gotta be a better way.
<i>You can deaI with this.</i>
All you have to do is go to the source.
Find out whoever it is
you have unresolved issues with--
And what,
have a good long talk with them?
See their point of view? Reach closure?
You think l haven't already tried that?
You think this isn't my last resort?
Fine, if you know so much,
you go talk to my father.
Because nothing is gonna stop me.
[Somber instrumental music]
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
Hi. l need just one more thing.
[Rhythmic instrumental music continues]
TRU: Mr. Sanders?
MAN: Right block. Wrong house.
Mike Sanders lives right there.
TRU: Thanks.
MAN: My pleasure.
-Who'd you say you were?
-A friend of Paige's.
We go to school together.
Mr. Sanders, l'm really worried about her.
l think Paige is gonna hurt herself.
No. My daughter would never do
anything like that.
l wish you were right,
but l don't think you are.
And you're the only one who can stop her.
Why am l the only one?
You're her father.
You have a history with Paige that--
Look, whatever she told you
about me isn't true.
Touch my own daughter?
lt's sickening just thinking about it.
<i>And the craziest part is,</i>
<i>Paige doesn't remember anything.</i>
Just some nonsense about
the moon and the stars.
The moon and the stars,
what's that mean?
You're her friend. You tell me.
[Tense instrumental music]
Tru Davies?
ls Tru Davies here?
HARRlSON: <i>I thought</i>
<i>you were taking your test.</i>
l am. l'm just going a little late.
l have to find someone first.
HARRlSON: <i>I'm gIad I caught you.</i>
Look, l need you to concentrate.
And the names of the horses are....
Harrison, l told you,
l can't remember them.
TRU: Look, l'm really sorry, but--
PAlGE: Hey, Hansen?
l gotta go.
Tru!
[Exclaims angrily]
Were you just talking to my father?
What's wrong with you?
First you force your way into my life,
and then my group, and now my home?
How <i>SingIe White FemaIe</i> are you?
l know l'm butting in,
but just give me one minute to explain.
Okay, one minute.
TRU: l was 12 when my mom died.
You were just a kid.
l watched it happen, right in front of me.
l have questions about
my mother's murder...
that l may never be able to answer.
As much as l'd like to know the truth,
it's not worth dying over.
-Yeah, but why do you think l would die?
-Because l've done the research.
The heart can't withstand it,
and if the heart does, the brain can't.
Sure, some people get lucky
and come out okay.
But not everyone. Not you.
Look, do yourself a favor. Call it off.
lt's suicide.
l mean, it's not like l've never had doubts.
l mean, l just....
l have these feelings about my past...
and l don't know what else to do.
Talk to your father again.
Or a therapist. Anyone.
Just don't go through
with the experiment.
Fine, l'll call it off.
l don't know why l trust you, but l do.
-l'll tell the guys.
-That's great.
You have no idea how relieved l am.
Harvard, how's it going?
Hey, Dan. l'm glad you're here...
because l wanted to talk to you
about something.
Sure, great, love to hear it.
There's just someone l met
at the sign-ups for Molecular Bio.
l really think that you should meet her.
[Tense instrumental music]
Hi. Jessica Hansen.
<i>Is this the one you toId me about?</i>
And will the real Jessica Hansen
please stand up?
l don't understand.
TRU: Paige, l can explain.
JESSlCA: Allow me.
l'm Jessica Hansen.
l transferred from Harvard yesterday...
and this woman here
is trying some lame-ass identity scam.
Which, sorry, honey, it won't work.
DAN: And now that's over with.
How about you tell us
who the hell you really are?
TRU: Paige, l--
PAlGE: Don't.
Because as far as l'm concerned,
everything you've told me is a lie.
l bet you're not even
a real medical student, are you?
[Somber instrumental music]
TRU: Paige, just wait.
TRU: Two hours and counting.
-Steven? Steven, wait up.
-What do you want from me?
-You've got to talk her out of it.
-No way.
lt's going to kill her.
No, it won't.
Look at me. l've never been better.
Look, we all have questions
we need answered.
But Paige is gonna make
the biggest mistake of her life...
in just a few hours,
unless you talk her out of it.
STEVEN: A little late for that.
TRU: Why?
She's doing it right now.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Machine beeping]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Beeping quickens]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Warning alarm sounding]
DAN: Okay, ready to come back.
Come on.
l can't get her back. She's not responding.
TRU: Got dobutamine?
DAN: No.
TRU: Dopamine?
DAN: No, none of that, either.
She's been under too long.
She should've been out by now.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[Machine beeping normally]
DAN: lt's amazing, isn't it?
How thin the line between life and death
can be?
<i>The nearIy instant recovery time.</i>
That's why l designed this
the way that l did.
That's great, Dan.
<i>What wouId you have done</i>
<i>if I couIdn't revive her?</i>
Hey, are you okay?
You saved my life.
[Soft instrumental music]
You feel like telling us who you really are?
Sure. l just gotta do one thing first.
You've over three hours late.
Better get started then?
[Tense instrumental music]
Thank you.
STUDENT: Thanks.
DAVlS: lt looks like we have
a little petechial imaging in the eye...
usually associated with
some sort of trauma.
My God.
She didn't die from the experiment.
-l'll be right back.
-No.
Once you leave, you're done.
You understand?
PROCTOR: You, your test, your future.
l'm sorry, l have to go,
but l can reschedule, right?
PROCTOR: Sure.
Just be back here bright and early
first thing next year.
[Tense instrumental music]
Guess l'll see you next year.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
She unlocked a memory, didn't she?
Yeah. But it's none of your business.
Besides, Paige is fine,
and you're not even a medical student.
Well, pretty soon you won't be either
unless you tell me where she is.
TRU: You want to play chicken?
Because you're right.
l'm not a med student.
l have nothing to lose, but you do.
Especially with those track marks
on your arm.
-Where is she?
-l don't know.
All she remembered is a man.
He hurt her, touched her.
She wasn't that specific.
And then some crap about
the moon and the stars.
l don't know what it means.
l do.
TRU: Paige!
-Where is she?
-l told you, she's not here.
-l really have to find her.
-All right, l've warned you once.
l don't know who you are,
or what you think you're doing...
but this is harassment.
TRU: She's in trouble.
You don't understand.
Paige did something tonight.
What'd she do?
A really stupid and dangerous experiment,
but now she remembers everything.
And you think this would
bring her back to me?
Her car's parked out front.
You said something about
the moon and the stars.
That has to mean something.
Go. Just get out of here.
[Tense instrumental music]
That doesn't make sense.
[Cell phone ringing]
-Hello?
-Did someone forget her blind date?
No, l didn't forget.
l just couldn't make it this time.
This time?
There was a time
when you could make it?
l'm sorry.
LlNDSAY: Okay, look, l'll cover.
TRU: <i>You're the best.</i>
Bye.
[Upbeat dance music playing on stereo]
Jeremy, hi.
l'm so sorry. l don't think my friend's
gonna be able to make it tonight.
You're not Tru? Of course not.
You're too good to be true.
Oh, my God, did you just make that up
right now?
LlNDSAY: That's hilarious.
[Tense instrumental music]
The moon and the stars. lt's the neighbor.
You don't know what you're saying.
For the first time in years,
l know exactly what l am saying.
Paige. You've always been a smart girl.
Be smart now.
l was a child, you son of a bitch. l was <i>9</i>.
All right, this is ridiculous.
l'm calling your father.
Good. Call my father.
Call the police. Call the District Attorney.
l'm pressing charges.
You are gonna pay for what you did to me.
Just hush.
PAlGE: Don't touch me.
MAN: Just be quiet.
MAN: Quiet, please!
PAlGE: Don't touch me!
l said, quiet!
PAlGE: Get off me!
MAN: Be quiet!
No one's gonna believe you anyway.
l'll believe her.
Get out!
There's a statute of limitations, you know.
lt's been years.
Go ahead, go tell the whole world!
Who's gonna believe you?
Oh, God! l'm so sorry, Daddy.
[Somber instrumental music]
So, how are you feeling?
l thought remembering would be the end.
But it isn't.
lt's just the first step.
A lot to be said for a good first step.
So who are you, anyway?
And please don't say Jessica Hansen.
l had to take on her name
so l could talk to you.
l mean, if l told you l was really
just some med school wannabe...
who works in a morgue,
would you have listened?
Probably not. So why'd you help me?
l'm still trying
to figure that out for myself.
l guess you could say it's sort of my job.
Well, if you ever figure it out,
you know where to find me.
l'd like that.
Med school gets a little cold sometimes.
l'll take your word for it.
Good luck.
[Soft instrumental music]
PAlGE: Hey, Tru?
You'll make one hell of a doctor someday.
Someday, yeah.
LlNDSAY: <i>So, how'd the MCA Ts go?</i>
They didn't. How did my date go?
LlNDSAY: <i>Not bad.</i>
Until he used the same line
on the waitress that he used on me.
LlNDSAY: <i>HonestIy, you didn't miss much.</i>
TRU: l had a feeling.
But still, Tru, l'm telling you,
the perfect guy is out there somewhere.
LlNDSAY: <i>You just haven't met him yet.</i>
That, or l've met him too many times.
LlNDSAY: <i>ExactIy.</i>
Wait, how's that work?
See you, Linds.
-Hello, again.
-Hi.
l'm gonna try and get past you here
without any hard contact.
TRU: Don't want to break anything.
LUC: l was thinking
about our little accident earlier.
Maybe it wasn't such a bad thing.
Because otherwise,
we never would've met.
And l'm glad we did.
Yeah. Me, too.
At least this time, you won't forget me.
l don't think l could ever forget you.
Anyway, l gotta go.
-To be continued?
-Absolutely.
Say hi to your folks.
Like l said, lucky guesser.
[Romantic instrumental music]
[Cell phone ringing]
TRU: Hello?
HARRlSON: <i>Tru.</i>
Harrison, please.
For the last time, l can't remember--
No. Listen.
l didn't go to the track today after all.
And you know what? l had a great day.
TRU: Really?
HARRlSON: <i>Yeah, I had some fun.</i>
<i>I read a book.</i>
l can't remember the last time l did that.
And, you know, plus other stuff.
HARRlSON: The point is,
l had a hell of a day.
And l didn't need a boost
from my big sister to do it this time.
l'm not surprised. You've just gotta
believe in yourself a little.
Kind of like you?
Just like me. Good night, Harrison.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
TRU: l knew you didn't need this.
DAVlS: Hey, you were right.
County Records called.
DAVlS: lt's your mom's file.
Whenever you're ready.
Thanks, Davis.
You gonna open them?
Later.
l was kind of hoping to live
in the present for a little bit.
Sorry about the MCATs.
l guess that means you'll be
sticking around here a little bit longer.
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.
lt's funny, l met a girl today.
<i>AII she reaIIy wanted to do</i>
<i>was understand...</i>
why she feels the things she does.
Maybe that's all any of us want.
Just to understand.
And you don't?
Not lately, no.
lt's not easy, is it?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Carrying the burden you do.
Excuse me?
Some would call it a blessing.
Others a curse.
l see it more as a calling.
[Suspenseful instrumental music
continues]
Davis?
l know more than you think l know, Tru...
about what you can do.
DAVlS: About how you help the dead
get another chance at life.
[Suspenseful instrumental music
intensifies]
<i>Have a seat, Tru.</i>
lt's time l told you what l know.
[Rock music]
HARRlSON: Then they called me
this frat guy...
and l was like, ''No, baby. Pay me.''
[Upbeat instrumental music]
Yeah, it's a damn good thing, too.
'Cause l was into my boy, Chaz,
for four bills.
You know, l've been thinking
about getting my nipples pierced.
-That's great, Harrison.
-Earth to sis.
Have you been listening to me?
-What's going on?
-Trust me.
TRU: You don't want to know.
HARRlSON: l do want to know.
<i>I am aII about wanting to know. Tru?</i>
[Tense instrumental music]
Tru, what are you doing?
[Car horn blaring]
What the hell do you think you're doing?
l was just.... Didn't you see that car
coming right at you?
All day with the questions
and the sneaking around.
-Are you stalking me?
-Ma'am, l swear, l was just trying to help.
Help me write down
your name and number.
WOMAN: l'm sure my attorney
will want to talk to you.
TRU: Obviously you'll believe
what you want...
-but l just helped you more than you know.
-l don't need your help.
NlCOLE: <i>I do.</i>
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
l do.
l do.
l do.
[Knocking on door]
Come in.
[Door opens]
What are you....
[Gunshot]
[Theme music]
Help me.
[Gentle instrumental music]
[Tru screams]
God, what are you doing?
We need to talk.
We're not really gonna have
this conversation again, are we?
l think we have to.
You should've seen yourself the other day.
And the way people were looking at you.
l saved someone's life.
l don't really care what people think.
lt's getting out of hand.
And l need a real explanation, okay?
Not this crap about do-over days...
and damsels in distress.
What you're claiming, it's not possible.
lt's not.
And now you're putting yourself
in danger...
and risking your life over people
who don't care...
over something that's not even real.
WAlTRESS: Come on.
Did you see where the guy
who was here went?
-Nope.
-Sorry.
What kind of person skips out
on a bill of $7.32?
<i>It comes out of my pay.</i>
Look, we've been over this before.
And you know what?
l'm done talking about it.
Obviously nothing l say...
is gonna convince you, so l'm just gonna
have to find a way to show you...
once and for all, this is real.
[Car engine roaring]
[Tires screeching]
Come on, don't you people have jobs?
[Screams]
DAVlS: Hi, you're here early.
TRU: Actually, l just came by...
to see if you wanna grab a bite to eat,
or maybe just hang out.
Hang out? As in me and you?
Yeah. lt's just....
Sometimes l feel
like you're the only one who gets me.
Who understands
what's going on in my life. My brother....
DAVlS: He still doesn't buy it?
TRU: No.
He believes boxing's legit
and Tupac's alive...
but he can't seem to wrap his head
around this one. So what do you say?
-Just a half hour?
-Yeah.
[Cell phone rings]
Hello?
What?
Oh, my God. l'll be right there.
lt's my sister.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
BOY: Oh, man. The ball!
KlDS: Get it! Come on!
-Meredith, you all right?
-Yeah, l'll get better.
-My car, not so much.
-Forget about your car. Let me see.
MERE: Are we done?
PARAMEDlC: One minute.
-Relax, Mere. Just tell me what happened.
-l had this appointment...
running late because of
all the construction on the highway.
-Then this guy just pulls out of nowhere.
-ls there anything l can do?
-Do you need me to call someone?
-No, it just....
l missed my appointment.
lt doesn't matter.
PARAMEDlC: Let me see.
TRU: l'm sure your office will understand.
l got to get my stuff out of my car
before they take--
TRU: You just finish getting patched up.
l'll take care of it.
TRU: Appointments. Right.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Thanks.
Odd part of town for you
to have an appointment.
Didn't you used to come down here
to make a different kind of deal?
Yes. Used to.
l really don't appreciate the implication
that this had anything to do with drugs.
Look, sorry, Mere. lt's just....
-Don't be afraid to ask for help.
-l am not afraid to ask for help.
l called you after the accident, didn't l?
[Elevator bell dinging]
[Elevator bell dinging]
DAVlS: ls everything okay with your sister?
TRU: Yeah, maybe.
TRU: Honestly, l don't know anymore.
TRU: My God!
DAVlS: Yeah, l know.
DAVlS: Nicole Simms.
Shot by an unknown assailant.
On her wedding day.
Time of death: between 7:00 and 7:30.
DAVlS: Actually might have made it,
but she bled to death in the chapel.
Ambulance was held up by construction
on the highway.
-Who would do this?
-Don't know.
Maybe it was random, or maybe
somebody didn't want her to get married.
Get started on the standards,
l'll go grab the x-rays. l'll be right back.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Door shuts]
Can l help you?
Sorry, that snow
just came out of nowhere.
Snow? Here, let me get you something
to dry off with.
MAN: No, it's okay. l just....
My....
l think my....
[Sighs]
[Sniffing]
We were supposed to get married today.
MAN: And l think they brought her here.
Yeah.
Could l get a couple of minutes?
Um, l never, uh,
l never got a chance to say goodbye.
[Somber instrumental music]
For what it's worth,
l know what you're going through.
Sorry for your loss.
Thanks.
Um. Can l, um,
Can l see her?
Yeah.
l'll just be right through here.
[Somber instrumental music continues]
MAN: Nicole.
DAVlS: Good news.
l finally got the cheesy chomps
that l ordered, so that....
Why aren't you running standards?
l gotta start the autopsy soon...
and the Sheriff's Department
needs the bullet for their investigation.
The victim's fiancť came in.
He just wanted to say goodbye.
Where's he waiting? l'll talk to him.
Actually, he's in Standards with her.
You know that's against the rules.
Yeah, but can't the rules
be broken a little?
-What's the harm in--
-Tru, until a case is closed...
-the dead are our responsibility.
-Davis, there's also a live person in there.
You take great care of the dead.
What about the living?
Excuse me.
DAVlS: What are you doing?
-All right, l can explain.
-Tru, call security, please.
No, you stay. You stay where you are.
-Oh, my God.
-Listen.
Whatever it is you want,
you don't have to hurt anybody to get it.
-You don't understand.
-Then help me understand.
You're in a lot of pain right now,
but we can deal with it.
Just relax. Davis, don't.
[Tense instrumental music]
Don't.
TRU: No! Davis!
[Davis gasping]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
My God! Talk to me! Davis!
You are not leaving me, you understand?
Get up.
Get up, now!
-You'd better pray he doesn't die.
-l did not want to shoot.
MAN: Look, you have to help me, now!
l will never do anything to help you.
[Fast-paced instrumental music continues]
[Gasping]
That's too bad.
[Fast-paced instrumental music intensifies]
Help me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Tru gasping]
We just saw each other yesterday.
Come on, we need to talk.
Tru.
Are you all right?
l don't know yet.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
l know you don't believe
half the things l tell you...
but let's just say
yesterday was a real bad day.
Yeah. Tell me something l don't know.
Watching your sister dive tackle
a total stranger.
TRU: Not your yesterday. My yesterday.
Look, this is getting out of hand.
And l want a real explanation.
Not this crap about do-over days...
and damsels in distress.
Tru?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
-And what is this?
-Your to-do list.
''Diner, 1 1 :20. Bring $7.32.''
What the hell is this?
lf something were to happen to me,
l need to know that you understood why.
The only way for you to finally accept
what l do, is for you to do it yourself.
-What do l get out of this?
-Be where l tell you, when l tell you...
and by the end of the day,
you'll have your answer.
So l'm guessing this is one of those days.
Since it's not your shift and you're here.
lt's a do-over day.
DAVlS: What have we got?
DAVlS: What?
-lt's good to see you, Davis.
-lt's nice to see you, too.
-l'm just really glad you're here.
-Okay.
You do realize l work here, don't you?
Who's Nicole Simms?
She's getting married today. Or trying to.
Gets shot in the chest and bleeds out...
-before the ambulance can get to her.
-Now you find out who did it?
That's the thing. l think l know this time.
lt's her fiancť.
-How do you know that?
-l saw him. He came here.
-What, to the morgue? What for?
-He was tampering with the body.
He must have been
trying to conceal evidence.
You know,
nab the bullet before the cops could.
So, he was here when she asked for help?
Was l here?
-Of course l was here, l'm always here.
-You were here.
What aren't you telling me?
[Somber instrumental music]
-Davis, l'm sorry, l really got to....
-Right.
Somebody out there needs to be saved.
Something like that.
What do you want me to say?
''Yes'' will work.
l'd be willing to take a ''fine.''
You seriously thought
l would just give you my car?
ln some remote cultures,
siblings are known to help one another.
What if you got in an accident?
My insurance premium would increase.
l'll have it back by tonight,
in one piece, l promise.
Look, l'd love to help you out,
l really would.
But l have an appointment across town
with a client this afternoon.
l need my car.
Didn't you used to come down here
to make a different kind of deal?
This appointment wouldn't be
for something else besides work, right?
Tru, look, no more games today, okay?
l have a staff meeting.
How about this?
You can have the car tomorrow.
Call me and we'll set it up.
Tomorrow's too late.
For both of us.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Car door locking]
[Knocking on door]
Yes, you did.
You said you wanted him at your table.
Hold on a minute. Hi.
Hi. l'm looking for Nicole.
-And if you found her, you would be?
-Tru Davies. Old friends.
GROOM: Ma? l'm gonna call you back.
MOTHER: <i>No, I need--</i>
l have a question about tonight.
Are you here for the wedding, too?
l hope so, l'm in it.
-A groomsman?
-Actually, l'm the groom.
Wait, you're marrying
Nicole Simms tonight?
GROOM: Yeah, that's the plan.
We were supposed to get married today.
TRU: Right, of course.
GROOM: So you're here for the wedding?
l don't remember your name
from the guest list.
Yeah, l'm not on it.
l'm just here from out of town.
l wanted to wish her luck.
Nicole and the troops are all downtown
at some nail shop.
Do you know which one?
lt might be fun to surprise her.
GROOM: lt's on Fifth.
-Hands On.
-Great.
Could you just tell her that l miss her?
This whole tradition of me
not seeing her all day....
Just tell her it's killing me, okay?
[Telephone rings]
GROOM: Yeah. Hello?
-She can't sing.
-l can't stop her.
-She's gonna be my mother-in-law.
-No, she can't sing.
She might get up there
and open her mouth...
but what comes out is gonna be like
something from <i>WiId Kingdom.</i>
CLERK: Another decision.
NlCOLE: God, l'm gonna explode.
Go with sheer. French tips are played out.
Thank you. That may have seemed
like nothing, but l'm grateful.
-Big day?
-Long day. lt's exciting, but exhausting.
-l just can't wait to get my life back.
-Good luck with that.
l've got three words for you.
Thank-you notes.
NlCOLE: l should've eloped.
Maybe someone didn't want her
to get married.
A friend once said
the hardest part about getting married...
is telling the guy she dated in college.
The guy l dated in college beat me to it.
He got married last year.
You mean there's not one boy out there
in a particularly bad mood today?
Justin? Justin Burke?
Stop it. He hasn't thought twice about me.
ANDREA: Only a guy still hooked...
would buy you something
off your Perry and White registry...
when he's not even
invited to the wedding.
Okay. Point taken.
Luckily, after tonight,
l'll only have one guy to worry about.
[Rock music playing on stereo]
HARRlSON: ''The diner, 1 1 :20. Bring $7.32.''
WAlTRESS: Come on.
WAlTRESS: What kind of person skips out
on a bill for $7.32?
<i>It comes out of my pay.</i>
-Did she put you up to this?
-Excuse me?
My sister.
[Chuckles] Tell her she's gonna have to do
better than that, okay?
Nice work, though.
Keep the change.
Hi. l'm hoping you can help me out.
My boss had me purchase a wedding gift,
and l think l blew it.
l gave you guys the wrong return address.
lf something goes wrong, it's my ass.
Would it be too much to ask
for you to check the files?
Yeah, thanks. His name's Justin Burke.
Where the hell are....
MERE: Steve, have you seen my keys?
STEVE: No, l haven't.
Tru, tell me you didn't.
Just call me a cab!
[Car door locking]
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Doorbell rings]
WOMAN: lf it's important, l'm out back!
TRU: Sorry to bother you.
WOMAN: lt's fine.
This stuff gets everywhere.
Can l help you?
l was hoping l could help you.
l'm a new neighbor...
and l actually have the same
house number as you a few blocks over.
Anyway, a couple of days ago,
l got a package with a ''Return to Sender.''
l think it was supposed to come here
to a Justin Burke.
That's my boyfriend. This is his place.
l just try to make it livable.
TRU: ls he around or....
ALYSSA: He's still at work...
but he usually comes home for lunch.
Actually, he should be home any minute.
Do you mind me asking you
where the package is from?
-l think it was Perry and White.
-That figures.
His ex-girlfriend's getting married.
ls that weird, or....
lt's like you'd expect.
Since he heard about the wedding,
he's been a little bit off.
l'm sure it's nothing.
[Car approaching]
Speaking of.... Right on schedule.
<i>Now you can teII him yourseIf.</i>
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Actually, you know what? l'm late.
l really got to.... Thanks for your help.
[Suspenseful instrumental music
continues]
JUSTlN: What was that about?
ALYSSA: A delivery or something.
-Everything okay?
-Yeah. l just....
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Do me a favor. When you're done here,
come inside for a minute.
JUSTlN: l want to talk about something.
ALYSSA: Sure.
So l took off.
l didn't know what else to do.
He lied. He's not the fiancť.
He's a bitter ex. Not to mention a cop.
At least you found the bride.
All you have to do is convince her
to call off the wedding.
That isn't the issue. Stopping the guy is.
l don't know if l can do that.
-You've done it before.
-l've failed before. l can't fail this time.
Tru, what is going on?
What happened yesterday?
l told you.
No, you're working harder
at avoiding my questions...
-than saving this girl.
-What do you want me to say, Davis?
The truth!
[Tense instrumental music]
This guy...
l told you he came here
to cover his tracks.
By trying to extract the bullet.
But what l didn't tell you is...
we walked in on him...
and he pulled a gun.
ln here?
Oh, my God, what happened?
He shot at me.
But the day rewound before l could....
Look, l'll be fine.
-But you need to get out of here.
-A guy came in here...
and shot at you
and you want me to leave?
What are you not telling me?
He shot you, Davis.
He shot me?
[Somber instrumental music]
Did l die?
l don't know.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
So you're telling me that in a couple
of hours from now, l could be dead.
Davis, we don't have time for this.
The longer you stay here...
the better the chance it'll happen again.
l want you to go to my apartment.
Look, if l can't change what happens,
at least l can rearrange the players.
TRU: Just take these, please, and go there.
DAVlS: But what about you?
l have to warn the bride. You know that.
l also know she's the reason
a guy came in here with a gun.
l'll be fine, okay?
l'll meet you back at my place, l promise.
Tru. Thank you.
For what?
For telling me the truth.
Those are Gerber daisies.
l didn't order Gerber daisies.
Are you telling me
it's too late to change them?
She's in the hall and can't decide
between <i>Some Enchanted Evening...</i>
or <i>Time of My Life.</i> She wants to sing you
the first verse of each.
That's just perfect.
-How could this day get any worse?
-Nicole, hi.
-Do you have a minute?
-No, not really.
NlCOLE: Aren't you the girl from--
TRU: The nail place, yeah.
l wasn't completely honest.
Look, l know your ex, Justin.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Okay.
l know how he still feels about you,
and what he's willing to do...
-to keep this wedding from happening.
-What is she talking about?
l have no idea.
Look, you say you know Justin?
So do l.
And l know he would never do anything...
to hurt me like that. And l also know
l'm not gonna let some stranger...
come in here and screw up my day.
[Woman singing off-key]
l have family for that.
Can you find your own way out
or do you need a hand?
l got it.
lf you want her to make it to the ''l do's''...
you'd better keep Justin away from her.
[Funky instrumental music]
HARRlSON: Someone's gonna need
my help. Yeah.
Hi. You probably
need some help, don't you?
-No.
-Come on. Give me your arm...
-and let's get this over with.
-Don't touch me!
What about this, lady?
BOY: Oh, man.
<i>The baII!</i>
KlDS: Come on!
[Soft instrumental music]
Hey.
You need this?
BOY: Thanks.
You're welcome.
Where have you been?
l've been waiting for hours...
-and this guy--
-Davis, l'm fine. Look at me, one piece.
-How about you?
-l'm okay.
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: When you say you're okay....
DAVlS: l'm lying.
So you really don't know
what happened after he shot me, if l....
No. That's just it. lt hasn't happened yet.
So we're gonna make sure
it doesn't happen again.
l've warned the necessary parties,
now all l have to do...
is get to Justin
before he gets to the chapel.
-Any idea how?
-That's the thing.
He's a cop. Not to mention armed.
So, short of knocking him out
and stashing him in a locked closet...
-l'm running low on ideas.
-l may have one.
Scientific knowledge
always bests physical strength.
How do you think
l got through high school?
-This helps me how?
-Knock him out, yes.
But pharmaceutically.
You want him incapacitated...
-two words: zinc sulfate.
-Zinc sulfate.
That's just gonna make him puke.
For hours. Good idea.
Not that l'm crazy about you
being alone with him in a room...
-but it will buy you some time. lf he's--
-Busy, he can't shoot Nicole or you.
Where do l find some?
l have a friend at County
who may not mind--
Give me a name and a number.
l'll go get the pills.
And listen.
This isn't just about me and Nicole.
-He shot three people yesterday, so Tru--
-Don't worry. l will.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
l hear you're the man to see.
Well, that depends.
Gonna make it worth my while?
What are you.... Are you ripping me off?
MERE: l'm talking to you!
[Mere grunts]
Stupid girl. You want something from me?
l want what l paid for.
You'll get it when you get it.
[Suspenseful instrumental music
intensifies]
Dispatch called.
Said Nicole was looking for you.
She wants to meet you here
before the wedding.
-Nicole?
-Something you want to tell me?
Justin.
Nicole's just running late,
so she sent me to give you a heads up.
-Who are you?
-Just a bridesmaid fulfilling her duty.
You look familiar.
l am one of Nicole's friends,
and you did date Nicole.
The chances are our paths have crossed.
Yeah. Right. Probably, l guess.
[Pop music playing on stereo]
[Gunshot]
l'm still a little thrown by her call.
Do you know why she wanted to see me?
Honestly, l think she's a little worried
that you're still bent...
about the whole breakup,
and that you might do something about it.
-Tonight.
-Are you serious?
The only thing l'd do is say thanks.
To hear she was marrying...
turned out to be a serious wake-up call.
-What do you mean?
-lf she's willing to stop playing games...
and commit, she must really love this guy.
l just hope l'll feel that strong someday.
TRU: lt's getting warm. Do you mind?
JUSTlN: Sure.
You're not wearing your gun.
But you're a cop, right?
l'm a cop, off duty.
l only carry it when l'm on the job.
You say you never carry your gun
when you're not working?
JUSTlN: No. Some guys do, but not me.
<i>When I'm off duty, I'm off duty.</i>
-lt wasn't you.
-What?
You know what? l've got to go. God.
JUSTlN: That's okay.
TRU: l'm sorry.
No, it's okay.
Are you sure that Nicole's gonna come?
TRU: Yeah. And l'm sure
she would want you to wait right here.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
When l left Justin, it was 6:40.
<i>He was Iooking forward to seeing NicoIe,</i>
<i>and he didn't have his gun.</i>
He couldn't have been the one
that shot her--
Someone else must've pulled the trigger.
l don't know who.
Then why does he go to the morgue
to cover it up?
TRU: l don't know. But there won't be
anything to cover up if l can find Nicole--
-Tru?
-My God, Nicole!
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Somebody help!
ANDREA: God!
TRU: What happened?
l don't know. l just found her like this.
What are you doing here?
Look, l'm here to help.
Alive. Barely.
-Call <i>9</i>1 1 .
-Did you see anyone come in here?
No, it's early.
Most of the guests aren't even here yet.
-My God! Nicole!
-The ambulance will be here any minute.
DAVlS: The ambulance was held up
by construction.
She bled to death in the chapel.
The ambulance isn't gonna
make it in time. We need to--
No! You're not touching her!
Nobody moves her!
What about the police?
Hasn't anybody called the police?
-Give me a phone.
-Listen to me!
There's construction on the highway.
The EMTs will never make it.
lf we don't get her to a doctor,
neither will Nicole.
[Tense instrumental music]
Please, we can't afford to wait.
Help me get her to a car.
But the cars are all blocked
by the catering trucks.
-Not mine.
-What about her parents?
lf the family has a problem,
they can find me at the County Hospital.
l'll be saving their daughter.
[Tires screeching]
Hold on! You're gonna make it.
Come on. Nicole?
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Come on!
[Dialing cell phone]
DAVlS: <i>HeIIo?</i>
TRU: <i>I couIdn't stop it.</i>
Someone shot Nicole, and she looks bad.
-Don't know if she'll make it.
-How close are you to the hospital?
Not close enough! Wait, who's on duty
at the morgue right now?
-l don't think that's--
-Someone has to know what to do.
l'm only two blocks away.
lt might be her only chance.
-Okay, l'll meet you there.
-No!
l spent the whole day keeping you safe.
You won't go back...
-to where you got shot!
-That was yesterday.
TRU: Today is yesterday! Davis!
DAVlS: <i>Bye, Tru.</i>
Davis! Damn it!
Help! Gardez! Anyone?
-l told you not to come here!
-You say how much you appreciate...
having someone help you.
Let me help you.
[Tense instrumental music]
lf not, let me at least help her.
-l locked all the doors.
-We've got to do this quick...
-and get out of here.
-What's this?
-Dried blood.
-l don't think so.
DAVlS: l can't tell what, though.
TRU: Lily pollen.
-What, from her bouquet?
-No. Those were Gerber daisies.
Then how did it get on her dress?
This stuff gets everywhere.
Can l help you?
Justin left his gun at home.
The only other person...
who would have had access to it
is his girlfriend.
l had the right motive,
just the wrong person.
ALYSSA: l find it so interesting...
that you broke up with me
on the day Nicole gets married.
This is about you and me.
lt doesn't have anything to do with her.
ALYSSA: Well, not anymore.
[Ominous instrumental music]
What are you doing with that?
l shot her.
Nicole?
Amazing how she's always
the first woman on your mind.
-Why would you do that?
-lt was so easy for you...
just to end things.
JUSTlN: Aly, you didn't have to--
ALYSSA: Kill her?
-l didn't, Justin. You did.
-Oh, my God.
ALYSSA: She's at the morgue by now.
But l didn't do it.
<i>It's my word against yours.</i>
lt's your gun. Your bullet. Your motive.
The evidence is all there.
Somebody just has to find it.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
DAVlS: How we doing?
TRU: With us.
DAVlS: Okay. l think we're ready.
TRU: Okay.
TRU: l'll assist you.
DAVlS: l'm not doing this. You are.
-What? You're the doctor.
-l know. l can't work on live people.
-They freak me out.
-Are you kidding?
Why do you think l work here?
Nobody chooses this job.
lt's gonna be fine. l know what to do.
l just can't do it without dry heaving.
DAVlS: You can do this, l know you can.
l'll be right here.
-Actually, l'll be right here.
-Okay, what's first?
You need to isolate the entry wound.
Do you think you can do that?
l think so.
[Tense instrumental music]
DAVlS: Careful. Given the subatmospheric
pressure in the cavity...
debris might have caused infection.
How's the internal bleeding?
-Pretty bad.
-Okay, you need to seal off any gushers...
and decrease the level of blood loss.
Not that one.
DAVlS: The one next to
the hydrogen needle.
Okay, that worked. Now what?
[Glass shattering]
l want you to get out of here right now.
lf l leave, Nicole dies.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
Who are you? l thought you said
you were a friend of Nicole's?
l lied.
Look, l came to say goodbye.
You came here for the bullet.
-ls she still alive?
-Look, we both know...
TRU: that you didn't shoot her.
JUSTlN: Yeah, but can you prove it?
Because the bullet came from my gun!
Everybody knows l still love Nicole...
and there were no witnesses.
Now, l need the evidence.
JUSTlN: And the evidence is inside of her.
TRU: Davis, don't!
lf you move, he'll shoot you.
Justin, there is a witness.
And she's lying here on this table.
<i>She's the onIy one who can testify</i>
<i>that AIyssa shot her, not you.</i>
Look, we can save her, and you.
But you've got to give us the time.
<i>Right now, you've got a choice.</i>
Your life goes one of two ways.
Which is it gonna be?
All right, where do l go from here?
[Somber instrumental music]
You might have to bag her.
How's her breathing?
TRU: lt sounds okay.
DAVlS: Good.
DAVlS: Looks like her lungs didn't collapse.
That's a good sign.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
TRU: How was your day?
HARRlSON: Well, l'll be honest. Nice effort.
You know, the waitress
and the little kid with the ball. Very clever.
But l'm sorry. Game over.
'Cause it ain't gonna snow out of nowhere.
Let me see your watch.
-Yeah, that's two minutes fast.
-So?
Look outside.
Unbelievable.
l have...
First l thought you were messing with me
with the card....
But there's no getting around this.
l don't understand. l can't comprehend...
but l do believe you now.
That's all l wanted.
You have no idea what this means to me.
-Thank you.
-No.
Thank you.
Do you know what this does for me?
You're omniscient.
You're like the ultimate bodyguard.
-That's not--
-lt's like a free pass.
-lf anybody steps to me, you can--
-No, that's not what this is.
Hold on a sec.
[Cell phone rings]
Hello? Chaz! What's up?
Yeah, l got your money. l'll be honest.
l don't think l'm gonna make it tonight.
No. Look, l'll call you.
-You owe him money?
-Yeah. But what's the rush?
-l'll get it to him.
-Harrison, you can't just do that.
lf you don't pay him....
l won't always be there to help you.
But of course you will, Tru.
You're my sister.
[Door opens]
Justin turned himself in,
and they arrested his girlfriend...
-based on what he told the cops.
-And Nicole?
l sent her to County. She's stable.
Her parents just called
and they wanted to thank the doctor.
That's nice.
They meant you.
She wouldn't have made it without you.
And neither would l.
[Soft instrumental music]
DAVlS: lt's kind of funny...
this is the second time
that someone's saved my life.
Really, what happened?
[Davis clears throat]
[Cell phone rings]
Sorry. Hello?
MERE: Hey, Tru. lt's me.
TRU: <i>Meredith, are you aII right?</i>
Tru.
[Mere sobbing]
Tru.
Help me.
Hold tight, sweetie, l'll be right there.
TRU: lt's my sister.
DAVlS: lt's okay. Go ahead.
lt's been a long day, or two.
We'll discuss it another time.
Okay.
[Rock music]
[Upbeat rock music]
Hey, Tru.
Ronny.
Prom is coming up.
-ls it?
-Yeah, and you know l wanted to....
Ronny, anything you want to tell me...
or ask me, you go right ahead.
Candace, not now. l'll call you later, okay?
l'm really sorry, Tru, but this can't wait.
What he's trying to say is that
he wants to go to the prom with me.
What?
Candace, how could you do this to me?
We're best friends.
Tru, high school's nearly over,
and everyone knows...
that high school friendships don't last.
So why would l let a friendship...
that's probably going to end anyway,
get in the way of something l want?
Try not to take it so hard. Things change.
<i>See you.</i>
[Somber instrumental music]
[Soft, rhythmic instrumental music]
Thank God.
Did you nod off?
What's this?
''High school reunion.'' You going to this?
Go back to high school? Absolutely...
not.
[Theme music]
Help me.
LlNDSAY: l can't believe you.
How many times will you say
you're not coming to the reunion tonight?
LlNDSAY: lt'll be fun.
TRU: Lindsay.
Okay, for the last time, you are coming,
even if l have to drag you there myself.
You can try, but l'm warning you.
My girl's stubborn.
Come on. l'm going.
-Harrison, you weren't even in our class.
-l was two years behind.
And Lindsay's taking me as her date.
Good. Go. Have fun, and you can tell me
all about it tomorrow.
ls she okay?
Guess l'll go find out.
So, just out of curiosity,
did you have friends in our class?
Well, not five years ago.
But now l have you.
Did l miss something back there?
l just don't want to go
to my high school reunion is all.
-That bad?
-Parts of it.
Parts of it were great.
l'm just not so keen on reliving it.
Look, l didn't know you back then.
l'm not even sure l know you now.
But you got a lot to be proud of, Tru.
Good friends.
A cool, if slightly morbid, new job.
LUC: Med school's not that far away.
TRU: No, l know, it's just--
LUC: Plus...
you got a cool new boyfriend
you can take to the reunion and show off.
-Really?
-Yeah.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
l'm so glad you decided to come.
Okay, what do you think?
Too much cleavage?
Shame on you. No such thing.
You know what you should wear?
Those pinstriped pants you got downtown.
Definitely.
You know what? Meredith borrowed them
two months ago...
and left them at the dry cleaners.
All she left me was this ticket.
-How is Meredith, anyway?
-Good. Rehab is going well.
-She'll be home in a few weeks.
-Good.
Don't worry.
l'll pick something out for you.
Here, start with these. We'll build around.
Hey, do you remember Craig Burg?
-Soccer goalie, total hottie. Sure.
-l had the hugest crush on him.
Yeah. You left him that note.
Yeah. l told him everything
about how l felt...
put it in his locker, waited for him
to do something.
-And what did he do?
-Nothing.
He just never even responded.
God, l think about that all the time.
You think he'll be there tonight?
-One way to find out.
-Yes.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
My God, back in high school.
Just for a few hours. Just breathe.
Stay strong.
Come on, let's check out some snacks.
Okay, l'll find you later.
Just remember, breathe.
[Rock music playing on stereo]
CANDACE: Billy?
Hi.
That's a nice tie. l didn't know
people were still wearing those...
in this century.
-Who's that?
-Candace Aimes.
-You know her?
-We used to be best friends.
-Tru Davies. lt's me.
-Billy.
Billy Lambert. My God, you look great.
l almost didn't recognize you.
Not that you didn't look great
back in high school.
Who are you kidding?
l was a pizza-faced beanpole.
-But that was then, right?
-What's been going on with you, Billy?
l've developed this software
that's gonna revolutionize downloading.
lt'll make the MP3 player obsolete.
That's great. l'll see you inside, okay? Bye.
[Lively dance music playing on stereo]
So how you holding up so far?
Glad you came?
My God, it's you!
Judy Rogers.
Judy, of course. How can l forget?
This is my boyfriend.
Can you believe it? Everyone here
in one room. lt's like we never left.
Don't you love reunion directories?
You can keep tabs on everyone.
Of course, they don't tell the whole story.
Like Larry Cutler,
addicted to prescription painkillers.
TRU: Judy, this is--
JUD Y: And Kenny Lewis is gay.
<i>Heard about Steve Sabitzsky?</i>
He went into his father's carpet business
and fired his own dad.
TRU: Judy was--
JUD Y: And Gillian Kaye? You noticed?
Less nose, more boobs.
All bought and paid for.
Judy was the captain of the swim team.
JUD Y: He's adorable.
Well, honey, you traded up.
That Ronny Clifton,
you heard about him and Candace?
She thinks she's everything
'cause she was Prom Queen.
l had the swim team.
Candace couldn't swim.
l see someone l have to talk to.
But this has been great.
JUD Y: Right.
LUC: Nice to meet you.
[Upbeat dance music playing on stereo]
Craig.
Hey, Glenn Carpenter.
Can l talk to you for a sec?
Later. Yeah, sure.
Craig Burg.
Hey.
This is gonna sound a little strange,
but toward the end of senior year...
l left a note in your locker...
and l wrote down how l felt about you...
in detail, embarrassing detail, actually.
And l never got an answer
and l was just wondering, you know?
l never got any note.
l'm sorry, what was your name again?
Excuse me for a second.
CRAlG: Hey, what's up, dude?
MAN: Hey, big guy.
[Sad instrumental music]
Voting for tonight's Reunion Queen.
Want to cast your vote?
Yeah. One for Lindsay.
TRU: Thanks.
So what exactly was the deal
with you and this Ronny guy?
High school crush gone awry.
But you can ask him yourself.
There he is.
l tell you what. l think
l'm going to go get you a refill instead.
[Upbeat dance music
continues playing on stereo]
Tru.
Hi, Ronny. God, it's been a while.
Last time l saw you,
it was right around prom time.
l know it's about five years too late,
but l owe you an apology.
RONNY: l never meant to hurt you, Tru.
Candace just got what she wanted.
You know, she always did.
-Always will.
-You don't sound too happy about it.
Me? No, l'm good. l'm real good.
Life couldn't be any better right now.
Hmm.
Well, it was real nice seeing you, Ronny.
RONNY: See you, Tru.
What's the matter?
You looking for someone?
No, nobody.
Well, let's go dance or something.
No, thanks.
l'm not really for the dancing thing.
Okay. Well, do you want to go
get a drink then?
Hello? Earth to Harrison.
LlNDSAY: What do you want to do?
HARRlSON: l'll be right back.
[Lively dance music playing on stereo]
[Exclaims]
LUC: Who's that?
Mr. Connor.
He is the best teacher l ever had.
He was the first one
who really got through to me.
Made me think for myself.
He changed my life.
LUC: So go say hi to him.
TRU: lt's not that easy.
Look who he's with. Candace.
LUC: Time to let bygones be bygones, Tru.
Mr. Connor, hi.
Tru Davies.
l was hoping you'd be here tonight.
<i>I'm so gIad you came.</i>
-Tru.
-Candace.
You look great.
l could never get away with an outfit
like that. You are so brave.
-Thanks.
-ls this your boyfriend?
We'll give you a chance
to catch up with Mr. Connor.
Couldn't deny you that.
Come on, l'll buy you a drink.
LUC: l think they're free.
Mr. Connor, how are things?
How's the writing?
l remember how you were always
gonna write the great American novel.
CONNOR: Actually, Tru, the writing
is going surprisingly well.
l am working on something
that l feel so good about.
Great. That's great.
Still thinking about Candace.
l guess some things haven't changed
that much in the last five years.
How's it going, man? Grab one of these?
BARTENDER: Sure.
KElTH: Thank you.
HARRlSON: Keith.
KElTH: Hey.
-Keith Morgan!
-Hey, what's up, man?
-You don't remember me, do you?
-l'm sorry. l can't say that l do.
Well, l'll tell you what.
How about l remind you?
All right.
<i>HeIIo, can I have your attention, pIease?</i>
<i>We've counted aII the baIIots,</i>
<i>and it is now time to announce...</i>
<i>our CIass of '99 Five Year Reunion Queen.</i>
<i>Tonight our Queen is Candace Aimes.</i>
[Crowd cheering]
Do you know that
Craig never even got my note?
He doesn't even remember me.
Ouch!
So much for high school memories.
Can you believe this?
l can't. lt's like a nightmare.
The recurring kind.
CANDACE: Wow!
CANDACE: <i>Thank you so much.</i>
<i>This is such a surprise.</i>
<i>Okay, not that much of a surprise.</i>
<i>Anyway, it's so good seeing you aII here.</i>
<i>Some of whom I actuaIIy even remember.</i>
CANDACE: <i>This has been--</i>
KElTH: l told you l don't know who you are!
-Harrison? Jeez! Are you okay?
-Okay? l'm great.
l've waited years
to punch this son of a bitch.
Now l remember. You're that guy
whose ass l used to kick.
ls this what you came here for tonight?
Settle some stupid high school grudge?
Yeah.
l mean, no.
l came for you.
You're unbelievable, Harrison.
LUC: He'll be fine. But are you all right?
Yeah. Great.
Convincing.
But it kind of looks to me
like you got Candace on the brain.
Hey, if you two really were best friends,
now's a good time to go talk to her.
LUC: Put things to rest.
-Did you see where Candace went?
-l saw her heading to the pool.
TRU: Thanks.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Candace, are you in here?
<i>Oh, no.</i>
-My God! Candace?
-Save me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Did you nod off?
What's this?
''High school reunion.'' Cool.
You going to this?
Yes, l am.
Again.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Again? You're going
to your high school reunion again?
DAVlS: So does this mean--
TRU: My day is repeating itself.
-Who's the lucky victim today?
-Candace Aimes, high school classmate.
-A friend of yours?
-lt's complicated.
Let's just say l doubt
she'll really appreciate any of my help.
But she drowned at the reunion yesterday.
Drowned.
Was there fluid in her lungs?
TRU: l don't know.
The day rewound before l had a chance
to examine anything.
-So really l've got nothing to go on.
-What about foam?
Drowning victims are often identified
by a physical reaction known as foam film.
When the body goes into rapid shock,
then responds...
with the formation of mucus
around the throat and windpipe?
No. Totally clean.
lt sounds like you have a murder to solve.
You think someone murdered Candace
outside the pool...
then dumped her in it
to make it look like a drowning?
lt's a theory.
Okay, l got to run. But stay close.
l may need you tonight.
l'm so excited.
l knew you'd come to the reunion.
Wouldn't miss it. l was thinking,
let's just you and me go together.
You didn't want to go, did you?
And miss another round of high school?
l'll survive.
Well, l'm going.
-You weren't in our class, Harry.
-l've promised him.
Yeah, but you'd have so much more fun
without him. Trust me.
You understand, don't you? We'll catch
a movie or something tomorrow night.
No. But l was so looking forward to this.
Hey, count your blessings, Harrison.
High school sucked.
Hey, can l talk to you a sec?
What are you doing?
This is my big date with Lindsay.
Liar. You just want to go
so you can pick a fight with Keith Morgan.
HARRlSON: What are you talking about?
There is....
We already went to the reunion,
didn't we?
Consider it a heads up.
You know how annoying it is
to have a sibling with your powers?
You're welcome.
[Serious instrumental music]
-Tru.
-Hey.
What a surprise. What are you....
How did you know where l live?
You were listed in the Reunion Directory.
Which hasn't come out yet,
but l'm on the committee...
and l helped put it together. Nice building.
lt'll do. For now.
l don't mean to be blunt,
but what brings you here?
Candace, you remember
when we used to be friends?
-One reunion and everyone gets weepy.
-Come on.
We used to ditch classes together
and talk on the phone all the time.
-We were kind of tight.
-l know.
But l'm through with the past.
Because as good as things are for me now,
they're about to get a whole lot better.
-Really? How so?
-l wrote a novel.
lt's called <i>High SchooI ConfidentiaI.</i>
lt's all about life in high school.
No one's seen it yet, but when they do...
it's going to be
this generation's <i>Less Than Zero.</i>
Wow, that's great. l'm so happy for you.
So please don't take this the wrong way...
but you can't go
to the reunion tonight, Candace.
l see.
You still have that jealousy problem.
ls that why you came here?
To keep me away
so l can't outshine you again?
No. lt's just,
reunions can get kind of crazy...
and who knows
what could happen tonight?
l know exactly what will happen.
You'll show up with Linda, or Lindy--
Lindsay.
And you'll be wearing something
she picked out for you.
l'm thinking two-year-old black skirt,
faux vintage top.
Thanks for stopping by, Tru.
lt's really nice catching up with you.
[Serious instrumental music continues]
But l wouldn't miss that reunion tonight
for the world.
LlNDSAY: What's the matter? You seem
so tense. Got the pre-reunion jitters?
l just keep thinking about Candace Aimes.
Can you think of anyone who would
still be holding a grudge against her?
Strange question. Let me think.
-l know. The entire graduating class?
-Not high school. l mean now, today.
Who would still have issues with her?
Ronny Clifton might still be upset with her
after what she did to him.
TRU: Why, what did she do to him?
LlNDSAY: You never heard?
After Candace stole Ronny from you,
they got engaged...
and then she left him at the altar,
broke his heart.
-Really?
-Yeah.
l guess no one told you because,
well, you know....
[Knocking at door]
Finally. My pants.
-Hi. l have a delivery for--
-Billy!
Tru!
This is....
l haven't seen you for what?
Like five years.
-Yeah.
-ls this for you?
-Under my sister's name, yeah.
-$<i>8</i>.
-Are you going to the thing tonight?
-Wouldn't miss it.
You know my favorite part
about these reunions...
is listening to everyone
out-BS-ing each other...
and trying to make themselves sound
big and important.
Right.
l'll see you tonight, Tru.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Upbeat instrumental music]
CANDACE: Billy, hi.
That's a nice tie. l didn't know
people were still wearing those...
in this century.
BlLLY: She'll always think l'm a geek.
You know, l shouldn't be telling you this...
but l've developed this software
that's going to revolutionize downloading.
lt'll make MP3 players obsolete.
Tru!
TRU: Hey Billy.
[Lively dance music playing on stereo]
JUD Y: Tru! My God, it's you!
TRU: Hello, Judy!
Can you believe it? Everyone here
in one room. lt's like we never left.
-Have you seen Larry Cutler yet?
-Addicted-to-painkillers Larry? Yeah.
-And Kenny Lewis--
-Gay.
-And did you hear about Steve Sabitzsky?
-Fired his dad.
JUD Y: How about--
Gillian Kaye, with all that plastic surgery?
And did you know Candace Aimes
could never even swim?
lt's been so great
catching up with you, Judy.
Ronny, hi.
-Tru. Hey. You look great.
-Thanks.
-lt's weird, all of us being back here.
-Yeah, no kidding.
You okay seeing Candace again?
lt didn't work out. Let's leave it at that.
She really hurt you.
No one can blame you
if you wanted her to hurt, too.
Slow down, okay? l mean,
what happened with Candace and me...
yeah, it hurt. But it's history.
Water under the bridge.
She really broke your heart.
People say l broke your heart.
lt doesn't make you want to hurt me,
does it?
[Lively dance music
continues playing on stereo]
Craig. Hey, it's Tru Davies.
Listen, my best friend, Lindsay,
is a really good person.
CRAlG: Awesome.
TRU: l know you don't remember her...
but in high school she put a note
in your locker and you never got it.
l don't know why. But just do me a favor.
lf she brings it up tonight,
just be nice to her.
Could you do that for me?
CRAlG: l guess l can.
Hey, Tru, you got a minute?
l want you to know something.
l'm not some total loser
who works at a dry cleaners'.
-Look, l didn't say anything.
-l know.
You see,
l would have done everything that l said.
See, l had all this venture capital lined up.
lt was cool until the guy pulled the plug
at the last minute.
And then, no more capital to venture with.
l'm sorry. Whoever the guy was,
l'm sure he made a huge mistake.
You know who the guy was?
Candace's dad.
-Really?
-Yeah. Nice, huh?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Beer, please.
You made it. l didn't think you'd show.
lt's not like we got anything else going on.
Yeah. Thanks to my sister.
You really wanted to go to that reunion,
didn't you?
You want to know why?
-Lindsay.
-No.
[Upbeat rock music playing on stereo]
Keith Morgan.
See, this guy used to torture me.
lt started out with little swirlies
after gym class.
And then it was beatings
on a semi-regular basis.
And now he's back in town.
-You wanted to go tonight so you can get--
-Two words: re-venge.
They asked me to transfer
to another school...
-but l figured that l could do more work--
-Do you mind if l cut in?
CONNOR: Tru Davies. What a treat.
Hi, Tru. Great seeing you.
Did you come here stag tonight?
No boyfriend?
lt's a nice outfit.
Somehow not what l expected.
-Do you mind if l talk to you for a second?
-About what?
Why you didn't want me coming?
Tru tried to convince me
that l shouldn't show...
but l told her, high school's over.
She can relax.
Look, there's Larry Whitesman.
l have to tell him how good he looks
with the extra weight.
-Don't let Candace get to you, Tru.
-She doesn't.
How come
you can't take your eyes off of her?
CONNOR: How about a dance
for an old teacher?
[Upbeat dance music playing on stereo]
CONNOR: Look, maybe it's Candace,
or maybe it's just being back here...
but l can tell there's something
on your mind...
and l just want to say that
even though you've graduated...
my office door is still always open to you.
l appreciate it, Mr. Connor.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
CONNOR: Tru, is there something wrong?
TRU: Not if l can help it.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music]
Candace, are you in here?
Candace, watch out!
[Tense instrumental music continues]
-Dude, this was priceless.
-l've been waiting five years for this.
Come on, get right in there.
-Tru, what are you doing?
-She can't swim.
[Candace coughing]
-You could've killed her.
-lt was just a prank, okay?
Yeah, we thought you hated Candace
more than anyone.
You okay?
l think you swallowed some water,
but you'll be all right.
-Hey! What the hell is going on here?
-Nothing, Curtis. l mean, Mr. Connor.
RONNY: Yeah, we're just having some fun.
CONNOR: Very mature, guys.
Laugh it up, both of you.
They told me to meet them here.
See how funny
you think assault charges are.
You're both witnesses.
Candace, are you okay?
Back off, Tru.
lt's not like you saved my life or anything.
[Somber instrumental music]
All right, guys, back inside. Let's go!
CONNOR: There's some dryers in the locker
room. You might want to use them.
[Tense instrumental music]
lt's too early.
DAVlS: Morgue.
TRU: <i>Davis, it's me.</i>
Hey, Tru. How's the reunion?
Everyone still alive?
The good news is, l saved Candace
after she got shoved in the pool.
DAVlS: What's the bad news?
TRU: <i>It was just a prank.</i>
Which means her life is still in danger
and the murder's still on track.
Well, maybe the pool prank
killed Candace on day one.
That's impossible. The times don't match.
Candace wasn't in the gym until <i>9</i>:30
and l found her at 10:00.
DAVlS: <i>Something must have changed.</i>
What did you do differently tonight
than last night?
Luc! Candace was
talking to him yesterday...
and so she couldn't get to the pool.
But he didn't come with me tonight.
<i>That's it. So your invoIvement in events</i>
<i>can change them.</i>
Last night you saved Candace
from humiliation.
<i>Tonight you have to stop her murder.</i>
Unfortunately, you're back to square one
on suspects.
TRU: <i>Looks Iike it.</i>
Stay in touch, okay?
l might need you. This isn't over.
God, and l was just a little runt back then.
And this dude put me through a living hell.
For years!
And l have been waiting
since the 10th grade to return the favor.
Tonight was going to be the night, man.
But no!
My sis has got to convince Lindsay
to leave me at home.
Look, l'm sure she had a good reason.
Yeah, when you can do what Tru does,
you always have a good reason, right?
What do you mean?
What can your sister do?
Well, you know....
She's always looking after little brother.
[Upbeat rock music playing on stereo]
lt's too bad we can't just
crash the reunion. That'd solve everything.
BOTH: Let's crash.
[Upbeat dance music playing on stereo]
Craig.
Hey, Glenn Carpenter.
Can l talk to you for a sec?
Later. Yeah, sure.
Craig Burg.
Hi, Lindsay.
You remembered.
This may sound a little strange,
but toward the end of senior year...
-l left you a note in your locker, and--
-l never got it.
But let me tell you something.
lf l had gotten a note from you....
lf a girl as beautiful and charming as you
had given me one...
-l'd be touched.
-You would?
Without a doubt. And l would have done
something about it, too.
Who knows where it could've led?
But as it is, l'm married.
-Congratulations, Craig. That's great.
-Yeah, l think so.
But l'm glad you said something tonight.
lt's good to reconnect.
lt was so good to see you, Craig.
JUD Y: There you are. l've been looking
for you! l've told everyone.
-Told everyone what?
-Votes for Reunion Queen.
Pass.
About you, Tru. Saving Candace.
They all agree you're a big hero.
<i>But I wish we had BiIIy's pictures.</i>
<i>I was taIking to--</i>
l've got something really important to do,
and l'm sorry, but l can't be distracted.
-Tru!
-All right!
HARRlSON: ls this a bad time?
l know how eager you were
to have us here tonight.
Great.
Hey! What are you doing here?
l didn't think you were coming.
Hey! What are you doing here?
l didn't think you were coming.
l wasn't, but then l remembered.
l got some business to take care of.
Sorry about the surprise.
lt seemed like a good idea
about half an hour ago.
-No, it's fine.
-You sure?
-lt's just been kind of a crazy night.
-Crazy good, or crazy bad?
TRU: That's the thing. l don't know yet.
LUC: Okay.
<i>Why don't you find me</i>
<i>when you figure it out?</i>
l'll be at the bar. Brown jacket.
You know,
l have my own opinion about Candace.
TRU: l told you. Now is not the best--
JUD Y: You could've let her drown.
TRU: What? You're kidding, right?
JUD Y: You know, it isn't fair.
Everyone always says Candace has things.
She has boyfriends, and she has money...
and looks and popularity.
But Candace doesn't have those things.
-She took them.
-What's that?
She took them from people like me.
l could've been Prom Queen,
but Candace took it.
Now, you ask me,
she deserves everything she gets.
Let's get some air.
Come on, let's get you out of here.
JUD Y: Why?
GLENN: [On mike] <i>HeIIo.</i>
<i>Can I have your attention, pIease?</i>
<i>We finaIIy have aII the baIIots in</i>
<i>and it's now time to announce...</i>
<i>tonight's CIass of '99</i>
<i>Five Year Reunion Queen.</i>
<i>And tonight our Queen is Tru Davies.</i>
[Crowd cheering]
TRU: No. You don't understand.
GLENN: Don't be shy!
<i>I think we'd aII Iike to hear a few words.</i>
[Cheers]
[Tense instrumental music]
Excuse me, l've got to go.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
Excuse me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: Mr. Connor!
Tru. You caught me grading papers.
CONNOR: Why aren't you inside?
TRU: l need your help.
-What's the trouble?
-l don't have time to explain.
l need you to listen. Candace is in danger.
l think Judy's going to hurt her.
l know a lot of old feelings
can get stirred up at these reunions.
-But violence? l don't think so.
-Normally, l wouldn't either.
But you're going to have to believe me.
CONNOR: l believe that you believe it.
-How can l help?
-Have you seen Candace or Judy?
-l haven't, but--
-l need you to do me a favor.
Let's split up. l'll take this wing,
you go that way...
and just keep an eye out
for either of them.
-Please don't ask why.
-That'd be two favors, wouldn't it?
[Tense instrumental music continues]
Judy.
lt's not fair, Tru.
-Where's Candace?
-l said it's not fair!
Okay, now you're starting to scare me.
l can't take it anymore.
lt's like high school all over again.
<i>Nothing ever changes.</i>
[Soft instrumental music]
First, Candace is Prom Queen. Now you.
How come it's never my turn?
How come girls like Candace always win,
and girls like me always lose?
All l can tell you, Judy, is,
things change, l promise.
Now help me out. l need to find Candace.
Why is Candace
so important to everybody?
To you, to Mr. Connor. l'm important, too.
What do you mean, Mr. Connor?
l just saw her, with him.
TRU: You just saw them together?
JUD Y: Yeah.
Like two minutes ago.
[Tense instrumental music]
l wrote a novel.
lt's called <i>High SchooI ConfidentiaI.</i>
CONNOR: So you're sure
no one's seen your novel?
lt's like l've been telling you, Mr. Connor.
No one's seen it.
-Why do you keep asking me that?
-Just need to be sure.
You told me it was no good,
that it needed lots of work.
Of course l haven't shown it to anyone.
l was feeling so good about it,
until l showed it to you.
Why'd you want to meet me here?
lt's so creepy.
[Tense instrumental music]
l have been trying to write a novel
for years, with no success...
watching students like you graduate,
move on, pass me by.
CANDACE: l thought you'd be proud of me.
CONNOR: l am.
Your first try, you write a book...
that l have been trying to
put to paper for years.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
l know my limits, Candace.
The only way
that l will write a book as great as yours...
is if l make it my own.
That's impossible.
Not if no one's seen it.
Not if no one knows.
Oh, God.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
No one knows.
The only way for you to steal
my novel from me--
l am so sorry, Candace.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
-Tru, what are you doing here?
-l was looking for Candace.
l just wanted to tell her
how much l loved her book.
See, the only way this works for you
is if nobody's seen it.
So now you've got a choice.
You can kill Candace
and put your name on the book.
But you're gonna have to kill me, too.
[Somber instrumental music]
You won't tell anyone, will you?
Not if you resign tomorrow
and turn yourself in.
<i>You know, it's a shame.</i>
<i>The schooI's going to Iose a good teacher.</i>
You used to be my favorite, Mr. Connor.
But l guess things change.
My God.
[Upbeat rock music playing on stereo]
<i>Ladies and gentIemen of the CIass of '99...</i>
<i>pIease weIcome back our Queen,</i>
<i>Tru Davies.</i>
[All cheering]
That's my sister.
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>
<i>For those of you who remember me...</i>
<i>you know I'm not too good</i>
<i>at giving speeches. But here goes.</i>
<i>High schooI was a time...</i>
<i>that pretty much sucked for most of us.</i>
<i>Let's face it, it was aII about</i>

<i>But tonight I think</i>
<i>we get the chance to change that.</i>
<i>We can Iet bygones be bygones.</i>
<i>This tiara means a Iot to some peopIe.</i>
<i>But it doesn't beIong to me. Judy Rogers.</i>
<i>You know everything about everyone</i>
<i>in this entire cIass.</i>
<i>And you've been</i>
<i>waiting five years for this.</i>
<i>So that makes you Queen in my book.</i>
<i>Why don't you come up here</i>

[All applauding]
JUD Y: [On mike] <i>Thank you.</i>
<i>For once, I'm speechIess.</i>
Lindsay? Hi. Glenn, again.
Hi.
This might sound crazy, but there's
something l've always wanted to tell you.
l always thought
you were the most beautiful girl in school.
And then you left that note in my locker.
-l left that note in your locker?
-That note changed my life.
lt did?
lt made me realize
one very important thing.
lf l couldn't have feelings for you,
l couldn't have feelings for any girl.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that my note
made you realize that you're gay?
That note made me gay.
And let me tell you something.
Come 10th year reunion, that tiara is mine.
[Comical instrumental music]
God, what a night.
My note turned one guy into a liar,
another one gay.
The power of the written word.
-And how was your night?
-Typical.
Don't even get me started
on Harrison, either.
My God, Harrison. l totally forgot.
He didn't try to pick a fight
with Keith Morgan, did he?
-Now l remember you.
-Drinks are up, ladies.
They've been like that all night.
l thought they were going to fight,
but then Luc just started laughing at them.
Now they're the Three freaking Amigos.
LlNDSAY: Lucky me.
l'll be right back.
There's something l have to take care of.
[Humming]
Candace, how you holding up?
l'm fine. Why?
l was just wondering.
After the ordeal you went through--
-l don't need your pity.
-lt's not pity, Candace. lt's friendship.
To be honest, l don't need that, either.
Candace, we used to be best friends.
l know things change.
We're not friends now,
but maybe that could change, too.
l know l'd really like that.
What do you say?
[Soft instrumental music]
Sorry, Tru.
Some things change.
Some things never will.
[Somber instrumental music]
[Romantic music]
Hi.
-l'm glad you're still here.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
-Then how about a dance?
l thought you'd never ask.
[Romantic music continues]
So tonight must have
brought back some memories?
Yeah. A few.
CANDACE: You know who you should take
to the prom? Ronny Clifton.
-He's so out of my league.
-No way. He'd be lucky to have you.
-You mean it?
-What are best friends for?
Let's never change, okay?
We'll be wrinkly old best friend ladies
together, forever.
[Romantic music continues]
[Rock music]
[Loud rock music playing on stereo]
HARRlSON: Yeah. Come on.
Harrison?
[Loud rock music
continues playing on stereo]
MAN 1 : Call it even.
MAN 2 : What's up?
What the hell is going on?
This, guys, is Tru.
My kind, caring...
and did l mention beautiful sister?
Nice to meet you guys. Explain.
You know how you and l
depend on each other?
-Harrison?
-The old saying:
<i>-''Mi casa es su casa ''?</i>
-Harrison?
How about the Biblical quotation
that states:
''Let you without sin cast the first--''
Harrison, just tell me what happened.
Our landlord.
A real stickler for the whole
''paying the rent'' thing.
You got evicted?
Which brings us back to <i>''mi casa. ''</i>
[Water dripping]
What's that water?
HARRlSON: Yeah, you might not want to....
TRU: What is that?
Luc just fixed the sink this morning.
What did you do?
Nothing.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
Guess you had to be there.
Why couldn't you have gone to Lindsay's?
HARRlSON: Because telling your
new girlfriend you've just been evicted...
isn't very effective pillow talk.
Okay, we're out.
-Looks like you need your alone time.
-Thanks.
Let go, boys. l can take a hint.
HARRlSON: Zachary.
[Upbeat instrumental music continues]
By the way, there's some more beer
in the bathtub if you want to....
Yeah, right. Yeah.
[Police siren wailing in the distance]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music continues]
-Open up the register.
-Excuse me?
You heard me. Open it up.
There's nothing. There's nothing here.
CLERK: The cash went out an hour ago.
Then give me what you have. Now!
[Tense instrumental music continues]
[Theme music]
Help me.
DAVlS: You don't mind?
l am perfectly capable of prepping
a body solo.
Besides, you don't look so hot.
Stay away from the shrimp sandwich
at that new deli across the street.
Ouch.
You know, actually l'm....
lf you'll excuse me....
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Tru shudders]
Hey, there.
l'm Tru.
And you are...
...in the red.
[Soft instrumental music]
How about a name?
Help me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Soft instrumental music]
Bad dream?
Yeah. Bad dream.
What am l doing out here?
Well, the plan was you, me,
wine, and a movie.
The reality was you, wine,
passed out on the couch.
Anyway, sorry if l woke you.
l wanted to take care of this.
Luc just fixed the sink this morning.
What did you do?
TRU: You're fixing it.
LUC: Yeah.
Like you've been asking me to all week.
[Soft instrumental music continues]
And she's off.
Yeah, l'm meeting Lindsay for breakfast.
On a weekday? Doesn't she work?
She's taking a sick day.
How do you know? You just woke up.
'Cause that's a girl thing.
-Aren't you gonna change first?
-These clothes are fine.
TRU: Besides, l'm running late.
LUC: Okay.
All right. Here's the thing.
l don't even mind your crazy excuses
about where you have to go all the time.
What l do mind is that you keep
a part of your life hidden from me.
No, it's nothing.
l'll make it up to you tonight.
Just bring coffee.
BRlAN: Hey, Tru.
HARRlSON: <i>HeIIo?</i>
Hey, Harrison, it's me.
l've got some bad news.
HARRlSON: <i>Give it to me.</i>
TRU: You'll be evicted today.
Tell me something l don't know.
TRU: <i>Meredith's in rehab.</i>
<i>Why don't you crash at her pIace?</i>
HARRlSON: Or what about yours?
TRU: <i>Been there.</i>
-Hated that.
-A dreaded rewind day.
So, what did l do?
Poker with the boys, food on my couch,
flood in my kitchen.
HARRlSON: <i>Tru, I am shocked.</i>
Shocked. l would never do anything....
Whoa, wait, was l winning?
Bye, Harr.
TRU: l'm kind of in a--
BRlAN: This will take a second.
l'm writing this song and l can't get
the last lyric. Check this out.
[Singing] <i>I'm Iivin' out Ioud,</i>
<i>I'm drivin'right through</i>
<i>WiII you meet me there?</i>
[Singing] <i>WiII you be true?</i>
Nice little pun there. ''Tru.''
That's not what l meant.
BRlAN: That's not
quite what l'm looking for.
More of a....
All right.
lf the body asked for help, why didn't you
come to the morgue first and check?
Because he asked before l got
anything to go on.
No name, no personals.
l'm lucky l got the receipt.
TRU: And you are....
He should be here any minute.
DAVlS: <i>You got nothing eIse?</i>
TRU: <i>BuIIet wound to the chest.</i>
Wait, Davis, put the sandwich down.
-Why?
-Davis, it's a rewind day.
You want details,
or do you want to trust me?
DAVlS: Done.
Look, here he comes. l'll call you later.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
...in the red.
ATM can really ruin your day, huh?
[Suspenseful instrumental music
continues]
[Suspenseful instrumental music
continues]
Can l just go on through? Thanks.
NURSE: Can l help you?
Yes. There's a man
who went in before me.
Are you a relative?
No, but--
Nobody goes there unless they have
an appointment. Do you have one?
Didn't think so.
l have to ask you to take a seat.
And l have to ask you to bend the rules.
Otherwise you'll have
a situation on your hands.
l think l already do.
[Dialing]
All right, yeah.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Cell phone ringing]
What's up, Harrison?
l went over to Meredith's, like you said.
TRU: <i>So you broke in?</i>
l didn't have a key.
And nobody told me she installed
this insane security system.
-So what's the password?
-What?
WOMAN: Wait! l'm coming!
WOMAN: Thanks a lot.
WOMAN: [On walkie-talkie]
<i>Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth.</i>
<i>Nearest unit respond immediateIy.</i>
HARRlSON: <i>The password.</i>
<i>What is the stupid password?</i>
Sorry, l've got to call you back.
What?
[Exclaims]
[Security system alarm wailing loudly]
HARRlSON: Fellas. lt is so good to see you.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music continues]
MlCHAEL: Just give me the money.
CLERK: There's nothing here.
-Now!
-Don't!
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[Pistol fires]
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: Oh, my God.
MAN: Sorry.
-Hey.
-l didn't mean to....
TRU: Can you hear me?
MAN: God, l'm sorry.
Talk to me. Hey.
TRU: Come on.
MAN: No. Please, no.
TRU: Stay with me.
No.
[Tense instrumental music]
ls he....
[Sad instrumental music]
Save me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: This can't be happening.
LUC: Bad dream?
More like a recurring nightmare.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Sorry if l woke you.
l wanted to take care of this.
TRU: Right. Thanks.
Sorry about crashing out last night.
l swear l'll make it up to you.
[Soft instrumental music]
And she's off.
Where are you going this time?
The library.
-Doesn't open till 12:00.
-Right. l'm going to the university library.
LUC: For what?
TRU: For a work thing.
Are we playing 20 Questions?
No, just two.
Look, it's no fun for me either,
but l've really got to go.
And don't worry about the sink.
l don't think it's meant to be fixed.
-l can handle it.
-l didn't mean....
l know you can.
Thank you.
Bye.
Any time.
[Door closing]
TRU: <i>No, Harr.</i> Mi casa es mi casa.
So you're asking me
to take up residence in a building...
where all my neighbors are dead?
Hang out at the morgue
until l figure something out.
HARRlSON: <i>Wait, Iet me guess.</i>
Rewind day?
You could say that. Twice.
-So, what did l do?
-Trashed my place...
got busted breaking into
Meredith's apartment.
HARRlSON: <i>Impressive.</i>
TRU: Just go to the morgue.
HARRlSON: <i>Later.</i>
-Hey, Brian.
-l'm writing this song.
See if you can help me out.
Check this out.
[Singing] <i>I'm Iivin' out Ioud,</i>
<i>I'm drivin'right through</i>
<i>WiII you meet me there?</i>
[Singing] <i>Or are we through?</i>
You want me to rhyme ''through''
with ''through''?
That's creative.
[Soft instrumental music]
How about....
-lt rewound again?
-Yes.
Well, that's unexpected.
l thought l finally understood
how this thing works.
Someone asks for help, l save them,
happily ever after. But this time....
-Someone else died.
-Yeah. Because of me.
But because of you, someone lived.
Yeah, a guy committing a felony.
Explain to me how that's fair.
Can anybody just ask for help now?
Maybe there's a homicidal maniac
who needs some assistance?
Come on, Tru.
l've been through this twice,
and each time someone different died.
Which one am l supposed to save now?
Both.
Great. l know where one of them
is gonna be in eight minutes.
About the sandwich?
Right about...
now.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Aren't you....
Hey, l'm Lauren.
l work at the Rose Food Market.
Sorry, no.
ln case you're planning on stopping by...
you should know we're closed
for inventory today.
Doors are locked, the registers are empty.
Listen, l don't know you,
or the Rose Food Market...
and l don't know why l care
if you're doing your inventory today.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Muscle tone appears slack.
Large, fatty liver.
Could be cirrhosis.
-l thought l had it bad.
-What are you doing here?
Following orders.
Tru told me to crash here.
DAVlS: Crash?
HARRlSON: Yeah.
HARRlSON: So where's my room?
DAVlS: Room?
We don't have rooms. We have drawers.
Whatever.
l'm easy.
l haven't seen you since my sister's party.
We never really got a chance to chat.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
About?
Hello?
We're the only two people
who know what she can do.
Hey, you ever thought of convincing her
to play the ponies?
No.
DAVlS: l believe her gift provides her
with a higher calling. Do you mind?
DAVlS: These are sterile.
Well, they were sterile.
So, rewind day, huh?
DAVlS: Multiple rewind day.
HARRlSON: Multiple?
Yeah, she told me.
First.
[Upbeat instrumental music continues]
HARRlSON: You gonna eat this?
DAVlS: No, it's good.
lt's all yours.
Thanks.
Hey.
NURSE: Can l help you?
TRU: Yeah. l don't feel very good.
l'm sorry. Do you have a doctor
or caseworker here?
TRU: No.
NURSE: Okay, let me just get you set up.
Right now, l'm gonna be sick, ma'am.
To my stomach.
Down the hall, to your right.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
MAN: You should be able to get it
more than anybody else.
MAN: You're telling me you can't
help me? Can you get me the medicine?
WOMAN: No--
Are you telling me you can't help me?
MAN: Will you give me the medicine?
WOMAN: l can't.
That's it?
[Suspenseful instrumental music
continues]
-l don't have any more time.
-Mr. Mancuso, wait.
Hi, Patricia? Yeah, Stephanie Brandis.
Stephanie, it's nice to meet you.
PATRlClA: Finally we got
another caseworker here. Come in.
NURSE: lf you're finished in the bathroom,
the doctor will see you now.
You know what? l'm feeling much better.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Cell phone ringing]
Hey, a little busy right now.
You must get your brother out of here.
Ten minutes ago, l found him
locked inside a crypt.
lt's not a good time.
He's asking me how much
a corpse goes for on the black market.
Keep him occupied.
l'll be there as soon as l can.
Not soon enough.
Why don't you ask me for help?
<i>Come on. Hook a brother up.</i>
[Harrison's stomach rumbling]
Hey, dude?
What the hell was in that sandwich?
Mr. Mancuso!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
TRU: Mr. Mancuso?
WOMAN: Wait!
WOMAN: Wait, l'm coming! Thanks a lot.
Somebody's robbing that store.
WOMAN: [On walkie-talkie]
<i>Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth.</i>
<i>Nearest unit respond immediateIy.</i>
-Then give me what you have. Now!
-Freeze! Hands in the air!
MlCHAEL: Dear God.
COP: Drop your weapon on the floor.
-l don't have any.
-lt's in his left pocket.
-Empty it.
-This is all a big mistake.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Car horn blaring]
[People screaming]
My God! l didn't see him.
DRlVER: He came out of nowhere.
TRU: Somebody call an ambulance!
COP: 1 1<i>8</i>0, Orange and First.
l need an EMS team immediately.
MAN: [On walkie-talkie] <i>Copy that.</i>
<i>They're on their way.</i>
-Forget the ambulance.
-ls he....
Why didn't you listen to me?
l told you not to go in there.
BOY: Please.
Help me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Gasping]
TRU: You've got to be kidding me.
LUC: What?
You've been trying to get me
to fix this sink for weeks.
Something tells me
it wants to stay broken.
LUC: Whoa, that's the fastest
l've ever seen you get ready.
That's the fastest l've ever seen
anybody get ready.
-Sorry, l've really got to run.
-Where?
Visiting Meredith.
-She wasn't allowed to have visitors.
-Only immediate family.
lf it was something else,
you'd tell me, right?
Of course.
TRU: <i>Go crash at Lindsay's.</i>
'Cause telling your girlfriend you've been
evicted isn't very effective--
Pillow talk, my ass.
Nice language.
You having one of those days?
More like three of them.
Just be a polite guest, she'll understand.
Three? Sweet.
-Writing a song?
-How'd you know?
Because you're holding a guitar.
l'm sort of in a hurry.
Right. Okay. Check this out.
[Singing] <i>I'm Iivin' out Ioud,</i>
<i>I'm drivin'right through</i>
<i>WiII you meet me there?</i>
[Singing] <i>'Cause I'm stuck in traffic</i>
That doesn't rhyme.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Three times?
And each day, because of me,
someone different dies.
lt's not your fault.
Besides, look at the bright side.
What's that?
DAVlS: Each day you're getting
a little bit more information.
Another clue.
Now you know the guy in the store
didn't have a gun.
So he's desperate. l get it. But so am l.
l mean, what if this day
never stops repeating?
lf every day l wake up and make
the same lame excuse to Luc...
and call my brother in a vain attempt
to keep him out of trouble...
and then my neighbor with his lousy song?
l can't keep doing this.
Maybe your job isn't
as obvious as we thought.
What do you mean?
Perhaps someone
is supposed to die today...
and stay that way.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
l can't deal with this.
l am not in the business of deciding
who is or isn't supposed to die.
-How do you know?
-Don't say that.
You know what everyone else my age
is deciding right now?
Grad school, or get a job?
Order in, or go out?
Do l really need a phone
that takes little pictures?
People say things happen for a reason.
That reason is fate.
DAVlS: Fate, by definition, is immutable.
-Maybe you're here to make sure that--
-Fate gets its way?
How do l know what it wants?
lt'll tell you, eventually.
-And until then?
-You've got to trust your instincts.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
-Back to the ATM?
-No.
Something went down in the clinic.
Whatever it was...
that's what made him desperate enough
to hold up the store.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Hi. l'm Stephanie Brandis,
one of your new caseworkers.
Hi, Patricia? Yeah, Stephanie Brandis.
Of course.
Through the door and to the left.
NURSE: Patricia Norris is expecting you.
TRU: l thought she might be. Thanks.
Thank God. l've been asking
for a new caseworker for months.
PATRlClA: Come on in.
l already started flipping
through some of the files.
TRU: l'm halfway through
the Mancuso case.
Awful, isn't it?
She is the sweetest child
you will ever meet.
TRU: She?
PATRlClA: Elizabeth.
Her parents tried everything,
but with a case like this--
l haven't finished reading the file.
Elizabeth has acute viral cardiomyopathy.
-She had an echovirus last year.
-What's the course of treatment?
PATRlClA: The doctor has her
on a daily antiarrhythmic.
But the medicine's just a Band-Aid.
Ultimately, she'll need a heart transplant.
-ls she on the list?
-Yeah, pretty far down.
With O-neg patients like her...
the chances of a heart
becoming available are....
TRU: Slim to none.
PATRlClA: Exactly.
Mr. Mancuso lost his job six months ago.
-His insurance is on its last leg, so--
-l need to talk to you.
Michael. We were just discussing
your daughter's case.
This is Stephanie Brandis,
a new caseworker.
Nice to meet you.
l need more Amiodarone.
We ran out, and Elizabeth's breathing
is very heavy today.
l went to the pharmacy,
but the insurance denied me.
You know, they were gonna charge me
$500 for two pills?
MlCHAEL: l don't have $500.
PATRlClA: l'm aware--
l need you to get me that medicine.
l promise, l'll pay you back.
-Mr. Mancuso, calm down.
-She's in pain.
l'm not a pharmacist.
l'm not authorized to give away medicine.
l thought you were supposed to help me.
Give us some time.
We'll see what we can do.
-l don't have any.
-Mr. Mancuso....
PATRlClA: Mr. Mancuso, wait.
MANCUSO: l don't have any more time.
-l can't imagine it getting worse for him.
-l can.
Look, l swear to you,
l'm Stephanie Brandis...
and l have a meeting.
Don't make me call security.
Michael.
l understand your daughter is in trouble,
but Patricia can help you.
-Wait for her call.
-My daughter needs her medicine now.
She's not going to get it
if you do something stupid.
What are you talking about?
Don't tell me you're looking
for a quick way to get cash...
which might include holding up
the nearest store you find.
Leave me alone.
TRU: Don't do this.
MlCHAEL: You got any other options?
She's 1 1 years old.
[Sad instrumental music]
The one thing my daughter needs
is the thing l can't give her.
l look at her friends and l wonder...
why their hearts work and hers doesn't.
Why she got sick and they didn't.
l can't fix her...
but l can make her feel better.
MlCHAEL: She needs her medicine.
She needs it now.
l'll get it for you.
Just give me an hour.
And no charge, but promise me
you won't go into that store.
MlCHAEL: An hour?
TRU: And your address.
<i>8</i>20 South Normandy, Apartment 2.
TRU: Amiodarone, right?
MlCHAEL: Yeah, 15 milligrams.
Got it. Go sit with your daughter.
l'll be right there.
[Mellow instrumental music]
Thank you.
WOMAN: Wait! l'm coming!
Thank you.
WOMAN: Thank you so much.
WOMAN: [On walkie-talkie]
<i>Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth.</i>
<i>Nearest unit respond immediateIy.</i>
Go to the pharmacy on the corner
and ask for Timothy.
DAVlS: lf she has shortness of breath,
this should work.
With acute viral cardiomyopathy,
she'll eventually--
l know. Need a transplant.
You sure he's gonna give me
$500 worth of medication?
DAVlS: He owes me. l set up his grandma
with a nice coffin last month.
lt looks like you were wrong.
No one had to die today. Not one person.
l'm glad l was mistaken.
[Cell phone ringing]
-What's up, Harry?
-l took your advice and went to Lindsay's.
<i>And you said to be a poIite houseguest.</i>
<i>WeII, I tried.</i>
But l thought l'd be nice
and cook a little something for dinner...
and l might have started a small fire.
And you're calling me why?
HARRlSON: On the off chance
the day boomerangs again...
l need you to say two simple
words: takeout.
Good luck, Harry.
TRU: You okay?
DAVlS: Kind of not. No.
-Word of advice. Stay away from that--
-Shrimp sandwich.
Yeah, my bad. l forgot to warn you.
l've been kind of busy. Sorry.
DAVlS: lt's okay. Priorities. Go.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Upbeat instrumental music continues]
Michael, l have the medicine.
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: ls she....
She's gone.
[Sad instrumental music]
l should've been here sooner.
The medicine wouldn't have saved her life.
Thank you for trying.
l'm so sorry.
[Sad instrumental music continues]
There's a plan for everyone.
MlCHAEL: Oh, come here.
<i>She's in a better pIace.</i>
MlCHAEL: We did everything we could.
You know we did everything.
ELlZABETH: Please.
[Tense instrumental music]
Help me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Gasping]
LUC: Bad dream?
TRU: l wish.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
You don't need to bother fixing that.
Trust me.
-Are you okay?
-No.
LUC: Can l help?
TRU: No.
And she's off.
LUC: Out of curiosity,
where are you rushing off to?
l could make up some excuse
that you'd see right through...
because you know me, and l love that.
But for us to work,
you need to know everything.
For that to happen,
you need to wait a little bit longer.
Obviously, we have a lot to talk about.
But l see you're stressed about something,
so let me help with that.
You're right. Maybe you could help me
with something.
TRU: Harrison's having
a really bad couple of days.
And he might come by here.
Can you keep him out of trouble?
-Okay.
-Thank you.
-l'll talk to you tonight.
-Yeah.
We'll see.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
BRlAN: Tru.
[Singing] <i>I'm Iivin' out Ioud,</i>
<i>I'm drivin'right through</i>
<i>WiII you meet me there?</i>
<i>So we can start anew</i>
[Exclaims in amazement]
BRlAN: That's my song.
BRlAN: l think we're on the same
kind of wavelength here.
You want to start a band?
You must be so sick
of explaining this to me.
Each time the day repeats, it gets worse.
You should've seen this family.
Let me get this straight again.
You saved the father.
Yeah. So he could watch his daughter die.
How is that okay?
-Without you, they both would've--
-l know.
But l'm still stuck in the same day.
What am l doing wrong?
Maybe you're doing everything
exactly right.
Davis, you can theorize all you want.
Maybe everything
was meant to lead you...
directly to this little girl.
So l'm supposed to keep Michael
away from the store...
and get help for his daughter?
And don't forget, the help that
he thinks she needs is useless.
The medicine isn't gonna save her life.
l have to get her to the hospital.
Davis, the sandwich in the fridge,
hand it over.
-What?
-Now.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
What am l supposed to eat?
[Fast-paced instrumental music continues]
TRU: Michael.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
-Who are you?
-You don't know me.
There's no time to explain,
but l'm here to help your daughter.
-She has to get to a hospital now.
-She's gonna be fine.
She's not. Elizabeth's in trouble.
-Believe me.
-How do you know her name?
Same way l know you're about to find out
that your balance is -$432.1<i>8</i>.
[Suspenseful instrumental music
continues]
-l don't understand.
-You'll go to the clinic...
to beg for free medicine for Elizabeth,
but let me save you some time.
Patricia Norris, your caseworker,
will be sympathetic...
but she's not authorized
to give you the meds.
What are you talking about?
Amiodarone isn't gonna save her life.
Her heart is gonna fail today.
ls there anything you wouldn't do
for your daughter?
l'd die for her.
Call your wife, and tell her
to get Elizabeth to the hospital.
Here.
[Soft instrumental music]
Honey, it's me. ls she....
No, the medicine is not gonna help her.
Take her to the hospital.
MlCHAEL: Yeah, l'll meet you there.
[Soft instrumental music continues]
Thank you...
whoever you are.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
MAN: l want all your money right now.
MlCHAEL: l don't have a thing.
WOMAN: [On walkie-talkie]
<i>Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth.</i>
<i>Nearest unit respond immediateIy.</i>
MAN: Come on!
TRU: Please. He doesn't have anything.
-Shut up.
-Please.
Take my necklace. lt's worth a lot.
Just don't hurt him.
TRU: Please, take this.
MAN: All right.
All right, take it off. Come on.
-Come on.
-l'm trying.
[Tense instrumental music]
No!
No!
[Michael screaming]
Move it! The necklace, come on. Let's go.
Hey, it's okay.
MAN: <i>91 1. What's your emergency?</i>
DOCTOR #1 : Multiple stab wounds.
He's bleeding out. We need another line.
Get a 14-gauge
and set up the rapid infuser.
Send a type and cross match
to the blood bank now. On three.
One, two, three.
-Who the hell are you?
-City morgue.
Where's my daughter?
DOCTOR #2: Damn it. She's in v-fib.
MlCHAEL: Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
DOCTOR #2: Get the paddles.
MlCHAEL: No.
DOCTOR #2: Everybody clear?
MlCHAEL: Elizabeth.
Still no pulse. Start the compressions.
MlCHAEL: Please, no.
Oh, God, no.
DOCTOR #1 : Please try and calm down.
<i>Three entry wounds in</i>
<i>the right upper quadrant, set up for a DPO.</i>
NURSE: Yes, doctor.
DOCTOR #1 : Blood in the peritoneum.
Where the hell is the trauma surgeon?
l'd die for her.
l'm not gonna make it.
NURSE: Doctor?
MlCHAEL: Please.
Make sure she's okay, please.
DOCTOR #1 : Pressure's still dropping.
DOCTOR #3: Clear.
DOCTOR #1 : Push more ringers, fast.
He needs blood.
Where is the O-neg l ordered?
NURSE: On its way.
DOCTOR #1 : Scalpel.
With O-neg patients like Elizabeth...
the chances of a heart
becoming available are....
Slim to none.
DOCTOR #1 : You're a mess.
His heart was destroyed.
<i>But not today.</i>
l didn't need to save him,
l needed to save his heart.
For her.
Your daughter's gonna live a long
and healthy life.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
DOCTOR #1 : Come on. Push through.
DOCTOR #1 : Damn it.
[Machine beeping]
Time of death, 12:32 p.m.
His daughter needs his heart.

HARRlSON: l hope
you didn't just break that.
Because Luc spent two hours
trying to fix it.
Yeah. l know.
Hey, you okay?
This has been the longest day of my life.
l know the feeling.
lf it makes you feel any better,
l got evicted today.
Really?
But your boy Luc really saved my ass.
He kept your buddies
from trashing my place?
Yeah, that, and he joined
the poker game and then he....
Let's just say that l have
enough money for last month's rent.
Oh, and next month's, too.
HARRlSON: But you should get some rest.

Valentine's Day.
Somehow, even the morgue
seems more romantic.
When do you guys leave
for the big weekend?
Harrison's picking me up in the morning.
TRU: He tell you where you're going yet?
LlNDSAY: Someplace up in the mountains.
Pinetop Cabins.
He says it's supposed to be beautiful.
So what about you and Luc?
He found this little bed-and-breakfast
up the coast...
and he's picking me up
right after my shift.
How sweet are our guys.
Valentine's Day comes up and
they put together fabulous weekends...
-for their respective hotties.
-Don't you love this time of year?
Valentine's Day is a sham...
perpetuated by the floral and
greeting card industries to move product.
You'll have to excuse Davis.
He's very single.
Shocker. So, l'll see you Monday.
Have a great weekend.
-You, too.
-l will.
TRU: So, are you working tomorrow?
Yep, filling in for one of the married guys.
l gotta tell you, Davis,
this weekend can't start soon enough.
l so need a break from my job.
This one or the secret one?
For a change, both.
[Thunder rumbling]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Theme music]
Help me.
[Upbeat rock music playing on car radio]
You're up.
Thank God.
l was about to check for a pulse.
When l picked you up at the morgue...
you said you were gonna close your eyes
for five minutes.
LUC: That was four hours ago.
[Man chattering on police radio]
Oh, no. This can't be good.
There's been some flash flooding
up ahead, sir.
Road's closed for the next 24 hours.
But we need to get through today.
This is the only road that goes through.
Sorry. lf l were you,
l'd go back the way l came.
So we'll spend Valentine's Day at home.
No big deal.
<i>What are you Iooking for?</i>
According to this, we're just 50 miles from
the place Harrison and Lindsay went to.
Pinetop Cabins?
How did you know about that?
Harrison called me last week
and said something about a package deal.
My brother the romantic.
The point is
it's supposed to be really beautiful.
Harrison said it was beautiful?
l believe his exact words were,
''Rustic, yet romantic.''
LUC: Come on, let's surprise him.
l've been craving chips
for the last 30 miles. You want anything?
l'm good.
[Cell phone ringing]
Hello?
l just heard on the radio they closed 14.
l wanted to give you a heads up.
TRU: <i>Thanks, but we sort of found out</i>
<i>the hard way.</i>
How's everything in Morgue-ville?
lt turns out l'm not spending
Valentine's Day alone after all.
TRU: No?
DAVlS: <i>I'm here with a Marissa Hatcher.</i>
Cops found her in McKinley Park
with her throat slit.
TRU: <i>ReaIIy?</i>
DAVlS: Yeah. The weird thing is...
the killer left a newspaper clipping
in the shape of a heart.
Some kind of a calling card or something.
God, there are a lot of freaks out there.
DAVlS: Poor girl.
Anyway, try to relax and have a good time.
Thanks, l will. l'll see you on Monday.
[Knocking on car window]
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
lt's okay.
[Tense instrumental music]
You're not heading south by any chance,
because l could really use a lift.
[Tru grunts hesitantly]
KEVlN: l know what you're thinking:
Mysterious stranger asks pretty girl
for a ride.
lt's like the first scene
in some bad horror flick, right?
Sort of.
l'm Kevin Rafferty, and my car broke down
just a few miles from here.
Good thing you're at a gas station.
Yeah. Well, the mechanic took off
for the holiday...
which kind of puts me in a bind because
l'm supposed to be meeting my girlfriend.
KEVlN: We've never spent
a Valentine's Day apart...
and l'd hate to start now.
l'd really like to help, but....
-No hitchhikers.
-Yeah.
KEVlN: Well, have a nice Valentine's Day.
TRU: You, too.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Pop music playing softly on radio]
Has anyone seen my wallet?
lt's red with a velcro snap.
-You must have just dropped it.
-Thanks.
Aren't you my little Good Samaritan.
Any idea how close we are to the motel?
LUC: l checked with the cashier.
15 miles, and we're supposed to look
for a painted sign.
Apparently, we can't miss it.
[Mellow instrumental music]
LUC: ls that what l think it is?
TRU: Leave it to Harrison.
All l tried to do
was take you away for a nice weekend.
-Here?
-l know it's a little creepy--
They've got their own cemetery.
No, that cemetery
is not part of the property. l asked.
l want to go home, Harrison.
Look, they're supposed to have
this amazing waterfall around here.
l was thinking
we could go for a hike tomorrow...
have a little picnic...
maybe watch some birds or something.
l don't know.
-You would go hiking?
-For you? Absolutely.
[Mellow instrumental music continues]
''Rustic, yet romantic.''
[Knocking at door]
We're all set with towels, thanks.
TRU: lt's me, Harry.
<i>The owner toId me where to find you.</i>
Hey.
HARRlSON: What the hell
are you doing here?
LUC: We couldn't make it to the coast.
The road was closed.
l tried both your cells,
but l couldn't get through.
The radio said some relay tower
got hit by lightning last night.
-There's no reception for miles.
-We were thinking of getting a room.
Great! The more the merrier.
<i>You two go check in.</i>
Once you're settled, we'll grab dinner
in the main cabin. My treat.
l thought you said meals were included.
lxnay, baby. We'll see you in 30.
Look, l know this isn't exactly
what l promised.
Luc, really, it's you and me.
Anywhere would be fine.
You sure?
Yeah.
KEVlN: We meet again.
TRU: Hey.
[Tense instrumental music]
Tru?
-l asked her for a ride a few miles back.
-At the gas station. You were inside.
lt's okay. Hank picked me up
a few miles down the road.
TRU: l'm really sorry.
KEVlN: Me, too.
lf l'd known we were both going
to the Pinetop Cabins...
l could've caught you a discount
on your room.
My sister owns the place.
ElLEEN: Hey, Kevin.
-Hey.
-Hi.
You made it.
-Welcome.
-This is Hank. He gave me a ride.
Hi, come on in.
HARRlSON: The way l see it,
you just fix up some of these cabins...
clear out some of those graves,
and Pinetop Cabins Motel...
is Pinetop Cabins Resort and Spa.
Am l boring you, honey?
No, it's just that poor guy...
all alone on Valentine's Day.
Maybe he wants to be alone.
-Who cares?
-l care. l think it's sad.
Awww.
-Some meal.
-Yeah, it's good stuff.
What?
Nothing.
Just wish you wouldn't always worry
about everyone else.
LlNDSAY: So what are you saying?
What, you think l'm a busybody?
Only when it comes to everyone else.
TRU: Who's still got room for dessert?
LlNDSAY: You're right.
l should become more like you
and think only about myself.
-All the time.
-You calling me selfish?
l'm not the one who used up
all the hot water in the cabin.
HARRlSON: So l like long showers. Sue me.
-Can l talk to you?
-Yeah.
LlNDSAY: ln private.
[Tense instrumental music]
-l'm breaking up with him, Tru. Tonight.
-lt's Valentine's Day.
Yeah, right.
The most romantic day of the year,
and Harrison and l can't stop fighting.
Wait. You're not mad, are you?
No, of course not.
lt's just you guys are my best friends.
And we still will be.
We just won't make out as much.
[Cell phone beeping]
TRU: l guess
they finally fixed the relay towers.
At least something
went right tonight, right?
[Tru sighs]
[Romantic instrumental music]
[Romantic instrumental music]
Happy Valentine's Day.
Luc, they're beautiful. Where did you--
Someone just left them there
on one of those graves in the cemetery.
LUC: l figured they probably
didn't need it anymore, so l....
l'm kidding. They were stashed in my bag.
Come here.
HARRlSON: You're dumping me?
LlNDSAY: We fight all the time, Harrison,
about everything.
You know, l actually thought this weekend
would make things better for us.
Maybe it did.
Look, l'm just gonna go for a walk,
so if you want the bed....
No, l'll take the cot.
The bed smells funny.
[Comical instrumental music]
Damn.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Leaves rustling]
Hello?
[Tense instrumental music continues]
Harrison, if that's you....
[Leaves rustling]
LlNDSAY: Hello?
[Dramatic instrumental music]
LlNDSAY: God, you scared me!
-What are you doing?
-l was just getting ice. Are you okay?
Yeah, sorry.
l thought l heard a noise in the woods.
Sorry, this place is just sort of creepy.
What, the motel with its own graveyard?
Go figure. See you.
KEVlN: [Ghostly voice] <i>HeIp me.</i>
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
<i>PIease.</i>
ls anybody out there?
[Suspenseful instrumental music

[Tense instrumental music]
Kevin.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
l need you.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
You're up.
What?
Thank God.
l was about to check for a pulse.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
-Who are you calling?
-Harrison, to warn him.
About?
Lindsay's allergies.
He was gonna cook her dinner tonight,
but if he makes anything with peanuts....
[Tense instrumental music]
A relay tower
got hit by lightning last night.
<i>There's no reception for miIes.</i>
LUC: Oh, no. This can't be good.
There's been some flash flooding
up ahead, sir.
Road's closed for the next 24 hours.
We need to get through today.
Only this road goes through.
Sorry. lf l were you,
l'd go back the way l came.
So, here's a crazy idea.
We're not too far from the place
Harrison and Lindsay went to.
Pinetop Cabins.
l was thinking
maybe we could go there, too.
That's so weird.
l was just thinking that same thing.
And if you see a gas station,
could you pull over?
-l've got this weird craving for chips.
-Chips.
LUC: Bag of chips coming right up.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
DAVlS: <i>HeIIo?</i>
TRU: Davis, it's me.
DAVlS: l was just getting ready to call you.
TRU: <i>I know.</i>
l get it. Do-over day.
What have you got for me victim-wise?
His name's Kevin Rafferty.
He was killed at the motel we went to.
Slit throat.
When l found him, there was
a newspaper heart next to the body.
-Sound familiar?
-Two victims, same M.O. Sounds like--
A serial killer. l know.
<i>Serves me right for thinking</i>
<i>I was gonna get a vacation.</i>
These things do happen
at the worst possible times.
All the better to ruin my life.
Tell me everything you know
about the first murder.
And tell me fast. l'm gonna be meeting
victim number two any second now.
According to the police report...
a witness saw a man
leave the scene of the crime.
What else?
There's some residue on the paper heart.
DAVlS: <i>Specks of something.</i>
<i>I can't teII what.</i>
l'll do a chemical analysis
and get back to you.
Fine, but you won't be able to reach me
until 6:03 tonight.
DAVlS: <i>Why not?</i>
TRU: Phone issues.
Just find out everything you can by then.
What are you gonna do in the meantime?
Anything it takes to keep Kevin away
from that motel tonight.
l gotta go, Davis.
Let me guess. You need a lift.
Yeah, just up to the Pinetop Cabins Motel.
lt's not very far.
That's fine by me...
but we should check and see
if it's cool with my boyfriend.
Great.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
That's him right there,
if you want to ask him.
Has anyone seen my wallet?
lt's red with a velcro snap.
He's got it. l just saw him snatch it
right off the counter.
That's not true.
-lf you don't believe me, check in his bag.
-What?
SHERlFF: All right, let's take a look.
[Suspenseful instrumental music
continues]
KEVlN: l did not take that, l swear.
Right. Never heard of that one before.
l don't understand you.
Why are you doing this to me?
lt's not what you think, it's....
l'm just trying to help.
Come on, let's get out of here now.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
l'm gonna go talk to Harrison.
l'll be right back.
How do you know which cabin he's in?
Four. lt's Harrison's lucky number.
He always stays in four.
LlNDSAY: Fine, we'll stay.
HARRlSON: Yes.
[Knocking at door]
HARRlSON: We're all set with--
TRU: Open up, you guys. lt's me.
Tru?
Hey, guys.
The road was closed.
We couldn't make it to the coast.
We decided to come here instead.
Luc's out front.
-Great.
-l need to talk to Harrison...
about something, in private.
-So you got the poor schnook arrested?
-To save his life, yeah.
Unbelievable. A serial killer, here.
That's right. So l want you and Lindsay
to pack your things.
We're all going home. l won't take no--
Relax, you had me at ''serial killer.''
l'm out of here.
TRU: Good.
HARRlSON: But wait.
Shouldn't we call the cops?
Tell them we got a whack job loose?
l'd love to, but we don't have any proof.
And if we told them l was reliving a day,
they'd think we were insane.
Let's call the tabloids, tell them you had
a psychic premonition about the killer.
-How would that help?
-lt wouldn't, but we could make a mint.
Think about it.
HARRlSON: Pack your stuff.
We're out of this dump.
What?
You were right about everything.
l should've taken you someplace nicer.
-My bad.
-But you just talked me into staying.
Here? Are you kidding?
They've got their own cemetery.
Okay.
Bad news. Harrison says
the cabins have rats. We can't stay.
-But l just checked in.
-So check out. We'll go someplace else.
Trust me,
this is not the place we want to be, okay?
LUC: All right. l'll be right back.
[Hank coughs]
We meet again.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
-You surprised to see me?
-You have no idea.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
KEVlN: Your little prank almost worked.
Till l realized that the Mini-Mart
had a security camera.
l told the sheriff to check the tape.
Guess what he saw.
l know it doesn't seem like it right now,
but it was for your own good.
Framing me for petty larceny
was for my own good?
KEVlN: l don't know what you're doing
at my sister's motel.
But l suggest that you leave
before l call the cops.
WOMAN: Kevin. Hey...
You made it.
-Hi.
-Hank. l gave your brother a ride.
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: Hey.
HARRlSON: Hi.
There's been a change of plans.
l'm staying.
What?
The victim just showed up.
l can't leave him.
-So what do we do now?
-''We'' aren't doing anything.
You're taking Lindsay back to the city,
like we agreed.
There's no way l'm leaving you here
with a psycho on the loose.
-So l'll send Lindsay back with Luc.
-Right.
And how are you gonna explain that one?
Besides, now that victim boy's here,
we're all perfectly safe.
We can't be sure about that.
We've already started
making changes to the day.
TRU: Changes that could affect
yesterday's outcome.
Meaning tonight's victim could be....
Me?
[Tense instrumental music continues]
Honestly, there's no way to know.
All right. lf l bite it, l bite it.
l'll ask you for help, the day will restart...
and we can do this crazy dance
all over again.
lf l let you stay.
What are we gonna tell Luc and Lindsay?
The truth.
The first time l told you l relived days,
you thought l was insane.
ln that case, we lie our asses off.
-So now you want to stay?
-lt's not that l want to. l have to.
Harrison and Lindsay
are in the middle of a nasty....
...fight. As much as l'd like to take you
someplace nice....
...l just don't feel right
leaving them here alone.
Maybe they should be alone
so they can work it out for themselves.
l don't think that'll happen.
Harrison's being....
-...totally unreasonable.
-That doesn't sound like Tru.
That's what l'm saying.
She's not being herself.
l think l should spend some time
alone with her...
so l can figure out what's what, because....
...they're gonna break up.
-All right, is there anything l can do?
-No.
So just sit here. Don't move.
As soon as l talk some sense
into my sister, l will be back.
l'll go check in. Again.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
-How'd it go?
-Piece of cake. You?
So what's next?
One of us should keep an eye on Kevin
while the other looks for suspects.
We got any?
Davis said a man was seen
leaving the scene of the first murder...
in McKinley Park.
Great. So how many dudes
are staying here...
that aren't me, Luc, or the victim?
Two suspects.
One guy gave Kevin a ride today.
The other guy was at dinner last night.
Older guy with glasses.
Yeah, he checked in with me and Lindsay.
HARRlSON: His name's Carl.
TRU: Okay.
Can you believe we're in a motel
with a cemetery next door...
and a frigging psycho on the loose?
Can it get any more <i>Friday the 13th?</i>
No, this is <i>Summer Camp.</i>
-Whatever.
-Harry, be careful.
l've got Tru Davies as my sister.
l don't need to be careful.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
-l thought l told you to leave.
-You did, and l was going to.
KEVlN: Why are you still here?
l feel bad about what happened today,
and l wanted to apologize.
You tried to get me arrested.
Saying sorry is not gonna cut it.
lt's hard to believe,
but l was trying to protect you.
From what?
ElLEEN: Kevin.
ElLEEN: ls there a problem?
KEVlN: No.
No.
No problem, Eileen.
Just a little misunderstanding.
Good. l was hoping
you'd get me some wood from out back.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
l hope you can forgive my brother.
He always gets so worked up
this time of year.
lt's Valentine's Day.
l'm sure he's got big plans tonight.
He told me he was meeting his girlfriend.
He hadn't mentioned it to me,
but big sister's always the last to know.
Keep an eye on him tonight, okay?
l always do.
Since our parents died, he's all l've got.
l don't know what l'd do without him.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music]
What are you doing in my cabin?
Your cabin? l thought this was....
Wake up, Harrison!
So you walked in here by mistake?
Yeah, l got in here, and l was like:
''Where's my stuff and my girl?
Who cut up all these crazy newspapers?''
-That would be me.
-Really?
Putting together a little ransom note,
are we?
[Tense instrumental music]
My wife's obituaries.
She passed away last week.
l'm sorry to hear that.
CARL: l know it seems morbid...
but the papers said such lovely things
about her.
According to this,
the funeral was yesterday in Philly.
HARRlSON: And you were there.
CARL: lt was a beautiful ceremony.
So you couldn't have been
in McKinley Park last night.
CARL: Pardon?
ls that....
My wife's ashes.
She asked that they be scattered here.
[Harrison sputters]
l'm sorry about the mixup,
but l've gotta go.
Carl's not our guy. He was in Philly
when the murder occurred.
You're positive?
l've got his wife's ashes to prove it.
On my hand.
That leaves the guy with the pickup truck.
What cabin is he in? l'll check him out.
We should switch up. Kevin made it clear
he doesn't want me around.
l'll take Kevin. You take the other guy.
-lf you see anything suspicious--
-l'll scream like a little girl.
l'll come find you. Whichever.
[Woman screaming on TV]
[Knocking at door]
LlNDSAY: Come in.
Hey.
Come on in, have a seat.
l was just wondering if you'd heard
anything from Tru or Harrison.
LlNDSAY: Zilch. You?
LUC: Nothing.
Some Valentine's Day.
lt could be worse.
We could be single.
ln which case, l'd probably be moping
around my apartment right now...
watching dopey Meg Ryan movies
and eating ice cream.
Damn, l wish l was single.
l hope you don't mind me asking,
but what set off the big fight?
LlNDSAY: Sorry?
LUC: The fight.
Tru told me about it.
You and Harrison are fighting, right?
No, you and Tru
are the ones fighting, right?
LUC: No.
[Cell phone ringing]
TRU: Right on time, Davis.
Tell me something good.
DAVlS: The lab guys just finished analyzing
the residue on the paper heart.
TRU: <i>And?</i>
They identified the substance
as tobacco flakes.
Tar and nicotine levels are consistent
with a certain brand of cigarettes:
<i>BuIIseye Lights.</i>
So keep an eye out for smokers.
Got it. Thanks.
There's more.
l did a little research this afternoon
on our serial killer.
The cops are trying to keep this quiet.
lt turns out there were five murders
over the last two years.
All with the same M.O.
<i>AII five occurred</i>
<i>on or around VaIentine's Day.</i>
So he's killed even more people
than we thought? Wonderful.
Say the word, and l'll meet you there.
TRU: <i>There's no way you'd make it in time.</i>
Just sit tight.
l'll call you if l need anything.
[Tense instrumental music]
LUC: You want to tell me
what you think you're doing?
-Luc, what are you--
-You're the one breaking into a pickup.
So you answer my question first.
l was turning the lights off.
He left them on,
and l just didn't want it to kill the battery.
l guess you and Harrison
worked everything out.
l guess you and Harrison
worked everything out.
Yeah, it wasn't easy,
but l think l finally got through to him.
l talked to Lindsay.
[Tense instrumental music]
We know you guys lied to us.
-Luc, you don't understand.
-No, l think l do.
This is the part where you tell me
your life's really complicated, right?
That you take off without explanation,
and l just have to deal with it.
TRU: No, l just--
LUC: Here l am...
thinking you're the most amazing girl
l've gotten to know in a long time.
And the truth is
l don't really know you at all.
[Sad instrumental music]
Luc.
Next time you break into a man's vehicle...
don't get into a shouting match
outside his cabin.
lt tends to wake a body up.
l know what you're up to,
and l'm warning you.
-Stay away from Kevin Rafferty.
-What?
You heard me.
[Coughs]
You're the second person l met today
that smokes that brand.
-These aren't yours?
-Of course not.
l've got severe asthma. l can't smoke.
HANK: Damn it.
lf these aren't yours, then whose are they?
Kevin's. He probably dropped them
getting out of the truck.
TRU: Kevin's?
[Tense instrumental music]
HARRlSON: There you are.
l was just gonna come look for you.
Save it, okay?
l don't know what you and Tru are up to,
and l don't even want to know.
But whatever it is,
l'm sure it's mostly your fault.
HARRlSON: Whoa, whoa. Calm down.
LlNDSAY: First thing in the morning,
you'll take me home.
HARRlSON: But, baby--
LlNDSAY: No, Harrison, really. No buts.
LlNDSAY: And no more of your stories.
This time, we're through.
[Sighs]
Uh, Kevin?
[Tense instrumental music]
Damn it.
Terbutaline. That's only prescribed
for people with life-threatening asthma.
-So the cigarettes belong to Kevin?
-Right.
DAVlS: <i>Which makes him the seriaI kiIIer.</i>
TRU: Right again.
Well, if Kevin is the serial killer,
then who killed Kevin?
l'm thinking maybe Kevin went looking
for another victim last night.
And that victim turned the tables on him.
Right. The only question now is who.
[Tense instrumental music]
Come on. You've gotta be kidding me.
KEVlN: Locked out?
Yeah, you work here?
My sister owns the place.
She went for a walk,
but l was just about to go find her.
lf you want to come with,
l'll get you another key.
You are a lifesaver.
Lead the way.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: The guy with the pickup
isn't the serial killer. Kevin is.
-What?
-There are two killers.
Kevin killed the girl in McKinley Park,
and someone else killed him last night.
Davis and l think
it must be someone he attacked.
That doesn't make
what l have to tell you any easier.
-Kevin took off. l lost him.
-You what?
And Lindsay stopped by to chew me out.
l only took my eyes off him
for two seconds.
Great. That means he's still in danger.
So what if he's in danger?
The guy's a serial killer.
Let's knock off
and let nature take its course.
You don't get it.
Everything you and l did today...
that we didn't do yesterday,
it changed fate.
So?
So things might play out differently
this time.
Maybe the person Kevin attacks
doesn't fend him off tonight.
Maybe that person dies instead of him.
CARL: Evening.
-Carl, buddy, what's shaking?
-l was about to ask you the same question.
l just saw your lady friend
walking off with another fellow.
What? Who?
Eileen's brother. She introduced me once,
l forget his name.
Which direction did they go?
[Tense instrumental music]
And then,
as if things weren't bad enough...
he leaves me sitting in the room alone
for three hours and....
LlNDSAY: Are you sure this is the way
your sister went?
l want you to meet someone.
My girlfriend, Amanda.
[Eerie instrumental music]
We never spent a Valentine's Day apart.
This is a joke, right?
She died three years ago. A car crash.
Have you ever lost someone close to you?
lt changes you.
KEVlN: lt separates you from other people.
They say they're sorry.
They bring flowers, they send cards.
But they don't really understand
what you're going through.
KEVlN: They don't know
what it meant to lose her.
That's why l do this.
So that other people will know
what it feels like.
l want them to understand, just like...
the people who love you
are going to understand.
LlNDSAY: Oh, my God!
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Are you all right?
Yeah, l think so.
You okay?
[Tense instrumental music]
So l guess we finally figured out
who iced the guy.
Yeah, l guess. lt's just....
What?
Are you okay?
Sorry, this place is just sort of creepy.
No, it couldn't have been Lindsay.
l saw her yesterday
just before l found the body.
<i>She was fine.</i>
So who the hell killed this guy?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
You.
TRU: The killer has to be someone
who knew the truth.
LlNDSAY: He said that was his girlfriend.
What was that, sweetie?
He said that was his girlfriend.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
He told me he was meeting his girlfriend.
He hadn't mentioned it to me.
Eileen. She was covering for him.
KEVlN: You always looked after me.
You always took care of me.
<i>PIease don't stop now, aII right? KiII me.</i>
Kill me before l hurt someone else, please.
l can't. l'm your sister. l love you.
lf that's true,
then you will put an end to all of this.
Once and for all, l'm begging you.
Kevin.
Please.
Don't do it, Eileen.
[Tense instrumental music]
l would never.
ElLEEN: He's my brother.
How long have you been protecting him?
ElLEEN: l haven't.
He confessed everything to me
just before you came to the cabin.
l begged him to go to the police,
but he promised he wouldn't kill again.
l believed it,
until l saw him following your friend.
[Crying] And then l knew he couldn't stop.
Do it, please!
Kill me, please, before l kill again.
No, l can't. l'm sorry.
ElLEEN: But we'll get you help.
The best doctors.
l don't want their help.
l wanted yours, but if you can't--
No, Kevin, don't. Please!
You're all l have.
TRU: l gotta be honest.
l don't even know if you deserve to live.
But l know if you go through with it...
you're not just killing yourself.
You're killing her, too.
[Tense instrumental music]
Thank you.
LlNDSAY: So let me see
if l've got this straight.
Tru overheard this psycho confessing
a murder to his sister this afternoon.
And instead of going to the police--
Which she couldn't do
because the phones were down.
Right. She went to you.
[Harrison grunts affirmatively]
So why didn't you tell me and Luc?
We didn't want you getting all freaked out.
Well, maybe if l was
a little more freaked out...
l wouldn't have gone for a walk
with the guy.
l can't believe
l almost broke up with you tonight.
LlNDSAY: What you did for me...
l didn't think a man could be that brave.
Look, l know l screwed up.
No, lives were at stake.
You did something good.
But for reasons l may never understand,
you felt like you couldn't come to me.
-l was trying to protect you.
-l didn't need you to protect me.
l never did.
What l needed was for you to let me in.
To be a part of your life.
But now.... God, after this....
Luc, please. lt won't happen again.
lt will.
[Sad instrumental music]
Maybe not the same way, but it will.
'Cause we're going in circles here, Tru.
We're running into the same problem
over and over again.
l just don't think one more chance
is gonna change that.
[Sad instrumental music continues]
l went through hell this weekend.
And for what?
To save the life of a serial killer.
Now he's in prison. Some people
would say that's worse than death.
All l wanted was two days, Davis.
Two lousy days away from this job
and this thing that l do.
But l couldn't get away.
lt followed me, and it cost me Luc
because l couldn't tell him the truth.
You have a calling.
TRU: A calling is something
you're destined to do.
Something that gives your life meaning,
that makes you happy.
What l do feels more like a curse.
[Davis sighs]
Look, you were chosen for a reason.
DAVlS: Whoever gave you this gift
knew what they were doing.
They saw the same things in you
that l see in you:
strength, compassion, conviction.
Curse or calling, love it or hate it,
you are the right person for the job.
DAVlS: There's no doubt in my mind.
[Sad instrumental music]
[Rock music]
[Pop music]
Drop those lights down!
Check the sound again.
l'm still hearing feedback.
l don't care what you told them, Marty.
l'm not gonna sing.
My friend at <i>The Times</i> says
they'll send their best photographer.
l don't know what l'd do without you.
CONTESTANT: Hi.
Hi.
Will you be moving sometime today,
or should l go change in my car?
Sorry.
You know this room
is only for contestants, right?
l am a contestant.
[Exclaims]
Right, of course you are.
My name's Jackie.
No offense, sweetie,
but l'm not looking to make friends today.
l'm looking to win.
[Phone ringing]
-Hello?
-Tru Davies?
TRU: <i>May I ask who's caIIing?</i>
Sorry, how rude of me.
Michelle Carey, <i>Post Dispatch.</i>
TRU: The newspaper.
MlCHELLE: <i>Some peopIe think so.</i>
Anyway, l was wondering
if l could ask you a few questions.
Actually, l'm not interested
in a subscription.
MlCHELLE: <i>That's not why I'm caIIing.</i>
l've been looking through police reports
over the past several months. All sorts:
an attempted murder-for-hire scheme,
suspected mass poisoning, and so on.
And the only thing all these
very different crimes have in common is...
well, you.
l'm not sure l understand--
MlCHELLE: <i>In aII the cases I've Iooked at...</i>
<i>you were cited by the wouId-be victim</i>
<i>as the reason he or she was stiII aIive.</i>
Every time. lt's really quite remarkable.
l'm sure it's some sort of coincidence.
Well, that's just it. l'm not.
For a city morgue worker, you spend
a lot of time in the police blotter.
You know, now really isn't a good time.
MlCHELLE: <i>ShouId I caII you Iater?</i>
Maybe l could just call you.
Fine. The paper will find me wherever l am.
-l look forward to your call.
-Great.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Theme music]
Help me.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
TRU: l am not depressed. l'm just--
LlNDSAY: Single.
TRU: Linds, Luc and l
just weren't meant to be.
lf you ask me, he'll be begging
to get back with you any day now.
LlNDSAY: Anyway, l'd better run.
That's right, you've got
that beauty pageant thing today.
l still can't believe
you talked your firm into running it.
l know. They're also letting me pick
one of the judges, so l had this brainstorm.
Since they're looking for a regular girl...
who better to choose one
than a common man.
Don't tell me. Harrison.
MAN: And your girlfriend
knows nothing about this?
Not a thing. She trusts me completely.
-You're not getting cold feet now, are you?
-Me? Please.
With yours truly on the judges panel,
l can practically guarantee...
that your daughter
will be the next Miss Fresh Face.
''Practically''?
There're three judges on the panel.
l'm only one of them.
Listen, Harry,
Angela made it this far on her own.
MAN: Your proposal,
as creative as it may be...
is null and void should Angela finish
any lower than, let's say...
first place?
Marlon, be reasonable, man.
l am.
You pay me four large right now,
and l'm reasonable.
You make sure Angela wins,
l'm also reasonable.
Anything else, l'm not so reasonable.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Exhaling loudly]
TRU: Hey.
DAVlS: You're here early.
l'm not staying.
l want to return this to County Records.
-Your mom's autopsy report?
-Yeah.
-Anything new?
-No.
Standard B and E gone bad.
Single bullet, massive blood loss.
l only read it 15 times, and still think
there's something l must have missed.
Tru, if l may,
sometimes there is just a single bullet.
A lone gunman, a tragic death.
DAVlS: Sometimes, the truth
is exactly what it appears to be.
-What makes you say that?
-Eight years of working here.
l just wish l thought so, too.
See you tonight.
Yeah.
[Phone ringing]
Hello?
l knew it.
l knew this girl was gonna be trouble.
Two minutes before the pageant starts,
and this finalist drops out.
-Know what this means?
-You're one girl short?
Yeah, exactly.
Now l need to find a replacement.
Someone fabulous to fill in.
Someone fabulous, just like--
-Not a chance.
-Tru, come on.
Listen, someone who holds your hair
when you throw up, l'm your girl.
Need a ride to the airport? Look no further.
But beauty pageants
is where l draw the line.
-lt'll be fun.
-l'm so sorry, but it's just not happening.
LlNDSAY: <i>Thanks anyway, Tru.</i>
TRU: Bye.
Hello, and welcome to
the First Annual Miss Fresh Face Pageant.
[Audience applauding]
<i>Now Iet's join our judges</i>
<i>in weIcoming our first contestant.:</i>
<i>Miss AngeIa Todd.</i>
<i>AngeIa 's a recent graduate of OakviIIe....</i>
By the way, l was checking out
the contestants backstage.
Angela girl, very impressive.
Smart as a whip,
and quite the pleasing disposition.
ANGELA: <i>I Iike rock.</i>
But that's just me.
HOST: <i>Okay, AngeIa. If you couId have</i>
<i>dinner with any figure from history...</i>
<i>who wouId you have dinner with?</i>
<i>That's a good question, Chuck.</i>
<i>I'd have to say KeIIy CIarkson.</i>
[Audience gasping and murmuring]
HOST: <i>AngeIa, Iet me cIarify.</i>
<i>Any figure from history--</i>
<i>KeIIy CIarkson.</i>
Wow!
HOST: <i>AngeIa, thank you.</i>
[Audience clapping]
Wasn't she great?
Wow.
There is a girl with conviction!
An all too rare quality
in our young people today.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
Excuse me.
-Miss Walker?
-Yes, Mr. Barnes?
-We have a problem.
-We do?
-l am fired?
-l'm sorry, okay?
Julian Barnes said
you were playing favorites...
-trying to influence the other judges.
-That's crazy.
l know, but he's the boss.
But what about you and me,
and the sharing of your work...
and all that stuff?
Doesn't that count for anything?
Of course it does.
That's why l saved you a seat
right in the front row.
Perfect.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
LUC: Tru?
TRU: Luc.
l'm glad l ran into you, because
l wanted to talk to you about something.
ln person.
-ls everything okay?
-Yeah, it's just....
Look, this isn't easy to say,
but l'm gonna try.
lf you ask me, he'll be begging
to get back with you any day now.
Take your time.
These things are important.
Yeah, that's why l wanted to talk to you
face to face.
Now that we're not together anymore...
it's inevitable
we're gonna start dating other people.
LUC: And since we work together,
l know that could be awkward.
That's why l wanted you to know
that l'm going on a date tonight.
Oh.
l hope l did the right thing. l just didn't
want you finding out some other way.
No, of course. l appreciate that.
[Pager beeps]
Anyway, l should get to work.
lt's funny. We've known each other
for three months...
and this is the first time
l've left a conversation before you did.
[Mobile phone rings]
TRU: Hello?
HARRlSON: <i>It's me.</i>
And l need you now.
TRU: Can it wait?
HARRlSON: <i>Yeah...</i>
-if you want to see me in a full body cast.
-l'll be there as soon as l can.
Sorry, but l've got to run.
Why aren't l surprised?
HOST: <i>She graduated with honors</i>
<i>from the IocaI community coIIege...</i>
<i>and Jackie majored in education.</i>
Let me get this straight.
You convinced your girlfriend...
to make you a judge
in order to rig the voting...
so the daughter of your loan shark
would finish first?
You know,
that's a very poorly constructed sentence.
l hardly know what you're talking about.
Fine, yes. That's why
l need to borrow $4,000 from you.
l don't have $4,000.
l figured. So, l don't know, $40
and tomorrow's winning lottery numbers?
HOST: <i>Now teII us, Jackie, why shouId you</i>
<i>be the next Miss Fresh Face?</i>
[Stutters]
<i>I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Okay. Moving right aIong.</i>
That poor girl.
These pageants can be rough.
Yeah, and l thought l had problems.
Let me ask you, if you don't pay this guy,
what would he do to you?
l'll put it this way.
l may be asking for your help tonight
from beyond.
Harrison.
l'm joking.
You start saving dead people, and
suddenly you lose your sense of humor.
Don't worry. l'll think of something.
[Funky instrumental music]
[Soft instrumental music]
-l'm having a really nice time.
-Me, too.
This might sound like a strange question...
but you have no reason to run off
in the middle of the meal, do you?
No. Not unless you ask me to.
How about we make a deal?
LUC: l won't ask you, if you don't volunteer.
WOMAN: Sounds perfect.
<i>Okay, Iadies and gentIemen.</i>
<i>And the votes are in</i>
<i>from our remaining judges.</i>
<i>Now, the first runner-up...</i>
<i>who wiII step in shouId our winner</i>
<i>be unabIe to perform her duties is...</i>
Don't say ''Angela Todd.'' Do not say--
<i>...Miss AngeIa Todd!</i>
[Angela screams]
[Audience applauds]
Oh, crap.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
<i>And the officiaI new face</i>
<i>of JuIian Barnes Cosmetics...</i>
<i>winner of the cash prize,</i>
<i>the modeIing contract...</i>
<i>and the Iifetime suppIy of cosmetics is...</i>
<i>Miss AIex ReynoIds!</i>
[Alex gasps]
<i>We're aII as excited</i>
<i>to have Miss ReynoIds aboard as you are.</i>
<i>But what do you say we give her a chance</i>
<i>to freshen up before taking more photos?</i>
Seriously. My makeup must be a mess.
Thank you.
HOST: <i>Thank you, Iadies and gentIemen.</i>
-All right, we're out of here.
-What's up?
Let's just say some people
have some major anger issues.
We can't get out this way.
-Why not?
-Because we need a pass.
Excuse me, Frank.
l was a judge, remember?
HARRlSON: Come on.
Man, l was so close. All l had to do
was convince the other two...
and l would've been....
Hey, track star, pick up the pace here.
You should stop borrowing money
and getting into these situations.
Okay, Dad.
[Girl screams]
-Did l imagine that or....
-l think it came from over there.
l don't know if right now is a good time
to be taking the scenic route.
[Tense instrumental music]
What happened?
lt's Jackie.
She was like this when l came in.
TRU: Go call the police now.
So she's....
Dead.
They just always seem to find you,
don't they?
Unfortunately, yes.
So, is....
-So, is now when it happens?
-What?
When she asks for help. The dead chick.
l don't know when it happens.
lt just happens.
Do me a favor. Go stand outside the door.
We need to keep the crime scene intact.
Sorry, but l have got to see this.
There's no guarantee it's gonna happen.
Even if it does,
you won't remember it tomorrow...
because it wouldn't have happened yet.
Yeah....
l think l'm just gonna wait outside.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
Help me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
TRU: [On machine] <i>Hey, it's Tru.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>
MlCHELLE: <i>Hi, this is MicheIIe Carey</i>
<i>at the</i> Post Dispatch.
Tell you what.
Since l seem to have missed you at home,
why don't l just give you a call at work?
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Just once.
Just once l'd like to go somewhere
and have everyone stay alive.
ls that too much to ask?
-You really want me to answer that?
-No, actually l don't.
-What do you know about the victim?
-Not much.
Just that she broke down and ran off
during her Q and A section.
Well, those questions can be tough.
So l'm told.
Anything on the body?
There was some nasty discoloration
under her eyes.
-Puffy?
-More like burned.
Doesn't ring any bells, but l'll look into it.
Let me know. First things first,
l've got to convince Jackie to drop out.
Not like she's gonna win anything tonight.
What, and shatter her dreams
of becoming Miss Fresh Face?
No, l'm gonna save her life.
Hey.
lf a reporter named Michelle Carey calls
looking for me...
just don't answer any questions.
Questions? What kind of questions?
The kind we don't want to answer.
That kind. Right.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
l'm going on a date tonight.
Hey, Tru, l was hoping l'd run into you.
-Yeah?
-Yeah, the reason is--
Actually, there's something that
l've been wanting to talk to you about.
Okay.
lt's just now that
we're not together anymore...
it's inevitable
we'll start dating other people.
TRU: And us working together,
things might get awkward.
l just wanted to let you know
that it's fine with me.
Really?
l just hope you find someone
that makes you happy.
l just hope you find someone
that makes you happy.
But l thought that, l mean....
-l got to run.
-Go. Yeah, right.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Tru.
l was just gonna call you. This is so perfect.
Really? What's going on?
One of the girls just dropped out,
two minutes before the pageant.
-And l need someone fabulous to fill--
-l'm in.
-Really?
-Yeah, whatever you need.
Wow, l'm shocked. l totally thought
it was gonna be a long shot.
So should l get backstage?
-Yeah, l'll get you a pass. Just wait here.
-Okay.
TRU: Hey, Harr.
HARRlSON: What are you doing here?
You know, stuff.
Don't tell me.
So, who kicked it? Me?
What, was l the one?
No, not you. One of the girls.
-Don't tell me it was Angela Todd.
-Her name's Jackie.
[Exclaims]
Man, can you believe it?
Murder at Lindsay's fashion show...
-where l'm a judge and you're--
-A contestant.
Oh, my God.
You?
[Exclaims]
l'm sorry, l didn't....
-lt's the only way to get close to her.
-Yeah.
TRU: While you're having a good laugh...
let me just mention
that your little scheme isn't gonna work.
What's that?
Fixing a beauty pageant for
your loan shark? What were you thinking?
lt's hard enough saving these people...
without always having
to bail your ass out of trouble.
But that's our thing, right?
Just try not to be so obvious.
You got yourself kicked off
the judging panel yesterday.
Good to know.
Okay, come on, let's get you backstage.
[Rock instrumental music]
So this is the replacement?
-Yeah, Tru.
WOMAN: l need you to get into your dress
for the first round. Eveningwear.
This was so last-minute.
l don't have a dress.
JACKlE: You can borrow one of mine.
[Tense instrumental music]
Help me.
-Thanks.
-Don't worry about it.
Couldn't decide, so l brought four.
lt sounds like a plan.
Okay, let's kick it into high gear, girls.
TRU: Hi, l'm Tru.
JACKlE: Jackie.
l heard a rumor there was a late entry.
So you must be the new girl?
Nice to meet you.
So what, you just decided over breakfast
that you wanted to be Miss Fresh Face?
Actually, yeah.
ALE<i>X</i>: Unbelievable.
ALE<i>X</i>: They'll let anybody into these things.
-ls she always so warm?
-Afraid so.
But it's not just Alex. lt's all of them.
l guess catty competition's
just not my thing.
l thought it could be fun,
but these girls will do anything to win.
HOST: <i>Before we start,</i>
<i>I'd Iike to introduce you to our judges.</i>
<i>PIease weIcome</i>
<i>the CEO of JuIian Barnes Cosmetics...</i>
<i>Mr. JuIian Barnes!</i>
[Audience claps]
<i>Our next judge is a former spokesmodeI</i>
<i>who, if you ask me...</i>
<i>Iooks Iike she shouId be back here</i>
<i>with the rest of our finaIists.</i>
<i>I know JuIian thinks so,</i>
<i>and that's why he married her!</i>
<i>Ladies and gentIemen,</i>
<i>pIease weIcome Adrian Barnes!</i>
[Audience claps]
<i>And our man on the street,</i>
<i>Mr. Harrison Davies.</i>
There's something l got to tell you,
and it's gonna sound weird, but--
Come on, you look so serious
all of a sudden. Let's talk inside.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Tyler? What are you doing here?
-Jackie, l uh, look, l missed you and...
-l told you not to come.
TYLER: Just listen to me, okay?
JACKlE: Go away!
-The least you can do is give me a chance.
-Tyler, there is nothing left to say.
l live here now. This is my home.
You have to go.
No, l'm not leaving. l came
halfway across the country to see you.
ls there a problem in here?
Please. Just leave.
TYLER: But--
GUARD: You heard the lady.
-Probably a good idea.
-Don't bother.
GUARD: This way, sir.
TYLER: l'll find my way out.
My ex. Not exactly a clean break.
l moved here to start over.
l never thought he'd come looking for me.
Trust me, men are never predictable.
-Here, try this one. lt'll look great on you.
-Thanks.
HOST: <i>Last question.:</i>
<i>If you couId have dinner....</i>
-What did he do?
-Nothing. ln fact, he's been quite pleasant.
The problem is it's come to my attention
that Mr. Davies' sister...
has been slotted in as an alternate.
Conflict of interest.
-So, l should....
-Can him.
[Audience clapping in the background]
Am l in the right place?
l was told to speak with Tru Davies.
[Stutters]
Actually, she's not here.
But l'd like to help you.
l could help you. Or not.
l need to pick up a death certificate
for a relative of mine.
-Actually, you'd have to go through--
-County Records, right?
l was there all morning.
When they finally got around to helping...
they said they'd lost the original
and to come here for a new one.
Unfortunately, any request
for a new certificate has to go through--
Please don't tell me
l have to go back to County Records?
MlCHELLE: l'm already four hours
late for work.
Well, l guess we could bend the rules
just this once.
-l'm sorry about your loss, Miss....
-Park. Susan Park.
[Slow instrumental music]
<i>Now, Jackie's wearing a stunning design...</i>
<i>from the JuIian Barnes coIIection</i>
<i>of fine formaIwear.</i>
ALE<i>X</i>: l hope she's kidding with that ass.
Ouch!
Big much?
What's between you two, anyway?
The only thing between me and Jackie
is the crown.
No one else stands a chance against me.
No offense.
lt's just a contest. lf you don't win,
it's not the end of the world.
You so don't get it.
<i>Winning something Iike this</i>
<i>puts a girI on the map.</i>
TRU: To where?
Mini-malls of the Eastern Seaboard?
Got to start somewhere.
And a word of advice.
lf l got into the finals because
my best friend was running the show...
maybe l wouldn't talk so much.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Audience applauding]
Hey.
-You looked really great out there.
-Thanks.
l've been thinking about what you said
about these girls, this whole thing.
And the truth is, l feel the same way.
So here's an idea. Let's drop out.
-Excuse me?
-l'm serious. Let's get out of here.
We could be halfway through a pizza
before they even know we're gone.
lt's tempting, l have to admit.
But l signed up for this thing,
and l should see it through.
lt can't get any worse, right?
Anyway, you being here is proof
that not all the competition is so bad.
There's something that
l didn't get a chance to tell you before--
l know. l walk too fast.
And if l'm not careful,
l'm gonna take a nasty spill in these heels.
No, that's not it. lt's something else.
TRU: About tonight.
HOST: <i>Tru Davies.</i>
l don't know how to tell you this, but--
HOST: <i>Tru Davies?</i>
Talk later. Walk now. Go.
Good luck.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
HOST: <i>Ladies and gentIemen, Tru's</i>
<i>a Iate entry into our IittIe pageant here.</i>
<i>But I'm sure she's as deserving</i>
<i>a candidate as we've seen here tonight.</i>
[Fast-paced instrumental music continues]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Fast-paced tense instrumental music]
TYLER: This is why l wanted you
to come home with me.
l always thought l'd propose to you
once we got there...
but after we argued this morning,
l figured it was now or never.
So, what do you say, Jacks?
l want to.
And l love you, Ty, more than anything.
But l need some time to think about it.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
Whatever you need.
l'm not going anywhere.
DAVlS: Here we are: Terrance Park,
6<i>8</i> years old, massive coronary.
Korean male.
Uncle by marriage.
lt says here the original certificate
was signed by a Jessica Park.
My cousin.
She was gonna come with me today...
but it was so hard for her to come here
the first time.
-lt's never easy coming to the morgue.
-And yet you do it every day.
You must be a very strong person...
working here all alone,
surrounded by death.
Well, actually l oversee a small staff.
[Exclaims]
Tru, right? My cousin said
she dealt with somebody by that name.
Yeah.
Actually, l should go
get you the new certificate.
l'm not in any hurry.
Besides...
l like talking to you.
Yeah.
[Soft instrumental music]
Are you okay?
This might sound like a strange question...
but you're not gonna run off somewhere
in the middle of dinner, are you?
-Not unless you want me to.
-No, l don't. No, not at all.
'Cause that's one thing l can't stand...
when a girl just ups and leaves
right in the middle of a meal, because my--
Ex used to do that.
-Did l mention that already?
-Three times.
Look, Tabitha,
you seem like a really great girl.
The truth is l thought l was ready
to start dating again...
but maybe l'm just not.
Great. Maybe you could've thought of that
before you asked me out.
You know what? Here, watch me run out
in the middle of the meal.
TABlTHA: This was a waste of a night.
MAN: What did he do?
<i>KeIIy CIarkson.</i>
[Audience laughs]
<i>Okay, AngeIa, thank you.</i>
[Audience applauds]
<i>And now for our next contestant,</i>
<i>Tru Davies!</i>
[Applause continues]
HOST: <i>So, Tru, your bio says...</i>
<i>that you work the night shift in a morgue?</i>
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>
<i>So teII us, how do you spend your time...</i>
<i>when you're not out tagging toes?</i>
[Tense instrumental music]
<i>I heIp peopIe.</i>
HOST: <i>So, voIunteer work?</i>
TRU: <i>You couId say that.</i>
JULlAN: Alex, this is the last time
l'm gonna ask you, do you understand?
<i>Did you bring it or not?</i>
ALE<i>X</i>: lt's here somewhere.
l can't give it to you. At least, not yet.
JULlAN: l haven't got time for this.
l shouldn't be out here...
JULlAN: in the middle of a Q and A.
ALE<i>X</i>: Careful, Jules.
The judges take off for bruising.
You know you could go out there
with two black eyes and still win.
l knew that tape would persuade you.
Don't worry,
you've got all the votes you need.
That's all l wanted to hear.
[Fast-paced tense instrumental music]
You're up next.
<i>Tru, in 50 words or Iess...</i>
<i>teII us why you shouId be</i>
<i>the next Miss Fresh Face.</i>
<i>I wish I couId, Chuck, but I'm kind of</i>
<i>on a tight scheduIe. Thanks.</i>
-What was that all about?
-lt's just the crowd. l got nervous.
Too bad, because
l think the judges like your look.
HOST: <i>It's the one and onIy</i>
<i>Miss Jackie Connors. Let's give her....</i>
Speaking of judges, where's Harrison?
Speaking of judges, where's Harrison?
-Yeah, l sort of had to fire him.
-You what?
Once you entered,
there was a conflict of interest.
lt wouldn't have been fair
to keep him on the panel.
HOST: <i>Now teII us, Jackie, why shouId you</i>
<i>be the next Miss Fresh Face?</i>
<i>I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm sorry.</i>
Okay.
Guess l don't have to worry
about her anymore.
HOST: <i>Our next contestant is....</i>
l thought you said
she was your main competition.
Not after that performance.
Right now, she'd be lucky to beat you.
[Tense instrumental music]
All this paperwork....
l bet you don't get out on many dates.
Actually, women kind of think l'm strange.
[Computer beeps]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
-Everything okay?
-Yes.
-Can you excuse me a second?
-Yeah.
TRU: Hello?
DAVlS: <i>Hey, it's me.</i>
l just heard back from the tox lab,
and the discoloration around the eyes...
is consistent with the topical application
of an organophosphate.
DAVlS: <i>Most IikeIy</i>
<i>a pesticide of some sort.</i>
You're saying she died
because someone rubbed it on her skin?
DAVlS: <i>Organophosphate is</i>
<i>a powerfuI nerve agent...</i>
and once it gets into the nervous system,
it shuts the lungs down.
-lt's instant asphyxiation.
-Lovely.
DAVlS: What about you? Any suspects?
TRU: <i>I had two, and now it's none.</i>
What happened?
l thought it was the angry boyfriend,
but he was only looking to propose.
Then it was another contestant,
but Jackie just bombed the Q and A...
<i>so she's not a threat to anyone.</i>
There's got to be someone.
TRU: <i>That's the thing. There isn't.</i>
Jackie's one of the sweetest girls
l've ever met. No one wants to hurt her.
And she's gonna be murdered
in the next 30 minutes.
l got to go. l'll be in touch.
Exactly who's going to be murdered
in the next 30 minutes?
[Slow instrumental music]
Hey, l saw what happened out there.
l just wanted to make sure you were okay.
-l'm leaving.
-What?
This whole night is fake.
The girls look fake...
the winner is fake,
and absolutely none of it matters.
l wanna help you, but l need you to tell me
exactly what's going on.
lt's Alex.
She's got something on one of the judges.
-Some sort of tape or--
-She's blackmailing him?
JACKlE: To make sure
she's declared the winner.
Which means
nothing we did here today counted...
because the whole stupid thing was fixed.
Oh, God, look at me.
l'm all Tammy Faye.
l can't let Ty see me like this,
or he might take back his proposal.
And the discoloration around the eyes...
<i>is consistent with the topicaI appIication</i>
<i>of an organophosphate.</i>
Most likely a pesticide.
[Tense instrumental music]
Jackie, stop! Don't use that.
-Why not?
-Because it'll kill you.
Why would Alex's makeup remover kill me?
-Wait, this isn't yours?
-Mine's already packed.
l was just gonna borrow some of hers.
But if this is Alex's....
Oh, my God.
Then she was supposed to die yesterday,
not you.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
No offense, Tru,
but you're sort of freaking me out.
Sorry, it's just that
l think someone's trying to kill Alex.
Why would anyone want to kill her?
Aside from the fact
she's a total B-l-you-know-what.
You said she had some sort of tape
that she was using...
to blackmail one of the judges?
To win a third-rate beauty contest
is not exactly grounds for murder.
l don't think it's about the pageant.
l think it's about the tape.
Look, maybe all the pressure
is getting to you.
l don't know, but l think l'm gonna....
You know, l got to say,
l'm glad we met today.
<i>It was an absoIuteIy miserabIe time,</i>
<i>and I don't ever want to do it again.</i>
But having you around....
[Soft instrumental music]
lt made a world of difference.
MlCHELLE: l asked you a question.
Let's get you your certificate
and you can be on your way.
l don't want the certificate.
And my name isn't Susan Park.
You Michelle Carey?
l have nothing further to say to you.
-What do you not want me to know?
-Please leave.
ls it something do with her
mysterious appearance at crime scenes?
MlCHELLE: Her uncanny knack
for saving the lives of strangers?
Listen, you are so far off. This is ridiculous.
Then enlighten me.
Tell me what's really going on here.
Nothing is going on here.
-You're saying that l imagined all of this?
-Absolutely.
Then let me tell you something else
that l might have imagined.
l did a little research, and it turns out
Tru isn't the first young woman...
to mysteriously pop up in the nick of time
and save the lives of total strangers.
There was another before her.
l asked you to leave.
MlCHELLE: Tell Tru l'm sorry l missed her,
but l'll be sure to catch her another time.
[Tense instrumental music]
ALE<i>X</i>: [On TV] <i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>about this, Mr. Barnes.</i>
JULlAN: <i>I'II make you a deaI.:</i>
<i>You caII me JuIian...</i>
<i>and I'II caII you Miss Fresh Face.</i>
ALE<i>X</i>: <i>But I'm not Miss Fresh Face.</i>
JULlAN: <i>Not yet, but you wiII be.</i>
<i>-Promise?</i>
<i>-AbsoIuteIy.</i>
<i>Now why don't we drop the chit-chat?</i>
HOST: <i>And the officiaI new face</i>
<i>of JuIian Barnes Cosmetics is...</i>
<i>Miss AIex ReynoIds!</i>
[Alex gasps]
Oh, crap.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Big surprise?
l'm sorry there can only be
one Miss Fresh Face.
But we'd like you to try again next year.
Maybe next year l could bring a tape.
l don't understand.
Tell you what, l could arrange a screening.
Maybe that would help jog your memory.
-So, what do you want? Money?
-l want you to turn yourself in.
-For what?
-For trying to kill Alex tonight.
What the hell are you talking about?
Why would l hurt her? She won. lt's over.
You're right.
Your motive went away as soon
as she won the contest, but who....
<i>What do you say we give her a chance to</i>
<i>freshen up before taking any more photos?</i>
Your wife.
ALE<i>X</i>: Seriously.
My makeup must be a mess.
[Audience applauds]
l would stay here if l were you.
Unless Miss Fresh Face is okay
with having a corpse for a spokesmodel.
What?
Adrian didn't like that
you slept with her husband...
<i>so she added a speciaI ingredient</i>
<i>to your makeup remover.</i>
<i>Something that cIeanses</i>
<i>and kiIIs pesky bIackmaiIers.</i>
You poisoned my makeup?
What better way to kill a beauty queen?
You can't prove any of it.
Not my department.
But as soon as l turn over the evidence...
they're gonna have
plenty of questions for you.
Adrian, l had this handled.
What did you do?
She made a fool out of you, Julian,
and she made a fool out of me.
ADRlAN: After tonight,
her face would have been everywhere...
and l couldn't stand the thought of it.
[Slow instrumental music]
Two days!
l'll get you everything, plus interest!
Sorry, buddy, too late now.
Daddy, l was looking all over!
Sorry, baby.
l just had a little business to attend to.
<i>It's too bad about that contest--</i>
-l won!
-What?
l won!
That other girl was blackmailing a judge,
so they disqualified her.
-Do you mean....
-l'm Miss Fresh Face!
Yes!
ANGELA: The scholarship, the modeling
contracts, the free cosmetics! All mine!
ANGELA: l got to go call Mom !
MARLON: Yes.
[Marlon exclaiming]
That's just great.
l don't know what you did,
but l'm impressed.
Any time, baby.
Any time.
[Exclaims]
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Sighing]
[Sentimental instrumental music]
[Sentimental instrumental music]
-Hey.
-Hi.
-How'd your date go?
-Honestly, not so good.
The truth is
the whole time l was with Tabitha...
l couldn't stop thinking
of another girl l knew.
[Exclaims]
Hey, remind me again why we broke up.
Because l was unpredictable...
and because l ran off
in the middle of sentences.
Because l kept secrets.
-And that bothered me?
-lt did.
Maybe l overreacted.
Maybe l could learn to live
with those things.
No, you didn't. And you couldn't.
Because as much as l'd like to,
l'll never be able to change.
TRU: That's who l am.
That's who l'll always be.
And because of that,
l'll have to give up things.
Sometimes really great things.
l'm sorry, Luc.
-Don't be.
-No, l'm sorry for me.
[Sentimental instrumental music
continues]
-Hey, Davis.
-Hello.
You okay?
l will be, l guess. What about you?
Did that reporter ever call?
No. She came in.
Don't worry, l didn't say a thing.
Good. lt's just been a long day, you know?
l don't know if l could handle reading
about myself in the morning paper.
She does know something, though.
Something that l've known for a long time.
DAVlS: Not that she'll be able to prove it.
Maybe l should've told you sooner...
but l didn't want to confuse you even more.
-Davis.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Before you, there was someone else.
A woman. She relived days.
DAVlS: She could prevent death.
Once you asked me why l believe you...
how l readily accept what you can do.
And that's why.
Because l met her.
And as many times as you read her file,
it's never gonna be in there.
lt was your mother.
What you can do...
she could do it, too.
[Rock instrumental music]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
ELlSE: Hurry.
ELlSE: Tru, come on.
TRU: What's wrong, Mommy?
[Elise panting]
ELlSE: Come on, sweetie.
TRU: ls everything okay?
ELlSE: Shh!
Stay quiet now, Tru.
[Tense instrumental music]
MAN: Are you alone?
Yes.
MAN: Where's your daughter?
ELlSE: She's not here.
MAN: Good.
[Gunshot]
[Gasping]
TRU: l see Mom's face.
And then l hear it.
A man's voice and....
lt's 'cause Daddy's coming to town.
-The dream has nothing to do with Dad.
-Right.
Besides, Meredith says
he's only in town for a conference...
so the odds are
we won't even hear from him.
TRU: But there's something else.
HARRlSON: And that is?
[Slow instrumental music]
What l do...
going back, trying to save
these people from dying...
l think Mom could do it, too.
HARRlSON: Where did you get this?
TRU: Davis.
He was an assistant
the night they brought Mom in.
How does this freak-fest from a morgue...
become such an expert on our mother?
He talked to people, did research.
Besides, the question isn't how he knows,
but if he's right.
TRU: And if he is...
what am l going to find out next?
[Theme music]
Help me.
[Stomping]
DAVlS: There's this new technology
everybody's talking about.
lt's called a bed.
TRU: Sorry.
l haven't been sleeping very well lately.
Your shift's over. Why don't you go home
and get some real rest?
How ''over''?
l'm meeting Harrison and Meredith
at the diner in three minutes.
Rumor has it our father's in town.
This is Meredith's way of dealing.
DAVlS: Your father?
TRU: Yeah.
Just because none of us
has seen him in five years...
doesn't mean he still can't make us crazy.
So, you want to talk
about our father, right?
Actually, l was going to see
who wants to split the French toast.
WAlTRESS: Here you go.
TRU: Expecting someone?
Right. About that.
Well, you asked if l had anything
to say about Dad...
and so l brought someone...
who l thought could say it better.
His wife.
Jordan.
Well, it ain't breakfast, it's an ambush.
Don't blame Mere. This was my idea.
Anyway, l'm sure you all remember
this weekend is your father's birthday.
<i>And since he's in town for a conference...</i>
l convinced him
to let me throw him a party.
-Yeah.
-Here in his hometown.
And l thought
what could be more special for Richard...
than to spend his birthday with his kids?
-From which marriage?
-Harry, she's trying. Why can't you?
JORDAN: lt's just a small get-together.
TRU: l work nights.
Well, they let you out to eat, don't they?
[Rock music playing]
Just come tonight.
lsn't showing up the least you can do?
Funny, l thought the same thing
about my dad my last 10 birthdays.
JORDAN: Tru, l'm sorry, that's not--
TRU: For what?
For breaking up my parents' marriage,
or pretending it never happened?
You know, l just remembered
l got to be somewhere.
MEREDlTH: Tru.
You wouldn't believe it, but we get some
pretty questionable job applicants.
But you, on the other hand...
good school, six years of EMT experience.
This is pretty good.
-Some would say that you're overqualified.
-Some might say l'm late paying my rent.
Yeah.
Look, the reason l'm here is because
they say this is a decent place to work...
reasonable on-call hours, steady turnover.
[Slow, rhythmic instrumental music]
Well, you have done your homework.
l do have some other candidates
coming in...
-but l'll show you around the place.
-Great.
So, this is the sign-in room.
The hub of most of the activity.
DAVlS: Not today, obviously, but....
JACK: Right.
Do you guys use LFD
as your primary filing system?
DAVlS: Yeah.
Slow week.
Probably a good thing in our business.
You mind if l take something to drink
before l hit the road?
-No, not at all. lt's right there.
-Thanks.
DAVlS: Perfect timing.
<i>Odd and compIeteIy off scheduIe,</i>
<i>but perfect.</i>
l forgot these
when l took off this morning.
This is Mr. Harper.
He will be interviewing to replace Gardez.
Hey. Jack.
Hey. Tru.
You had to write it down?
Just so the functional illiterate
wouldn't drink my soda.
Right.
[Soda can pops open]
JACK: Can't be too careful...
what with the big soda shortage
l've been reading so much about.
And here l was thinking you didn't read.
Okay, you know what? l'll probably
make my decision by this afternoon.
JACK: Great.
Well, you know where to find me.
Excuse me.
Thanks.
DAVlS: That guy's going places.
TRU: Yeah.
Let's just hope
somewhere far, far away from here.
Are you all right?
Fine. l just don't get why
you'd want to hire someone like that.
l know you have a lot on your mind,
but are you sure...
that it's Jack that's bothering you?
[Slow instrumental music]
[Knocking on door]
Hey, Claire.
lt's Tru.
-l know who you are.
-lt's been a while, l wasn't sure.
Anyway, l'm looking for Jordan,
your mom.
She's not here.
Do you want to talk to my daddy?
TRU: No, that's okay.
CLAlRE: Dad.
RlCHARD: Yeah?
[Slow instrumental music continues]
Tru.
Hi, Dad.
lt's good to....
l was sure you'd be at your conference.
l was actually just looking for Jordan.
Claire, do me a favor.
Go keep an eye on your brother, will you?
Come in. Or are you in a hurry?
Jordan's actually running errands.
But she'll be at the party tonight.
Can it wait until then?
TRU: l don't know if l'll be able to make it.
You know, work.
Right.
Jordan told me
about your breakfast this morning.
And it will mean a lot to her
that you came here to apologize.
TRU: Apologize? No.
l might have been a little out of line.
l was upset.
With Jordan or with me?
l should go.
RlCHARD: Come tonight, okay?
TRU: lf l can.
Look at you.
You are so much like your mother.
lt was your mother.
What you can do, she could do, too.
Jordan, it's me again.
l don't know if you're still out...
or if you even have your cell phone
with you. Should l worry?
Call me.
<i>Thanks.</i>
[Jazzy instrumental music playing]
-Thought l'd make an appearance.
-l'm glad you did.
l can only stay for a minute.
Where's Jordan?
l'd still like to have that conversation.
Running late, as usual. She was supposed
to meet me here after her errands.
RlCHARD: Typical Jordan.
l'm sure she's just out
getting you a last-minute gift.
Yeah.
Come on.
[Exclaims]
RlCHARD: Look who's here.
LlNDSAY: Come on.
Harrison.
Hi.
l want to introduce you
to my lovely girl, Lindsay.
-Hi, Mr. Davies.
-You're Tru's friend from school, right?
Yep.
l don't think Harrison has ever formally
introduced me to anybody he's seeing.
lt wasn't really necessary before.
[Lindsay laughs nervously]
-Lindsay, let's go get drinks.
-Yeah. lt was good to see you again.
Seems like a nice girl, Lindsay.
-And here it comes.
-Don't get defensive.
l look at you,
and you've got so many options.
Why limit yourself?
Usually you save the advice
for the occasional Christmas card.
Don't waste
all your good material tonight.
What l'm trying to say, if you'll
let me finish, is that you're doing fine.
Just don't let this thing
with Lindsay confine you.
You're young. Keep your eyes open...
for what might otherwise pass you by.
[Slow, rhythmic instrumental music]
Well, just so you know...
it's kind of a now thing. lt's no big deal.
[Groans]
Good to know where we stand.
DAVlS: Hello.
TRU: Hi.
DAVlS: How was the party?
TRU: A bust.
The only reason l went was to apologize
to Jordan, who never showed up.
Listen, about your mother.
-l just wanted to say that--
-lt's okay.
l think l've had enough
big conversations for one day.
So how about the new guy?
When does he start, Mr. Mooch?
DAVlS: He doesn't.
l checked his references and....
He didn't check out?
DAVlS: No. lt turns out that Mr. Harper
has a nasty habit...
of not showing up for work. Permanently.
DAVlS: Until l called, his last three
employers had no idea where he was.
TRU: You're kidding.
DAVlS: So it looks like it's just you and me.
TRU: Who brought this one in?
DAVlS: Copland from County.
DAVlS: He's helping me
until l find a replacement.
DAVlS: Must've dropped it off
when l was on break.
DAVlS: lt looks like a mugging.
lt's multiple stab wounds.
Oh, God.
Jordan.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Somber instrumental music]
TRU: Dad, l'm....
l know.
You probably don't remember this,
but when your mother....
This is where we....
We could have her moved somewhere else
if it would make it easier.
lt's my fault.
RlCHARD: l shouldn't have let her go.
TRU: There's nothing you could've done.
Mugged.
God, if l could just have it
to do over again.
You should talk to them.
l will.
You know, there are pieces l remember
from the night Mom died.
<i>Things I wish I didn't.</i>
<i>And they don't have to be here.</i>
We're ready for you.
l'll keep an eye on the little ones.
lt's all right. l'll do this.
<i>You can wait out here.</i>
Let Daddy handle it.
[Somber instrumental music continues]
All right.
RlCHARD: Now what?
TRU: l'll take it from here.
-You sure you can....
-lt's my job.
Yours is to be with your children.
They're going to need their father.
What are you doing? Go home.
l'll cover this. l'm serious.
No one's giving out extra credit
for the bravest girl in the room.
Go on. Go home.
You cannot save everyone. Go.
Victim suffered multiple stab wounds
to the upper torso.
FEMALE VOlCE: <i>Tru.</i>
TRU: What?
l didn't say anything to you.
<i>Sex.: FemaIe.</i>
FEMALE VOlCE: <i>Tru.</i>
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Stop him.
My God, Davis, l'm so sorry.
DAVlS: The coffee's just really hot.
This is the third time this week
you've crashed out during your shift.
DAVlS: Why don't you--
TRU: Can't.
l've told you about my father's wife,
Jordan, right?
She's in town and sometime today,
she's going to be murdered.
-One of those days again.
-And about the Jack guy...
check his references before the interview
so you don't get your hopes up.
Okay. Where are you going now?
Believe it or not, l'm going to
spend the day with my stepmother.
Tru?
Jordan, hi. This is unexpected.
She wanted to see us
to talk about some things and--
That's funny,
because l was just telling someone...
how l thought it was time
you and l got to know each other better.
MERE: You were?
JORDAN: l would like that, Tru.
Which makes what l came to ask you
much easier.
Your father's birthday is this weekend
and l'm throwing a party for him.
TRU: l'll be there.
You said she'd probably walk out on me.
l'm thrilled, Tru. Thank you.
Excuse me, l'm going to wash up.
Okay, what's going on? Those are the first
polite words you've ever said to her.
l guess we're all full of surprises today.
HARRlSON: Hey, kids. What's cracking?
Jordan came by and told us she's throwing
a party for Dad tonight, and Tru--
-Told her off?
-Actually, Tru said she'd be there.
[Rock music playing]
She was killed? Come on, get out of here.
Why else do you think l'd hang out
with her? l don't have a choice.
She was killed, she asked for my help,
the day rewound...
and l'm stuck with her for the entire day.
We're going to go pick up Dad's cake.
l guess we'll see you guys later?
Mind if l come along?
You know, help with the party planning?
Of course. That'd be nice.
What do you know?
Could you excuse us for just one sec?
You can't tell me something like that
and just run off to some bakery.
-Do you need me to do something?
-l don't think so, not yet.
But when Dad asks you
about Lindsay tonight...
tell him how you really feel,
not what he wants to hear.
You'll be glad you did. Okay?
[Cell phone rings]
My office. l'll be right back.
So, Jordan, where to after this?
Back to the hotel
or you may be meeting someone else?
lt depends on how much time l have.
What kind of cake do you think
he's going to want this year?
Honestly, you've got the wrong girl...
if you're looking for intimate knowledge
of Richard Davies.
Then we have something in common.
What do you mean by that?
Tru, l love your father.
[Soft instrumental music]
And l might even understand him.
But that doesn't necessarily mean
that l know him.
l think that he only ever let
one person in completely...
and that was your mother.
So the rest of us,
we just take what we can get.
CLERK: Can l help you?
JORDAN: We'll take the big chocolate one.
CLERK: Sure thing.
DAVlS: l see the bulk of your work
experience has been as an EMT.
DAVlS: Why the sudden desire
to change teams?
The truth is, l think l'd accomplished
everything l wanted to in that line of work.
l contacted all your previous employers...
and they all said the same thing,
that you were good at the job...
but one day you didn't show up.
Just disappeared.
DAVlS: ls there anything you want to say
about that?
A couple of years ago...
l died.
Excuse me?
l was at a scene working on a kid
about nine years old.
He had a gunshot to the back.
We'd just gotten a pulse...
and l guess someone didn't want the kid
to make it.
He started firing.
l caught the bullets instead.
l remember...
it felt like a bee sting
on the back of my neck, right here.
Three minutes and 2<i>8</i> seconds.
That's how long my heart stopped.
And then, l came back.
And what was that like?
You know, they say an experience
like that changes you.
lt should make you want to live every day
to the fullest.
But for me, it just....
[Melancholic instrumental music]
l lost it.
l knew something had to give.
lt just didn't feel right....
lt just didn't feel right
entrusting lives to my unsteady hands.
l thought a change of location would help.
lt didn't.
l'm hoping a change of vocation will.
Some would say once you survive
something like that...
that you were brought back for a reason.
l guess we'll see.
l love cutting through the park.
lf it stays like this,
it may be nice living here.
Are you sure
you don't want to just take a cab?
l know you have a lot to do today.
No, we're just going a few blocks.
[Lightly suspenseful instrumental music]
l just want to let you know l really
appreciate you giving me a chance today.
You know,
your father and l don't fight very often...
but when we do, it's usually about
his relationship with the three of you.
Really?
For what it's worth,
l think his distance comes from guilt.
About how he dealt with what happened.
But he's different now.
JORDAN: He wants to make things right.
He's changed.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
JORDAN: He's a different man, Tru.
TRU: Jordan, go!
[Man grunts]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Gasping]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Now we know why we left the city.
They can talk all they want
about the shrinking crime rate.
You know, l think l'm going to lie down
a bit, before the party.
Close my eyes.
Hey.
JORDAN: Thank you.
<i>Who knows what couId've happened</i>
<i>if you hadn't been there?</i>
-l'm just glad you're okay.
-Thanks.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
RlCHARD: Boy, never a dull moment.
RlCHARD: lf not the little ones, it's Jordan.
-Luckily, she's fine.
-Luckily, you were with her.
She's sweet, Dad.
l probably should've noticed that sooner.
TRU: l'd probably better get going--
lt's nice that you stopped blaming her.
Blame her? For what?
Me and your mother.
Look, Dad, l'm glad that l could
help Jordan, but now is not the time.
No, it's not the time.
lt's long overdue. Sit down.
When l met Jordan, yes,
your mother and l were still married.
l'm pretty clear on that part.
But we had already decided
to get a divorce.
What?
Why didn't l know this before?
Because you didn't want to.
RlCHARD: l loved your mother, Tru,
but the fact is...
we grew apart.
She became distant, unreliable.
She'd run off at a moment's notice...
at very odd hours, flimsy excuses.
lt was like she was living some....
Secret life.
The truth is, when l met Jordan,
l'd been alone for years.
[Sentimental instrumental music
continues]
But l've said enough.
Too much, probably.
RlCHARD: Today is not a day
for living in the past.
<i>I'II see you tonight, won't I?</i>
lt would mean the world to Jordan
if you would make an appearance.
And it would to me, as well.
[Jazzy instrumental music playing]
-Hey, you made it.
-l did.
-Hi, you look beautiful.
-So do you.
Please, l stopped looking beautiful
two children ago.
So, this is Tru. Richard's daughter.
The one l told you about.
Jordan's been singing your praises
all night.
So, if you'll excuse us,
l have a lot of people l want you to meet.
Come here.
Harrison.
Dad.
l want to introduce you
to my girl, Lindsay.
-Mr. Davies.
-Aren't you Tru's friend from school?
LlNDSAY: Yeah.
There's Tru. lt was nice to see you again.
She seems like a nice girl.
She is.
One of the nicest ones l've met
in a long time.
That's good to hear.
But at your age, Harrison--
Yeah, at my age, you met Mom.
Now you wouldn't consider that a mistake,
would you?
No, absolutely not.
Think about it.
You have three wonderful kids.
lf you haven't noticed.
Yeah, l see your point.
[Slow, rhythmic instrumental music]
God, you are so unexpected sometimes.
[Lindsay chuckling]
[Glasses clinking]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
TRU: Dad?
RlCHARD: What?
-He's here.
-Who? What are you talking about?
The man from the park
who attacked Jordan. He's here.
Or at least he was.
He's here now?
That means it wasn't random.
He's looking for her.
l'm going to call the police.
Don't let Jordan out of your sight.
[Suspenseful instrumental music
intensifies]
TRU: Excuse me.
You...
what do you want with her?
The daughter's always the last to know.
MAN: Where's your daughter?
[Gunshot]
lt was you. You killed my mother.
What do you want from us?
HARRlSON: What's up?
Dad said something was going down
with Jordan.
-He was here.
-The man who mugged Jordan is here?
-The man who killed Mom.
-What?
lt's the same person.
Go find Jordan, make sure she's okay.
Harrison, go. Hurry up!
[Harrison grunts]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
RlCHARD: You've gone way too far
this time.
RlCHARD: l told you the last time,
this is over. You understand?
RlCHARD: l never want to see you again.
[Fast-paced instrumental music continues]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Tru!
RlCHARD: Wait.
-Will you give me a chance to explain?
-You knew him.
This is not what you think.
You don't want to know
what l think right now.
Yeah, l know him. He's an ex-con,
and his name is Carl Neesan.
-And you know that because?
-l was the one who convicted him.
l was an ADA 15 years ago.
He was a kid up on a murder rap.
He said he was innocent,
which they all do.
The evidence was flimsy, but l was out
to impress, so l went after him.
And was he guilty?
The jury said he was.
That was good enough for me.
At the sentencing, he swore revenge...
and he said if he ever got out,
he would make me pay.
Why today?
Why today, of all days, does he show up?
You think this is the first time?
This has been going on for years.
He shows up, he demands money.
He threatens retribution, so l pay him...
and he goes away. Until the next time.
And today?
RlCHARD: Today l told him it had to stop.
l wasn't going to pay.
l never thought that he would
follow through with his threat.
God, l never wanted to get you involved
in this. Not you, not Jordan.
And what about Mom?
What does your mother
have to do with this?
He killed her.
-He killed Mom.
-Why would you say that?
l was there.
[Somber instrumental music]
-No, sweetheart--
-l heard his voice.
l will never forget that voice.
He killed Mom because he was angry
with you. He wanted revenge.
Tru, no.
Don't tell me no, l saw him.
l was there, l saw him pull the trigger.
That's not what happened.
-How can you tell? He said he--
-lt's not!
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
You don't think his was the first name
l thought of?
RlCHARD: The police investigated this
thoroughly, and said this was not the man.
Airtight alibi.
''Not your man, Mr. Davies.''
But l heard his voice.
But did you see his face?
No.
[Melancholic instrumental music]
We live with the question long enough,
we want an answer.
So our mind plays tricks on us
and makes us think we've got one.
But we don't.
-Come on, it's cold. Let's go inside.
-No, l can't. l've got to go to work.
-Tonight?
-They're expecting me. l should go.
[Melancholic instrumental music continues]
Happy birthday, Daddy.
Don't you think
you've been through enough?
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?
Sleep. That's a novel concept.
lf Neesan didn't kill my mother,
then is it true?
What?
That her death had something to do
with her calling.
Despite what you might think...
l don't have all the answers.
But l'll promise you this,
l'll help you find them.
Thanks, Davis.
But for now, l'm going to take you up
on your first offer.
l'm going to go home, draw a bath,
and try and get some sleep.
l guess you didn't hire Jack after all.
Actually, l did.
l decided to go with my gut.
-That's weird.
-What's that?
Well, yesterday he took my soda.
This one with my name on it.
And today, it's still here.
You know how many ways
you can alter fate.
<i>Yesterday you met him, today you didn't.</i>
lt's impossible to predict
how that might alter things.
Yeah, l guess.
Just give him a chance.
l think you'll be happy that you did.
He's next door.
TRU: lt'll get easier.
JACK: What's that?
This. Doing what we do.
TRU: All these people.
Taken before their time.
Sometimes it just doesn't seem fair.
Never really thought about it.
That's one way to deal, l guess.
But if you ever want to talk,
sometimes it helps.
You know what l think is unfair?
When tubes and machines
keep people alive.
When life is prolonged
beyond its usefulness.
That's what's unfair.
-Yeah, l guess.
-l'll be honest with you. For my money...
l think that death
was one of the fairest things...
that ever happened
to some of these people.
You said you hadn't thought about it.
You caught me.
Anyway, l just wanted to say welcome.
l'm Tru.
-Like the name on the soda can.
-Yeah, that's right.
Jack.
[Slow instrumental music]
And, um...
And thanks for making me feel
so welcome.
lt's never easy being the new guy.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Crashing]
lt feels familiar, doesn't it?
[Neesan screams]
[Fast-paced instrumental music continues]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[Tru gasping]
-You okay?
-Yeah.
-Don't move. Stay here.
-Dad, no, he'll kill you. He killed Mom.
l don't care what the cops say,
l swear it's him.
l believe you.
And that's why this has to end.
TRU: No, Dad.
RlCHARD: Lock the door, wait here for me.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Both grunting]
You're growing a conscience
in your old age, Richard?
-Who the hell do you think you are?
-The man you paid to kill your first wife.
-At least, if l remember correctly.
-We had a deal. l pay you, you go away.
You didn't honor it, so now it ends.
Now, l mentioned the letter, right?
The letter detailing everything
that's sent to your daughter...
if l meet an untimely death?
[Tense instrumental music]
[Footsteps running]
Tru, go!
<i>Go!</i>
Now!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Gunshot]
[Tense instrumental music]
When we meet next,
there won't be any warning shot...
there won't be any chase down an alley.
lt's just going to be
a bullet through your heart.
Goodbye, Carl.
Did you.... ls he....
[Shushing]
RlCHARD: lt's over, sweetheart.
lt's over.
RlCHARD: Daddy's taken care of it.
[Ominous instrumental music]
[Rock music]
[Upbeat rock instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
TRU: Hello?
DAVlS: <i>Tru, it's 1.:00. Are you up?</i>
l am now. You know l work
the graveyard shift, right?
lt's Jack's orientation.
You have to show him around.
Don't tell me you forgot.
No, Davis, l didn't forget.
l'm just running a bit late.
Okay. She's running late.
[Slow rock instrumental music]
Okay, we can start over here.
This is the digital autopsy capture.
First we--
Scan the body with the camera
for any visible signs of trauma...
then enter the name and case number
into the database.
Right. Exactly.
Okay. Over here,
this is the live scan machine.
Used to log fingerprints,
flat panel to take hand impressions.
-l read the manuals.
-Good.
l wish someone had told me.
l wouldn't have gotten up so early.
Then we couldn't have spent
this quality time together.
And the truth is...
-there are a couple of things l don't know.
-Such as?
Such as, do you like working here?
The reason l ask is you don't look like
your average morgue attendant.
Yeah? And what do l look like?
You look like a girl
who takes things way too seriously.
JACK: Someone who should be
enjoying life...
but probably spends Friday nights
home alone watching TV...
eating a microwave dinner.
Should l bag the personals?
l don't spend every Friday night at home.
l mean....
Well, anyways,
what do you do on Friday nights?
Why don't you tell me?
Well, you don't stay in. That's for sure,
because that'd mean you'd be alone...
and you're not a guy
who's very keen on being alone.
So you go out to a bar or a club.
And after a few hours,
you return home, sometimes solo...
but usually with some nameless,
faceless, shameless girl...
who just doesn't understand you.
TRU: But either way,
by the end of the night...
you're alone, in front of the TV,
eating a microwave dinner.
l don't own a microwave.
[Jack chuckling]
But you still haven't answered
my question.
Do you like it here?
Actually, l do.
l understand.
You do? Because not everyone does.
That's because most people believe
that only the living need help.
[Gunshot firing]
[Electronic beeps]
BOY #1 : Hand them over. Right now!
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
-Can l help you?
-You sure can.
Open the safe under the counter
and fill it up.
We don't have a safe.
[Woman screaming]
ROBBER: Open it or she dies!
WOMAN: Please do what he says!
[Tense instrumental music]
Now!
[Theme music]
Help me.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
-Harrison Davies?
-Yeah.
MlCHELLE: Are you Tru Davies' brother?
HARRlSON: Who wants to know?
Michelle Carey, <i>Post Dispatch.</i>
Right, Tru told me all about you.
l have a couple of questions
about your sister.
MlCHELLE: She's been
at a series of crime scenes.
l was wondering
if you've anything to say about that.
Sorry, Michelle, l don't talk to the media.
They tend to make me a little nervous,
you know?
HARRlSON: But l'll tell Tru
you were asking about her.
TRU: Harry, what a surprise.
You know me, l am full of them.
This is my brother, Harrison. This is Jack.
JACK: Jack Harper.
HARRlSON: Nice to meet you.
JACK: You, too.
HARRlSON: You got a sec?
TRU: Yeah.
HARRlSON: Check.
HARRlSON: l ran into
that reporter, Michelle.
TRU: And?
HARRlSON: Didn't say a word.
MAN: [On TV] <i>The gunman Ieft</i>
<i>the Lion's Lair Arcade at 2.:00 p.m...</i>
<i>and reIeased a hostage shortIy after.</i>
<i>We'II have more....</i>
TRU: So, what's up?
l just wanted to check in,
make sure you're doing okay.
Yeah, l'm fine. Why?
The whole thing with Dad
shooting the guy who killed Mom.
Yeah, l'm dealing with it the best l can.
[Solemn instrumental music]
You know, they haven't found the body.
You gotta hand it to the old man.
He really took care of things.
So is that the only reason you stopped by?
Well, now that you mention it...
it's me and Lindsay's
three-month anniversary.
l'm shocked you remembered.
l don't think it's a big deal,
but it means a lot to her.
So l booked reservations
at Le Petite Fleur....
-Whatever it is she's talking about.
-Good. She'll love that.
The problem is l'm a little tapped out.
HARRlSON: But if you
could float some cash my way...
l can make sure that
your best friend, Lindsay...
has a night that she'll never forget.
[Jazzy instrumental music]
Lucky it's payday.
TRU: Here.
Pretty expensive restaurant.
Of course, l should valet the car.
-Yeah, street parking. Not a problem.
-Get out.
Yeah, l'm going.
You are the best.
MAN: [On TV] <i>And they're off.</i>
That's it, baby! Go! Come on, Eight Ball!
Hold on! Come on, Eight Ball.
Come on, go!
MAN: [On TV] <i>Now Aidan's Luck swings up</i>
<i>on the outside.</i>
Do it for daddy, baby! Come on.
MAN: [On TV] <i>It's Eight BaII bringing</i>
<i>to a narrow Iead.</i>
<i>And here comes Aidan's Luck.</i>
Just trying to parlay some cash
to bring the old lady out to a nice dinner.
MAN: [On TV] <i>Eight BaII, Aidan's Luck</i>
<i>neck-and-neck.</i>
HARRlSON: No!
MAN: [On TV] <i>As they hit the finish Iine,</i>
<i>Aidan's Luck by a nose.</i>
-Looks like you guys are eating in.
-God.
No, that's cool.
l still got one more race, win it all back.
[Jazzy instrumental music]
So, what do you think of
Hodge Podge and Nightcap?
Not much.
Look, l'm going with Deep Shaker.
Deep Shaker?
He's 20-to-1 .
Lots of luck with that, pal.
Hey, Tru.
TRU: What's up?
l just wanted to say thanks
for giving up your afternoon...
-to come in here and help me.
-lt's no problem.
-So we're okay, you and me?
-Yeah, why wouldn't we be?
l just want to make sure.
l didn't want to come off like a know-it-all.
-No, you didn't. Perfectly, well--
-Hey, Tru.
Oh.
Luc, hi.
[Tru stuttering]
This is Jack, the new forensics assistant.
Luc's a crime scene photographer.
-Nice to meet you.
-Same here.
So....
TRU: So, how have you been?
LUC: Fine.
-Busy.
-Me, too.
LUC: You always are.
Speaking of busy, l....
You know, head back.
Well, l'll see you around.
See you, Jack.
JACK: Nice to meet you.
LUC: You, too.
So how long did you two date for?
TRU: What?
JACK: Come on, l saw it.
The long lingering looks,
the unfinished sentences.
-What are you talking about?
-l think it was about two months.
And then things got complicated,
and you broke up.
Only, now you're wondering
if you did the right thing...
or just the easy thing.
Okay, yeah, something like that.
Now's the part
where you're gonna lay into me...
for being that girl
who's way too serious, right?
No.
l was gonna tell you l'm sorry things
didn't work out the way you wanted.
[Slow instrumental music]
-How did it go with Jack?
-Good, l think.
Did he mishandle equipment?
What did he do?
No, nothing like that.
He's a smart guy. He knows his stuff.
l just can't get a read on him,
for some reason.
lt's like one minute he's in your face
and almost obnoxious.
The next, he's charming,
trying to be your best friend.
He's just trying to get acclimated,
you know.
You remember your first few days here?
[Davis laughs]
Besides, we need the extra help,
especially with your other job.
TRU: Yeah, l guess.
Anyway, l've got to run.
l will see you tonight.
-Tonight?
-Yeah, Luc's show.
What show?
-[Stuttering] Never mind.
-Davis.
[Davis clearing throat]
Okay. Luc is having a photography show
at some gallery.
l'm sure it's no big deal.
l was only invited at the last minute.
No, it's fine. l mean, it's totally fine.
We broke up,
and l'm working tonight anyway.
-Did l mention it's fine?
-Yeah, three times.
-Well, it is. lt's completely and totally--
-Fine.
You didn't have to go to all this trouble
for just three months.
Although l'm so glad that you did.
l can't wait to order dessert. They have
this amazing chocolate soufflé here.
ls everything okay?
[Soft instrumental music playing]
Who? What's that?
Nothing. lt just looks like
you're planning an escape or something.
Oh, my God. Here, drink some water.
-Sir, are you all right?
-Oh, my God!
HARRlSON: A bone?
-This was in my veal. l almost choked!
-l'm terribly sorry, sir.
-Let me get you another dish.
-Another dish? And another bone?
HARRlSON: l don't think so, pal.
l'm sure the maitre d'
will take your meal off the bill.
-My meal? What about hers?
-Harrison, it's fine. You're fine.
We're happy to pay for my meal,
and thank you for everything.
Harrison, sit down.
[Lindsay sighs]
A fish bone? You ordered veal, you idiot.
Let me guess.
You don't have any money, do you?
lt's just one more chapter in the
Harrison Davies book of disappointments.
Who would've thought
that Deep Shaker would have won?
lt was a 20-to-1 shot. 20-to-1 !
MAN: [On TV] <i>In what is amounting</i>
<i>to a crime spree...</i>
MAN: [On TV] <i>In what is amounting</i>
<i>to a crime spree...</i>
<i>the gunman once again used a customer</i>
<i>as a human shieId...</i>
<i>when he heId up the Pharsyde</i>
<i>CIothing Store shortIy after 6.:00 p.m.</i>
<i>The fact there were no security....</i>
TRU: Hey, Linds, how was dinner?
LlNDSAY: <i>Great.</i>
Until your brother pretended to choke
on his entrée.
TRU: What?
LlNDSAY: <i>Trying to get his meaI comped...</i>
because he blew his money
at the track today.
You're joking, right?
LlNDSAY: <i>I know</i>
<i>his heart's in the right pIace...</i>
but l really think
l'm at the end of my rope with him.
He's my brother and l love him, but....
Anything you need?
Besides a chocolate soufflé?
Look, l'll call you tomorrow.
Okay. Bye.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
Harrison.
ls your brother in trouble?
Sorry, l couldn't help overhearing.
JACK: ls everything okay?
TRU: Just family stuff.
Siblings. They can get to you
like no one else.
You have brothers and sisters?
l had a sister.
She died a couple of years ago.
l'm so sorry.
Thanks. That's nice of you.
But l really feel like
she went to a better place.
<i>I know it sounds cIiché...</i>
but l really believe it's true.
She was sick, and then she wasn't.
[Melancholic instrumental music]
Anyway, l know what you're going through
with your brother.
You feel like he's your responsibility.
Tell me about it.
Still, sometimes you gotta let them
make their own mistakes.
Learn the hard way, you know?
JACK: Speaking of mistakes....
l had this soup from the vending machine.
Forgot about that on your tour.
Anywhere around here
a guy can get some edible food?
Yeah, the diner two blocks up isn't bad.
l was gonna get some takeout.
-l'll get you something.
-Only if l can pay.
Sounds like a deal.
[People chatting]
-Pickup for Davies.
-A couple more minutes.
Okay, l'll be right over there.
Hello, Tru.
[Mysterious instrumental music]
-Do l know you?
-Michelle Carey.
We almost spoke on the phone
a couple of times.
l've got nothing to say to you.
MlCHELLE: l ran into your brother today.
He wouldn't talk to me, either.
You've been dodging my calls
for over a month now.
l'm sure your boss told you
about our chat?
He also told me
that he kicked you out of the office.
Aborted suicides, murder attempts,
near accidents. All these rescues.
What have you to say about showing up
each time before the police do?
Or the fact that your mother
did the same thing?
TRU: What are you talking about?
Where are you getting all this?
Doesn't matter. Now is the time
to give your side of the story...
or you'll read about it
in the paper next weekend.
l'll go to print
whether l get a quote from you or not.
CASHlER: Order's up.
At first l thought you had
some sort of hero complex.
Setting up these near misses
so you could rescue people just in time.
-But you never took any credit.
-There's nothing to take credit for.
No one moves or she dies!
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Racy instrumental music]
Empty the register. Quick!
This guy hit two other places today.
He took a hostage each time,
then let them go.
Everyone shut up!
Fill it up.
l am not kidding. l'll kill her if you don't!
Police officer! Drop the gun!
[People screaming]
Somebody get us some help, hurry!
lt's gonna be okay, Michelle.
TRU: Here.
Hang on, Michelle.
Someone call <i>9</i>1 1, please!
Hang on, Michelle.
lt's gonna be okay. Come on.
Hurry, please!
[Racy instrumental music intensifies]
[Racy instrumental music ends abruptly]
God, no.
CASHlER: ls she....
Yeah.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
l need you.
[Phone ringing]
[Upbeat instrumental music]
-Hello?
-Tru, are you up?
-Because it's Jack's orientation today.
-Tell him l'll be right there.
Again.
DAVlS: Tru, to be honest,
this doesn't set a good example.
-Sorry, l didn't mean to keep you waiting.
-lt's okay, l'm not busy.
Good. Then, Davis, can l talk to you
for one sec? ln your office?
[Upbeat instrumental music]
-Okay.
-Be right back.
l'll be here.
Michelle, the reporter,
is the one who asked for help?
Unfortunately. But not before she had all
these questions about me saving people.
DAVlS: Was there anyone else hurt?
The gunman grabbed a customer
who was wounded in the crossfire.
Then he dragged her out with him.
Now you must try to save
the woman trying to expose you.
Jeez Louise, talk about irony.
What do you know about the gunman?
Apparently, he was going on
some sort of crime spree today.
This guy hit two other places today.
<i>...he heId up the Pharsyde</i>
<i>CIothing Store shortIy after 6.:00 p.m.</i>
Three places in five hours: an arcade,
a clothing store, and then the diner.
And each time,
he uses a customer as a shield.
-That worries me.
-Davis, you're always worried.
No. The fact that Michelle's the one
that died concerns me.
Some people are fated to die
before their time.
And l believe that some people are fated
to lead to the death of others.
lf you wind up back at the diner with her...
fate could be altered enough
where someone else could get shot.
Not to mention that if you save her,
you're exposed:
who you are, what you can do.
You've got to call the cops, Tru.
lf you can get the gunman arrested
at either of the other two places...
he'll never make it to the diner.
Michelle will be safe and so will you.
-Okay, fine. l'll do it.
-And then....
You will? That was easy.
-l thought you were gonna call the cops.
-l am.
l need to make sure the cops get this guy,
so that Michelle's safe.
DAVlS: Listen to me for a minute.
Look, l know that you're good
at what you do.
-But that doesn't mean l can't worry.
-That means a lot, Davis.
Just keep your cell on at Luc's show.
l may need you.
Yeah, maybe l'll see you there later.
Actually, l wasn't invited.
Don't worry. l'll call you later.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
What about that tour?
A little personal business. But l'll give you
an orientation later this afternoon.
Tru's a busy girl.
Yeah, she's got a lot of hobbies.
[Harrison exclaiming]
-What's the rush?
-l think it's sweet...
that you remembered your three-month
anniversary, but l'm not giving you money.
Why would you think that? Why....
Why do reliving days suck for me?
So, what did l do?
You lost everything l gave you
at the track.
So you're gonna have to be more creative.
And l'm gonna do you
an even bigger favor today.
l'll borrow your car
so you can't go to the track at all.
-No, wait--
-l gotta go.
Go on. Save everybody but me.
l gotta get a job. No.
You look a little lost there, bud.
Everything okay?
-You'll have to ask my sister.
-You must be Tru's brother.
-l'm Jack, the new guy.
-Harrison. What's up?
JACK: You sure everything's okay?
Yeah, it's nothing.
My girl wanted to go out
for the anniversary, you know.
l was gonna take her to a nice dinner,
but l'm all tapped out, so....
Well, what do you usually do
to score some quick cash?
l bet the horses.
-But l don't even have start-up cash--
-l love the track.
Why don't we go together
and l'll spot you a few bucks?
-Get out of here!
-l got some time till orientation. Let's go.
Sweet, because if we hurry,
we can still make the daily double.
HARRlSON: Check it out.
l need to talk to someone
about a potential robbery.
OFFlCER: <i>HoId, pIease.</i>
TRU: Come on.
Desk Sergeant Cooper.
How can l help you?
Someone l know
is gonna commit a robbery today.
TRU: <i>An armed robbery.</i>
COOPER: Someone you know?
-What's your name, miss?
-l'd rather not say.
This person you know
give any specifics as to time or place?
The Lion's Lair Arcade on Fifth
around 3:00.
Okay, l'll bite.
What does this armed man look like?
No one moves or she dies!
Mid 20s, about 6' tall, short black hair.
He wore.... l mean, he's wearing
an orange T-shirt under a gray jacket.
Okay, we'll send an officer to check it out.
TRU: Thank you. Please hurry.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Upbeat club instrumental music playing]
What's up, Frankie?
Give me $20 on the 2 horse.
Two seconds.
What's the matter? Second thoughts?
l must have lost
when l bet the horse yesterday.
What are you talking about?
No, Tru told me that l didn't....
l mean, that the horse didn't....
The horse won't do well.
l've only known Tru
for a short period of time...
but she doesn't strike me
as an expert on the ponies.
She's not. She's....
Tru is lucky, man.
So am l. So go with me
and bet the 7 horse.
-Aidan's Luck?
-Aidan's Luck loves this track.
Three-for-three at this distance.
Right.
HARRlSON: Forgot about that.
[Harrison exclaiming]
Sorry about that.
Had to have a quick powwow
with my new consultant over there.
Give me $20 on lucky 7, to win.
[Tense instrumental music]
Hand them over. Right now!
OFFlCER: Everything okay?
BOY #1 : Fine, sir.
BOY #2: No problem here, Officer.
WOMAN: Can l get some change
for the parking meter?
See anything out of the ordinary today?
MANAGER: Besides half my clientele? No.
OFFlCER: Give us a call
if you have any problems.
They must have seen the cops.
LUC: Hey, Davis?
You think you'll be able
to make it tonight?
-Yeah, l'm looking forward to it.
-Great. lt's my first show...
and l'm afraid the photos
are gonna outnumber the people.
l know that Tru's really excited
about going.
She loves photography and photo stuff.
Actually, l didn't invite Tru.
Really? l had no idea.
l thought she's got a lot going on.
l didn't think she'd have the time.
Look, l'm no expert
on successful relationships...
or any relationship, for that matter.
But let me just say this.
Sometimes people will surprise you.
Wh-What?
DlSPATCHER: <i>Unit 4 7, what's your status</i>
<i>on that 2-1 1 at the Lion's Lair Arcade?</i>
OFFlCER: <i>This is McLain.</i>
<i>That 2-1 1's a negative.</i>
DlSPATCHER: <i>10-4.</i>
Some nut just called in a false alarm.
OFFlCER: The premises were checked.
lt's all clear.
DlSPATCHER: <i>AII right, 10-4.</i>
<i>We got you back in service.</i>
lf that woman calls again,
you let her know...
<i>that the faIse reporting of a crime</i>
<i>is a feIony.</i>
DlSPATCHER: <i>WiII do. 10-4.</i>
MlCHELLE: What are you up to?
[Pounding instrumental music]
The gunman never showed up,
so the robbery never happened.
You altered the day.
He must have cased the place.
TRU: Saw the cops and took off. Right.
-There's just one problem.
-The guy's still out there.
Right, and his crime spree is still on track.
l have no assurance
that Michelle's gonna be safe.
lt might be time
for another anonymous tip.
You gonna bail me out
after they lock me up?
Sorry, it's up to me now.
l've gotta head to that second location.
-No, it's too dangerous.
-Davis, l can't turn my back on fate.
Who knows what could happen?
l have to do this.
Okay, but l want you to take this.
-A St. Benedict medal.
-lt's for protection.
Many people believe that it ensures...
no harm will come to the body or soul
that possesses it.
<i>It was given to me a Iong time ago...</i>
and l like to think
that it's kept me safe ever since.
l'm gonna be just fine, D.
l hope so.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-l'm just--
-l know, on your way out the door.
LUC: Hey, Tru.
l know you're busy
and this is kind of last-minute...
but if you get some time tonight,
l'd love for you to come to my show.
Thanks. l'll try.
-l'll keep my hopes up.
-Bye.
Thank you, Aidan's Luck. 2, 3, 4, 5.
And thank you.
l don't know what l would've done
without you.
No, actually, l do.
[Up-tempo instrumental music]
HARRlSON: l wish Tru could see this.
HARRlSON: Teach her to have a little faith
in her baby bro.
What's with your sister, anyway?
She's a little overprotective of you.
She can't help it.
You know, ever since our mom died
and the old man bailed...
she kind of looks over the family.
Maybe that's why she seems like she has
the weight of the world on her shoulders.
Yeah, she's got
a lot of other stuff going on.
JACK: Like what?
More than you could imagine, my friend.
l got a pretty big imagination.
Well, she's...
She's one-of-a-kind. But enough about her.
More importantly,
who do you like in the next race?
You're not gonna like it.
JACK: Deep Shaker.
What? He's 20-to-1 .
He likes the outside on a dry track.
Could be his day.
And if you win this bet, you'll have
enough money for six anniversary dinners.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
Deep Shaker?
$20 to win.
[Harrison exclaiming]
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: Don't do it.
l know what you're gonna do.
You're gonna grab someone
and try and hold this place up.
-l don't know what you're talking about.
-Listen.
You haven't done anything yet.
Didn't hit the arcade because of the cops.
-Stop before someone gets hurt, or worse.
-Who are you?
TRU: Does it matter?
ROBBER: Get out of my way.
Don't go out there.
The guy that just left has got a gun.
-Sorry, but l'm in a rush.
-Didn't you hear what l said?
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
DAVlS: <i>Morgue.</i>
TRU: Davis, you're not gonna believe this.
Honestly, nothing at this point
surprises me.
He tried to hit the clothing store.
l stopped the robbery but he escaped.
DAVlS: <i>What about the hostage?</i>
TRU: <i>That's just it. There isn't one.</i>
He isn't taking a different hostage each
time. lt's the same girl at every location.
-They're a team.
-Just like Bonnie and Clyde.
Kind of, except in this case,
Clyde uses Bonnie as a fake hostage.
That's an interesting twist.
l should've known when he took her
from the diner after she got shot.
She wasn't a shield.
He wouldn't leave her because--
DAVlS: <i>They're in it together.</i>
TRU: Right.
MlCHELLE: You've been busy today.
-Feel like telling me what's going on?
-Michelle.
l see we don't need to be
formally introduced...
-even though l haven't met you.
-l recognize your voice.
Really?
You've harassed my phone machine
enough times.
MlCHELLE: lf you'd just talk to me,
maybe l'd stop.
TRU: <i>Today's not the day.</i>
MlCHELLE: <i>It's the perfect day.</i>
You're calling in false alarms,
chasing people out of clothing stores.
MlCHELLE: Just another typical day
in the life of Tru Davies.
l checked police logs, auto track records.
Your name pops up everywhere. ln fact--
Michelle.
You don't want to be around me today.
l want your answers, Tru.
l'm not going anywhere until l get them.
-Okay, meet me tonight.
-Time and place?
<i>8</i>:00 sharp at the morgue.
Just please promise me
you'll wait until l get there?
l'll be there.
And this better be good.
Believe me, it's good.
TRU: Did you get all that?
DAVlS: <i>Yeah.</i>
She'll be at the morgue at <i>8</i>:00.
Make sure she waits until l get there.
That way, we can ensure she stays alive.
Even if she isn't at the diner,
someone could still get hurt.
lt's my job.
lt's a chance we're gonna have to take.
<i>I'II caII you Iater.</i>
-Did l hear someone mention the diner?
-No, l was talking to Tru.
ls she getting takeout?
'Cause l could really use a burger.
No, she has her hands full.
HARRlSON: Before we got there,
l'm thinking to myself...
it's gonna be canned soup
and crackers for us.
Jack, he's turned me in the direction
of this long shot.
l'm a little dubious, mind you,
but Jack said:
''lf this horse wins,
you can buy six anniversary dinners.''
Are you gonna eat the rest of this?
HARRlSON: Deep Shaker
was a 20-to-1 shot.
But Jack had a feeling.
And boy, did he ever have a feeling!
l'm talking about $400 worth of feelings.
l have an idea. Why don't l leave
so you can have dinner with Jack?
What?
Never mind.
What a day, what a night, and it ain't over.
Where are you going, chief?
HARRlSON: For your little lady.
WAlTER: Thank you, sir.
No, you ought to thank Jack.
[Soft instrumental music playing]
[Pounding instrumental music]
Drop the gun!
Everyone shut up!
You're a policeman, right?
l'm off-duty, ma'am.
ls there something l can do for you?
l hope so.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Hello?
Hello?
JACK: Can l help you?
[exclaims]
Hi, l didn't see you there.
Michelle Carey, <i>Post Dispatch.</i>
Sorry, l subscribe to the <i>Times.</i>
l'm not peddling subscriptions.
l'm looking for Tru Davies.
Yeah. Davis said she's at
the Standard Diner down the block.
Really? She's supposed to meet me
here at <i>8</i>:00.
-l'm sure she's on her way back.
-l'm not.
JACK: Why don't you just pop in on her?
lt's just out the door,
two blocks down on your right.
Thanks. l think l will.
l don't know who tipped you off...
but l don't see
the blonde woman you described...
let alone some guy holding up the place.
l don't understand.
They should be here by now.
Things couldn't have changed that much.
l can't believe you're not gonna do this.
That girl knew we were gonna be
at the arcade and the clothing store.
-lt was a coincidence. Bad luck.
-She knows we're together.
She has no idea who we are...
and there's no way in hell
she knows we're gonna hit this diner.
-Unless you talked to somebody, Charlie.
-You think l'm nuts?
CHARLlE: Why would l tell anyone
about this?
Look, this is getting out of hand, Beth.
This was supposed to be
just the two of us having a few kicks...
grabbing some quick dough
without anyone getting hurt.
Who's gotten hurt, Charlie?
-No one, but--
-Exactly. No one.
We promised each other
that the minute there was any trouble...
-we're gonna back off.
-Meanwhile, we haven't seen a dime.
As for kicks,
we haven't got much there, either.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Later, hon.
Sorry, but you're gonna miss all the fun.
Beth!
CHARLlE: Beth!
Looks like your friend gave you
a bogus tip.
-lt wouldn't be the first time.
-Sorry to have troubled you.
Better to be safe than sorry.
You leaving already? Because
if you'd like to join me for dinner....
Sorry, but l've got another crisis
waiting for me back at the office.
And unfortunately,
this one's gonna show up.
[Tense instrumental music]
Did a reporter come here looking for Tru?
Long dark hair, mid-to-late 20s?
Yeah, Michelle something.
About 10 minutes ago.
l told her Tru was at the diner
and she took off.
MlCHELLE: <i>8</i>:00 at the morgue?
-l was just gonna pick up some dinner.
-Eating light?
Look, you can't even begin to understand
what's been going on today.
Oh, no.
-Wait right here. l'll be right back.
-Like that's gonna happen.
Wait for me at the morgue.
lt's for your own good, believe me.
Okay, but you better show.
BETH: Give me the money right now!
TRU: Don't do this.
You.
Police officer! Drop the gun!
l don't know what you're doing here,
but just shut up!
-Get in the booth.
-lt's not gonna end well.
Now!
All right, let's have it right now.
OFF-DUTY COP: Drop it right now!
BETH: Hurry up!
OFF-DUTY COP: Put the gun down
and no one gets hurt.
BETH: All right.
l leave, she lives. Simple as that.
No one's been hurt yet
but that could change.
ln fact, l could almost guarantee
it's going to.
OFF-DUTY COP: Just let it go, miss.
-What if she gets shot? What if she dies?
-Just shut up!
Everyone knows what you look like.
You'll end up alone in prison for the rest
of your life. ls that what you want?
CHARLlE: No, she doesn't.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Please, Beth. You gotta stop.
We never wanted to hurt anyone.
<i>This isn't what we do.</i>
We're not criminals.
We're not even good at it.
How else could
she have been on to us all day?
<i>And if she is...</i>
-the cops can't be far behind.
-Actually, there's one right there.
Beth, please, let this woman go.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
Put down the gun and kick it to me.
Drop the gun!
OFF-DUTY COP: Over here.
OFFlCER #1 : Police! Put the gun down!
OFF-DUTY COP: l'm from 64 Precinct.
OFF-DUTY COP: Badge number <i>8</i>304<i>9</i>.
OFFlCER #2: Police!
OFF-DUTY COP: How'd you get here
so quick?
Got a <i>9</i>1 1 call from the Coroner's Office
about a holdup in progress.
<i>Said he was worried about his friend here.</i>
So, Harrison spent a fortune on dinner.
TRU: <i>He did?</i>
LlNDSAY: Yep.
He also spent the entire evening talking
about his new track buddy named Jack.
No kidding?
LlNDSAY: <i>Why do I feeI</i>
<i>if a coupIe of Iong shots hadn't come in...</i>
l would've had frozen pizza
instead of a soufflé?
l won't try and convince you otherwise.
You gonna be all right?
-Yeah. Ask me in the morning.
-Okay, good night.
l think you owe me an explanation.
God, l've had it with you!
lt's not enough
l just saved your ungrateful....
-Okay, you want the truth?
-That's all l ever wanted.
Turn on that tape recorder.
Yesterday, l went to the diner.
You were following me,
just like you did today.
-Yesterday? l didn't go--
-You want to hear this or not?
There was a holdup at the diner.
You were shot and killed.
After you died, you asked for my help.
The day rewound,
and now l'm reliving yesterday.
What?
ln order to keep you from dying,
l had to try and prevent a crime spree...
which you tipped me off on yesterday.
And thanks for that, by the way.
But you ended up at the diner anyway,
because that's how fate wanted it.
So now you want me to think
you're just plain nuts?
Nice try, but it's not gonna work.
l don't know
exactly what happened back there...
but you and l aren't done.
[Slow instrumental music]
[Elevator bell rings]
Luc, hey.
Yeah.
Your show. l wanted to be there.
l really did.
-lt's just my day wouldn't end.
-Tru, you don't have to explain.
l invited you because l wanted you there,
not because l thought you would be.
lt's okay, really.
Well, how did it go?
Pretty good. Had a decent turnout.
Sold two prints.
-lt was a good night for me.
-That's good. l'm glad.
You know, l thought for a while
that maybe l could change our fate...
but l guess fate's one thing
you just can't change.
DAVlS: Thank God.
TRU: lt's okay, Davis. l'm in one piece.
And Michelle lives to see another day.
l'll reserve judgment
whether that's a good thing or not.
So did the medallion keep you safe?
No, Davis. lt was you who kept me safe.
You called the police.
lt's the least l could do
after letting Michelle out of my sight.
TRU: Anyway, thanks.
DAVlS: No.
No, that's, uh...
That's yours to keep.
l appreciate it. Thanks, D.
Yeah.
One thing.
l'm in danger all the time.
l mean, dodging bullets, chasing bad guys.
But today, the medallion,
making me call the police.
Why were you so worried about me today?
Well, for one, there was Michelle.
But the truth is...
l worry about you every day, Tru.
Today l just wanted to help.
[Crypt door closes]
You have a fun day at the races?
Actually, we did.
Your brother's a pretty cool guy.
l happen to think so, too.
Just not sure why you had to go
to the track to figure that out.
Don't worry so much.
Harrison's a big boy.
He can take care of himself.
Besides, he won, didn't he?
Well, l'm his sister.
l know Harrison a lot better than you do
and what's best for him.
Maybe so.
<i>But you know what?</i>
You can't take care of everyone, Tru.
That isn't gonna stop me from trying.
[Rock music]
[Rock instrumental music]
TRU: Did Harrison call?
DAVlS: Hi. No, was he supposed to?
He was supposed to give me a lift.
But, never mind.
l'm not gonna let anything
ruin my mood today because....
Look at me, Davis.
lt's the new woman.
And she would be different
from the old woman because?
l won't put everything on hold anymore...
just because a few corpses
get conversational with me.
From now on,
l'm back in control of my own life.
TRU: But....
How you doing? You look a little tired.
l've got this thing tomorrow
at my apartment.
-And l haven't unpacked.
-When did you move in?
Three years ago.
Yes, some people are coming over,
because a guy l know from JPL...
is feeding us images
from the Mars Spirit Rover, and--
TRU: Why don't l help you unpack?
Really? All right.
Then it'll be me, you, and Jack.
Jack? Why is he--
Because he volunteered
before you showed up.
JACK: Honey, l'm home.
[Grunts]
Shot through the heart,
found in an alley downtown.
<i>FamiIy's on the way.</i>
Still got her lD and wallet.
Not your average mugging.
TRU: Melissa Sumner. 1<i>9</i>. College student.
l like a girl
who pays attention to the details.
lt's my job.
But not everyone does it so well,
or so thoroughly.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Help me.
[Scary instrumental music]
Hey, you okay?
Yeah.
l got to go. Just one sec.
[Tense instrumental music]
That body that just came in,
she asked for help.
-Just now?
-Just now.
But you're still here.
That's because nothing happened.
No rewind. Nothing.
[Tense instrumental music heightens]
[Theme music]
Help me.
[Slow instrumental music]
Are you sure you didn't imagine this?
Davis, please. l may be overworked,
but l'm not hallucinating.
So is this it?
Am l never gonna rewind again?
-We may never know.
-Did l do something wrong? Or--
No. Don't start that now. You put yourself
on the line for these people.
You've done nothing wrong.
Maybe it didn't happen for a reason.
Something specific to this case, this girl.
A college student. You think
there's something special about her?
Hey. Melissa Sumner's parents
are here for an lD.
l guess we'll find out.
Mrs. Sumner, l'm sure
this is of little comfort to you now...
but l am truly sorry for your loss.
[Somber instrumental music]
We always told her
how dangerous the city is.
How she should just hand over her wallet
if someone wanted it.
Actually, Mr. Sumner,
her wallet was still with her.
<i>$20 inside.</i>
Can you think of anyone who might have
had animosity towards your daughter?
No!
<i>MeIissa was....</i>
<i>She got aIong with everyone.</i>
<i>She was aIways a good girI.</i>
She was so bright.
She had a brilliant future and....
MR. SUMNER: Honey.
MR. SUMNER: Honey,
you shouldn't be here, okay?
MR. SUMNER: We'll go outside.
The worst part of not rewinding
is watching the family.
All that pain every day,
how do you stand it?
You get used to it.
Where're you going?
l can't just leave it like this.
l mean, l can try and find out...
what happened to Melissa
and why she asked for my help.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Elevator bell dinging]
l know, l am sorry, okay?
l forgot to pick you up...
-but something unexpected came up.
-A girl or a bet?
Hey, it was an emergency of a kind.
Okay, so l boxed a trifecta at 3-4-7.
lt was 3-4-6.
l was only off by one.
But who would've thought that
Vanilla Custer wouldn't pass a urine test?
-You know what, just forget it.
-What's your hurry?
My hurry is
that a body just asked for my help.
This is a do-over day,
and you let me lose $200?
lt's not a do-over. The body asked for help,
and nothing happened.
What, were you fired?
l was Melissa's roommate,
but we really didn't talk much.
She always had her head in a book.
She was doing
a math and engineering double major.
And she was a teaching assistant,
and had a 3.<i>9</i> grade point average.
Any arguments, disagreements?
l mean, was she upset about anything?
She seemed fine. Everything was normal.
-l'm sorry l can't be more help.
-No, l appreciate it.
You know, it's not like Melissa and l
were really friends.
But l go back to the room now,
and all of her stuff is still there.
-Like she'll walk in any second.
-Yeah.
But l guess this is just another day to you.
[Knocking on door]
DAVlS: Good. Thanks for coming.
TRU: No problem.
This is it. How'd it go?
Actually it didn't go very far.
The roommate backs up the parents.
Nobody has any clue
why anyone would shoot Melissa.
DAVlS: At least you're starting to build
a picture of who she was.
-Hey, Tru.
-Hey, Jack.
l put all 13 episodes of <i>I, CIaudius...</i>
on the same shelf as <i>The X-FiIes</i> videos.
ls that wrong?
What, you were serious
about alphabetizing?
[Jack chuckling]
JACK: Wow. Davis is a dedicated employee,
isn't he?
TRU: He really takes his work home
with him.
JACK: l'm trying to imagine
a first-date scenario.
Why don't you come to my apartment?
l'll show you all my books on death.
-Kind of a mood killer.
-Unless you're dating a serial killer.
Hey, Davis. We were just checking out
some of your books.
l thought you guys were here
to help me unpack.
JACK: Who's this?
-Someone special, l presume?
-We were together, now we're not.
TRU: Look, Harbor Marina. She's pretty.
JACK: Yeah.
TRU: You still talk to her?
Look, l think l can take care of the rest
of this if you guys want to take off.
[Slow instrumental music]
He's a funny guy, isn't he?
-Funny?
-Yeah.
He lives alone, he makes death his career.
Have you ever noticed how
he always avoids talking about himself?
Come on, he's just eccentric, that's all.
-How much do you know about him?
-Plenty.
Really? Then tell me this.
ls Davis his first name or his last name?
l'll bet he knows a lot about you, though,
doesn't he?
[Pager beeping]
l got a pickup.
l'll see you back at the morgue.
Yeah, see you there.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
TRU: Why?
What do you want from me?
How can l help you?
JACK: Talking to yourself?
Occupational hazard in a place like this.
You know what l always say.
When they start answering back,
then it's time to worry.
<i>Look at this guy.</i>
Swallowed a whole bottle of downers.
What have we got?
[Suspenseful instrumental music
continues]
TRU: Check this out.
No lD, but he picked up
a lot of business cards.
TRU: Maybe he was a salesman.
And the piece de résistance.
JACK: ''Jean, l'm sorry, please forgive me.''
Signed, Geoffrey.
Short, concise, to the point.
Got to admire that.
Save me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music]
Davis. Two bodies, one day. We got to talk.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
TRU: Davis, where are you?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
TRU: No lD, but he's picked up
a bunch of business cards.
You're here early.
l need to talk to Davis. A personal matter.
You rely on him a lot,
for someone you know nothing about.
Or am l wrong about that?
JACK: See you, Tru.
TRU: Look, Harbor Marina.
TRU: ''H. Clarke.''
l got here as fast as l could.
You want to go talk in the office?
DAVlS: Could these two people
be connected in some way?
<i>What does a murdered coIIege student...</i>
and a businessman's suicide
have in common?
We don't even have a last name
on the suicide.
TRU: He signed the note ''Geoffrey.''
DAVlS: No lD, no address?
TRU: We didn't find any.
But l did find a bunch
of different business cards in his pocket.
TRU: l checked the company names
on the computer. Get this:
they all had the same address.
lt sounds like a place to start.
Two people to save, double workload.
DAVlS: You gonna be okay?
l'll be fine.
l got a head start on Melissa yesterday.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
DAVlS: Can l help you?
JACK: Yeah.
Does the name H. Clarke
mean anything to you?
Why do you ask?
Tru was looking it up on her computer...
and l was just wondering
whether l'd lost a body.
l mean, H. Clarke wasn't on the list,
but maybe....
lt probably doesn't mean anything.
Okay.
[Rhythmic instrumental music continues]
l need to borrow your car.
-That's so weird. l was coming--
-No, you weren't gonna come and get me.
And if l were you,
l'd stay away from the trifecta, too.
That is so not fair.
You know what l did and l don't.
You let me down again. Nothing you
haven't done a thousand times before.
And you know what? Lindsay says
the same exact thing about you, too.
Well, excuse me. l made a mistake.
l'm not lucky like you.
You screw up, and it's:
''What am l gonna do?
You know what, l'll just redo it.''
That's right, l'm lucky, right?
Because l have two lives to save today
and l have no idea how l'm gonna do it?
You know what? Let me help you on this.
Help me?
You forgot to even come pick me up.
Look, l know about that, but look...
l'm good with people, you know that.
And l've helped you before.
HARRlSON: You don't have a lot of options.
You got two lives, right?
You got to trust somebody. Why not me?
l swear, Tru, l will not let you down.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Okay, l'll tell you everything l know
about Melissa Sumner...
but l need you to pay attention...
because you never know
what's gonna be important.
TRU: Okay, drive to Hudson,
its uptown campus, Waverly Hall.
TRU: She's gonna TA a math class at noon.
All right, that's it for today, class.
Just remember, when you think
something is random, it isn't.
<i>It's aII about patterns.</i>
As Einstein once said,
''God doesn't play dice with the universe.''
[Students chattering]
l liked that little lecture thing there,
especially the end part.
l'm not sure l agree with it, though,
about God not playing dice.
You feel up to arguing with Einstein?
Well, gambling's fun, right?
lt just stands to reason that God would
wanna have a good time with His creation.
Probabilities are fun for you and me,
because we can't see the future.
But since God already knows all the cards...
he probably doesn't get
the same kick out of it.
No, that's where you're wrong.
l actually know
a little bit about the future myself.
MELlSSA: You do?
HARRlSON: Yeah.
l see you. l see me.
We're having lunch together.
Nice try, but l see separate tables.
Right.
TRU: ''36<i>8</i> West 1st Street.''
[Cell phone ringing]
Hello, Harry.
lt's a little harder than l thought.
l've known bail bondsmen
who are friendlier than this chick.
Right. So listen, you have to get
into this girl's life, Harrison.
TRU: <i>Whatever her pIans are for today,</i>
<i>you've got to change them.</i>
You can do it. Just be yourself.
l was myself.
-You hit on her?
-No.
Well, not in so many.... Yeah.
Then be your other self.
-Lie?
-Bingo.
Got it.
MAN: You committed to 6,000 pounds
of bison meat.
<i>This pIace isn't even refrigerated.</i>
<i>Okay, damn it, you can't get mad cow</i>
<i>from freaking buffaIo.</i>
<i>That's why they caII it ''cow. ''</i>
[Cell phone ringing]
MAN: All right, hold on a second,
just hold on.
MAN: Hello? Jean, hi,
it's so good to hear your voice.
No, it's great timing.
MAN: Yeah, it's not even
midnight here.
<i>No, that's right, Hong Kong doesn't sIeep.</i>
<i>Listen, honey, I'm right in the middIe</i>
<i>of finishing dinner with some cIients.</i>
No, it's going really well. lt's going great.
<i>I miss you, too.</i>
<i>Yeah, I'II be home in a few days.</i>
GEOFFREY: Okay. l love you, sweetheart.
GEOFFREY: Hello?
Hello?
Damn it.
-Man of many names?
-Can l help you?
Yeah, l'm here to see Geoffrey.
l'm from the bank.
l just talked to your manager.
l told him l'd get the money today,
and l will.
<i>I'm working on something right now.</i>
Always a scheme?
l have a brother like you.
Look, the bank's gonna get their money.
l've got everything under control.
-So, thank you for stopping by.
-No problem.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Melissa clears throat]
You know, l come up here to be alone.
l can see why, it's a great spot for it.
lf you're looking for a girl,
this campus is full of them.
Look, no offense, and....
This is so embarrassing.
[Stammering]
l need some help with some math tutoring.
Really? What do you need help with?
Advanced calculus? Beginner?
Ah, um...
Fractions. l need some help
with some fractions.
Come on.
Okay, you multiply, divide, and...
one goes over the other...
and those little slashes?
What is that about? lt's confusing.
No, the thing is...
you look like you need a break.
[Melissa clears throat]
HARRlSON: You're all
about patterns, right?
Why don't you break out of yours?
Look, l'm sorry.
You seem like a really nice guy, but...
l've got a lot to do.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
Right.
JACK: Harbor Marina?
Yeah, l'm looking for H. Clarke.
The owner of a boat called <i>The Comet.</i>
Yeah, l'll hold.
Doctor's office.
Try getting a human being on the phone.
Yeah, l'm still here.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[People chattering]
You here for the poker game?
lt's high stakes players only.
l'll be right back.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Harrison, what do you know
about a poker game...
at a place called The Countdown Club?
That place. Once a month
they have a high-stakes game...
where they throw out all the small fries.
l don't know,
l've only heard rumors about it.
lt looks like Geoffrey's gonna lose
and kill himself sometime tonight.
He's desperate for the money.
Think you could get into the game?
lnto the game?
What about Melissa? And besides...
you need $5,000 to have a stake.
Right. Just stay where you are,
l'll get the money and bring it to you.
TRU: <i>We're gonna switch.</i>
<i>Poker's your worId.</i>
You take Geoffrey,
and l'll take care of Melissa.
Where are you gonna get that kind of cash?
Tru?
[Grunting]
Vanilla Custer flunked the urine test.
Or so you told me yesterday.
You pick winners for perfect strangers,
but not even your own bro?
Where is Melissa?
She's in her dorm.
That's the only entrance, right over there.
And, hey, good luck.
[Car engine starts]
[Cell phone ringing]
Hello?
l ran one of those aliases you gave me
through a credit bureau.
Harold Smith co-signed a loan
for, get this, Geoffrey Pine.
Pine? We finally got a last name.
DAVlS: <i>I think Geoffrey creates</i>
<i>new identities to open new Iines of credit.</i>
And probably get away from those people
he owed money to when things got bad.
He must be deeper in the hole
than he's ever been...
if he's committing suicide over this.
TRU: His wife has no idea.
She thinks he's in Hong Kong.
He's been living a lie.
TRU: <i>You know what the crazy thing is?</i>
<i>He's not a bad guy.</i>
With all of his schemes and everything,
he reminds me so much of Harrison.
Mirror images, duality, life and death.
That's a way a lot of religions
see the universe.
Davis, l got to go.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Cell phone ringing]
TRU: Hello.
HARRlSON: <i>I'm at the game.</i>
And l'm just checking in.
Great. Don't lose track of Geoffrey
while you're staring at your cards.
HARRlSON: <i>No, come on, Tru.</i>
<i>I wiII not Iet you down. I swear.</i>
<i>Everything is under controI.</i>
HARRlSON: Tru?
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Did you follow me here?
[Harrison stammering]
How could l follow you if l was here first?
Now that you mention it,
l think you should leave. Like now.
-All right, who the hell are you?
-Maybe l'm a friend of your wife's.
Not with that tell.
TRU: ''Tell?''
GEOFFREY: lt's a giveaway.
You looked away when you lied,
and you pushed your hair back.
No, seriously,
l think you should get out of here.
What is it with you?
Why are you obsessed with me leaving?
l just have a feeling that you
might have some bad luck here tonight.
Yeah, nice try at psyching out
your competition.
But l need this money, and l'm not moving.
Come on.
What does a young, pretty,
smart girl like yourself...
need with that kind of money?
Your wife doesn't know
about your secret life, does she?
Guess what, when they take your house
away, l'm sure she's gonna figure it out.
GEOFFREY: You don't understand.
My wife told me to straighten up my act
a long time ago.
She thinks l did.
l've been putting my theories
of probability to practical use.
l've been gambling, okay? A lot.
Got it.
MELlSSA: Over the long run, l tend to win.
But over the short run, l....
Hmm?
l lost my tuition money.
You mean all of it?
Look, l can fix this, okay?
l can win. l just need one good streak.
That's why l'm here.
Consider me your good luck charm.
ln a few days, the school
is gonna write a letter to my parents...
unless l head it off
by getting this money tonight.
Look, this is my last chance, Harrison.
l like you, but l'm gonna have to beat you.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
DEALER: Flush beats the pair.
[People chattering]
MAN 1 : How about a break?
MAN 2: Yeah.
No offense, but as a good luck charm,
you're not working hard enough.
Damn, she's a hell of a player.
She probably won last night, too.
That's why she was killed, for the money.
HARRlSON: So, Geoffrey lost, offed himself,
and Melissa won and--
And was robbed and shot
in the alley outside.
lf she leaves broke, it'll keep her alive.
But then she gets kicked out of school.
TRU: We have to think of this as an ER.
We have to save their lives.
You have to beat her, Harrison.
Not to shock you or anything,
but l'm trying.
-You have a tell.
-l do not!
You pull on your collar
whenever you're bluffing.
MAN: You playing?
HARRlSON: Yeah.
Just remember who
the experienced poker player is, okay?
[Tense instrumental music]
DEALER: Straight beats two pair.
MAN: The ace.
Yeah!
[Melissa clears throat]
MELlSSA: Congratulations,
you were faking the tell.
Well, you know...
it was only the last one, so....
Um, this is, uh...
This is really awkward for me.
l got to warn you.
l'm in a serious relationship and--
Look, Harrison, the truth is
l really need this money.
Do you think that you would consider
loaning it to me?
l mean, l would pay you back
with interest and everything.
lf you'd just give me a little bit of time....
l'm sorry. l can't do it.
Yeah.
MELlSSA: Thanks.
[Harrison sighs]
This whole knowing the future thing....
-lt can really suck.
-Yeah, sometimes.
That was just step one,
because step two is...
now you lose all that money to Geoffrey.
Why don't you just stick a bullet
right through my heart?
Start losing, Harry.
[Doorbell ringing]
JACK: Hi, l'm looking for H. Clarke.
HOPE: l'm Hope Clarke.
Are you the owner of the boat
registered out at the Harbor Marina?
Well, l'm not the sailor in the family.
My daughter, Haley, bought it.
Then can l talk to Haley?
May l ask you what this is about?
[Tense instrumental music]
Two lousy pairs. l'm out.
[Geoffrey sighs]
Good luck charm says cash out.
Are you crazy?
A little friendly advice, pal.
Leave while you're ahead.
You got to be kidding me.
l'm on a streak
and there's still money on the table.
There's always
money on the table somewhere.
So, l guess l'm never gonna know
who the hell you are.
TRU: Guess not.
[Geoffrey chuckles]
Well....
l think l'm gonna go surprise my wife
with an early return from Hong Kong.
Thank you.
[Slow instrumental music]
l can't believe
l voluntarily lost all that money.
Welcome to my world.
Now, l've got to go to work.
What about you?
Melissa left here
thinking l'm some kind of jerk...
so might as well try to find her...
and make sure
she knows it wasn't personal.
[Sighs]
Hey.
You did good.
You ain't so bad yourself.
TRU: <i>He was great, Davis.</i>
l mean, two people saved,
and he didn't just leave it at that.
He's gone to see Melissa
to try to make things right with her.
What's with Geoffrey Pine?
Just this feeling l have,
like there's unfinished business.
The truth is,
l may have saved his life this time...
but if he doesn't make some changes....
The man reminds me so much of Harrison,
l can't just....
MRS. PlNE: <i>HeIIo?</i>
TRU: Can l speak to Geoffrey?
MRS. PlNE: <i>He's stiII in Hong Kong.</i>
<i>Can I take a message?</i>
TRU: No message. Thanks. Bye.
MRS. PlNE: <i>Bye.</i>
His wife says he's still in Hong Kong.
TRU: He left to go see her.
He should be home by now.
TRU: l better go make sure Geoffrey's okay.
Tru, it may be nothing.
-We talked about duality, mirror images?
-Yeah.
Murder and suicide on day one.
lf that were a complete mirror image,
you know what would happen.
[Tense instrumental music]
Hello? Melissa?
Mel? Hey, you in here?
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Cell phone ringing]
Hey, Harrison.
HARRlSON: l'm at the campus.
Melissa left a suicide note.
TRU: <i>My God.</i>
HARRlSON: You need to get down here.
TRU: <i>I can't.</i>
<i>I'd never make it there on time.</i>
Geoff's still in danger.
He never went home.
You know where he is.
Where does any gambler go?
-He went back to the game.
-Just forget him, okay?
l know where she's got to be--
l have to reach Geoffrey.
He has no idea what he's walking into.
She's going to kill herself, Tru!
You are there. You can do this, Harry.
You can do this.
[Tense instrumental music]
Melissa, l....
Look, l know why you're here and....
Melissa, l can help you.
Are you giving me the money after all?
Look, l would, but...
Um...
l don't have it anymore.
You lost it?
HARRlSON: Hey, no, don't.
Hey, look.
Losing money
ain't the end of the world, right?
HARRlSON: l mean, take it from me.
l can help you.
You can tell your parents.
No, l can't. l can't face them.
[Melissa sobbing]
They work 16 hours a day
so that l can have a better life.
They gave up everything
for me and my sister.
How could l possibly tell them
l gambled away all my college money?
-They would never understand.
-There has to be another way out, okay?
No! lt's hopeless. l would have to get
the money to school by tomorrow...
before they write a letter to my parents.
HARRlSON: Hey, hold up.
Hey, look, uh...
my car.
My car. lt ain't worth but $5,000, but...
it's yours.
lt's yours.
Huh?
Will that give you time?
You would do that for me?
Of course.
HARRlSON: Come here. Come on.
Yeah.
GEOFFREY: What a night.
Looks like l don't need
my good luck charm after all.
l'm still on that hot streak.
That's tough luck, man. Maybe next time.
Hey!
MAN: Just stay calm
and hand me the money.
TRU: No!
[Gunshot]
[Grunting]
[Tru grunts]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Police radio chatter]
You know, l don't know why
you keep looking out for me.
And l'm not sure l know how to thank you.
Well, if l was really looking out for you,
what do you think l'd say?
Tell my wife.
Harder than a high-stakes game.
Think you can handle it?
No. But it's time.
[Slow instrumental music]
[Elevator bell dinging]
Hey. l got a pickup down in the van.
JACK: How do you get so banged up
on this job? The dead don't fight back.
You'd be surprised.
Hey, did you know that Davis was married?
[Davis chattering]
His wife's dead.
Dead? He tell you this?
Davis? Volunteer personal information?
Are you kidding me?
l got an ear for gossip.
HARRlSON: You got to come out with me.
l'm serious.
DAVlS: Don't know.
HARRlSON: Get out of here.
HARRlSON: Dude, live it up a little.
HARRlSON: Hey.
DAVlS: Hi.
HARRlSON: l rescued a pizza
on the way back.
DAVlS: After saving a damsel.
HARRlSON: Yes, sir.
ls something wrong?
Yesterday, at your apartment,
there was a picture of a woman.
Maybe we should discuss that.
TRU: You know what, no,
it's none of my business, actually.
DAVlS: lt is.
HARRlSON: You know,
should l just go and--
No, stay, Harrison.
You deserve to hear this, too.
HARRlSON: Okay.
We were married for a year.
You're married?
DAVlS: And l was supposed to meet Haley
at her mother's.
We were going to a restaurant
for our anniversary dinner.
[Somber instrumental music]
l'd been working late here,
and l was going out to my car and...
the gas had all been drained from the tank,
the tires were flat.
There was this crazy woman there,
telling me l had to call my wife...
and prevent her from getting in her car
and getting on the freeway.
-Crazy woman?
-Our mother.
DAVlS: But l knew
the evening could be salvaged.
Haley knew if l was running late,
l could meet her at the restaurant.
Our mother didn't know where she was.
And you didn't call Haley.
To tell her that there was a lunatic
claiming she was gonna die that night?
<i>I thought, yeah, that'd be a great way</i>
<i>to say happy anniversary.</i>
What happened?
The autopsy said
that she had a seizure at the wheel...
and her car drifted over three lanes
before she was hit by a semi.
So on day one?
l died with her.
That's why you know so much.
That's why you understand.
TRU: Our mother saved you.
Davis, l'm so sorry.
lt happened a long time ago.
And, you know, today is a celebration day.
Yeah.
Two lives saved.
Cheers.
So that's it?
No more shocking revelations?
No more secrets?
You officially know what l know.
Well, not everything, Davis.
-First name or last?
-Yes.
lt's my middle. Actually, it's a funny story.
HARRlSON: Hey, Jack? Hey, my man.
HARRlSON: Why don't you come in here,
join the party? You work too hard.
Actually, it's a slow night.
JACK: l only had this pickup on campus.
What?
[Tense instrumental music]
[stammering]
Harrison, let's just go sit down.
We'll figure out what happened.
She was all right when l left.
The suicide was a friend of his?
She was all right when l left.
Everything was fine.
Hey, man, it's easy to misjudge
when someone's depressed.
Who knows
what's going through their head?
-Where are you going?
-What difference does it make?
Lindsay was right about me.
You were right. l'm not like you.
l can't save anybody.
Not even myself.
Look, don't go. Just stay with me.
We can talk.
[Elevator bell dinging]
l got to get out of here.
l know this is of little comfort to you now...
but l am very sorry for your loss.
Why?
<i>Why'd she think she had to Iie?</i>
lt was only money.
We put too much pressure on her.
MR. SUMNER: Honey,
you shouldn't be here, okay?
MR. SUMNER: We'll go outside.
Could you be any more specific?
We got a phone call.
A man said that Melissa had lost
all her tuition money playing cards.
Somebody told them.
Somebody told Melissa's parents.
TRU: They must have called her
after Harrison left.
They wanted an explanation.
That's why she killed herself.
But that doesn't make any sense.
On day one, they didn't know.
What changed?
<i>Who couId've done such a thing?</i>
[Eerie instrumental music]
[Rock instrumental music]
TRU: <i>PreviousIy, on</i> Tru Calling:
ELlSE: Stay quiet now, Tru.
MAN: Where is your daughter?
ELlSE: She's not here.
Good.
[Gunshot firing]
DAVlS: This is Harper.
He'll be interviewing to replace Gardez.
JACK: And thanks for making me feel
so welcome.
lt's never easy being the new guy.
That guy's going places.
Let's just hope
somewhere far, far away from here.
What's with your sister, anyway?
Ever since Mom died,
she looks over the family.
That's why she seems to have
the weight of the world on her shoulders.
There was someone else.
<i>It was your mother.</i>
What you can do...
she could do it, too.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Woman crying frantically]
NlCK: lt's the end of the line, Maggie.
Please, Nick. l promise
l won't tell anyone what l know.
You're right.
You won't.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
See? That's her. That's her right there.
That's Carly Anders.
Right. lt's the girl
from all those teen movies.
DAVlS: She put an album out, also, so....
TRU: And l care because?
Because she's gonna be
spending the day with us tomorrow.
Okay, remind me again
why some actress is coming here?
Because she's playing a morgue attendant
in her next movie...
she wants to make sure that she has
all the technical aspects of the role.
That's not what l meant. l don't get
why she's coming here, to our morgue.
A hometown girl.
<i>Her mom and eight-year-oId sister</i>
<i>Iive nearby.</i>
-Two birds with one stone, l guess.
-Okay.
Hey, what's this?
''Victim's sex, manner of death.''
Well, it's personal data of everyone
that you've saved so far.
<i>I'm using it to Iook for recurring patterns</i>
<i>among wouId-be victims.</i>
So if a body comes into the morgue,
we'll know how likely it is to ask for help.
You know you're most likely to be asked
for help on Mondays and Thursdays...
that the killer is someone
that the victim is close to?
Does it say anything about my mother?
l'm not sure that l understand--
lt say why she didn't tell me
about reliving days?
That she could do it, too?
l'm sure she would've,
but she ran out of time.
She must have known
there was some chance...
that she'd pass it on to her kids,
but never told us.
She never prepared us.
l mean, not one word.
l know that you're angry--
TRU: l just wish your research
could tell me that.
Not that l just won't be getting
any Mondays or Thursdays off for a while.
JACK: That's perfect.
'Cause l'll take all the Mondays l can get.
Big TV night for me.
-ls that the new schedule?
-No.
lt's nothing. But l'll post the new schedule
in the morning.
Okay. Bye.
You know, Tru, l was thumbing
through the intake records this morning...
and l couldn't help but notice
you've never been on a pickup.
-That's ridiculous. l've--
-No, not one.
You're right. And that's my fault.
And l'm sorry.
And, Jack, thanks for pointing that out.
Thank you.
Any time.
All your pickups have been on relive days.
You remember?
DAVlS: lt's like it never happened.
TRU: Do you think he heard us?
We so need a secret lair.
[Theme music]
Help me.
HARRlSON: $2,200?
<i>PIease, sir, don't insuIt me, okay?</i>
<i>This is a hunk of junk.</i>
<i>What are you, out of your mind?</i>
<i>That's an insuIt.</i>
This vehicle's six years old,
has under 30,000 miles?
<i>$2,200 is a steaI.</i>
HARRlSON: Yeah, ''steal''
being the operative word.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Got some brewing in the office.
Sorry, l just got off the night shift.
-Oh, really? Where do you work?
-l work over at the county--
[Harrison exclaims]
Sidebar, you and me, right now.
[Harrison clears throat]
[Slow rock instrumental music]
What did we say about sharing
personal info with the used car guy?
Once they think you've got cash,
they jack up the price.
All l said was l work the night shift.
Look, just stick to the plan.
Talking to dead people, your thing.
-Haggling, mine.
-Fine.
[Harrison clears throat]
Yeah, she'll give you $2,000 for it, Monty.
Not a penny more.
Deal.
l'll start the paperwork.
Coffee, right?
Why do l feel he would've gone lower
than $2,000?
Hey, at least you got a set of wheels now.
So you can do your girly stuff
and go save dead people.
All the things that you like to do.
l gotta go. Lindsay wants to prep me
for dinner with her sister tonight.
All right.
-Wish me luck.
-Luck.
DAVlS: Remember, celebrities
are just like you and me, only famous...
-so try to keep it cool.
-l'll try.
[Elevator bell rings]
[Peppy instrumental music]
Hi, you must be Davis.
Tru Davies.
Carly Anders.
And this is my assistant, Anna.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
So, this is the Standards Room,
where a body gets processed.
After being picked up from a crime scene?
That's part of a morgue attendant's job,
to retrieve the body?
Typically, yeah.
But what if there isn't a body?
What if you get to a crime scene and it
looked like a murder had taken place...
CARLY: but the body was gone?
TRU: Where are you going with this?
The reason l ask is that
in the first act of this movie...
my character issues a death
certificate for a guy who vanishes...
while hiking in the mountains.
You're wondering why you'd do that
if there wasn't a body?
CARLY: Exactly.
TRU: Under certain circumstances...
a coroner's office can declare a person
legally dead without a body.
lt's called
a certificate of presumptive death.
CARLY: Let me ask you another question.
So how'd you get into this line of work?
Well, l had an internship lined up
to help me get into med school...
and when that fell through,
l kinda ended up here.
CARLY: l used to want to be a doctor
when l was a kid.
But then the acting thing took off.
You know how it is when you find
your calling. You gotta answer it.
Yeah, l know what you mean.
But, judging by your success,
it seems you made the right choice.
l'm not so sure sometimes.
l mean, all the pressure, the hours,
putting up with the media...
it gets to you after a while.
Maybe l should work here.
Dead people are much less demanding.
Actually, you'd be surprised.
Look, l know this probably seems crazy...
but, Erin, she never likes my boyfriends,
and l really want her to like you.
-Relax. She's gonna love me.
-Well, she'd better.
We both know how spotty
your track record's been lately.
-Yeah.
-Look, l'm just....
l'm really counting on you, okay?
-Jackie, what's going on, man?
-Harrison.
JACK: Excuse me.
HARRlSON: What is up?
JACK: How are you?
You at a funeral?
Yeah. A friend of mine passed away.
l came to pay my respects.
-l'm sorry to hear that.
-Yeah. Me, too.
Hi.
Jack, Lindsay. Lindsay, Jack.
Jack? Yeah, Harrison's told me
lots about you.
You know, l was about to go get a drink.
Would you guys like to join me?
l know it's early, but it's kinda been
one of those days, you know?
l actually have a ton of stuff to do
before tonight...
but if you think you can squeeze a drink in
before dinner, then....
Are you kidding?
Probably knock back three or four, huh?
But we won't.
She was really nice, Davis.
Totally down to earth.
Not at all what l expected.
Someone l could definitely hang with.
Yeah, if she wasn't going back
to Hollywood tomorrow.
lt's not just that.
This whole superhero thing.
All the running around l do,
it's hard to keep the friends l have...
let alone make new ones.
Traditionally, superheroes
don't have many friends.
Just a close-knit group of allies
and confidants.
Well, l'm 22 years old, Davis.
l need more than allies and confidants.
-Hey. Can l help you?
-Yeah.
-l'm looking for Carly Anders.
-You just missed her.
Oh, shoot. l was really hoping
to catch up with her.
-ls she a friend of yours?
-We go way back.
You wouldn't know
where she was heading?
Her mom's, l think.
You could try her there.
Thanks, l will.
Well, Davis, l'll see you tomorrow.
lt's been kind of a long day.
Tru, about your mother....
Maybe she never told you because she
didn't think you were ready to understand.
Well, l guess we'll never know, will we?
Bye.
[Slow instrumental music]
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
Oh, no.
[Tru sighing]
HARRlSON: To new friends.
lt's never easy
being the new guy in town.
l just wanted to say thanks
for making it not so hard.
Well, hey.
[Rock music playing in bar]
HARRlSON: What's so funny, friend?
Just picturing your sister's face
when she finds out we hung out.
Yeah, don't take it personal.
You know Tru.
No, actually, l don't.
l mean, we work in the same place,
we talk every day, we work side by side...
but l can't really say l know her.
-Well, she's cool, bro.
-No doubt she is.
She's like me. Loyal.
But she is smart as hell.
And she works her tail off.
Tell me about it. She comes in off-shift...
practically memorizes the stats
of all the corpses.
That job, it's like she lives for it,
you know?
-Understatement of the year.
-What's that?
What's what?
Something about your sister
l should know?
What?
No.
[Phone ringing]
[Harrison exclaiming]
HARRlSON: <i>TaIk to me.</i>
TRU: Nice job.
-My car is a lemon.
-What?
lt won't start.
Something's wrong with the engine.
We'll take it back in the morning.
Right. l'm sure Monty's Used Cars
has a real accommodating return policy.
HARRlSON: <i>I'II figure something out,</i>
<i>I promise.</i>
-Look, right now, all l need is a ride home.
-A ride home?
Look, l'd love to help you out, Tru.
<i>But I gotta go home, get ready.</i>
lf l don't look just right tonight,
Lindsay is gonna kill me.
-Whoa, you're kidding, right?
-Ask her where she is.
-Where are you?
-At the corner of Third and Ogden.
-Third and Ogden.
-Tell her l'll swing by the morgue...
and pick up the van,
be there in 20 minutes.
My man, Jack,
says he'll be there in 20 minutes.
Jack? No, l don't want a ride from Jack.
Babe, gift, horse, mouth. Need l say more?
So, you want to ride up front
or in the back?
Very funny.
Harrison sends his love, by the way.
Where were you two, anyway?
The racetrack?
-No, actually we were in a bar.
-Much better.
Why do l feel you don't want me
hanging out with your brother?
Probably because you're very perceptive.
-Harrison's a nice guy.
-Yeah, and l'd like to keep him that way.
A guy's gotta make friends somewhere.
What's that supposed to mean?
You think it's been easy for me
working in the morgue?
l try to be friendly, l try to be a good guy,
but every time l walk into a room...
you and Davis clam up,
or you change the subject, or you leave.
That has nothing to do with you.
Still, it doesn't exactly make me feel
like part of the team.
Jack, if we made you feel left out...
that's not at all what we're trying....
TRU: We would never want to....
JACK: Apology accepted.
JACK: Go for Jack.
Yeah? Yeah, l'll be right there.
Well, it's your lucky day, Davies.
You're about to go on your first pickup.
<i>Hop in.</i>
l mean, have you noticed this
crazy weather we've been having lately?
l remember it being much, much warmer
this time last year.
l know, isn't it the strangest thing?
l mean, it's late spring,
and l'm still in my midwinter wardrobe.
That is a lovely color on you, by the way.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Would you excuse me?
l'm just gonna powder my nose.
HARRlSON: Yeah, sure.
You are doing awesome.
Come on, babe. What did you expect?
Don't answer that.
[Police siren wailing]
[Slow instrumental music]
The deceased called <i>9</i>1 1 from her car
approximately <i>9</i>0 minutes ago.
Said she was being pursued by another
vehicle as she approached the bridge.
Then the line went dead.
Three guesses what happened next.
l'm gonna get the gurney. Be right back.
Okay. Do you think
she was forced off the road?
DETECTlVE: The divers found a red paint
scrape on the driver's side door.
DETECTlVE: Most likely from
the pursuing vehicle.
Who took her body out of the car?
She was already washed up on the shore
when we got here.
<i>MostIy IikeIy thrown free on impact.</i>
Jim.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Oh, no.
Carly.
[Arresting instrumental music]
Tru, l need your help.
HARRlSON: $2,200 for this hunk of junk?
What are you, out of your mind?
That's an insult.
TRU: Oh, boy. Here we go again.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Lively instrumental music]
MONTY: $2,200 is a steal.
HARRlSON: ''Steal'' being
the operative word.
-l don't want it.
-Pardon?
l don't want it. l want....
l want that one.
-l thought l was doing the negotiating.
-Not today.
Little lady, l think you're mistaken.
This car is in ''like new'' condition.
<i>It's got at Ieast another 60,000 miIes in it.</i>
lt's got six miles in it,
and then it's gonna die.
And l'm not your little lady.
Did the day restart
so you could save a car?
l'll give you $1,500 for that red one.
-lt's listed at over $2,000.
-$1,500. Take it or leave it.
Deal.
Thanks, Monty.
DAVlS: The Carly Anders,
as in the one who's getting ready...
DAVlS: to come down the elevator?
TRU: Yeah.
DAVlS: l'm nervous around regular people,
but famous people that are about to die?
TRU: She's not gonna die, Davis.
Not if we have anything to say about it.
DAVlS: Who knew you would be asked
for help on Wednesdays?
TRU: Why wouldn't l be?
According to my research,
relived Wednesdays are a statistical rarity.
l was gonna make it your day off.
No more research.
Take it off your computer altogether.
DAVlS: Why?
TRU: Jack's been asking questions.
He thinks we're up to something.
We should be more careful,
don't you think?
-Well, what about suspects?
-There aren't any. Not yet anyway.
Find out what you can during the tour.
We need something to go on here.
Okay.
<i>And try to be cooI today.</i>
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Hi. You must be Davis.
So, did you like the elevator?
What if, at the crime scene,
it looked like a murder had taken place...
but the body was gone?
Depending on the circumstances...
you'd issue a certificate
of presumptive death...
which allows the coroner
to declare a person legally dead...
-even if there's no body.
-Really?
Yeah. So, what's it like coming home
after striking it big? ls it weird?
Sure. But going home is always weird,
no matter who you are.
Yeah, but do you run into
any real jealous types?
-Here and there.
-Anyone who has any big issues with you?
Look, you seem like a real sweet person...
but l'd rather not talk
about my personal life.
Right. Of course. l was just wondering....
-Please, let's just stick to business, okay?
-Okay.
l was just gonna grab some lunch
from that diner up the street.
-Do you want anything?
-No, l'm good. Thanks.
Okay.
-Hey, Davis?
-Yeah?
Mind taking over?
l'm gonna run to the diner with Anna.
Yeah. Will you get me
a slice of chocolate....
l have a corn dog here, so it's fine.
Okay.
l've been with Carly for four years now.
Best boss l ever had.
-So you're pretty much with her 24/7, huh?
-More or less.
Then you'd know if there was someone...
who might be
holding a grudge against her?
A grudge?
Yeah. l mean, she got so famous, right?
Some people might resent that.
Everybody loves Carly.
So, you're saying you can't think of
one person who might feel otherwise?
The tabloids have a field day with her,
but Carly's tough.
ANNA: One of the most determined people
l've ever met.
Really?
Her mom told me the only time
she ever took off was eight years ago...
right after a big movie.
She was 16 years old,
and on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
ANNA: Finally, her mom forces her
to take a year off.
After that,
she comes back stronger than ever.
Wow.
Where's Carly?
That guy came in,
said he needed to talk to her.
l tried to stop him,
but she said it was okay.
He came looking for Carly yesterday,
but she'd left by the time he got here.
You heard anything they've been saying?
Been keeping their voices lowered.
CARLY: l can't do this anymore!
l'll see you later, Carly.
ls everything okay?
CARLY: Yeah, l'm fine.
That was just an old friend.
-Didn't look too friendly to me.
-Yeah? Well, it's nothing.
-Anyway, l should be going. ls Anna....
-Pulling the car around.
You sure you don't want
to stay a bit longer?
-l could autopsy something for you.
-No, thanks.
TRU: Nice meeting you.
CARLY: Yeah, you, too.
You just gonna let her leave like that?
TRU: Don't worry, l'll be right behind her.
After all, l have to return this.
DAVlS: Did you steal her purse?
TRU: l had to do something.
-l needed to buy myself some more time.
-For what?
To figure out how l'm gonna tell her
she's gonna die tonight.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
-Relax. She's gonna love me.
-Well, she'd better.
We both know how spotty
your track record's been lately.
-Yeah.
-Look, l'm just....
l'm really counting on you, okay?
-Jackie.
-Harrison.
So, you all ready
for Lindsay's big test tonight?
Oh, the test? No, no.
lt's, you know, it's....
Dinner. Right.
You're a braver man than l am, Harrison.
But, hey, if l would've played it safe...
maybe l wouldn't be pushing 30
and all alone.
No, safe? No. lt's....
Me and Lindsay? We click.
-You know what l'm saying, man?
-l stand corrected.
The truth is, l envy you, man.
JACK: You have what every guy wants...
whether he's man enough
to admit it or not.
To you and Lindsay.
Me and Lindsay.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Door belling ringing]
You must be Carly's sister.
-Are you a reporter?
-No. My name's Tru.
-Swear you're not a reporter?
-Swear.
Oh, Tru.
Hey, your sister's adorable.
She looks just like you.
-How can l help you?
-You left this at the morgue.
-Wanted to return it before you left town.
-Thanks.
l wanted to talk about the guy
that came to the morgue today.
-Peter?
-Yeah, you two seemed pretty worked up.
-l don't see how that's your business.
-lt's not, but....
-Listen, l'm worried about you.
-Why?
Because l have a bad feeling.
-So, what, you're psychic now?
-No.
CARLY: Look, you've been asking
strange questions all day.
Thanks for dropping off my purse,
but you should go now.
lf you're in trouble, maybe l can help.
l don't even know you.
No, not yet.
But if you just gave me a chance--
-We'd be the best of friends.
-Carly, please, l'm just....
Look, come near me or my family again,
and l'm calling the police.
Yo, thanks again, bro.
We should do this again sometime.
We should.
About what l said back in the bar....
No, don't worry about it.
No, l've just lost too many buddies
to wives and kids.
l don't want to lose another one.
You keep picking up that tab,
there ain't no chance of that.
JACK: All right.
HARRlSON: Need a lift?
No, man. lt's a nice day.
l'm gonna walk. Good luck tonight.
Thanks again, man.
[Harrison laughing]
Leave the key in the lock.
Step away from the car.
All right, buddy. Take it easy, man.
Take it easy, okay? Be cool. All right?
No problem.
Hang onto your keys, Harrison.
-No, you did not just say that.
-l'm afraid l did.
-Jack? Jack, just....
-Keys!
JACK: lt's your car, not his.
CARJACKER: Shut up!
When a guy with a gun asks for keys,
you hand the keys to him.
HARRlSON: That's how it works.
JACK: Not this time.
The only way this guy's gonna get your car
is if you give it to him.
Because he certainly doesn't
have the stones to do it on his own.
lf he did, we'd be dead already,
and he'd be nothing but a set of taillights.
[Tense instrumental music]
-You sure about that?
-Oh, yeah.
Look, the car is a piece of crap, man.
lt ain't worth it, okay?
Five seconds, your boy here's dead.
Jack, come on, man.
Five.
HARRlSON: Come on, Jack.
lt ain't worth it, Jack.
Four.
Come on, Jack! Hey!
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
CARJACKER: Three.
HARRlSON: Jack, man, come on!
-lt's okay, Harrison.
-Two.
Let me give him the keys, man! Jack!
HARRlSON: No!
CARJACKER: One.
Bang.
[Slow instrumental music]
What the hell was that, man?
[Lively instrumental music]
[Lively instrumental music]
This was a mistake.
She won't even talk to me now.
She just doesn't understand you.
TRU: <i>WeII, we were totaIIy cooI yesterday.</i>
And now, thanks to my gift,
she thinks l'm a psycho.
Which, to be completely honest,
l can't blame her.
-All that matters now is saving her life.
-Yeah, l know. lt's just....
Sooner or later,
this gig is gonna cost me all my friends.
Tru, a hero's journey is treacherous.
Yeah, treachery l can deal with.
But being alone kinda sucks.
l'm guessing you weren't able
to find anything out...
-about the guy she was arguing with?
-No, just a name. Peter.
DAVlS: <i>Angry ex or something?</i>
TRU: Sounds about right.
-So, what's the plan now?
-Well, stick close to Carly...
and see what happens,
and pray she doesn't see me.
Why don't l meet you
and keep you company?
TRU: Davis, you don't have to do that.
DAVlS: <i>No, I want to, because....</i>
Tru, you're not alone.
-Thanks.
-l'll see you.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
[Children screaming]
JACK: You okay?
-Do l look like a guy who's okay?
-You look like a guy who's still got his car.
HARRlSON: Oh, my God.
JACK: What?
-He was gonna kill you, man.
-But he didn't.
Look, l am all about standing up
for what's yours.
But that was....
What, you got some kind of death wish?
Harrison, death isn't something
you have to wish for. lt's coming anyway.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
-Can l make a confession?
-Sure.
l lied to you...
before, when l said that an old friend
of mine had passed away.
l was at a funeral,
but l didn't know the person who died.
Did you go to the wrong church, what?
No. Just something l like to do.
-Go to strangers' funerals?
-Yeah.
-For what, kicks?
-No.
For clarity.
Right. Jeez.
l go to remind myself
that death is inevitable.
Death is part of life.
And as soon as you understand that,
you're free.
You can do anything you want.
So, is that what you meant earlier,
when you were you were talking about...
playing it safe with Lindsay?
Lindsay?
Look, l'm sure Lindsay's a great girl.
But the problem with great girls is,
they want great lives.
They want a house with
a white picket fence and 2.5 kids...
playing in the yard.
l don't know you that well...
but you strike me as a guy
who wants more than that.
Who needs more than that.
More freedom. More fun.
More life.
[Mysterious instrumental music]
Whoa, there's more here
than what l asked for.
Consider it a severance package.
That's not how our arrangement works.
You see, l ask you for money,
you get it to me...
whether it's today, tomorrow,
or a year from now.
l've honored that arrangement
for eight years.
l think that's long enough.
Not for me. l mean, l appreciate the bonus.
But you will be hearing from me again.
Count on it.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Car engine starting]
TRU: Why didn't you tell me
about your arrangement?
-And you are?
-Someone who cares about Carly.
She said you were an old friend...
but you look more
like an extortionist to me.
Actually, l'm a reporter for the <i>Sun-Times.</i>
What you just saw was an interview
for a story, nothing more.
She paid you off to keep quiet
about something...
-that happened eight years ago.
-l can neither confirm nor deny.
Look, what was it, Peter?
What happened back then?
Her mom told me the only time
she ever took off was eight years ago.
TRU: <i>Your sister's adorabIe.</i>
<i>She Iooks just Iike you.</i>
lt's lsabelle.
She's not Carly's sister.
She's her daughter.
Whatever it is you're planning tonight,
you can forget it.
Because if you hurt Carly,
l'm going to the police.
Are you kidding?
Carly's little secret
helped pay for my summer home.
The last thing l'd ever do is hurt her.
Are we done here?
[Car tires screeching]
DAVlS: Carly's younger sister
is really her daughter?
<i>What a scandaI.</i>
<i>You don't think the reporter's the kiIIer?</i>
-No, Carly's worth too much to him alive.
-lf not him, then who?
TRU: <i>I'm back at CarIy's</i>
<i>trying to figure that out.</i>
CARLY: l can't believe you did that!
Look at it!
TRU: According to your spreadsheet,
there's a probability...
that the killer's someone
close to the victim?
DAVlS: Right.
TRU: Who's closer to Carly than Anna?
CARLY: Just leave me alone.
[Soft instrumental music playing]
Hey, what's up?
You were supposed to be here
two hours ago.
-Where the hell have you been?
-l lost track of time. No biggie.
Actually, no, it is a biggie.
l told you that this was important to me.
Well, l'm here now.
-So, where's the big sis?
-She left.
[Exclaiming]
Her loss, right?
Why are you acting like this?
l don't know.
Why are you acting so clingy?
What?
-Exactly what Jack was talking about.
-Jack?
What does he have to do with us, huh?
You know, sometimes l'm gonna be late.
Sometimes l might not show up at all.
That's just something
you're gonna have to deal with.
That's just something
you're gonna have to deal with.
No, l won't.
Because if you're feeling tied down...
then by all means,
consider yourself untied.
Whatever.
LlNDSAY: We're through.
TRU: Anna?
Tru, what are you doing here?
TRU: Carly had a few more questions
about the morgue, asked me to stop by.
-ls everything okay with you two?
-Honestly? No.
Why, what happened?
l asked Carly if l could borrow her car
to run some errands...
while she's at her mom's. She says fine.
l get in a fender-bender while l'm out,
and she throws a fit.
You were in an accident?
l was pulling out of a spot when
this other car just crunched the door...
and left a nasty red paint scrape.
But so what? lt's just a rental.
[Phone ringing]
Sorry.
Hello?
TRU: Good. You made it.
-Anna was in an accident in Carly's car.
-What?
A red car crashed
into the driver's side door.
lf the damage was before
she drove to the bridge....
Maybe she wasn't forced off the road.
-Maybe she drove off the bridge herself.
-Suicide? No way.
The police said that Carly called <i>9</i>1 1
saying someone was following her.
Why would she do that
if she was planning suicide?
-Someone killed her, l know it.
-But who and why?
[Car engine starting]
[Car tires screeching]
Carly.
[Tense instrumental music]
But that can't be right.
lt doesn't make any sense.
Fine. Yeah, l'll call you back
after l talk to her. Bye.
-ls everything okay?
-That was Carly's agent.
And according to him,
there is no morgue movie.
What?
The movie about the morgue attendant
doesn't exist.
Her next project's
supposed to be a romantic comedy.
lf there's no movie,
why spend the day with me and Tru?
l was just wondering the same thing.
[Phone ringing]
Hello?
Carly lied to us.
There never even was a morgue movie.
-What?
-lt doesn't exist. She made it up.
Why would she come to the morgue?
Why would she ask us all those questions?
What if you get to a crime scene and
it looked like a murder had taken place...
but the body was gone?
Davis, this may sound crazy, but l think
she's trying to fake her own death.
-What did you say?
-Both days she asked what happens...
if l got to a crime scene
and there was no body.
She needs to be sure the missing person
would still be declared legally dead.
DAVlS: Why?
TRU: <i>Because that was her pIan.</i>
Fake her own death and disappear.
That's why she spent the day with us.
She wanted to get the details right,
so no one would catch on.
She had everything.
Why would she do something like that?
Think about what the last eight
years have been like for her.
<i>Knowing her secret</i>
<i>couId come out at any time.</i>
She must have had enough. Probably
thought this was the only way out.
lf you're right, then Carly wasn't
forced off the bridge by another car.
<i>-And that caII to 91 1....</i>
-Also fake.
There's just one problem.
Carly didn't fake her death yesterday.
She actually died, otherwise the day
wouldn't have restarted.
Something must have gone wrong.
Something she didn't plan for.
Well, whatever that something is,
you have to get there before it happens.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
TRU: Oh, my God.
CARLY: l need help! You have to come
now! Someone's following me!
l can't get away! Please hurry!
CARLY: What?
TRU: Carly, listen to me.
What are you even doing here?
l know what you're planning,
and it isn't gonna work.
lt will, as long as you don't tell anyone.
-No, that's not what l meant.
-Please, just leave me alone.
Carly, l....
[Rock music playing on car stereo]
Watch out!
The SUV hit you yesterday.
That's how you got in the water.
That's how you died.
Died? What are you talking about?
l know why you did it, Carly.
l know about lsabelle...
-that she's your daughter.
-How?
l figured it out.
l thought that if word got out,
my career would be over.
So, you covered it up for eight years?
CARLY: You don't know what it's like, Tru...
to have a secret
people are trying to expose.
Actually, l do.
Because l have a secret, too, you know.
TRU: There have been times
where l wanted to run away...
pretend it wasn't a part of me.
But l don't,
because there's someone's life at stake.
-Whose?
-Tonight it was yours.
[Slow instrumental music]
Someday, someone
would have exposed us, l know that.
lt's no way to live,
waking up each morning...
wondering if today's the day
the story finally comes out.
That's why l finally told lsabelle
the truth a few months ago.
CARLY: That was the hardest thing
l ever had to do.
lt took her some time,
but she's okay with it now.
She wants us to be together,
start a new life.
By faking your death?
Look, l'm leaving the country tonight,
and l'm taking lsabelle with me.
l didn't want to go to this extreme, Tru.
l tried to buy my way out today.
Pay off the one person
who knew the truth about lsabelle.
But he wasn't about to let the story die.
So l had to go to my backup plan.
lf she's okay with you being her mother...
then why go to all this trouble?
Why not just come clean?
You think the tabloids
would ever leave her alone?
Ever let her have a life?
l'm sorry if you can't get away
from your secret, Tru.
But please, l need to get away from mine.
l thought you had that thing
with Lindsay and her sister.
l did, yeah. lt didn't go exactly as planned.
She ended it.
l'm sorry to hear that.
l should've seen it coming, you know?
She gives me chance after chance,
and, you know, l screw up.
That's what l do. l screw up.
l know it must be hard,
losing a girl like Lindsay, but...
maybe it's for the best, you know?
l mean, all these chances
you keep talking about...
did it ever occur to you
that maybe they were chances for her?
Chances for her to change you?
Real friends don't do that, man.
Friends accept you for who you are...
appreciate you for who you are.
Yeah, l guess, you know?
No, don't guess, Harrison.
Know.
Now, l know l haven't known you
for very long, but l'm your friend, man.
No matter what.
[Pager beeping]
-Duty calls. l'll see you soon, yeah?
-Thanks, man.
[Police siren wailing]
-Are you sure about this?
-Don't have to be.
l can't say it's my choice,
but it's Carly's life.
She can do what she wants.
Well, there's a lot of ways
to help people, l guess.
Some people need help living, some dying,
some a little bit of both.
l think l finally understand now.
She did it to protect her daughter.
DAVlS: Well, here's hoping
that Carly pulls it off.
Actually, l wasn't talking about her.
l was talking about my mother.
JACK: l don't get it.
Why would they call
and bring us all the way down here...
if there's no body to pick up?
Must've jumped the gun
when they found the car.
-Probably figured the body was still in it.
-The currents must have washed it away.
We may never find it.
l'll see you two back at the office.
lt's too bad.
Your first pickup and no body.
Go figure.
Poor Carly Anders.
She had a lot to live for.
lt's funny how life works, huh?
JACK: One day you're here,
the next day you're not.
Well, wherever she is tonight...
l'm sure it's a better place.
[Slow rock music]
TRU: Hey, Mom.
l know it's been a while,
but l've been busy.
l guess nobody would understand that
better than you.
But l'll be back soon, Mom.
l promise.
[Rock music]
TRU: <i>PreviousIy on</i> Tru Calling:
Anyway, l just wanted to say welcome.
l'm Tru.
Jack.
JACK: A couple of years ago...
l died.
And then, l came back.
Some would say once you survive
something like that...
that you were brought back for a reason.
l guess we'll see.
DAVlS: How did it go with Jack?
l just can't get a read on him,
for some reason.
One minute he's in your face
and almost obnoxious.
The next, he's charming,
trying to be your best friend.
Leave the key. Step away from the car.
Hang on to your keys, Harrison.
-You sure about that?
-Yeah.
What, you got some kind of death wish?
Death isn't something
you have to wish for. lt's coming anyway.
Death is part of life.
TRU: Someone stopped us from saving her.
But that doesn't make any sense.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Slow instrumental music]
DAVlS: <i>So you ended up ordering takeout?</i>
<i>What did you get?</i>
TRU: Moo Shu pork.
DAVlS: <i>Nice choice. With the pancakes?</i>
No, straight from the box. You?
l'm just digging into a rack of lamb
with some garlic mashed potatoes.
TRU: Cereal again?
DAVlS: <i>Yeah.</i>
The doctor says l'm fiber-poor.
So what are you doing tonight?
You know, the usual.
Nothing?
DAVlS: Exactly.
Look, me being alone on a Friday night
is one thing...
but you, on the other hand....
With my life,
it's rejuvenating to have a night off.
And besides, l told you. l'm between exes.
[Davis mumbling]
What?
lt's okay to say that you miss someone.
Luc? Why would you say that l miss Luc?
l didn't say Luc. You said Luc.
Yeah, well--
DAVlS: <i>The way I see it is,</i>
<i>just because we're aIone...</i>
<i>doesn't mean that we're IoneIy.</i>
So by that reasoning, you'd argue
that my neighbor across the way?
She looks like
she's having the time of her life.
DAVlS: <i>She's probabIy miserabIe.</i>
TRU: Gotta tell you, Davis,
it sure seems like she's having fun to me.
DAVlS: <i>Trust me.</i>
<i>Nothing is ever exactIy what it seems.</i>
Listen, l've got to go.
The <i>Outer Limits</i> marathon
is about to start.
l'll let you go.
DAVlS: <i>Tru, for what it's worth...</i>
l happen to think that you have
a pretty exciting life, you know?
Time travel...
<i>saving Iives, pretty cooI boss.</i>
Yeah. Good night, Davis.
Good night, Tru.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
WOMAN: [On Machine]
<i>Leave me a message, I'II caII you back.</i>
Consider this a warning.
You can make all the trouble you want...
but it's only a matter of time
before l find you.
And when l do, let's just say
there won't be a second warning.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Theme music]
Help me.
[Slow instrumental music]
[Knocking on door]
DELlVERYMAN: Delivery!
[Knocking continues]
Coming.
[Quizzical instrumental music]
TRU: 4B, not 3B.
Four, as in upstairs!
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
Tru? Hey.
l haven't seen you around much.
l thought you moved.
No, l've just been working
some weird hours lately.
But the delivery man
left this at my door by accident.
Cool. Thanks.
[Stuttering] Hey, Tru!
Can l get your advice on something?
Sure.
There is this girl.
And she lives nearby...
and she is amazing.
Right.
She's always busy
running around all over town...
but whenever l see her,
she just makes me want to smile.
l see.
Yeah, and, well...
l've been wanting
to ask her out for a while...
but l'm afraid that if she says no,
things will get weird.
You know, on account of us
being neighbors.
Yeah.
l would advise you...
to first make sure that she's ready to date.
And after that, l would take things slow.
Right. Yeah. Slow.
Very slow, you know?
Okay. Makes sense.
-Okay. Thank you.
-No problem.
Just the morgue attendant
l was looking for.
l'll bet you say that to all the girls.
Remember l told you
l was looking for a new apartment?
l found the perfect one-bedroom.
lt's close to work, utilities included.
-Congrats.
-l haven't signed the lease yet...
-'cause l wanted to run it by you first.
-Me, why?
The thing is, it's in the building
across the street from yours...
and l didn't want you feeling crowded
or anything.
So l figured l should check with you.
Are you kidding? You should jump on it.
TRU: Places in my neighborhood
are so hard to find.
Morning, gang.
Hey, you got your state license forms.
Davis only called me three times
to remind me.
So you're sure about this?
Positive. lt'll be so nice
to have a friend across the street.
-Guess l got a lease to sign.
-Sweet.
LUC: See you.
TRU: Okay, bye.
[Slow instrumental music]
DAVlS: Signed and dated. Perfect.
You put the morgue
as your mailing address.
l hope that's okay.
l've been staying at a friend's place
since l moved here.
-Figured this was the best place to get me.
-Not a problem.
As a matter of fact,
you got some mail this morning.
DAVlS: Here it is.
DAVlS: The Schenkman Center.
That's an impressive facility.
Yeah, one of the best in the country.
DAVlS: Were you there long?
l don't remember it being on your résumé.
lt was a long time ago.
l didn't think it was relevant.
DAVlS: Did you ever run into a guy
named Tom Forrester?
An old college buddy of mine.
We used to play D&D on the weekends.
We called him Wizard.
Forrester. Yeah, sure. Big fella.
JACK: Hell of a guy.
DAVlS: Yeah.
Good old Wizard. l wonder what he's....
DAVlS: l should give him a call.
HARRlSON: So the meet's at noon.
HARRlSON: High noon.
TRU: Don't be so dramatic.
lt's the first time me and Lindsay
are seeing each other since the breakup.
We're exchanging stuff.
How is that not dramatic?
Look, l want you both to be happy.
But the truth is,
it's not so bad being single.
[Peppy music playing in diner]
Who are you kidding? Not me.
And you've been busted up
since you and Luc split.
TRU: That's just not true.
HARRlSON: Yeah?
And what's your love life now?
Talking on the phone with Davis all day?
Telling me your upstairs neighbor
has a crush on you?
You're pleasant today.
You're right, l'm sorry.
l'm just nervous.
HARRlSON: Anyway, l got to get going.
Whose turn is it?
You ask that like we actually take turns.
Yeah, well, l'll get the next one.
l'll hold my breath.
l don't care. You listen to me,
for the last time, leave me alone.
TRU: My neighbor looks like
she's having the time of her life.
Some guys won't take no for an answer.
Well, try saying yes.
Yes, you're a psycho.
Yes, l was right to break up with you.
l'll have to remember that.
You look familiar. Have we met?
No, but l've seen you
around the neighborhood.
Thanks, Chris.
-l'm Tru Davies.
-Chris Barronson.
-Always nice to put a name with a face.
-Absolutely.
-Thanks. Take care.
-Bye.
One Motley Crue concert tee.
One deck of naked lady cards.
[Whooping]
Two eggs of Silly Putty.
And 13 assorted comic books.
l've been looking for these.
All right, where's my stuff?
That's it?
Yeah, l turned my place upside down...
and that is all l could find.
That's not even mine.
Yeah, well, uh...
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
Look, the reason l asked you
to meet me here today...
is because l wanted to
look you in the eye...
into those eyes...
and tell you that l want you back.
What?
Just give me one more chance,
that's all l'm asking for.
No, l've given you, like, 50 chances...
and you blew every single one of them.
You're just too self-absorbed to know it.
And you're the perfect girlfriend, right?
What?
You're so needy. And demanding.
You always order
the most expensive thing on the menu...
when you knew l couldn't afford it.
HARRlSON: Right?
Hmm?
[Rhythmic instrumental music continues]
Take care of yourself, Harrison.
When will l learn to shut my mouth?
Hi. Tom Forrester, please.
[Davis clearing throat]
Hi, Wiz?
Hi, it's Gothar, the Elf King.
Yeah. Davis.
Yeah. Listen, turns out
we have a friend in common.
Jack Harper.
[Exclaims affirmatively]
Yeah, he used to work with you
at Schenkman.
[Mysterious instrumental music]
Mmm-Hmm.
Really?
[Slow instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
TRU: Hello?
So your brother and l
are officially through.
Can't say l'm surprised, but l'm so sorry.
LlNDSAY: <i>He made this sad, Iast-ditch</i>
<i>attempt to patch things up.</i>
<i>And when I said no,</i>
<i>he caIIed me needy and demanding.</i>
<i>Can you beIieve that?</i>
[Tense instrumental music]
Hello, Tru, you there?
TRU: <i>Yeah, sorry, I just....</i>
There's this couple across the building
and they're having this nasty fight.
LlNDSAY: <i>Are they stiII going at it?</i>
l can't tell.
They just turned the lights off.
One guess. Makeup sex.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Anyway, Linds, l got to get to work.
LlNDSAY: Fine. l'll talk to you later, okay?
TRU: <i>Okay.</i>
JACK: lncoming.
<i>Hey, Tru?</i>
l thought you said
your neighborhood was getting better?
lt is.
l've got a homicide here
that might disagree.
You picked this up near my place?
A building across the street,
if l'm not mistaken.
Victim's name is Chris Barronson,
died from massive head trauma.
Chris Barronson?
Friend of yours?
No, we just met. Today.
-You sure you want to see this?
-Yeah.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
That's not Chris Barronson.
-lt's what his lD said.
-No, Chris is a girl.
l saw this guy at her place earlier tonight.
He was furious about something.
You know, the cops said something about
thinking the killer was a woman.
Bag this, will you?
Two people, same name, same apartment?
-lt's either coincidence...
-Doubtful.
...or our buddy here's been up to no good.
Hi, Tru.
l thought you were home for the night.
-l was, but--
-Couldn't stay away?
Actually, if you have a moment?
l'm kind of in the middle of something.
Can it wait?
lt's actually important. We need to talk.
[Tense instrumental music]
Tru, go ahead. l got this.
-Tru?
-Yeah. Okay, l'm coming.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Please save me.
[Knocking on door]
DELlVERYMAN: Delivery!
DELlVERYMAN: Delivery!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Wait! Hold on!
You've got the wrong apartment!
Even when you relive days
they still get away.
So your neighbor and victim
have the same name?
He's dead and she's the prime suspect?
Yep. But it wouldn't be any fun
if it were easy.
Okay, well, here's a theory.
Could be identity theft.
He took her identity
and she killed him for it.
DAVlS: ldentity theft is on the rise.
They're either stealing it online...
or taking a picture of your credit card
with a cell phone.
She seemed so normal.
lt's hard to imagine her killing anyone.
People can do a lot of things
in self-defense.
DAVlS: Especially when they're pushed
past their limit.
For the last time, leave me alone.
-Maybe you're right.
-Hi, Jack.
Sorry to interrupt. l just wanted
to drop off my state license forms.
DAVlS: Super. Thanks.
JACK: Hey.
TRU: Hi.
We were just going over
the new intake procedure.
Cool. You mind if l check the mail?
Unfortunately, this is the only address
most people have for me.
-No, go ahead.
-Thanks.
Tru, about the new intake procedure.
[Davis clearing throat]
Were there any other clues
about the victim's real identity?
He had a pen with a logo on it.
lt was a sunburst with a capital ''A'' inside.
Probably from his work. l'll look into it.
An identity thief with a day job.
All the better to meet new victims.
l got to get going.
Chris will be at the diner any minute.
Okay. l'll call you if anything comes up.
There was something else...
you wanted to tell me
right before the day rewound.
-l did?
-You said it was important.
No clue. Too bad l don't relive days.
DAVlS: But look on the bright side.
lf you don't change
too many things today...
then we'll have
the same conversation tonight.
Here's hoping.
HARRlSON: Yeah. A redo day.
l get it. No time for breakfast.
HARRlSON: But considering you're 24 hours
ahead of me...
<i>what happened with Lindsay yesterday?</i>
Do you want my advice?
Save the sit-down for another day.
Another week even.
Man. lt was that bad?
Put it this way: Yeah.
All right. Thanks for the heads up.
Too bad you're blowing off breakfast
'cause l would've picked up the tab today.
lt must be nice living in your world, Harry.
Jack, is Tru around?
-You just missed her, man.
-Damn.
l needed to ask her something.
There's kind of a time factor.
She should be on her cell.
No, this is one of those things
that's best to do in person.
Make sure she means what she says.
You mean women don't always say
what they actually mean?
Not the ones l fall for.
LUC: See you, man.
JACK: Yeah.
MAN: <i>You're finished. The fun is over.</i>
For the last time, leave me alone.
Coffee, please.
Some guys,
they just can't take no for an answer.
-Ex-boyfriend?
-lt's sort of a long story.
Thanks, Chris.
You know, you look familiar.
You don't live on York by any chance?
Yeah, l do.
-Same here. l'm Tru Davies.
-Chris Barronson.
lt's always nice to put a name with a face.
Chris Barronson.
Yeah. Have you heard of me?
Sort of. There was this guy
outside your building this morning...
asking all these questions about you.
He seemed pretty belligerent.
About 6', dark brown hair?
Same guy who just can't take no
for an answer?
Only he's not an ex.
Well, it's nothing l should get into.
lf you're heading home,
l could walk with you.
You know, in case he's still around.
-Okay.
-Okay.
CHRlS: lt was six months ago...
when l found out he'd stolen my identity.
l was applying for a loan,
and the bank ran a credit check.
They found 10 different credit cards
in my name.
He'd used them to run up
nearly $60,000 in charges.
And now he's threatening you?
-Because l went to the police.
-No arrest?
lD theft's tricky to prosecute.
You need absolute proof,
which l don't have.
But it's getting worse because now l feel
like someone's been watching me.
That's creepy.
Any idea how this all started?
No, but there's a million ways.
lf you don't have a shredder, a firewall...
a digitally scrambled phone...
you may as well have a sign up saying:
Ruin my life.
Anyway, thanks for the company.
And do me a favor,
if you see that guy again...
just say l moved or something.
No problem.
Because if l run into him,
there's no telling what might happen.
-Jack?
-Hey.
TRU: What are you doing here?
JACK: Moving in.
You're kidding?
No. l saw the ''For Rent'' sign
and snapped it up.
JACK: Lucky for me.
The guy who was supposed to take it...
missed the deadline 'cause he had to
run it by his girlfriend or something.
The thing is, it's in the building
across the street from yours...
and l didn't want you feeling crowded.
But his loss is my gain.
Third floor, great view. Unbelievable.
So l've heard.
JACK: l got to get started with
the packing process. l'll see you later on.
Tru, your friend, who l just met.
She wouldn't happen to be single,
would she?
l'm not sure a new guy
is what she needs right now.
TRU: Besides, a word of advice.
Girls don't appreciate
being hit on by their neighbors.
We need to find
some more interesting neighbors.
Maybe you need to find
some less desperate tenants.
Look, she's having guy trouble right now.
JACK: A bad breakup?
TRU: Not exactly.
All right. Fine. Don't tell me.
l'll find out on my own soon enough.
Hey, wait.
The truth is, there's this guy
that's been harassing her...
and the last thing she needs is--
-Two.
-Yeah.
Enough said.
TRU: Okay.
JACK: You know, Tru...
if that other guy really is a problem,
l wouldn't mind keeping an eye on her.
l know you think l'm heartless...
but l have been known to show an interest
in people other than myself.
Thanks, but l've got it under control.
l'd expect no less.
[Phone ringing]
TRU: Hello.
DAVlS: <i>Hi, it's me.</i>
l found your logo and your identity thief.
Really?
lt's a company called Advantix.
They sell medical equipment.
And there is a salesman there
by the name of Chris Barronson.
Did you get an address?
Don't need to. He's coming to the morgue
in 20 minutes to make a presentation.
You made an appointment with the guy?
l told him we weren't happy
with our current distributor.
You're always chasing the bad guy.
<i>Why not make them come to you for once?</i>
TRU: Nice, D. l'll see you in 20.
DAVlS: <i>Okay.</i>
This is my colleague, Tru.
This is Chris Barronson.
Please save me.
This is my first sales call to a morgue.
Most of our equipment's designed
to keep the patient out of a place like this.
Everyone passes through sooner or later.
Right.
Anyway, let me show you guys
what might be useful.
Had this job long, Mr. Barronson?
Eight, nine months. Why?
Does it pay well?
Only if you buy what l sell.
l guess you don't sell that much.
All right. Who are you people?
l think who you are is the bigger question.
What?
We know who the real Chris Barronson is
and you are not her.
And it's only a matter of time
before the police figure that out.
Right. She's good.
l'll give her that.
She pulled a fast one on you guys.
-l don't think you get it.
-No, l do. You don't get it.
All right, the police are on my side.
Except they're too inept
to do anything about it.
Look, l'm the real Chris Barronson, okay?
Here, see?
All right? She stole my identity.
And if you guys know who she is...
you'd better talk some sense into her
before l find her myself.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
The DMV has his picture on file
back to the early '<i>9</i>0s.
The state police confirm
there were six identity theft reports...
filed by a man named Chris Barronson.
Looks like he's the real deal.
Which means
the girl you met in the diner isn't.
She probably gave me that name...
because it was on the credit card
she was using.
l've spent the day helping a con woman...
while the guy who needs help
wants nothing to do with me.
Helping the criminal may be
the only way to help the victim.
Since the real Chris won't talk to you,
focus on the fake one.
See if you can't keep her
from committing a murder today.
Right.
[cellphone ringing]
TRU: Hello.
JACK: <i>It's Jack.</i>
TRU: <i>What's up?</i>
JACK: Your friend's on the move.
TRU: She left the building?
JACK: <i>But don't worry.</i>
JACK: l'm keeping an eye on her.
TRU: <i>You foIIowed her?</i>
You seemed worried about her.
Thought l was doing you a favor.
TRU: <i>Where is she now?</i>
JACK: She's headed back
into your neighborhood.
But about an hour ago,
she was in a jewelry store downtown.
Did she buy anything?
Yeah, a necklace.
But she didn't keep it long.
She walked six blocks to a pawnshop...
and sold it for half of what
she just paid for it. Crazy.
<i>She's aImost home now.</i>
She's all yours. l got some errands to run.
Wait, Jack?
You got to let me hang up
so you can miss me.
Cute, but, no.
You followed her.
l can't help wondering why.
She looked like she might be in trouble.
And aside from a little white-collar crime,
she's harmless.
Just be careful.
She's not exactly who she seems.
Who is?
-Jack is following her?
-He was trying to help.
Listen, l want you to take this
before you go.
lt's the name and the number
of the cop l talked to, just in case.
Who's Tom Forrester?
He's an old college buddy of mine,
but l haven't talked to him in years. Why?
Yesterday, you had a note to call him.
Remember to find out
what it is you want to tell me.
We have to keep the days
as similar as possible.
Okay. l'll give him a ring.
He's a hell of a guy.
Great Dungeon Master.
God, did l just say that out loud?
[Soft instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
Harrison.
HARRlSON: Look, about today, l....
LlNDSAY: <i>Let me guess.</i>
<i>Not gonna work for you.</i>
No, not so much.
You lost all my stuff, didn't you?
No. lt's not that. lt's just....
lt just isn't the best day for it.
Why not?
Well, because, l got to....
lt just isn't. Okay?
Fine. Whatever. We'll just do it tomorrow,
same time, same place.
HARRlSON: l'll be there. l promise.
LlNDSAY: <i>Yeah. Bye.</i>
You better be right about this, Tru.
Excuse me, miss?
l didn't want you to forget this.
-Randall?
-Lindsay?
[Laughing] My God.
Feel like telling me who you really are?
l already told you. l'm Chris Barronson.
Look, don't bother. l know you're not.
l know you've been buying jewelry...
with someone else's credit card
and pawning it off for quick cash.
How did you know that?
lt doesn't really matter.
lt's just time for you to stop.
Just give this guy, Chris, his life back.
l will. Someday.
Someday isn't soon enough.
Trust me on this.
l don't trust anyone.
That's why l'm so good at what l do.
Stay out of it, Tru.
You're in over your head.
Hey, Tru. What a nice surprise.
How's it going?
TRU: Good, thanks.
l got a package for you delivered to me
inadvertently this morning.
Do you want to come up and....
There's this girl.
Right.
l've been wanting to ask her out.
You know what? l'll just drop it off later.
l'll save you the time, okay?
l'd be happy to come by.
l'd love to see your place.
-l'm actually just in a hurry, so....
-Okay.
Can l ask you one question?
Sorry, l'm in the middle of something.
But l'll catch up with you later, okay?
DAVlS: <i>What is she doing now?</i>
TRU: Looks like she's packing.
DAVlS: <i>What is she doing now?</i>
TRU: Looks like she's packing.
DAVlS: <i>That's good.</i>
<i>Maybe you spooked her enough...</i>
<i>so she'II be gone by the time</i>
<i>the reaI Chris Barronson shows up.</i>
Maybe, but we can't count on it.
-l talked to Tom Forrester, by the way.
-And?
He told me about his wife and his kids...
and his research
after leaving the Schenkman Center.
But it's certainly nothing
l need to discuss with you.
lt was worth a shot.
DAVlS: <i>You don't think</i>
<i>that the important thing...</i>
has anything to do with the kidney stone
l passed last week, do you?
Okay, probably not. l'll keep looking.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Beeping]
l know you think you can handle this,
but you're the one in over her head.
TRU: <i>It'II onIy get worse.</i>
<i>Running won't soIve anything.</i>
Let me help you
or l'll tell the police where to find you.
lt's your choice.
[Sustained buzzing]
lt was just so easy, you know?
Like free money.
And at first, l only did it to get by.
But now, it's....
God, you got to believe me.
l had no idea it would go this far.
Okay. But it has.
And now we have to do
something about it.
l'm scared.
The messages
this guy's been leaving for me.
What if l paid him back?
Do you think he would still
turn me in to the police?
You can pay him back?
Yeah, l could give him cash.
Really? You have that much money?
l told you, l was good.
lf only that were something to be proud of.
[Somber instrumental music]
You. You turned my life upside down.
She wants to make amends.
That's why l called.
Sure, now that l know where to find her.
-l'm so sorry.
-You're sorry?
-l'm so sorry.
-You're sorry?
-No, l really am.
-Sorry doesn't cover it.
Here. Maybe this will.
lt's the least l can do
with you giving me a second chance.
l almost forgot. Here.
The credit card l took out
in your name.
lf l ever hear from you again,
or if l see you--
You won't. l promise.
Fine.
CHRlS: l have a phone call to make.
And you?
You should be gone when l get back.
Thanks, Tru.
l know you probably don't care...
but my real name is Cathy.
lt's nice to meet you, Cathy.
CATHY: Here, let me get this.
TRU: No, l got it.
This one's on me.
Thank you again for everything.
TRU: Hey.
You caught me using a city vehicle
for personal business.
What vehicle?
l want to thank you
for helping me out today.
lt's nothing
you wouldn't have done for me. Thanks.
Still, l mean you took it upon yourself
to look out for someone...
l told you was in trouble,
no questions asked.
Should l have asked some?
l can't help thinking most people would.
Whatever's going on
between you and your friend...
it's none of my business.
-lt's never stopped you before.
-All right, fine.
Tell me.
And if l don't?
l'll ply you with alcohol
and pry it out of you.
Right.
Or you'll owe me one.
Lock up the van for me, will you?
-Keys?
-They must be inside.
-l talked to Tom Forrester.
-And?
He told me about his research
after leaving the Schenkman Center.
Here you go.
l guess you can lock up yourself.
CHRlS: Hey.
WAlTRESS: Hey.
Could l get a roast beef sandwich to go?
Sure thing.
-Nothing smaller?
-No, not tonight.
l'm sorry, but this bill's a fake.
You got to be kidding me.
You said your friend Tom
worked at the Schenkman Center, right?
Did you mention Jack
when you spoke to him?
No, why would l?
TRU: Jack had a letter
from the Schenkman Center in his coat.
l bet you found it first yesterday.
Why don't l give Tom another call?
Yeah, just let me know
what he says, okay?
Here we go again.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Beeping]
Lock yourself out?
Yeah, it happens to me
at least once a week.
Here, l'm sorry. l'm the new tenant.
CHRlS: l appreciate it.
JACK: You bet.
JACK: Here you go.
CHRlS: Thank you.
TRU: Matt?
[Mysterious instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Now l feel like someone's
been watching me.
There is this girl.
And she lives nearby.
[Dramatic instrumental music intensifies]
TRU: Chris.
<i>What is he doing?</i>
[Arresting instrumental music]
Matt?
[Racy instrumental music]
[Beeping]
TRU: Come on.
JACK: <i>HeIIo?</i>
Jack, it's Tru! l need to get in.
Hey, Tru. What are you doing
on this side of the street?
Please, Jack, l need to
get into Cathy's apartment right away.
Cathy? Who's Cathy?
Chris. Chris is Cathy.
The girl that you followed.
-Please, Jack, hurry!
-Okay.
<i>Let me just try and figure this thing out.</i>
<i>It's trickier than I thought.</i>
<i>Did that do it?</i>
Thanks. Excuse me.
JACK: <i>Tru, did that do it?</i>
Tru?
Tru?
[Matt exclaiming]
l'm telling you, stay away from her!
She's a nice girl!
Put it down, Matt.
MATT: He broke into her apartment!
He wants to hurt her!
l know you want to protect her,
but you don't know anything about her!
Yes, l do! l watched her every single day
since she moved in.
l know her better than anyone.
No, she's not who you think.
Look, she's a thief.
She stole this man's identity.
No. She can't be. She's perfect!
She would never do that!
lt's okay, Matt.
You're not the only one that she's fooled.
But l'm telling you the truth.
She's stolen thousands of dollars.
She's ruined people's lives.
She's a thief?
l'm sorry.
[Matt breathing heavily]
MATT: l'm sorry.
TRU: Are you okay?
Why did you come here?
l thought that we had an agreement.
Yeah, we did.
Till l found out
that the money she gave me was fake.
Now she's gone, l'm still broke...
and l'm probably
never gonna see her again.
You never know.
Stranger things have happened.
l don't understand what's taking so long.
lt's been 45 minutes already.
l'm very sorry.
Did my card not go through?
The card number's fine,
but our computer's down.
Just give us another minute,
we'll get you all sorted out, Miss Davies.
TRU: Heading out of town, Tru?
You know, it's a good thing
l don't believe every sob story l hear.
Mine, for example?
You almost had me.
But then you absolutely blew it
back there at the diner.
This one's on me.
You pulled out your camera cell phone
the second l put my credit card down.
All l had to do
was call the credit card company...
and report a stolen credit card.
l knew you had the number,
but l was hoping that you wouldn't use it.
Then l got the call.
WOMAN: <i>Miss, there's activity reported</i>
<i>on your credit card at A vaIon Car RentaI.</i>
TRU: Thank you.
ls it too late for me to explain?
To me? Yeah.
But l know a couple of guys
who'd be happy to listen.
[Police siren wailing]
TRU: Really, you had a good day?
LlNDSAY: <i>It was the best, Tru.</i>
The perfect afternoon
with the perfect guy.
Wait, you were with my brother?
No. Harrison was his usual self.
Called to cancel after l was already there.
But that's how l spotted Randall.
Randall?
l met him a few years ago
when l was studying abroad.
<i>He's actuaIIy in town for a few weeks</i>
<i>and he's a totaI opposite of your brother.</i>
TRU: Well, lucky break.
Just when l was starting to think
they didn't make them like this anymore.
Yeah, l know what you mean.
Good night, Tru.
LUC: [On Machine] <i>Hey, it's Luc.</i>
<i>I couIdn't get to the phone right now.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>
Hey, Luc, it's me, Tru.
l heard through the grapevine...
<i>that you missed out on that apartment</i>
<i>across the street...</i>
<i>and I just wanted to caII</i>
<i>and say that I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I know that we're not together anymore...</i>
but it would've been nice to be neighbors.
Just to know you were close.
<i>I'II taIk to you soon. I just wanted to caII.</i>
Okay, bye.
[Phone ringing]
Luc?
No, Tru. lt's me, l'm sorry.
l saw the morgue number and thought
he was working tonight. What's up?
l talked to my friend at Schenkman.
What l had to tell you
is definitely about Jack.
Turns out he was a patient there.
A patient?
But Schenkman's a psychiatric facility.
lt seems like he was there voluntarily.
He checked himself in
so he could check himself out.
Well, we knew
something was off with Jack, but--
DAVlS: <i>There's more.</i>
<i>When Jack committed himseIf,</i>
<i>he thought he was going crazy.</i>
But the doctors couldn't diagnosis it.
Going crazy how?
He thought he was reliving days.
[Slow instrumental music]
Reliving days?
Like me?
Exactly like you.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Rock music]
NARRATOR: <i>PreviousIy on</i> Tru Calling:
l relive days.
You relive days?
This is Mr. Harper.
He will be interviewing to replace Gardez.
Hey. Jack.
Thanks for making me feel so welcome.
lt's never easy being the new guy.
-Do you like working here?
-Actually, l do.
l understand.
You do? Not everyone does.
That's because most people believe
that only the living need help.
l just can't get a read on him,
for some reason.
lt's like one minute he's in your face
and almost obnoxious.
The next, he's charming,
trying to be your best friend.
When Jack committed himself,
he thought he was going crazy.
Going crazy how?
He thought he was reliving days.
Like me?
Exactly like you.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Soft instrumental music]
Come on. You've got to let me talk to him.
He was in a psych ward, Tru.
He was diagnosed as being delusional.
And so would l, if l'd gone to a doctor
claiming to be reliving days.
But what makes you so sure
he's not just like me?
And out of all the gin joints in the world,
he walks into mine.
-l did.
-You were meant to.
Maybe he was meant to,
but we won't find out unless l talk to him.
And say what? ''How about
this whole reliving days thing?''
TRU: Yeah, why not?
lf it's true, he'd be relieved to know
that there's someone like him.
The way you are?
Okay. Yeah, sure.
TRU: lt would be nice to have someone
to share the responsibility with.
What if he's been doing it for a while?
He may know more than we do.
That's assuming we can trust his answers.
Come on, Davis.
You don't trust the waitress to give
you decaf till you see what pot she uses.
DAVlS: Coffee's important to me.
And so are you.
You know
l'm gonna have to talk to him soon.
l know.
[Gasps]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Panting]
[Groans]
WOMAN: Oh, my God!
MAN: Call <i>9</i>1 1 .
[Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[Theme music]
Help me.
[Pop song playing softly on radio]
Tru.
Hi.
You must be Randall.
l've been hearing about you all week.
l can't stay. l have to get back to work.
But first, Lindsay tells me
it's absolutely vital that you like me.
So what can l do?
You can leave,
so we can start talking about you.
RANDALL: All right.
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.
LlNDSAY: Here, hold my cell.
Okay, what's going on?
Remember how we always said
when someone proposed to us...
we'd call the other one and the first thing
we'd say was, ''Don't drop the phone.''
-Well, don't drop the phone.
-No.
Yes! He asked me last night.
He wants to get married this weekend.
What did you say?
l asked for more time.
Do you love him?
Yeah, l think l might.
LlNDSAY: God, am l crazy?
lt's not like he's a total stranger.
We dated that semester abroad--
But you've only been back together
for a week.
Great. So we both agree l'm totally crazy.
No, not if you asked for time
to think about it.
l did.
LlNDSAY: l told him l'd let him know
by the end of the day.
You okay?
lf by ''okay,'' you mean
25 minutes late for work, yeah.
But if you're on your way out,
avoid downtown.
-Construction?
-No, there was a bad accident.
The radio said a dump truck
plowed into the Number 6 bus.
-There's all kinds of gridlock.
-Are we expecting any bodies?
l wouldn't be surprised.
Do you ever notice how we always end up
in this hallway at the same time?
Maybe someone
is trying to tell us something.
[Romantic instrumental music]
Anyways, l know you're in a rush.
-Right, yes. l'll see you later.
-Okay.
So, you probably heard.
A certain lovely young woman
has seen the error of her ways...
and is returning into the arms
of her man, Harrison Davies.
Who are we talking about here?
Who are we talking about?
Lindsay, of course.
HARRlSON: She left a message.
She needs to talk.
-lt's reconciliation time, baby.
-You never know.
A message like that
could mean a lot of things.
You should've heard her voice.
l could hear
how much she cares about me.
-Harr.
-Yeah?
She's thinking about getting married
to someone else.
What?
[Somber instrumental music]
Why would you say that?
TRU: His name's Randall Thompson...
and they've been seeing each other
for a week.
A week? She just met the guy.
Actually, they dated
when she was studying abroad...
and now he's an investment banker
at Burkess and Wells....
Come on. What's he after?
Not everyone's on the scam, Harry.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
He's Euro, right?
l'm sure a green card would make
it real easy for him in this country.
You've never met him.
HARRlSON: Don't have to.
He's working an angle...
so he can keep doing this investment
banking crap on this side of the Atlantic.
lt doesn't matter what you or l think.
This is Lindsay's decision.
Stay out of it, Harr.
Dr. Frank Colvin,
mid-40s, victim of a heart attack.
Dropped on the street
a couple of hours ago.
TRU: Time of death?
JACK: <i>8</i>:10 a.m.
Sorry about crashing here
after the late shift last night.
You guys should try sleeping
on that sofa in there.
l swear, this guy's the only guy in here
who feels worse than l do this morning.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
What, did l miss a memo?
[Phone ringing]
-That's probably not important.
-l can handle everything in here.
You sure?
[Phone continues ringing]
You know, Davis is an interesting guy.
But why do l get the feeling
we'll come here one morning...
and all the corpses are gonna be
dressed up for an imaginary tea party?
Tru, l can appreciate the silent treatment
as well as anyone else...
but what's going on?
l can't even piss you off lately.
[Somber instrumental music]
See, you want the truth.
-Davis and l, we--
-Let me save you the tap dance.
This is about the letter l got
from the Schenkman Center last week?
-Partly.
-l had a feeling.
-Look, l can explain that.
-You don't have to.
Why?
Because l know
it can be kind of hard to explain.
Jack, what you thought
was happening to you...
it happens to me.
[Tense instrumental music]
l think we should go get a drink.
JACK: You know,
l had my suspicions about you.
Running off all the time, the way
you're so invested in these people's lives.
-Why didn't you say anything?
-Why didn't you?
-lt's just, l can't believe--
-That there's two of us. l know.
l can't believe l'm finally talking
to someone who doesn't think l'm crazy.
-How sick are you of having--
-The same conversation...
over and over again.
TRU: And then having to act surprised,
like you hadn't heard it.
-''Oh, my God. No way.''
-''So interesting.''
-So when did it start?
-For me, it started a while ago.
l woke up after a near-death experience...
and found that it was the same day
over again.
And now l had this job to do.
What about you?
Almost a year ago now.
On the anniversary of my mother's death.
Really? Your mother?
So bodies ask for your help, too?
Yeah, although
it hasn't been happening lately.
Now l understand why.
Obviously, they prefer to go to you.
Can't say l blame them.
But you've gotta admit,
it's pretty amazing.
TRU: Being able to save people's lives,
to change things, make things right.
ls that what we're doing?
l guess l just wonder sometimes.
-About?
-Consequences. Ripples in fate.
JACK: How what we do affects others.
MAN: Jimmy, l got some seats over here.
There's a dartboard over there.
Let's go play.
So, who else knows about you?
First l told Harrison, and then Davis.
JACK: You told Davis?
He figured it out on his own.
He's really helped me navigate this.
At least now l understand
why you're single.
What's that supposed to mean?
JACK: You told Luc and he bolted, right?
First of all, nobody bolted.
lt just wasn't working.
Second of all, l never told him.
Because you were afraid he'd bolt, right?
TRU: Who have you told?
JACK: Me?
Nobody.
lt tends to make things complicated.
[Pager beeping]
Speaking of bolting, l got a pickup.
Well, thanks.
God, it's so nice to know
l'm not in this alone.
Yeah.
l'll see you later tonight.
JACK: Or depending on the body,
maybe l'll see you this morning.
Okay.
Hey, Lindsay.
l did it. l finally made up my mind
about Randall's proposal.
And?
l said no.
<i>And he said goodbye.</i>
He's such a great guy, Tru.
lt just felt too fast.
l am sure that you did the right thing.
The day will come when you'll tell me
not to drop the phone again...
<i>and then it'II be the right guy,</i>
<i>the one who was meant to be.</i>
You really believe that?
Of course, rebound girl.
Thanks, Tru. Good night.
Good night.
DAVlS: Someone's got a little extra bounce
in their step.
Someone's got a little tequila
in their system.
But more importantly, l talked to Jack.
-And?
-He's just like me.
He understands everything l've been
going through because he does it, too.
-You told him about you?
-Of course.
Was he surprised?
l guess.
Just getting it out there was so liberating.
TRU: And he brought up
something interesting.
He asked if l ever thought about
how what we do could have a ripple affect.
Well, yes.
Every time you save someone,
it changes the course of history.
DAVlS: You not only affect that life...
but the lives of everyone
that person will touch.
DAVlS: Tru, the power that you have
is awesome:
to change history for the better.
[Serious instrumental music]
What is it?
lt's just the way he was talking about it.
l'm not so sure
Jack always thinks it's for the better.
Could l get a hand out here?
l got a body.
Suicide, found over at Chelsea River.
What's going on with the good doctor?
No one came to claim him?
-That's kind of sad.
-Yeah, it is sad.
What?
Nothing.
You told him, didn't you?
lt's okay. You can trust him.
TRU: Here, let me help you with the body.
COLVlN: <i>Wait.</i>
BOTH: What?
DAVlS: l didn't say....
Here we go.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Help them.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
Jack?
TRU: <i>Did you?</i>
JACK: Yeah.
Looks like they're playing our song.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
So, what do you remember
about the doctor?
6' tall, mid 40s, dark blond hair.
lt's <i>8</i>:02. You said Colvin died around <i>8</i>:10?
According to witnesses.
Do you remember
where you picked him up?
Tru, l've never been
much of a morning person.
TRU: <i>Come on, Jack.</i>
JACK: 3rd and Cliffwood.
TRU: <i>East or West?</i>
-East.
-Meet you there.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
-East 3rd and Cliffwood. Where is he?
-l don't know.
lt's <i>8</i>:0<i>9</i>. He should be here.
-What?
-lt might have been West 3rd.
[Fast-paced instrumental music continues]
TRU: Excuse me.
[Serious instrumental music]
[Serious instrumental music]
l'm calling it. <i>8</i>:10 a.m.
-That man is dead because of me.
-That's not true.
l could've sworn it was East 3rd.
-We can't always be perfect.
-Have you ever lost anyone?
Yes. l understand how you feel.
lt's hard to believe
anyone understands how l feel.
Dr. Frank Colvin.
He's the one that asked for help?
Yeah, we didn't make it to him on time.
DAVlS: What do you mean by ''we''?
TRU: Jack and l.
-Together?
-Yeah.
Thus the ''and.''
So you guys talked?
Right. Sorry, l told you yesterday.
Of course, you don't remember.
Jack and l spoke.
And, Davis, he is another me.
Really? He said that?
lt's incredible, isn't it?
Yeah, it's incredible.
Just one sec.
[Cell phone ringing]
lt's Lindsay.
l'm supposed to be meeting Randall.
This guy proposed to her.
Go ahead, you can take the call.
That's okay. l'll call her back.
Now, about what you're not saying....
l don't get it. There was two of you,
and you still couldn't save him?
Jack got the street wrong.
-Right. Wrong street.
-Seriously, it was an honest mistake.
When did you last make a mistake
that cost someone their life?
-Why are you being so hard on him?
-Why aren't you?
You beat yourself up
over the slightest misstep.
You're gonna give Jack a free pass
over someone's life?
l told you, it wasn't his fault.
[Tense instrumental music]
What's going on with you, anyway?
Can't you just be happy for me
that l found Jack...
or does every silver lining
have to have a cloud?
-Sometimes it does.
-l'm sorry, l can't live like that.
l have to take victories
where l can find them.
Since when is losing someone
considered a victory?
JACK: He's right, Tru.
Maybe we just have to admit
we lost this round.
l don't think that we have.
lt's good to see
we're all on the same page again.
-You were saying?
-l don't think this is over yet.
Dr. Colvin died of a massive heart attack.
We couldn't have stopped that
even if we got there on time.
And he said, ''Help them,'' not ''help me.''
Maybe he was supposed to die.
JACK: lnteresting.
TRU: Everyone asks for help for a reason.
We just have to find out
what his reason was.
[Serious instrumental music]
You got something to add, Davis?
l was thinking, if every rewind
is a matter of life and death...
and the doctor said, ''Help them,''
you have to figure...
there's at least one person connected
to this man who will die today.
<i>Maybe more.</i>
The question is: Who is it,
and can you find them before it's too late?
Since no one claimed the body yesterday,
we should start with the next of kin.
[Serious instrumental music continues]
Lindsay, you're my best friend,
and l believe in you.
Somehow, l know you'll make
the right decision about Randall today.
All right? l'll call you later. Bye.
How'd it sound?
Too surprised? Not surprised enough?
lt was perfect. l almost thought
you were worried she might say yes.
Not today.
So, you think the doctor's son
is the one we're supposed to save?
He's the next of kin and his only family.
[Bell buzzing]
Can l help you?
Are you Marc Colvin?
Yeah.
We work at the morgue downtown...
and l'm sorry to have to tell you this...
but your father passed away this morning.
Heart attack.
Yeah, it would be.
We were wondering if you'd mind coming
down to the morgue to claim the body.
l'd rather not.
Thank you for telling me about it, though.
But you're his son.
[Soft instrumental music]
My father and l weren't very close.
lt's none of your business,
but he didn't exactly approve of me.
Since Frank Colvin
never claimed me as a son...
l don't think l should have to be the one
to claim him now.
MARC: Why don't you try his office?
That's where he lived most of his life.
HARRlSON: What's up, doc?
DAVlS: God!
[Upbeat instrumental music]
ls Tru around?
No, she's out in the field.
Can l take a message?
l wanted to tell her in person.
l'll tell you anyway.
l've got some great news about Lindsay.
She already knows about that.
How does she know?
l just got the message.
DAVlS: Because Tru has been
talking to Lindsay about the guy all week.
What guy?
The guy that Lindsay
is thinking of marrying.
[Stuttering]
l didn't say anything about marriage.
This is awkward, isn't it?
Only if you don't keep talking.
Come on, Davis.
What guy?
Randall Thompson, l think.
An investment banker with an lrish accent,
which women find so appealing.
l don't understand
why accents have such an effect...
because when you think about--
He's foreign. He's from another country.
He just lives here.
Suddenly, he just pops the question
and asks some chick to marry him?
Hello? What does that say to you?
That he's impulsive and likes to travel.
WOMAN: No, l'm actually a referral.
Dr. Colvin left me a message
asking me to come by today.
GRACE: Dr. Colvin's office, this is Grace.
Can you hold, please?
GRACE: Miss Casola, the doctor will
be here soon. Please take a seat and wait.
He said 10:00 a.m. l've been waiting.
You know what? Forget it.
GRACE: Sorry about that, Mrs. Hoffman.
Your test results will be in this afternoon,
and l'll have him call you first thing.
Okay, bye. Hi, how can l help you?
My name is Jack Harper,
and we're with the city morgue.
l'm sorry to be the one to tell you this...
but Dr. Colvin died from a heart attack
at around <i>8</i>:00 a.m.
We were wondering
if someone from this office...
could come down to the morgue
to identify the body.
Right.
[Somber instrumental music]
GRACE: We need to close for the day.
Look in the doctor's book...
and call anyone
who's scheduled for an appointment?
Lily is probably still waiting for him.
Someone should probably tell her.
Lily?
She's a waitress
at the coffee shop across the street.
She's going to community college...
and Frank was tutoring her.
TRU: Let us help you. lt's on the way.
We'll tell her.
So, you think
this girl might be one of ''them''?
You said it yourself. Ripples.
One person's life touches so many others.
How many lives did Dr. Colvin touch?
And if Davis is right,
which one of them is gonna die today?
LlLY: Oh, my God.
-What happened?
-He had a heart attack.
l served him coffee every morning
for over a year.
LlLY: One day he saw me drawing...
a sketch of the human anatomy
from my biology text.
He corrected me.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
On what?
He told me the left lung
is smaller than the right lung...
to make room for the heart.
LlLY: He said that
that's how he'd remembered it...
because it's like life.
The heart always comes first.
Excuse me.
[Sentimental instrumental music
continues]
The man Lily knew and the man
his son knew were two different people.
You know how families are.
They always save the most
dysfunctional stuff for each other.
JACK: Hey, man, Lily left her book here.
You can probably catch her
at the bus stop.
TRU: Which one?
WAlTER: Down the block. The Number 6.
A bad accident.
The radio said a dump truck
plowed into the Number 6 bus.
TRU: Yesterday there was an accident.
JACK: Lily's bus?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
There it is.
[Tense instrumental music]
TRU: Wait, stop!
JACK: Stop the bus!
TRU: Hold on!
JACK: Lily!
TRU: Stop the bus!
JACK: Wait!
TRU: Jack, no!
[Brakes screeching]
Jack, what the hell were you thinking?
[Horn blaring]
Are you telling me...
you've never jumped in front
of an oncoming vehicle to save someone?
Are you okay?
l think so.
You forgot this.
Thank you.
DAVlS: So Jack stopped the bus. Okay.
That's okay. You're allowed to be wrong
about him. l forgive you.
-All right, what now?
-That's the thing.
Yesterday you and l talked about
how one life touches so many others.
TRU: How do l know this is what Dr. Colvin
meant when he said, ''Help them''?
Anybody die in the accident yesterday?
That's just it. Luc wasn't sure.
Although Jack thinks--
Jack thinks? What do you think?
What l was gonna tell you,
if you'd let me...
was that Jack and l were talking
about lives touching--
You told Jack
about what we talked about?
Come on, it's not as if it was classified.
l didn't even know
that you talked to me about it until now.
What's with you?
Why are you acting like this?
l know it must be a big relief
to share this with someone.
But ever since you learned
the truth about Jack...
you're walking around with blinders on,
which is exactly what l think he wants.
Please don't tell me you're jealous.
l'm not jealous.
-l'm skeptical, which you used to be.
-What's there to doubt?
Jack's practically proven
that he's here to help.
-Has he?
-He jumped in front of a bus.
To stop an accident,
which you just said yourself...
might not have killed anyone.
You have to ask yourself,
''Why Jack? Why now?''
Why would the two of you
be in the same place at the same time?
<i>I know that</i>
<i>you don't want to be aIone in this...</i>
but something here isn't right.
And something about him isn't right.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
You okay?
Fine. My mind's just on other things.
You feel like sharing?
l just want to follow up a little
on Dr. Colvin's call for help.
Tru, we saved a busload of people.
Our work here is done.
You've got to learn
to take yes for an answer.
The son might know something.
l just want to try him again.
-All right, let me grab my stuff.
-No, it's fine. l got it.
No reason for both of us
to be obsessive, right?
MARC: Why should l waste my time?
GRACE: Because it's the right thing to do.
You're his son.
MARC: l needn't pretend it meant
more to me than it did to him.
GRACE: Can't you, just for today,
do this one little thing for him?
TRU: l'm sorry to intrude.
You again.
TRU: Your father's body is still unclaimed,
and nobody's even come to identify it.
What, you both go
to the same school of etiquette?
-l have my reasons. Good ones.
-We're not here to judge.
You didn't know my father.
He was the man who convinced
a 15-year-old kid that he was a failure...
because he wanted to do something
other than follow in his father's footsteps.
lt was years before l realized that
''artist'' didn't mean ''disappointment.''
Okay, so your father wasn't a saint.
But he tried to help people.
Did you know he was tutoring someone?
A girl in junior college?
Really? Was she studying biology?
Something medical?
[Soft instrumental music]
MARC: Yeah.
Dad was a decent guy
if you met his expectations, but if not....
Let's just say that l know how it feels
to go unclaimed.
Excuse me.
[Soft instrumental music continues]
He wouldn't return my phone calls.
l just wanted to ask him
to help me choose a mortuary...
pick out one of Frank's suits.
All the things
that should be done by family.
l guess l am alone in this.
Help them.
No, you're not.
-You Randall Thompson?
-How'd you.... Where's my assistant?
-Sit down. This will only take a second.
-Who are you?
Harrison Davies.
RANDALL: Lindsay's Harrison.
HARRlSON: Right.
l'm only gonna say this once.
You listen up.
lf you think you can take
this sweet, innocent girl...
get some green card,
and break her heart...
l don't care where you go,
l don't care what you do...
but l'll find you and break you.
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
My grandfather gave this to
my grandmother when they got engaged.
My grandfather gave this to
my grandmother when they got engaged.
My father gave it to my mother.
l was hoping to get it resized
so that Lindsay could wear it...
when we move to London.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
London?
The firm's sending me back.
l've been promoted.
And l want to take Lindsay with me...
as my wife.
See, l don't need a green card. l need her.
l keep seeing him all day.
Ever since you told me.
lt happens for a while.
After my mom died, l saw her all the time.
At the grocery store,
in the carpool line at school.
lt will stop.
What if l don't want it to?
Gardenias.
Frank gave them to me for my birthday.
This may be none of my business but....
[Sentimental instrumental music]
l loved him.
Did he know?
l never said anything...
but somehow l always thought
there would be time...
to let him know what he meant to me.
[Crying] There is no time, is there?
Frank was always doing things like this:
taking on other doctors' lost causes,
helping people.
''Lost causes''? Meaning terminals?
Her HCG levels were elevated,
which usually signifies inoperable cancer.
But Dr. Colvin ordered additional tests
to be run on her blood samples.
May l see that?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
According to this, the patient
recently suffered a miscarriage.
TRU: Pregnancy would cause
her levels to be off.
That means she was misdiagnosed
by her previous doctor.
She's not going to die.
l'm sure Frank meant to tell her.
TRU: ''Nadine Casola.''
GRACE: Miss Casola, the doctor will
be here soon. Please take a seat.
She was in your office today, but she left.
-Yes.
-So she still believes she's dying.
Grace, you have to call her. She needs
to hear this news right now. Please.
Oh, dear.
lt's ringing.
-There's no answer.
-Keep calling.
TRU: Hello?
JACK: Sounds like you're in a rush.
The son put you onto something?
TRU: <i>I know who was supposed to die.</i>
Nadine Casola. A suicide.
She was misdiagnosed.
l'm on my way to the....
l got a body.
Suicide, found at Chelsea River.
Wait a minute.
You picked her up yesterday.
<i>The suicide at CheIsea River.</i>
Why didn't you say anything
on seeing her at the doctor's office?
Maybe l just didn't recognize her.
Sometimes suicides don't look all neat
and tidy when you get to the scene, Tru.
A life is in danger.
Can't we argue about this later?
Wait, Jack. Why didn't you tell me
what you knew?
l've got to go, Tru. My cell's dying.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
[Tense instrumental music]
Nadine!
JACK: We're too late.
-l gotta see for myself.
-Why are you being like this?
-l'm trying to do my job.
-So am l.
You don't want me to save her.
You want her to die.
-So help me God, if you don't let go!
-Tru, think a minute.
Nadine Casola is supposed to die.
Why should you change that?
Because someone asked me to.
Because l can.
That's not good enough.
You have no idea what you're doing.
lf you save someone who shouldn't
be here, there are consequences.
Do you think l'm messing up
some grand plan? Maybe l am the plan!
lf someone needs my help,
l am not gonna stand by and watch.
And l'm not gonna stop you.
This time.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
What did you do?
You're okay. You're gonna be okay.
Stay with me, okay? lt's gonna be all right.
Come on, Nadine. lt's okay.
You're gonna be fine.
TRU: Yes, l want to report an emergency.
l need an ambulance.
TRU: l have an overdose.
She's still breathing.
<i>You're gonna be fine, Nadine.</i>
HARRlSON: Hi.
What are you....
l never returned your key.
LlNDSAY: Harrison, tonight isn't--
HARRlSON: l heard about the proposal.
And?
And l checked this guy out.
-l know it pisses you off.
-Harrison.
You need to know something...
before you make a mistake
that you'll regret for the rest of your life.
You should go. You shouldn't be here.
HARRlSON: Say yes.
Say yes.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
HARRlSON: He is the real deal.
He's the better guy.
A better guy than l could be for you.
At least, right now.
And he really loves you.
Say yes.
[Sentimental instrumental music
continues]
[Lindsay crying]
Thank you.
l see you chose the suit.
He wore it one night
when he was going to a concert.
He looked very distinguished.
l still want to help.
lf there's anything l can do....
[Knocking at door]
Hi. Grace?
LlLY: l'm Lily.
l came to give back Dr. Colvin's book.
Please.
Hi.
Hi.
-Here.
-Thank you.
Frank spoke so highly of you.
You, too.
Did you like the gardenias?
How did you know about that?
God, he agonized over
which ones to get you: gardenias, roses.
He finally chose gardenias
because of what they meant.
Unspoken love.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
l'll put this in his medical collection.
lt was very nice to finally meet you.
l'm really sorry it had to be this way.
lt's so ironic.
Frank touched so many people.
And the one person
he wanted to help the most, he couldn't.
-You mean....
-His son.
GRACE: Frank just never knew
how to tell him.
[Sentimental instrumental music
continues]
Thanks for coming.
You said on the phone l had to sign
something, then this would be over.
Right, a notarized statement.
l get your signature,
we can release the body...
and you'll never have to think
of your father again.
GRACE: Please, come in.
MARC: Grace, l've got a lot of work to do.
She told me that this whole thing
was gonna just take a few....
[Sentimental instrumental music]
He's been buying them
from galleries for years.
l don't....
He wanted to be with you.
<i>This was as cIose as he couId get.</i>
l thought that he didn't....
Why didn't he say anything?
Maybe he thought there was time.
TRU: Hey, stranger.
We've gotta stop meeting like this.
Do we?
-Tru, l understand--
-l got something pointed out to me today.
We never have as much time as we think.
Meaning?
l don't want to stand around
and wait for someday to come.
l want to make it work with us.
l understand that you're serious.
But what's different now that's
gonna make things better between us?
LUC: Unless there's something you want to
say that you couldn't or wouldn't before...
what's gonna keep us
from going in the same circles?
This time there is something different.
[Soft instrumental music]
This weekend, let's talk.
TRU: About everything.
Okay.
[Soft instrumental music continues]
TRU: l tried to call, but you weren't around.
l saved a life today.
That's good.
Jack tried to stop me.
TRU: You were right, Davis...
and l should've listened.
But l didn't want to hear
what you were saying.
So l'm just really sorry that--
-l'm sorry, too. l just kind of lost--
-Davis, just let me do this, okay?
You said that l'm different
because of this gift that l have...
and l've gotten to a place
where l can accept that.
But what l don't want to be is alone.
And l wanted so badly to believe in Jack...
that l ignored the one person
who's been with me all along.
[Soft instrumental music]
l needed to know there was someone else
out there who was like me.
But Jack, he's not even close.
No, he's not.
lt's not just supernatural theory.
lt's scientific fact.
From Eastern philosophy
to Newton's Third Law of Motion...
they all say the same thing.
That every force
has an equal and opposite force.
l should've said something sooner,
but l didn't have any real proof until today.
You're right about Jack. He is not like you.
He is the opposite of you.
-You save lives and he....
-Takes them.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Rock music]
Help me.
He's gone.
He must've taken off
as soon as he realized we were on to him.
Yeah. Gone. Almost.
-What's on your mind?
-Well, here's the thing.
We know who you are. You are life.
You give a second chance to those
that have died before their time...
-and we know who Jack is.
-My opposite.
-Choice adjective excluded.
-Right.
He relives days to ensure that
those victims once again die.
Okay, so we know that.
Here's my best guess.
The next time that your day restarts...
our friend Jack Harper
will make his return...
because it's clear why he came here
two months ago.
His work is undone.
-He came to find his opposite.
-And stop me.
[telephone ringing]
<i>Hey, it's Tru. Leave a message.</i>
<i>Hey, it's Lindsay.</i>
<i>I know it's Iike 6.:00 a.m.,</i>
<i>but I had to caII and say one thing.</i>
5:15.
l'm getting freaking married today, Tru.
Can you believe that?
lt still doesn't mean l'll pick up the phone.
<i>My God! And I aIso noticed you RSVP'd,</i>
<i>pIus one.</i>
So, who are you bringing?
All right, never mind.
l'll just call you later. Bye.
l've driven women to drink.
l've driven women to other women.
But l have never driven a woman
to the altar...
within a month of dumping her.
Look, here's the thing. l love Lindsay...
but she's never been
very good at being alone.
l blew it, you know?
l was undependable, unreliable.
But ever since this Randall guy,
l have decided...
that l'm gonna be a better man.
You know, someone l can be proud of.
Someone you can be proud of.
A new leaf, so to speak.
-A new leaf?
-Well, yeah. l'm a young guy...
it's never too late to change your spots.
Speaking of sudden character
transformations, any luck finding Jack?
No, nothing.
l scoured the town, just like you asked.
l went to bars, strip joints.
-About that new leaf?
-Pacing myself.
l'll tell you who l have run into lately. Luc.
-So, you've been avoiding him.
-Here's the thing.
The last time l spoke to Luc,
l promised him l'd tell him about me.
But as long as l don't tell him,
l can still have hope for us.
'Cause l know that as soon as l do,
l won't even have that.
No, maybe.
But maybe not. But, see, the point is...
that you will never know unless you try.
And if l can turn a new leaf, anyone can.
-l gotta go, Wonder Woman.
-Bye.
-Hey, l hope l'm not interrupting.
-No, come here.
Watch this. lt's still cooking.
The photo sits in the developer
and the chemicals draw out the image.
Just give it a couple more seconds and....
lt's an old roll l never developed.
-She looks familiar.
-Yeah.
-Ex-girlfriend.
-Sounds complicated.
lt is. Just like her.
l'm sorry if you feel like
l've been avoiding you.
Well, l'm sorry, too.
Mainly because you're so damn good at it.
Look. Maybe heart-to-heart's
not your thing, and that's fine.
-No law says you have to explain--
-How about tonight?
-Tonight?
-Yes.
Come to Lindsay's wedding with me,
and l will explain everything.
-Semiformal, right?
-l'll see you at 6:00?
Okay.
But, hey, Luc?
Just remember, she is complicated.
Right.
Harrison.
Jack. What the hell are you doing here?
-l came to see a friend.
-Great.
You let me know when he shows up.
Look, l know Tru wants you to think
l'm the enemy. l'm not.
Your sister and l
just see things differently, that's all.
Right. She saves people...
-and you kill them.
-l'm not a killer.
Straight up. When a bullet gets shot
into a man's chest...
l don't pull the trigger.
When a drunk driver takes out a family
of four, l'm not behind the wheel.
But when those people ask
for my sister's help...
you're not exactly lending a hand now,
are you?
Death can be tragic.
Death can be unfair. But as much as
we may all hate to admit it...
death is inevitable. l'm merely helping
fate get what it wants.
And you're telling me this because?
Because she listens to you.
And you love her.
And l know that you will find a way
to make her stop.
Stop saving the lives of people
who are supposed to die.
Stop messing with fate. And stop
screwing with the order of the universe.
Yeah. Okay. No.
No, it's okay.
Don't worry, l'll take care of it.
l'll be right there.
But she'll never stop,
and l'll never ask her to.
So do yourself a favor, friend.
You stay the hell away from me...
and my sister.
We're gathered here today
to celebrate the union of two people.
Lindsay and Randall. Two people
who have found each other...
in a world where we rarely slow down
to let ourselves be found.
And to celebrate that love, the bride has
asked her very good friend, Tru Davies...
to read a passage today. Tru?
''l carry your heart with me
(l carry it in my heart)
''l fear no fate (for you are my fate,
my sweet)
''i want no world (for beautiful
you are my world, my true)
''and it's you are whatever a moon
has always meant
''and whatever a sun will always sing
is you
''here is the deepest secret
nobody knows''
Excuse me just a moment.
-Your cell was off. There was no other--
-Davis, what's wrong?
Your brother. He's been shot.
-He's got bullet trauma, single entry.
-Doesn't look good.
Let's set up the rapid infusers,
and get a truckload of O-Neg.
Could be a hole through the anterior LV.
Get the thoracic surgeon on call, stat!
Get him to Trauma before he drains
into the pleural cavity. Not a lot of time!
God, Harrison!
l'm his sister, what happened to him?
EMT radioed ahead,
they found him in a house on Bank Street.
l'll ask. lf anything happens,
l promise l'll ask.
No, you are not gonna die.
Do you hear me? You'll be fine.
Let us do our job. That's all you can do.
-Any word?
-No.
lt's okay. lt's Harrison.
He's a fighter, you know?
He's gonna be okay.
l'm so sorry about the wedding.
The wedding can wait.
Lindsay belongs with you.
Hello. l'm looking for a patient.
Harrison Davies?
Excuse me.
l'm sorry, ma'am. He's still in surgery.
l'm Harrison's sister. Do you know him?
Not really. l was the one who called <i>9</i>1 1 .
-He was shot.
-Your were with him?
No, l mean, it's my ex.
He just gets so jealous.
l am so sorry. l shouldn't have come here.
-l just wanted to make sure he was okay.
-Your ex? Who's.... Wait!
Dad.
l was in town for a meeting.
They found my card in Harrison's wallet.
He's hurt, Dad. lt's not good.
We don't know anything yet.
l'm gonna find the doctor.
He's still in surgery.
They just told me to wait here.
Okay. We'll wait.
Excuse me.
Hey!
l want you out of here right now!
You are not welcome here!
l came to see my friend.
You had something to do with this,
l know you did.
This morning
l went to your brother's place.
Our conversation ended badly,
so l called him to clarify.
A paramedic answered the phone.
l got worried.
lf anything happens to him,
l'm holding you responsible.
Do you understand that? lt is on you!
RlCHARD: Tru
-Tru, sweetheart.
-No.
They did everything that they could.
No.
-No, he can't be.
-Tru!
Talk to me. Talk to me, Harry!
-Miss, you're not supposed to be in here.
-He needs me.
You said....
Harry, you always said you'd ask me.
Please, l'm right here.
Just ask me.
Sweetheart, come on.
l'll be waiting at the morgue.
l won't leave you.
l'm always by your side.
Tru.
You can't let him win.
<i>Hey, it's Tru. Leave a message.</i>
<i>-Hey, it's Lindsay. Look, I know--</i>
-Thank God!
<i>But I'm getting freaking married today.</i>
<i>Can you beIieve that?</i>
Yeah, let's hope so.
l'm only a few minutes--
lt's good to see you, too!
l tried to reach you all morning.
l called your house, l called your cell.
l'm a heavy sleeper. What?
-l went by your place. You weren't there.
-Why? What's going on?
Today isn't gonna be your day, Harrison.
Today's the day that
l'm gonna be a better man.
-Today's the day that l'm gonna--
-Die.
Let me get this straight. l'm dead,
in the hospital, and l ask for your help?
Fortunately, yeah.
Wow.
-So was Lindsay there?
-What?
Lindsay. Was she there at the hospital?
Yeah, she postponed the wedding
as soon as she heard you were shot.
Okay.
That is great! Yes!
So, were people sad
and, like, tears flowing and--
-Harrison.
-What?
Well, come on! How many times
does a guy get to die and come back?
Set the scene for me.
l can set the scene for you,
or l can keep you alive.
-Which do you prefer?
-Fine.
Okay. First of all, who are you dating?
Dating? No one.
Wrong time to be coy, Harry.
There was a woman at the hospital.
Said you were shot by her jealous ex
on Bank Street.
Do you know anyone who lives
on Bank Street?
No one.
Look, there's no girlfriend.
There's no jealous exes.
There's no Bank Street. Are you sure
it was me who asked for help yesterday?
Okay, we may not know why you
were killed, but we know one thing.
Your death is entirely preventable.
So let me ask you this.
On a scale of one to ten...
how much weeping
are we talking about here?
Harrison, everything you did yesterday,
we have to do differently today.
Okay. So where to?
The place you were least likely
to be yesterday.
How can you be so sure
l wasn't here yesterday?
Because the last book you read
had pictures in it.
That's a good point. Yeah.
-l got here as fast as l could.
-Hey.
-What?
-l'm so sorry.
Please accept my condolences.
You were so...young.
Dude, l'm still alive. l died yesterday.
Why don't we talk in private.
This one's personal,
but you're doing everything right.
l can't think of any reason
why you can't win this one.
l can.
Jack came by the hospital last night.
You don't remember me telling you this...
but yesterday he showed up
at Harrison's apartment.
You don't think Jack
has anything to do with....
No, not yesterday.
But if Jack is my opposite, then today....
He'll make sure that fate plays out
the same way.
Meaning, it's his job
to make sure Harrison dies.
Oops. Sorry.
Hello.
He seems to be handling it okay.
He wanted an estimate of number
of tears people shed last night, in gallons.
Okay, don't worry.
l'll take care of it. No, l'll be right there.
Look, this is probably something
you don't want to hear.
-But there is someplace l need to be.
-No way. Not a chance.
Someone's in a jam
and they need my help. lt's important.
-No!
-Probably called yesterday, too.
Who is it, and what do they want?
Need l remind you, you died yesterday.
All right, look.
This may sound stupid, but ever since
Lindsay met this Randall guy...
l took stock.
And l'm tired of being the screwup.
Look, there's this Rec Center
around the corner from my place.
They have all these sorts of programs
for these kids.
Well, the other day l just walk in
to get change for the meter...
and l walk out someone's big brother.
-Who's the kid?
-Ethan McCrane.
His folks got divorced last year.
Look, l may not know how it is
to be a great dad...
but l know how to survive without one.
That's Ethan on the phone,
and he got busted shoplifting.
He's too afraid to call his mom, so unless
an adult goes there to claim him...
-the owner's gonna call the cops.
-And where's the store?
-lt's on Carver and Fifth.
-lt's a good three miles from Bank Street.
-You can go, but l'm coming with you.
-Okay. Let's go.
-See you, Morgue Man.
-Are you coming?
No. Go ahead and go.
There's something l need to take care of.
Ok.
You took my seat.
l was sitting there yesterday.
l just wanted to let you know that
Harrison won't be showing up today.
Good old Tru.
At least she's gonna make this sporting.
So, why don't you tell me
what you really want.
l just want to hear it for myself.
-What's that?
-Who you are. What you can do.
How you can live with yourself.
l respect you, Davis.
You're a man of science.
You want answers, conclusions.
So how's this?
l preserve the order of the universe
by ensuring the cycle of life.
Fate already has a representative, Jack,
and it is not you.
Tru? Now this is where we're gonna have
to agree to disagree.
Because if Tru was serving fate,
why does fate need me?
-She helps people live.
-Who were supposed to die!
Don't you see? She can't win.
You're wrong.
l've seen her save people. She can win.
Yes. You've seen her outfox killers...
talk people off ledges,
and quite capably, l might add.
But if you think that's the end of the story,
you're missing the best part.
What's that?
l think we'll save that for another time.
Wouldn't want to blow
all my best material at once.
But it's good to see you, boss.
Tell Harrison l'll catch him later.
lf l see him in my place again,
l'll call the cops.
Yes, sir. Not a problem. Come on, buddy.
lf you're hungry, you call me.
l'm, like, VlP at all the restaurants in town.
Forget candy bars.
l'm talking steak and tiramisu.
This is my sister. She's cool. She's....
Well, she looks out for me.
-Kind of how l look out for you.
-Hi, Ethan.
Hi.
-You're not gonna tell my mother, are you?
-Not a chance!
-You are.
-What?
Yeah, we'll take you home.
Where do you live?
lt's a few blocks. l can go on my own.
Come on, buddy, just tell me where.
Fine. l live on Bank Street.
But she's probably not even home
from work yet.
-Did you say Bank Street?
-Yeah, <i>9</i>5 Bank Street.
Ethan, do you think your mom would
mind picking you up at my office?
Why don't you guys wait in Sign-ln
until Ethan's mom gets here?
-Where you going?
-l hear Davis in the crypt. l'll be right back.
And just do me a favor?
Don't play with anything.
-l won't.
-l was talking to him.
Davis.
Sorry if l got your hopes up. l just came by
to give my two-week notice.
Don't bother. Davis took you off payroll
once we realized you were Death.
l'm not Death, Tru.
l don't determine who lives or dies.
lt's my job to bring a little order
to the universe.
Which means today your job is
to make sure my brother dies.
-l take no pleasure in that.
-Oh, l'm sure. Later, Jack.
What if l let him live?
For a guy who claims he isn't Death,
you sure talk a good game.
l like your brother. l'd hate to see him die.
l'd hate to see you see him die...again.
Death's Top 10 Come-Ons.
Number 10:
promise to spare the life of a relative.
l also hate reliving days.
l mean, the first time was cool,
but after that, dull as dishwater.
Number nine: bitch about the job,
and then invite her back to your place...
to see your new black robe.
You know what l hate
more than anything?
The way you're looking at me right now.
So l won't stand in the way
of you saving Harrison.
-lf?
-lf you stop.
The next time someone asks for your help,
ignore it.
lf your day should rewind, have fun.
But don't save the life
of someone whose time is up.
-Think about it.
-l don't have to think about it, Jack.
l can save my brother
and anyone else who needs me.
ls that how you think this works?
When you save someone who's supposed
to die, there are consequences.
The universe
keeps very strict accounts, Tru.
And what you're doing is messing
with the books.
So if you save Harrison,
the one certainty is...
someone else is gonna die today
in his place.
-lt doesn't work like that.
-l guess we'll see.
Twelve hours till midnight.
And l'm sitting on the edge of my seat...
because l know someone's
gonna die today. Could be anyone.
-lt could be you.
-Or you.
-l guess we'll see.
-l guess we will.
Say goodbye to Harrison for me.
Read into that any way you'd like.
Yes! That's good!
-Mom.
-There you are. Ethan.
You can always call me, no matter what.
You understand?
Hi, l'm Harrison. l know we only spoke on--
On the phone. Right. lt's nice to meet you.
-Well, what can l say? Thank you so much.
-Oh, no problem.
Emma.
-Hi. Have we met?
-No, l'm Tru, Harrison's sister.
Hey, Harry, you want to just give us a sec?
Oh, yeah.
Girl talk. Dude, come on.
He worships your brother.
All l've heard for the last week is,
''Harrison this, Harrison that.''
lt must be really tough raising him
on your own.
Yeah. His father and l
split up six months ago.
Harrison may be the first
stable role model he's ever had.
Not exactly Donnie's strong suit.
-Being a role model?
-Being stable.
Could you just excuse me one sec?
Emma's got a jealous ex. But she
and Harrison never even met until today.
-He must've taken Ethan home and--
-Wrong place, wrong time. Right.
You're doing everything you need to do.
Keeping Harrison away from Bank Street.
-What about them?
-They're safe.
The only person in danger is the guy
he thinks is sleeping with his ex-wife.
lt still couldn't hurt
to keep an eye on the house.
But wait, Davis. You?
From across the street.
lf there's any real work to be done
l'll call you. l'm not doing that stuff.
l'll see you later.
Tru, you were awesome! You did it!
You saved me! l knew it!
l always knew you could do it.
Hey, we're not out of the woods yet, Har.
Come on! You said it yourself. Stay away
from Bank Street and l am bullet-free.
So what's next? 'Cause l'm starving.
This whole dying and coming back thing
really works on my appetite.
Stop! Listen to me!
Look, you don't remember yesterday.
You don't have to, but l do.
l stood over your body. Your dead body.
And l will not lose you again,
do you understand me?
Yeah, sure. Whatever.
So let's go.
l'm taking you somewhere safe.
Safe? What could be safer than a morgue?
We're gathered here today to celebrate
the union of two people.
FYl. Given a choice between death
and attending my ex's wedding...
l might have chosen death.
And in celebration of that love...
the bride has asked her friend, Tru Davies,
to read for us a passage today. Tru?
-l'll be right back.
-l'll be right here.
-What's his name?
-Stop it, Donnie.
-We've been through this many times.
-We've been divorced six months.
You already found a replacement?
You know how crazy this is?
How crazy you sound?
-Who is he?
-There's no one!
l haven't been out on a date since
high school, and that was with you.
-Don't lie to me, Emma !
-Oh, my God!
Would you stop that and put that away.
-My buddy saw him.
-Daddy?
Hey, Eth. l didn't know you were....
-Mommy and Daddy, we were just talking.
-You should leave, Donnie. Now.
Yeah.
Hey, look, Daddy's gonna come see you
real soon, okay?
l'm gonna find this guy.
Don't think l won't.
Goodbye, Donnie.
Hey, honey.
Watch where you're going.
l know where l'm going.
The question is, do you?
-What the hell's that supposed to mean?
-Donnie McCrane?
-Yeah?
-Jack Harper.
Sacred Heart Basketball League!
Come on, l was the point guard.
We beat St. Anthony's for 30 points
back in '<i>9</i>1 . You must remember.
Sorry, Jack? No.
Hey, l was sorry
to hear about your divorce, man.
Some of the guys were talking about it.
l've been through it myself.
lt sucks, doesn't it?
They leave you for some young stud,
and we get left paying the bills.
Anyway, l was sorry to hear it.
But keep your chin up.
You're a much better-looking guy
than he is.
Hey. You know him?
-You know the guy Emma's seeing?
-Know him? Oh, yeah.
Not only that,
l know where he is right now.
Come on, Tru.
Pick up the phone. Pick it up. Come on.
-Sorry, Davis.
-Give me that!
This is between me and Tru.
''here is the deepest secret nobody knows
''and this is the wonder
that's keeping the stars apart
''i carry your heart (i carry it in my heart)''
l can't tell you how surprised l was
to see you.
Lindsay called, and she said
she hadn't heard from you all day.
She had a nagging suspicion her best
friend was gonna go stag to her wedding.
Well, that's why she's my best friend.
She knows what l want.
lt can't be easy for him,
seeing Lindsay marry somebody else.
lt beats the alternative.
-What's that?
-lt's a long story.
l'm not going anywhere.
You haven't heard the story yet.
Okay. l promised you answers.
Explanations that are long overdue.
So here goes.
Harrison's here today
because l'm saving his life.
You're saving his life?
Yesterday he was shot, and he died.
He asked for my help, and my day
restarted, and so l'm helping him...
because that's what l do.
l help people live who aren't ready to die.
And when we were together,
if l ever showed up late, or ran off early...
or acted in some inexplicable way,
it was because someone needed me.
-Because someone needed my--
-Your help.
Right.
And l never told you this before,
because l know how it sounds...
but l can do all of those things.
Every one of them.
Excuse me, everyone.
Before we move inside for dinner...
l would like to make a toast...
to my beautiful bride, Lindsay...
who has--
Luc. Luc.
accepted me for who l am.
And has made my life richer because of it.
-To Lindsay.
-Hear, hear.
Harrison.
Look, l told you, buddy.
l didn't sleep with your wife.
-That's not what l heard.
-l'm telling you the truth!
-Honest! Ask anybody! Ask--
-Your son!
Who are you?
Someone who knows
the same thing that Ethan does.
My brother met your ex-wife
for the first time today.
You may not believe me,
but you have to believe your son.
Look, you're mixed up. l get it.
l just had to watch the woman l love
marry another man.
Okay, l know how you feel,
but l'm not the guy you're looking for.
Honest.
You better both be telling me the truth.
-lt's okay.
-Yeah.
Do me a favor and keep an eye on him.
There's just one more thing l gotta do.
-That's a little harsh, don't you think?
-Actually, l'm not so sure it is.
Let me guess.
She's in love with someone else.
l wish it were that simple.
-l can see you need some alone time, so--
-She seemed so normal at first.
l mean, she's pretty and smart and....
You know what? Forget it.
Hey.
Sorry for prying.
Okay, no, how about this?
And l can't believe l'm even repeating it.
She thinks dead people talk to her.
-Yeah, she thinks that she--
-Relives days.
-How did you know that?
-She told me, too. This morning.
lt was a practice run for you, l think.
-And, yeah, it did sound crazy at first.
-Yeah.
Until l got some proof.
And suddenly it didn't seem so crazy.
lt sounded miraculous.
-You got proof?
-Oh, yeah.
Tru sent me to talk to this woman, Emma.
She lives over on Bank Street.
-<i>9</i>5 Bank Street.
-And what did she tell you, Emma?
Well, l'm not really sure
l can do it justice...
but somehow she made everything clear.
Don't take my word for it.
Just go talk to her yourself.
l don't know, man.
-Bank Street?
-Yeah.
Yeah. Why not.
The things we do for love, huh?
And this Emma is a bit of an odd bird.
She tends to be more talkative if you go
over there without being empty-handed.
You know what l'm saying?
Learn from my mistake.
Flowers. Not candy.
Women.
-Great. Thanks, Jack.
-Any time.
So, your brother's gonna live.
Yes, he is. No thanks to you.
-Would it ring hollow to say l'm glad?
-Would it ring hollow to say l don't care?
Unfortunately, someone still has
to die today.
Try not to sound
so broken up about it, Jack.
l'm really sorry, Tru. Like l said...
there are parts of my job that sometimes
don't make me feel good about myself.
-What did you do to him?
-l didn't do anything. You did.
You told him who you are.
l just told him where he could get proof.
Emma? Come on, open up. Look, l'm sorry.
Ethan? You guys home? Hello?
Safe? What?
[knocking on door]
-Can l help you?
-Yeah, l'm looking for Emma.
-She's not here right now. And you are?
-l'm Luc.
Nice flowers.
-You a friend of Emma's, Luc?
-No, actually we've never even met before.
Okay, why don't we try this again,
and how about the truth this time?
Are you a friend of my wife's, Luc?
-l think there's been some kind of mistake.
-Yeah, and you made it.
Was it worth it? l know she's good,
but was she worth your life, Luc?
l understand that you are upset,
but l have never met your wife before.
Then why do l see you, the two of you,
in my bed, and it makes me sick!
-lt makes me want to--
-No, Donnie, please! Put the gun down.
-Listen to me.
-He's sleeping with her.
-No, he's not. lt's all a misunderstanding.
-Tru, get out of here.
Donnie, please listen to me.
We'll all talk this out.
-l can't lose her.
-Now, l can handle this!
-Donnie, don't do this!
-Tru, get out of here! Tru, go!
-l'm so sorry.
-Please! Donnie, don't do this.
Please, no! Donnie, no!
Luc. Look at me.
-You're okay.
-l'm sorry, l didn't believe you.
No, Luc. Come on, it's gonna be fine.
l'll get help.
Just stay with me. Look at me, okay?
l love you, Tru.
No, please, don't, Luc.
Please just stay with me.
You're gonna be fine. Look at me.
Look at me, please!
Luc.
Luc, come on, please don't.
ln certain hope of the resurrection
to eternal life through our Lord...
we commend to almighty God
our brother Luc Johnston.
And we commit his body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.
The Lord bless him and keep him.
The Lord make his face to shine upon him,
and be gracious unto him...
and give him peace. Amen.
l owe you my life.
Thank you.
ls there any chance that he'll ask?
Don't know. Don't think so.
-Wait here.
-Don't, Tru.
l take no pleasure from being right.
lt's my turn to talk, so listen up.
My mother had the calling,
and she passed it on to me.
lf you think for one minute that
l'm ever gonna stop, you're wrong.
So you'd better watch your back, buddy,
because it's on.
You should know one thing.
This is bigger than you think.
And you should know one thing.
You have no idea what you've begun.
l love you, too.
Get in.
So, tell me, what does my daughter know?
Nice to see you, too, Richard.
Why don't l start
with what she doesn't know.
That you once did what l do.
She's tough.
You'll have your work cut out for you.
-Just like l had with her mother.
-You won that one, didn't you?
Besides, l love a challenge.
Well, Jack, l believe you've got one.
Tru.
Oui.
Ça va Tru.
Oui maman.
Avant cet instant en la personne...
Elle m’a pardonnée.
Quoi ?
Maman... Elle m’a pardonnée de ne pas l’avoir aidée.
Elle dit qu’elle va bien.
Tu as une imagination débordante
mais maman a été tuée devant toi.
Qui y’a-t-il de bien lŕ-dedans ?
Une épouse et une mčre
prise avant son temps...
Dieu, C'est un tissu de conneries.
Je souhaite juste...
Tu souhaites juste quoi ?
que je pourrai y retourner et l’aider.
Tu ne peux pas.
Personne ne le peut.
Dominique Baron.
Elizabeth Christensen.
Tru Davies...
Qu’est-ce qu’elle fou ?
Tru Davies...
J’ai obtenu un jeu de boisson.
Ça s’appelle la diplômée et ta famille n'est pas venu.
Ton jeu de boisson est le prochain dans "Docteur Phil".
Je suis tellement désolée Tru.
Je sais qu’il manque toute une partie de ton entourage mais...
C’était prévisible...
Harrison a probablement rencontré une fille.
Meredith a probablement rencontré un client.
Et mon pčre...
ne reconnaît plus les enfants de son premier mariage.
Merci Cam, mais je pense que je vais y aller.
- Maintenant ? Mais on vient d’arriver...
- Quoi ?
L’internat commence demain ŕ l’hôpital.
Je veux faire une bonne impression et
pas me montrer avec la gueule de bois.
Tru...
Le professeur Evans.
Lindsay, veux tu arręter ça maintenant ?
Elle pense que je ressens un truc pour lui.
Mais je lui ai dit.
Les profs ne sont pas exactement mon genre.
Bonne nuit les gars.
Et félicitations.
Incroyable.
Félicitations.
Hier tu étais en violation avec la moralité.
Et aujourd’hui tu es une petite amie étudiante.
Mais rappelle toi ce que j’ai dit, Tru.
Maintenant que tu es diplômée,
nous pouvons nous montrer en public.
Je suis sűre que Dean sera vraiment contente d’entendre ça.
L’opinion de Dean ne m’intéresse pas.
En fait, je dois la voir ce soir au banquet de la faculté.
Peut-ętre qu’il est temps que je lui parle de toi.
Que vas-tu dire ?
Pas un mot.
Je vais lui montrer les polaroďds que j’ai pris.
Tru, c’est ton frčre préféré.
Je suis dans une situation délicate.
Qu’est-ce que c’est cette fois Harrison ?
Et s’il te plait ne me dis pas que tu as joué aux cartes toute la nuit.
Non pas toute la nuit...
juste depuis 2 heures du mat'.
Ecoutes, tout ce que tu as, pourra m'aider, 1000 $,
quelques billets de 100 męme.
C’est juste un pręt.
Je te le dis Tru, je suis sur un coup.
Si tu es sur un coup,
pourquoi tu as besoin de m'emprunter de l'argent ?
Tu sais que je n’ai pas d’argent.
Ecoutes, je dois aller ŕ l’hôpital
mais je te vois ce soir, ok ?
Oh bien...bien. Ok.
De toute façon, j’ai un plan B.
Je suppose que j’aurai du commencer par lŕ de toute façon.
Et Tru...
j’espčre que tu as eu une bonne journée.
Ecoutes, je serai venu si j’avais pu...
Je sais Harry. Je sais.
Vous avez perdu votre budget ? Mais mon internat ?
Que va-t-il arriver maintenant ?
Je suis désolé Tru...
vraiment.
Je sais, je sais, tu comptais sur ce boulot pour l’argent
et de la crédibilité de l’école de médecine.
Il y a cet autre boulot dont j’ai entendu parler...
mais ne t’excites pas,
il peut ne pas te convenir.
Tu connais le quartier de Traxtar ?
Bien, pourquoi n’y cours-tu pas...
Vois ce type aussitôt que tu peux.
Dis lui que je t’envoie.
C’est un bon boulot ?
Crois moi, beaucoup mourrait pour l’avoir.
Es-tu déjŕ entrée dans une morgue auparavant ?
Une fois, j’avais douze ans.
Ça sonne comme une histoire.
Es-tu vraiment intéressée pour travailler ici,
car je dois ętre honnęte...
la plupart des filles aussi jolies que toi qui viennent ici...
elles sont mortes.
J’ai fait une demande pour l’école de médicine en automne et
 mon responsable a pensé que ce pourrait ętre une bonne idée.
Quoi ?
Votre mascara... c’est un mac n° 5 ?
7.
7. Joli.
Bien, l’ouverture est pour des amis du surveillant.
Qui rapporte le corps,
le pčse, le mesure, étiquette l’orteil,
s’occupe des organes et collecte les détritus.
Les détritus ?
Les chutes de cheveux, les poils pubiens, les coupures d’ongles
et ensuite ils préparent le corps pour le stockage.
On l’appelle la Crypte.
Lŕ oů tous les morts non naturelles de la ville viennent finir.
En attendant d’ętre tous autopsiés.
Vous avez dit, morts non naturelles ?
La plupart d’entre eux,
car s’il y a un doute, que la mort puisse ętre non naturelle,
meurtres, suicide, ils viennent ici.
Donc chaque frigo...
contient un corps. C’est juste.
Peut-tu imaginer la peine de perdre quelqu’un avant son heure ?
Résultat, la plupart de ces gens ne devraient
pas ętre encore mort.
Vas-y, tu peut en ouvrir un.
J’ai besoin que tu commences ce soir.
Les corps partent au cimetičre.
Et tu vas le prendre ?
Je viens juste de te dire que je l’ai pris.
Je veux dire, si ça semble bon pour l’école de médecine, dirais-tu non ?
Regardes-moi, si je ne dors pas bientôt,
j'aurais des poches sous les yeux.
Tu n’as pas encore dormie?
Ecoutes, ne jouons pas ŕ ce jeu ce soir, ok ?
Je me sens bien.
Tru, rappelles toi
que je n’étais pas lŕ ŕ l'anniversaire de la mort de maman.
Je te vois dehors.
Meredith, tu oublies ton...
sac.
Quelle est l’excuse d’Harrison cette fois ? Une fille?
Une cargaison de DVD ?
Une fille avec une cargaison de DVD ?
Ouais, bien je suppose que nous fętons
l'anniversaire différemment,
Harrison joue aux cartes...
Tu prétends que ce n’est pas arrivé...
Et toi, je devine que tu appelles ça de vielles habitudes.
Tu as regardée dans mon sac ?
Merde Tru !
Qu’est-ce tu fais ?
Les gens comme toi ne peuvent pas
en prendre une seule fois Mer',
ils ne t’ont pas appris ça en réhabilitation.
Je suis désolée. Ecoutes, je...
tu dois faire quelque chose de bien.
Tu as une grande carričre, beaucoup d’argent...
Tu sais, peut ętre qu’Harrison a eu une bonne idée.
Il ne prétend rien.
Ne pars pas Mer', s’il te plait.
Allo ?
Harrison ?
Oh mon Dieu, regardes toi.
L’hôpital a appelé, ils ont dit oů...
Le 10 de trčfle. C’est ce que j’ai eu.
Joli souvenir, je ne crois pas en Dieu.
Le 10 de trčfle ? Qu’est-il arrivé ? Ils t’ont fait ça ?
Les gars avec qui tu jouais aux cartes ?
Je viens avec toi.
Non Tru.
Harrison, regardes toi.
Tu as eu ta chance Tru.
Tu ne peux pas m’aider maintenant.
C’est ta premičre fois ?
Félicitations.
Elles ne sont pas toutes aussi jolie que...
Rebecca Morgan.
Que lui ai-t-il arrivée ?
Tu veux dire outre le trou derričre sa nuque ? Rien.
Les voisins ont entendu un coup de feu aux alentours de 10 heures.
Nous l’avons trouvé dans son appartement.
C’est un joli F1 si tu connais quelqu’un.
Hé, rends moi service, tiens ce sac ouvert par ici.
Est-ce que vous savez... euh... qui a fait ça ?
Tu es nouvelle ici donc personne ne te l’as dit.
Nous ne résolvons pas les crimes, nous livrons juste le corps.
Passe une bonne nuit... euh
Tru.
Tru ? Oh, entraînant.
Attendez, vous partez ?
Car David a dit que pour ma premičre nuit,
je ne dois pas rester seule.
Tu ne le seras pas.
Tu as 32 amis juste ŕ côté.
Hello?
Marco?
Vraiment drôle. Faire peur ŕ la nouvelle.
Aide moi.
Félicitations.
Hier tu étais en violation avec la morale.
Et aujourd’hui tu es une petite amie étudiante.
Mais rappelle toi ce que j’ai dit, Tru.
Maintenant que tu es diplômée, nous pouvons nous montrer en public.
Qu'est ce qui ne va pas?
C’est ce que je pensais...
je n’aurais jamais du prendre ce boulot.
Excuse moi ?
A la morgue. Le cimetičre.
Seigneur, cet endroit me donne la chair de poule.
La morgue.
Chérie, ton internat commence ce matin ŕ l’hôpital.
Non, le financement de Grains a été coupé.
Le boulot a été supprimé, je l’ai vu hier.
Hier c’était dimanche. Tu as été diplômée.
Tu as bu un coup avec tes amis et tu es rentrée dormir avec moi.
Personne n’a du allé travailler ŕ la morgue.
C’était juste un mauvais ręve.
Ou peut-ętre trop de margarita.
je suppose. Cela semblait juste si...
Oh, au fait ce soir, c’est le banquet de la faculté.
Je pensais qu’il serait temps que Dean sache ŕ propos de toi.
Ce soir ?
Aujourd'hui, je ne vais pas dire un mot,
je vais juste lui montrer les polaroďds que j’ai pris.
Allo?
Tru, c’est ton frčre préféré.
Je suis dans une situation délicate.
Nous avons eu la męme conversation hier.
Je n’ai pas l’argent.
Premier numéro...
De quoi parles-tu ?
Tu es folle parce que je ne suis pas venu ŕ la remise des diplômes ?
Et votre second numéro...
Quatre.
- Est-ce que tu m’écoutes toujours ?
- est le quatre
Ecoutes Harrison,
peut ętre que tu ne devrais pas retourner ŕ cette table.
Peut ętre devrais-tu partir maintenant. Harrison?
Ouais, ŕ plus tard Tru.
Harrison.
Votre troisičme numéro...
29.
est 29.
Vous ne m’avez jamais rencontré ?
Je ne t’ai jamais rencontrée.
D’un autre côté,
je ne suis pas allé ŕ la gym derničrement.
Mac... numéro 7.
La crypte... c’est par lŕ, exact ?
Es-tu sűre de n’avoir jamais travaillée dans une morgue auparavant?
Donc c’est la crypte. Chaque...
Est-ce que je peux t’aider ?
La nuit derničre...
une femme nommée Rebecca Morgan est morte et elle a été amenée ici.
Une amie ŕ toi ?
Qui était de garde la nuit derničre... Mark Dub je pense.
Non, elle n’est jamais venue ici.
Vous avez dit, je veux dire quelqu’un a dit que les corps amenés ici
 n’étaient pas des morts naturelles.
La plupart, oui.
Donc ces gens ne sont actuellement pas morts.
Pas encore.
Est-ce que c’est dure de voir les gens partir avant leur heure ?
Oui.
Mais Tru, si tu dois travailler ici,
tu dois accepter le fait que tu ne puisses rien faire pour ça.
C’est un boulot ŕ prendre, si tu es intéressée.
Qu’est-il arrivé ?
Les voisins ont entendu un coup de feu
aux alentours des 10 heures.
La vérité, c'est que nous manquons de personnel.
Tu sembles déjŕ connaître l’opération.
Je le prends.
Oh super.
J’ai besoin de toi ce soir.
Tru?
Rebecca Morgan...
303 West 23th Street.
- Et qui est-elle ?
- Je ne sais pas encore.
Avec un peu de chance, personne.
A chaque fois  que je t’aide il se trouve que ce n’est personne.
Peut ętre que tu auras plus de chance.
Au fait, es-tu vraiment sérieuse ŕ propos de ce boulot ŕ la morgue,
car je dois ętre honnęte cela va faire une coupure par rapport ŕ l’école ?
Lindsay, je te rappelle plus tard.
Oh Tru...
Tru?
Elle est en vie,
pour encore 10 heures.
Ce soir, dans Tru calling.
Tru Davies...
Il y a cet autre boulot dont j’ai entendu parler...
Beaucoup mourrait pour l’avoir.
Es-tu déjŕ entrée dans une morgue auparavant ?
Une fois, j’avais douze ans.
J’ai besoin que tu commences ce soir.
Les corps partent au cimetičre.
Le prochain numéro est 4
Que lui ai-t-il arrivée ?
Les voisins ont entendu un coup de feu aux alentours de 10 heures.
Aide moi.
- Le second numéro...
- 4
Vous ne m’avez jamais rencontré ?
Je ne t’ai jamais rencontrée.
La nuit derničre...
une femme est morte et a été apportée ici.
Non, elle n’est jamais venue ici.
Donc ces gens ne sont actuellement pas morts.
Mais Tru, si tu dois travailler ici,
tu dois accepter le fait que tu ne puisses rien faire pour ça.
Rebecca Morgan...
Qui est-elle ?
Je ne sais pas encore.
Elle est en vie, pour encore 10 heures.
Café, s’il vous plait.
Ça va ?
Ouais.
J’ai eu une drôle de journée.
Peut-ętre que tu veux quelque chose de plus fort qu’un café.
Un café, c’est parfait.
La vérité c’est que je ne devrais pas me plaindre.
J’ai cette amie qui va avoir une mauvaise journée
et elle ne le sait pas encore.
Ecoutes, cela va te sembler fou mais...
Oh une minute.
Allo ? Que fais-tu... ?
Aaron nous avons déjŕ parlé de tout cela.
Non, je ne peux pas faire ça maintenant.
Au revoir Aaron.
Certaines personnes ne savent pas quand c’est fini, hein ?
Rebecca, je dois te dire quelque chose...
Comment connais-tu mon nom ?
On se connait ?
Cette amie qui doit avoir une mauvaise journée...
Tu sais quoi ?
Peu importe...
Je ne sais pas comment le dire
alors je vais juste te le dire.
Tu vas mourir aujourd’hui Rebecca.
Quoi ?
Qu’est-ce que tu viens de dire ?
Tu dois me croire.
Peut-ętre que nous pouvons l’empęcher.
Nous avons 9 heures.
- Tu as demandée mon aide.
- J’ai demandée ton aide ?
Tu es... tu es folle.
- Dis moi juste pourquoi quelqu’un voudrait te faire du mal.
- Gary...!
Peux-tu venir ici...
Elle a dit que j’allais mourir aujourd’hui.
Tout serait parfait si j’arrivais ŕ la convaincre
de tomber amoureuse de moi.
Ton nom est Tru exact ?
Elle n’a jamais parlée de toi avant.
Et bien j’ai juste commencé ce week-end.
Gary pensait avoir besoin d’une aide supplémentaire.
Quel genre d’ennuis penses-tu qu’elle a ?
C’est dur ŕ dire.
Je sais que c’est un peu précipité,
mais tu ne saurais pas qui voudrait lui faire du mal ?
Non.
Elle n’a pas besoin d’aide dans ce domaine.
Elle se bat toute seule pour de petites choses.
Mauvais jours.
Auditions difficiles.
Actrice, bien sűr.
Danse.
C’est une danseuse.
Bien merci.
Comme je l’ai dit, elle me tuerait si elle me savait ici.
Donc...
C’est marrant,
une fille a des ennuis et tout le monde suspecte son ex-petit ami.
Aaron, non.
Ne...
Non, je dis que j’ai de la chance.
Je ne suis pas le seul.
Son nom est Elliot Winters.
Alors, vous en avez terminé avec moi
ou dois-je appeler la sécurité ?
Actuellement, je ne suis pas lŕ pour une interview.
Je suis ici pour Rebecca.
Rebecca ?
Rebecca Morgan.
Ecoutez, je ne porte pas de jugement.
Manifestement...
Le professeur de danse de ma fille.
Pourquoi ?
Ok. Je ne comprends pas.
Donc vous deux n’ętes pas...
Est-ce qu’elle est intéressée ?
Sűrement.
Est-ce que je suis flatté ?
Absolument.
Mais ces photos ne sont pas lŕ pour ętre étalées,
il s’agit de ma vie.
Ecoutez, je ne sais pas ce qu’elle vous a dit,
mais parfois devenir bons amis ne signifie pas ętre liés.
De toute façon c’est tout ce que nous pouvons faire.
Alors, pourquoi ętes vous inquičte pour Rebecca ?
Car elle va mourir aujourd’hui.
Ne vous faîtes pas de souci ŕ propos de la sécurité.
Je connais la sortie.
Est-ce que tu es sűre que tout va bien ?
Mon Dieu, on dirait que tu te sens vraiment concernée.
Attendez une seconde,
qui ętes vous et qu’avez vous fait de ma sśur ?
Rien. Je sais ŕ quel point tu es stressée Mer’,
particuličrement aujourd’hui.
Je ne peux pas te parler plus longtemps Tru,
mais je te vois ce soir, ok ?
Et traites moi de folle
mais je pense réellement qu’Harrison pourra le faire cette année.
Vous direz ŕ votre amie que si c’est une menace,
ça ne marchera pas.
Nous avons déjŕ vécu ça elle et moi.
C'est terminé entre nous.
Fini.
Et si elle insiste pour le dire ŕ ma femme,
je ferai tout ce qui est en mon pouvoir pour l’arręter.
Tout.
Je vois
Bien... Je ne peux pas gagner, non ?
Qu’est-ce qu’il y a de drôle lŕ dedans ?
Whoa... Whoa... Relax.
C’est ma sśur.
Elle est ma sśur.
Pars maintenant...
Je te le dis maintenant.
Profites en et vas-t-en maintenant.
Est-ce que tu te moques de moi ?
Tu as vu le tas de jetons que j’ai lŕ dedans.
Maintenant Har’,
maintenant mais cela ne va pas durer.
De ce côté,
je pensais que tu étais un peu court.
Ecoutes,
j’ai pris un emprunt sur la maison.
Quoi ?
Un pręt.
Super.
Tu joues avec l’argent de la maison.
Whoa whoa whoa...
Est-ce que ça va ?
Est-ce que tout va bien ?
J’ai eu une sale journée Harrison.
Une journée que je voudrais t’expliquer si je le pouvais,
mais je ne le peux pas.
Donc je ne vais męme pas essayer.
Et j’ai entendu une autre voix...
Attends...
je ne comprends pas.
Tu veux dire comme...
comme maman ?
Non, pas elle.
Je veux dire quelqu’un d’autre.
Mort ?
Oh merde.
Et ce n’est encore que la moitié de l'histoire.
Et crois moi ou non, c’est la partie qui a le plus de sens.
Je ne comprends pas, pourquoi moi ?
Pourquoi viennent-ils vers moi ?
Peut-ętre parce qu’ils savent que tu écouteras.
Tu penses que je suis folle ?
Je n’ai jamais pensé que tu étais folle.
Écoutes, je vais y retourner, ok ?
Ecoutes, fais moi une faveur.
Retardes les paris pour me laisser plus de temps.
Pour quoi ?
Chercher un moyen de sauver tes fesses.
Ok...
Gary, j’ai vraiment besoin de lui parler.
Je t’ai dis qu’elle ne se sentait pas bien.
Elle a besoin de prendre l’air.
Cela arrive souvent ces derniers temps.
Quel est le score ?
Les Socks mčnent 71 dans la neuvičme.
Je te pari une centaine de dollars qu’ils vont perdre.
Es-tu folle ?
Peut-ętre.
Je ne sais pas encore.
Désolé Gary,
j’ai perdu la notion du temps.
Cette fille dit qu’elle te connaît.
Restes loin de moi.
Ne t’approches pas...
Non, tu ne comprends pas.
Moi non plus, mais je veux juste m’aider.
Tu veux m'aider ?
Pourquoi ne commences-tu par me laisser seule ?
Tu sais quoi ?
Peut ętre que tu ferais bien de l’écouter.
Gary elle a des ennuis
et elle ne sait pas ŕ quel point.
Pourquoi je te croirais ?
Bien.
Voici le deal.
Les Socks gagnent, je suis bonne de 100 dollars.
Mais s’ils perdent, tu m’aides.
Vous avez reçu une lettre de Meredith Davies.
Tru.
C’est une surprise.
Je suppose qu’il était temps que je vois ton bureau.
Oh, tu essayes de me faire sentir coupable d’avoir manquer ta remise des diplômes.
Bien, je suis désolée Tru.
Que nous est-il arrivés Mer' ?
Nous étions proches. Nous trois.
Maintenant je me retrouve ŕ faire plus pour des étrangers
que pour ma propre famille.
De quoi tu parles ?
Dans une seconde, quelqu’un va venir t’apporter
une enveloppe contenant de la cocaďne.
N’y touches pas Mer.
Tru ton nouvel intéręt pour moi est touchant,
psychotique mais touchant.
Car personne ne va m’apporter de la coke.
Encore moins dans une enveloppe ŕ mon bureau.
Vraiment Tru.
Crois moi.
Ma puce, tu as beaucoup d’imagination, tu sais ?
Bien, je ne sais oů tu as pris cette idée mais...
C’est comme ça que tu prends ton pied?
En te convaincant, que tu n'est pas celle qui de nous tous,
qui n'a pas tout foiré ?
Tu ne peux pas aider les gens, Tru.
Tu ne peux pas les sauver.
Ni maman il y a dix ans, ni moi,
et ŕ ce rythme lŕ, pas męme toi.
Tru, pourquoi est-ce que je penses
que tu ne me dis pas la vérité ?
Je sais, je ne veux pas regarder dans les dossiers,
j’ai juste quelques questions.
Oh, ŕ propos des meurtres non résolus ?
Exactement.
Donc laisse moi résumer,
depuis 8 heures que tu as commencé ŕ travailler,
tu as décidé de résoudre les vieux cas.
Vraiment ambitieux.
Tu sais ce que j’ai fait aujourd’hui ?
J’ai parié sur les Socks.
Ecoutes, je suis juste curieuse.
Que peux-tu me dire ŕ propos d’une femme
qui viendrait avec une balle dans la nuque ?
Qu’elle est morte ?
Davis.
Ok bien.
Um, une balle dans la nuque.
Je suppose que sa mort est une exécution signifiant qu’elle a fait
quelque chose ŕ quelqu’un qui les a rendu furieux.
Un petit calibre, probablement un 22.
Comment ça ?
D’aprčs ce que tu m'as dis, il n’y a pas de blessure de sortie
donc la balle s’est fichée dans son cou.
Et je dois ętre honnęte avec toi Tru,
tu n’as pas besoin de faire ça pour m’impressionner.
Tout ce dont j’ai besoin
c’est de quelqu’un ŕ l’heure pour le travail.
Davis, merci je dois y aller.
Les jolies filles n’apportent rien que des ennuis.
Roué de coup ?
Quoi ?
Comment peux-tu savoir ça ?
Comment est-il possible que tu saches ça ?
Fais moi juste confiance.
Ok, et prends ça.
Conçois le, comme une réponse ŕ une pričre.
Ecoutes, il y a 52 cartes dans un jeu,
les chances que cela me sauve de ce coup...
Ai un peu confiance en ta sśur. Ok ?
Tu te rappelles quand j’ai dis que tu n’étais pas folle ?
Je vais devoir repenser ma position.
Allo ?
Comment diable, savais-tu que les Socks allaient perdrent ?
Oů est-elle Gary ?
Elle est partie voir Winters.
Sais-tu ce qu’il y a de pire que de regarder des diplômés de l’académie ?
C'est de les regarder manger.
...parce que ce matin tu me paraissais un peu...
Mark, je ne peux pas te décrire ŕ quoi ŕ ressemblé cette journée.
Ne n’inquičtes pas, il sera bientôt fini.
Yeah, il faut l’espérer.
Mark, je dois y allé.
Ne fais pas ça...
il te tuera.
Je ne comprends toujours pas comment est-il possible
que tu saches qu’Elliot veuilles me tuer.
Bien, disons juste que j’ai vu de quoi il était capable.
C’est fantastique de voir ŕ quel point
un homme peut ętre charmant quand il veut entrer dans ta vie
et combien il peut ętre un salop quand il veut en sortir.
Seigneur...
et je pensais qu'il suffisait que je viennes pour qu'il change d'avis...
Rebecca.
Aaron, que fais-tu ici ?
Je me faisais du souci pour toi.
Et tu m'avais dit que tu avais perdu cette clé.
Elle est venue me dire que tu pouvais avoir des ennuis.
Bien Aaron...
tout va bien.
Tu peux partir maintenant.
Je ne veux pas partir.
Rebecca, je veux qu'on parle tous les deux.
Tu n’as pas ŕ rester seule, spécialement maintenant.
Je ne veux pas recommencer ça avec toi.
Je veux que tu partes.
Rebecca, je suis venu pour t’aider.
Non.
Il est venu pour te tuer.
De quoi tu parles ?
C’est fou.
Exact.
Aussi fou que le calibre 22 dans ta poche.
Quoi ça ?
Oh mon Dieu
c’est pour toi... pour que tu te protčges.
Ne sois pas aveugle Rebecca, tu en as besoin.
Tu sais de quoi Elliot est capable...
Pourquoi ne me donnes-tu pas le revolver Aaron.
Au fait, qui diable es-tu vraiment ?
Tu penses que tu lui rends service ?
En foutant sa vie en l’air ?
Si tu me le demandes,
je penses que c’est vraiment la bonne façon pour lui faire du mal.
1
Elliot, n’a jamais voulu me faire de mal.
C’est toi, Aaron.
De quoi du parles ?
Quoi c’est moi ?
Pourquoi est-ce que tu le défends ?
Tu l’as toujours défendu.
- Męme aprčs ce qu’il t’a fait.
- Ce qu’il m’a fait ?
Il ne m’a jamais rien fait.
Je suis juste...
Enceinte.
Tu es enceinte.
Acide folique, prescrit pour les grossesses.
Aaron, écoutes moi.
Tu ne le savais męme pas, tu as une seconde chance
de ne pas tuer 2 personnes alors donnes moi ce revolver.
Rebecca...
je n’ai jamais voulu te faire de mal.
Je voulais juste t’aider, tu le sais.
Tu dois y aller Aaron, maintenant.
Non, juste...
laisses le partir.
Fermes la porte.
Restes ŕ l’intérieur et appelles la police.
Il devra bien rentrer chez lui.
Quoi ?
Je viens de réaliser.
Je ne t’ai jamais dit merci.
Il veut te rappeler que tous les comptes doivent ętre payé
et que c'est la derničre partie.
Yeah. J’ai lu le mémo.
Whoo ! Ce fut un plaisir les gars.
Comment savais-tu ?
Je veux dire pour le 10 de trčfles ?
Juste dans ma main, je veux dire sérieusement...
comment... .
Comment savais-tu ?
Disons juste que j’ai un temps d’avance sur tout le monde aujourd’hui.
Evidemment, je n’ai pas un centime.
L’argent que j’ai gagné servira ŕ payer l’emprunt.
Il y a, il y a une histoire lŕ non ?
Yeah...
il y a une histoire.
Je ne vous ai presque pas reconnu les gars.
Ça ne peut pas ętre ma famille, il y a trop de foutu bonheur.
C’était bien de te voir aujourd’hui Tru.
Vraiment ?
Oui.
Oui... vraiment.
Tu vois Tru, je t’avais dit qu’Harrison serait ici cette année.
Je reviens tout de suite...
commandes moi un club soda.
Toi et Meredith ?
allant ensemble ?
Juste quand je pensais que les choses ne pouvaient ętre plus étranges...
Est-ce que tu ne penses jamais que maman nous regarde ?
Seigneur, je n’espčre pas.
Car je ne suis pas sűr qu’elle aimerait ce qu’elle voit.
Oui.
Peut ętre qu’elle essaye de changer ça.
Joli tenue au fait.
Allo...
Euh... hello.
Est-ce que je ne dérange car je peux te rappeler.
Non, c’est bon.
Est-ce que tout va bien Davis?
Euh... oui.
J’ai repensé ŕ cette fille...
Tu sais celle qui est morte, et euh...
je pensais qu’il pouvait y avoir une autre raison ŕ ce qu’il n’y ai pas d’impact de sortie.
Euh... et c'est quoi ?
Tu veux bien commander, s'il te plaît.
Tu sais cet impact d’entrer, dans sa nuque,
peut-ętre que ce n’est pas un impact d’entré,
peut ętre que c’était un impact de sortie.
Donc, cela veut dire que la balle est venue...
De sa bouche.
Oui, exactement.
Ce qui veut dire, que pour moi elle se l'ai faite.
Donc ce n'était pas un homicide...
C’était un suicide.
Le fait est que, j’ai toujours voulu ętre mčre,
avoir une maison pleine d’enfants.
Ma seule erreur a été de croire qu’il le voulait également.
Rebecca...
Peut-ętre que oui.
Seulement pas avec sa maîtresse
car quand je lui ai parlé du bébé,
Il m'a fait comprendre que je n'étais que sa maîtresse.
Mais ce n’est pas ce que tu vas devenir...
Tu vas ętre une mčre, Rebecca.
Prends le de quelqu’un qui a perdu la sienne trop tôt.
Tu es supposé vivre.
Il n’y a pas de meilleure raison.
Ta mčre...
a été tué...
il y a 10 ans,
devant moi,
par un homme qu’ils n’ont jamais trouvé.
Ce n’était pas son heure alors.
Et ce n’est pas la tienne maintenant.
Rebecca, veux-tu me donner le revolver ?
Euh..., nouvelle ici ?
En quelque sorte, tu permets ?
Vas-y... fais toi plaisir.
Ils l’ont trouvé dans un appartement, tu devrais voir l’endroit,
c’est un F1 si tu connais quelqu’un.
Un cancer.
C’est une saloperie.
Alors, premičre fois ?
Non, la seconde.
Ca a été le jour le plus étrange que j'ai vécu.
As-tu quelque chose ŕ voir la dedans ?
Je ne sais pas.
Ce que je sais seulement,
c’est que j’aurai souhaité que ce jour arrive 10 ans plus tôt.
Et peut-ętre que j’aurai pu te sauver.
A la place je vais attendre,
pour les autres,
ceux qui ont le plus besoin de moi,
peut-ętre que je ne pouvais pas te sauver.
Peut ętre, peut-ętre que,
c’est ta façon de me sauver moi.

FIN
Ici, Lindsey, c'est le bureau des entrées
Et là, ce qu'on appelle la chambre Commune
Joli, très gothique
Alors, qu'est ce qui se passe ici?
Eh bien, c'est ici que l'on mesure et pèse les...
Hum, cadavres
OK, Tru... Soyons honnêtes
Tu es belle, tu as 22 ans, tu as de meilleures
possibilités de carrière en dehors d'ici
Je te l'ai déjà dit. Travailler
ici m'aidera à intégrer l'école médicale
Alors tu pourrais au moins éviter les gardes de nuit,
Je veux dire,
Toutes les bonnes fêtes débutent après minuit et avec qui je vais y aller?
Tu survivras
En plus, je pense que je peux faire le bien en travaillant ici
Comment?  Tes amis sont déjà morts
oh, pas tous
Tru, tu vas jamais me croire.  Je viens juste d'extraire une balle de tennis d'un poumon.
Ho, Hello
Rappelle moi d'annuler mon adhésion au club de tennis
Uh, Lindsay, Davis, c'est mon patron
Davis, Lindsay, ma meilleure amie
Salut, ravi de vous rencontrer
je vais bien... vraiment
Hum....
J'étais sur le point de partir, Tru,
merci pour le .. le tour
Et on va toujours faire du shopping demain?
Absolument
Ok, génial
On se voit demain
Ecoute, Tru,
je sais que la morgue n'est
pas exactement un endroit riche en évènemments
mais je sais que des choses vont arriver
En fait, c'est ça qui m'inquiète
Mes enfants sont dans cet immeuble! En haut !
Quelqu'un doit les aider!
- SVP sauvez les !
- Madame, nous y allons !
Viens par là, je te tiens
Je te tiens
ok, ok ,ok,
J'ai de la chance aujourdh'ui.
Je suis ton sauveur, mon petit.
Allons-y, tout va brûler.
Descends les escaliers
-Tu es coincé
-Je vais bien! je vais bien! File !
Non, viens aussi !
Ecoute moi, je serai en bas dans une minute ok?
Ne t'inquiète pas pour moi
Allez, va-t-en !
Cours, cours
Hey, beauté. Je ne voulais pas te réveiller.
Où vas-tu?
Je prends mon petit déjeuner avec le doyen Haillington.
Ah, oui?
Il semble qu'un poste se libère à l'Université.
Et si ma lèche est efficace, alors
tu sortiras avec un professeur
Hum, dis moi, que penses-tu de tout cela?
très joli
Comment c'est passé ton boulot hier soir ?
Assez mortel.
Amusant.
Bon esprit..
Pourquoi tu ne te recoucherais pas, belle au bois dormant?
Vous aviez dit 5 minutes pour une table.
Ca en fait bien 10 maintenant.
Hey. Ca va?
Oui. Qu'est-ce qui n'irait pas?
He bien, voyons voir...
la dernière fois que l'on s'est vu, des morts te parlaient.
Et je pensais qu'il était de mon devoir d'en parler
Je vais bien Harrisson, tout va bien.
Deux? Votre table est prête.
Enfin, je vois que tu es une belle menteuse Tru.
Je veux savoir ce qui se passe.
Crois moi, tu ne le veux pas
Tout d'un coup, tu ne veux plus te confier à moi?
Ton frère?
Tu veux vraiment savoir?
Soyons bref, tu sais pour résumer.
Les morts demandent ton aide à la morgue.
Une fois. C'est arrivé une seule fois.
Heureusement, une seule fois.
Et ensuite tu es propulsée..
C'est le mot que tu as utilisé, non? propulsée.
propulsée vers le jour d'avant.
Je revis la journée, oui...
Donc tu peux sauver la vie de la fille car elle est pas encore morte.
Tru, je..,qu'est-ce que je peux dire...
Tu es ma soeur, tu sais, je t'aimerais toujours.
Je sais que ça parait dingue.
Bien joué.
Dingue?
non,
le rodéo c'est dingue,
faire du parachute,
jouer les actrices est un peu dingue.
Ca ?
Ca, c'est démentiel.
Harrison? je ne mens pas.
Et je ne pense pas être folle non plus.
Tu revis la même journée.
Alors dis moi :
Qui va gagner le match des Tigers ce soir?
Quoi?
Super, le traffic va être bloqué sans toute la ville.
On se voit plus tard.
Salaud.
Donc tu sortais avec un professeur et
tu me demandes d'oublier tout ça?
Je savais que tu n'approuverais pas.
Ha, je suis étonnée.
Moi aussi.
Je croyais que les choses se passaient bien avec lui.
Non, je parlais de nous.
Nous sommes amies,
les meilleures amies.
OK, maintenant je comprends pourquoi tu agissais si bizarrement.
Tu ne peux pas cacher des secrets à tes amis, surtout à moi.
Je me sens stupide. Je veux dire, tu me connais. Je ne tombe pas amoureuse si facilement.
Mais quand tu l'es, c'est pour de vrai.
Excusez moi !
Très joli, oui.
Au fait, qu'as tu fait lorsque tu l'as pris sur le fait?
Rien.
Rien.
Je suis restée figée.
Ok, heu..
tu surprends ton copain avec une autre et tu restes figée.
He, tu sais ce que je lui aurais fait?
Je l'aurais humilié.
J'aurais fait en sorte qu'il ne veuille plus me croiser.
Hey, Tru, tu as manqué la meilleure opportunité de remettre ce salaud à sa place.
- Je dois partir
- Où ça?
ça ne te regardes pas.
Tu m'inquiètes.
Moi?
Oui, c'est quoi cette histoire de morgue.
C'et mon boulot.
C'est une bonne expérience à mettre sur mon CV pour faire médecine.
He bien, tu crois pas que c'est un peu bizarre?
Travailler dans la morgue où maman a été ammenée après avoir été tuée?
Quoi? De quoi tu parles?
Mon dieu, tu ne te souviens vraiment pas?
Travailler là bas est un peu morbide, tu ne penses pas?
Tru, quoi que tu essayes d'accomplir
Maman est morte. Rien ne peux la ramener.
Qu'est ce qui est si intéressant?
Rien.
Ce sont pas les archives de 1993?
C'est rien Davis.
1993, une très mauvaise année.
Et pourquoi?
Eh bien, la mortalité de la ville était basse, peut être la plus basse du pays.
Et après 93, elle a décollée comme une fusée.
De la compagnie.
Je vous présente Samantha Blanc.
Oh mon dieu
Morte par asphyxie au gaz.
Le feu a démarré au 4ème vers 5H.
Les pompiers croyaient l'immeuble vide, elle était cachée sous son lit.
- Quelle est la cause du feu?
- Une explosion de gaz
Celui-ci est Nick Kelly, un civil. A sauvé un enfant de 12 ans mais la fumée l'a eu aussi.
La victime a une cheville cassée
Probablement en voulant s'échapper de cet immeuble rempli de pièges mortels.
Décoloration des joues.
Quelles causes?
Pourrait indiqué l'exposition à un produit chimique.
Benzène diméthylique, je pense.
Ce gars est un génie ou quoi?
Hey génie, tu me dois 20 billets, Patterson s'est démarqué ce soir.
Les Tigres ont marqués 2 essais.
C'est quoi du benzène diméthylique ?
Surtout utilisé en industrie.
Pauvre enfant, elle a du étouffée à cause de la fumée.
Fibres de coton plaquées sur la peau.
Elles sont rouges et ...autre chose, dur à dire
Si jeune.
Fichue tragédie, voilà ce que c'est.
Hey
Je ne sais pas si je pourrais le supporter
Crois moi ou pas, les choses seront plus faciles à la longue.
En plus, j'aime penser qu'ils vont dans un meilleur monde.
Tu crois ça?
Bien, si tu veux travailler ici, tu devrais y croire.
Car les morts s'en vont facilement,
ce sont les vivants qui doivent faire face à la peine.
Renee a dit qu'elle ne te reverrait plus. Ni aucune de ses copines.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que tu leur fais peur.
Ecoutes, t'es un brave gars mais ta technique de drague est trop rapide.
Mais j'ai écris que 8 emails.
<i>Aidez Moi</i>
Tu dois te la jouer cool.
Hé les gars, vous avez entendu?
Entendu quoi ?
Rien, vous en faites pas.
Tru, dis-moi. Tu as un mec
tu ne veux pas être avec lui
et en profiter?
<i>Aidez moi.</i>
Je reviens de suite
Elle est belle. Bizarre, mais belle.
<i>Aidez moi.</i>
<b>Aidez moi</b>
Hé, beauté
Où vas-tu?
J'ai un petit déjeuner avec le doyen Harrington.
Tru? Tru?
Pardon, hum..Quoi?
Je demandais ton avis sur ça. Comment tu le trouve?
Oui, c'est joli.
hé,
Alors, petit-déjeuner avec le doyen hein?
Quelle surprise.
Oui, il y a un poste qui doit être disponible à l'université et
si ma lèche est efficace, alors tu sortiras avec un professeur.
Elle est bonne.
Quoi?
Opportunité, c'est une bonne opportunité.
Oui, Donc... heu..  t'en es sure?
Oui, très joli.
Tellement beau que je voudrais que tu restes dans le coin.
Heu.. Je peux pas. Je dois voir le doyen mais je te verrai ce soir.
Hum.. Tu réalises que tu a été embauché pour le service de nuit, non?
Est-ce que des fois vous rentrez chez vous?
Je, Je peux te poser la même question.
En fait, je me suis dit que si je voulais faire du bon boulot, je devais bien connaitre le système.
Appliquée.
Assez avec la crypte... Un peu de base de données.
La base de données municipale. Que veux tu faire avec ça?
Juste une petite recherche.
Qui est Nick Kelly?
Ce que j'en sais ?
C'est un pompier.
Puis-je vous aider mademoiselle?
Oui, je recherche Nick Kelly.
Nick, oui. Hey Nick.
Oui?
Quelqu'un veut te voir.
Bonjour, je suis Nick.
Salut, peut on parler?
Au 84 Hastings?
Oui, c'est celui là.
C'est pas très loin d'ici.
Qu'est ce qui vous fait penser à un risque d'incendie?
Aucune raison en particulier.
Je dois faire une évaluation du risque d'incendie dans un immeuble d'avant guerre.
Pour ma classe d'architecture.
Un bien étrange devoir.
Etrange professeur.
Yeah, je serais ravi d'aller y jeter un coup d'oeil pour vous.
Disons à 5H.
Le feu a pris à 5H.
5H, non 5H c'est trop tard.
Je suis supposé être dans le bureau de mon professeur à 2H.
Et ça ne peut vraiment pas attendre?
Non, pas si je veux réussir.
OK, qu'importe. Il ne se passe pas grand chose ici de toute façon.
Juste un question.
Pourquoi moi?
Pardon
Vous auriez pu demander l'aide d'un autre, mais vous m'avez demandé moi.
J'ai le calendrier.
Oh... je vois. Heu, c'était pour les bonnes oeuvres.
Pour les fonds des veuves et des orphelins.
OK, Mr septembre.
Je n'étais pas présent lors de la dernière inspection. J'ai passé la nuit aux urgences.
Une alliance est tombée dans le vide ordure...
J'y ai mis ma main et j'ai presque perdu 2 doigts.
J'ai dit à ma femme que cela ne faisait pas parti de mes obligations, non?
Je veux juste vérifier la chaudière.
Pas de problème, elle est à la cave.
Attention, cette chemise était un cadeau de ton père.
Je la déteste, elle me fais ressemblé à un taré. C'est ce que porterait un nul.
Tu la portes et c'est tout. Qu'est-ce que tu as?
Emmene ta soeur jouer dehors.
Salut.
Que dit-on Samantha?
- Merci
- De rien
c'est un ange
C'est vrai, elle aura sept ans la semaine prochaine.
Yeah
Je l'espère.
Effreyant
Tru, venez.
Attention où vous marchez.
Que fait-on?
He bien, première règle en matière de risque incendie.
Vous vérifiez tous les tubes et conduites à la recherches de fuites.
Personnes ne prends de notes?
Hmm?
Pour votre rapport..?
Ca va. Mémoire visuelle.
Vraiment
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
C'est un renifleur de gaz.
Il est utilisé pour détecter les sources de fuites.
On pourrait pas les sentir?
Si la concentration en gaz était suffisante, oui.
- Attendez une seconde.
- Quoi ?
Merci
Je devrais vous emmener à toutes mes inspections.
Là, baissez vous.
Attention.
On ne sait jamais ce qu'on peut rencontrer la-dessous.
Faites attention.
Attendez une minute, on a un gagnant.
- Vous voyez ça?
- Quoi?
- Juste là.
- C'est une fuite.
- Tru, pouvez vous me tenir cela une seconde
- Oui
Vous voyez
Et voilà
C'est une bonne chose que vous nous ayez contacté.
On ne l'aurait pas trouvé sans vous.
Vous êtes sur que c'est réparé?
Oui, tout est bon.
Positif. Je veux dire qu'il n'y a aucune chance que ça explose.
C'est bon.
Bien. Pas de feu aujourd'hui.
En fait, pas dans cet immeuble en tout cas.
Ecoutez, je finis dans 10 minutes. Vous prendriez bien un café?
Je pourrais tout vous dire sur les risques d'incendies dans les immeubles d'avant guerre.
J'apprécie vraiment, mais
Un petit ami?
Vous savez quoi ? Laissez moi y penser.
Tu sais, ma collocotaire veut vraiment te rencontrer.
On pourrait faire les présentations ce weekend.
Genna, je suis professeur adjoint, je ne peux pas..
D'accord, d'accord,
j'adorerais rencontrer tes amis. Ne me fais pas la gueule, d'accord?
Je reviens de suite. Je dois juste aller aux toilettes.
Tru
Salut !
Salut... C'est un...
Que fais-tu ici ?
Je voulais te faire une surprise.
On ne passe pas assez de bon temps ensemble avec mon job et tout.
Quoi ? tu n'es pas content de me voir ?
Si. Bien sur, que je le suis. Je suis, Je suis surpris,  c'est tout. Euh.. Euh...
Où est le doyen?
Hum... Annulé.
Trop fatigué.
Mark ?
Je suis désolée. Je voulais juste dire bonjour à mon prof préféré.
Oui, je ...je te présente Tru
Elle est l'une de mes meilleures élèves.
Vous êtes dans sa classe maintenant?
Vous apprendrez beacoup de lui.
Des choses innatendues, que vous ne voudriez pas connaître.
Mais il a une façon de rendre les choses très simples.
Sa classe doit vraiment vous manquer.
Je le croyais,
mais je sais maintenant qu'elle ne me manquera pas du tout.
Bon, j'ai assez abusé du temps du Professeur.
Tru
Adieu Mark.
Il est tout à vous.
Tru, attends,
Tru !!
Tu as fait ça?
C'était incroyable,
avoir la chance de pouvoir tout dire sur le moment.
Mon dieu,
je n'aurais jamais pu faire un truc dans ce genre.
Tu es tellement forte, Tru. C'est ce que j'admire le plus en toi.
Et je suis désolée pour Evans,
pas surprise, juste désolée.
Oh.
Ah, mignon.
Bon, à partir de maintenant, plus de secrets OK?
Ok,
alors j'ai quelque chose à te dire Lindsay.
Je crois que j'ai rencontré un nouveau mec.
Déjà ?
Petite trainée.
Je peut te poser une question?
Bien sur
Tu savais que le corps de maman avait été envoyé à la morgue où je travaille?
Non, mais j'avais 10 ans lorsqu'elle est morte.
Allez Tru, tu dois oublier ces choses là, tu n'était qu'une enfant.
Tu devrais te détendre un peu.
Comment le savais-tu ?
Savoir quoi?
Tu savais que le couvercle n'était pas vissé avant même qu'il tombe.
Sérieusement.
La semaine dernière, tu connaissais mes cartes et maintenant ça.
Alors, vas-tu me dire ce qui se passe?
Je ne peux pas.
- Et Pourquoi?
- Parce que tu ne comprendrais pas
Moi ?
Allez Tru.
Comment le savais-tu ?
Je le sais.
De la même manière que je sais qu'il va pleuvoir à 3H,
ou que Patterson va marquer 2 essais pour les Tigers.
Ne réponds pas à une question par une question.
Tu sais quoi Tru, il y a des moments où je ne te comprend pas.
Patterson va vraiment marquer 2 essais ?
Au fait, j'aime bien cette chemise
Celle ci ? je l'ai juste prise dans le placard.
- Hum..
- Quoi?
- Rien
- Allez, quoi?
Ca fait du bien ne rencontrer quelqu'un qui ne soit pas un imbécile.
He bien, nous sommes pas tous des imbéciles.
Non, c'est vrai.
Alors peut être, tu répondrais à cette question?
Comment ce fait-il que tu m'ai menti
sur le fait d'être une étudiante?
D'accord, qu'est-ce qui te fais penser que j'ai menti?
Tu es supposée être dans le bureau de ton professeur à 2H et il est maintenant 2H15.
On a fait une bonne action, non? En stoppant cette fuite.
Oui, c'est vrai.
Alors restons en là.
D'accord, c'est étrange mais restons en là.
Tu aimes être pompier?
Oui, j'aime aider les gens.
Tu ne te soucies pas du danger de ton boulot?
On voit ça tous les jours aux infos, un pompier rentre dans un immeuble et...
Je n'y pense pas réellement.
Parfois le travail te choisis, tu vois ce que je veux dire?
Oui, je vois.
Je comprends, tu es bon pour ce job.
Si nous n'avions pas trouvé la fuite, qui sait ce qui ce serait passer cet après midi.
cet après midi?
Oui, tu ne sais pas qui aurait pu mourrir.
En fait, si je le sais.
Personne.
Que veux-tu dire?
L'accumulation n'était pas suffisante pour créer une explosion.
La fuite n'était pas dangeureuse?
Pas à ce moment là. Dans 2 semaines peut-être
Mais cette fuite n'aurait pas pu déclancher un incendie aujourd'hui.
Nick Kelly, mort par asphyxie au gaz.
Samantha Blanc. Elle était cachée sous son lit.
<i>Aidez moi</i>
<b>Aidez moi</b>
Je suis Nick.
Pouvons-nous discuter ?
C'est une fuite.
Je veux dire qu'il n'y a aucune chance que ça explose.
C'est bon.
Si nous n'avions pas trouvé la fuite, qui sait ce qui ce serait passer cet après midi.
tu ne sais pas qui aurait pu mourrir.
En fait, si je le sais.
Personne
L'accumulation n'était pas suffisante pour créer une explosion.
Le type de feu hypothétique que tu décris pourrait être causé
par un chiffon en coton trempé dans un accélérateur.
Comme du Benzène diméthylique ?
Pourquoi es-tu si intéressée dans ce scénario,
tu veux te venger de quelqu'un?
Je suis là pour apprendre.
Lebenzène diméthylique se trouve dans les produits de nettoyage,
mélanges en avec un combustible sur un chiffon et Boum!
Les fibres que tu décris seraient incrustés dans de la peau proche du lieu d'explosion.
C'est donc un incendie criminel.
En hypothèse.
Hypothétiquement oui. Il prend vite et est dur à détecter.
Si tu es dans le coin, tu te fais de méchantes brûlures.
Je n'étais pas présent lors de la dernière inspection.
J'ai passé la nuit aux urgences.
Merci pour votre aide Davis.
Tu sais, si jamais tu as besoin d'aide pour une autre recherche hypotéthique, hum..
Je serais toujours là.
Et si je suis absent, passe moi un coup de fil sur mon portable,
on pourrait peut-être, en parler derrière un verre.
Tu as de la compagnie?
Une personne que je fréquente, un ami.
Son nom est Nick Kelly
Mr Septembre
C'est pour une bonne cause.
Alors tu travailles ici, hein?
Parfois le travail te choisit.
En tout cas, je pense à un incendie criminel.
Incendie criminel?
Tu as dit que la fuite de gaz ne pouvait amorcer un feu aujourd'hui,
ce qui signifie que c'est arrivé d'une autre façon.
De quoi tu parles?
Il n'y a pas de feu au 84 rue Hastings.
Non, pas encore.
Tru , je ne comprends pas pourquoi tu suspecte cet homme
de démarrer un feu qui n'existe même pas
Il a des dettes pour fraude à l'assurance
Et tu penses qu'il a prévu de brûler l'immeuble?
A quoi cela rime? Tru, pourquoi m'avoir amener ici?
Je crois que le 84 Hastings serait la cible
d'un incendie criminel aujourd'hui.
Si tu as des infos sur un incendie criminel, tu devrais en parler à la police
au lieu de courrir dans tous les sens comme Nancy Drew.
Mais c'est une intuition.
Quel genre d'intuition?
Ecoute, je te propose un marché
Je t'écoute
Attends jusqu'à ce soir
et je te dirais tout ce que tu veux savoir
et bien plus encore.
Tu as de la chance que j'ai un faible pour les femmes bizarres.
Il est 3h30, je te verrai là bas aussitôt que je le pourrais.
Prends quelques bières, commande un chinois
et tu ne pars pas avant que j'arrive. Promis ?
Oui.
Très très bizarre.
Hé ?
Il y a quelqu'un en bas?
Hé ?
Mr Ford.
Laisser moi deviner, vous avez perdu une boucle d'oreille.
Non, je suis là pour vous parler.
A propos de quoi?
Cet immeuble est sous la surveillance de la police et des pompiers.
Ils suspectent un éventuel incendie criminel.
OK, je me lance. Pourquoi?
C'est à vous de me le dire.
Qui diable êtez vous?
- Vous avez des dettes depuis deux ans à causes d'une fraude à l'assurance
- Et alors?
- Et pourquoi ne pas enlever ça...
- C'est quoi ce bordel?
Je vous donne juste un avertissement
Ne me parle pas sur ce ton, d'accord ?
Comment était l'école, ma chéri ?
C'était bien ?
Très bien
Samantha Blanc
Morte asphixiée par la fumée
Viens, Samantha, on ne parle pas aux étrangers
Excusez moi madame.
Harrison, je ne peux pas te parler pour l'instant, j'ai un truc sur le feu.
Les Tigers ont gagné aujourd'hui. Comme tu l'avais prévu.
Contente de t'avoir aidé.
Je veux des réponses, Tru.
Comment tu l'as su?
Je n'ai pas le temps...Combien as-tu gagné?
Un petit problème, tu n'étais pas là et j'ai parié ce que j'avais.
Alors, voila le programme,
tu fais ton numéro de vision
tous les matins, et
toi et moi
on passe en revu tous les scores.
En premier, le football, après -
Ah, je dois y aller.
Pourrait indiquer l'exposition à un produit chimique,
du benzène diméthylique, je pense
principalement utilisé en industrie.
Oh, Salut
J'ai..J'ai entendu un bruit.
Je suis Tru. Je crois que l'on s'est déjà vu avant.
Oui, je me souviens.
Qu'est-ce que tu dirais de sortir d'ici?
Allez viens, je t'offre un soda.
La petite fille qui était en haut avec toi, c'est ta soeur?
Oui
Tu n'as pas l'air content.
Elle est sympa.
Cet endroit craint.
Mon père s'est tiré.
Il est à Washington avec une nouvelle femme.
Alors, pourquoi as-tu cassé la vitre pour entrer dans le bureau de Mr Ford?
C'était un accident. J'ai frappé trop fort..
Tu sais tu aurais pu crocheter la serrure, elle a au moins cent ans.
Kevin, tu dois me faire une faveur,
mais tu ne poses aucune question.
Quoi ?
A 5H,
assures toi que ta soeur, ta mère et toi soyez à l'extérieur
du bâtiment
et aussi tous ceux que tu auras pu prévenir.
Pourquoi?
J'ai dis pas de questions.
Ok, ce sera fait.
Bien, une seconde
Salut ?
Tu es où ?
Nick, je t'avais demandé de m'attendre à ton appartement.
Et moi je te demande une explication sur le pourquoi
tu essayes d'éteindre des feux imaginaires?
Je veux dire, c'est une belle journée et je reste coincé
dans mon appart à cause d'une certaine fille qui travaille à la morgue.
Je pense que c'est le concierge.
Je te l'ai dit, des convictions ne sont pas des preuves.
Son bureau est rempli d'accélérateurs.
Oui, pour le nettoyage. Ce gars est concierge.
Il a quelque chose de pas très net.
D'accord, même si c'est lui, il n'y a toujours pas de feu.
Tu ne peux pas arrêter un type sur ce qu'il pense faire
Heureusement,
car on pourrait être arrêter pour nos pensées.
Tu penses que je suis folle, non?
Honnêtement?
Cela m'a traversé l'esprit.
Ecoute, j'ai peut être tout faux, je ne sais pas,
mais je veux seulement empêcher ce feu.
- Le feu n'est pas encore arrivé
- Mais il pourrait
- Comment le sais-tu?
- Je le sais, c'est tout
Encore ton intuition.
J'avais raison pour la fuite de gaz
Tu dois me croire
Le plus bizarre c'est que,
je te crois.
Il est bientôt 5H
Elle est belle et me donne même l'heure
Non
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas
- Je ne peux pas maintenant
- Si tu le peux
Non, je ne peux pas
Nous y sommes presque
Si je t'embrasse, je tomberai amoureuse de toi et
je ne le peux pas. Ce serait mal.
Pourquoi ? pourquoi ce serait si mal ?
Des fibres de cotons plaquées sur la peau.  C'est rouges et il y a autre chose...
Kevin, c'était un cadeau de ton père.
Je la déteste.
J'avais tord.
- Pour quoi?
- Pour le coupable. C'est le gamin
Quel gamin ?
Kevin, le gamin de l'immeuble. Il va démarrer le feu.
Alors maintenant c'est un gamin qui met le feu?
Il y a une minute, tu disais que c'était le concierge.
Il est en colère.
Seul. Il se sent invisible.
Il peut crocheter la serrure du concierge,
quelle meilleure façon d'attirer l'attention? J'ai compris
Toi, peut être.
Ecoute, je dois aller dans cet immeuble. La soeur du gamin va être en danger.
- Tru, je...
- Promet moi de rentrer chez toi
- Mais s'il y a un feu...
- Non !
Tu as raison.
Il n'y a pas de feu.
J'avais tord, même folle si tu veux.
Alors rentres chez toi et attends moi là-bas,
Promets-le moi Nick.
- Je suis fatigué de ce jeu là
- Nick,
S'il te plait...
Je t'aime bien,
tu sais que c'est vrai et je pense
que tu ressens la même chose. Je ne l'imagine pas, non?
Non
- Et je dois savoir...
- Je te l'ai dit, tu auras les réponses ce soir.
Et avant la fin du jour, tu auras ce baiser,
mais maintenant rentres chez toi.
Tout le monde sort de l'immeuble! Hé! Hé!
Il y a le feu! tout le monde dehors!
Vous feriez mieux de sortir!!! Allez! Allez!
Sortez de l'immeuble, allez!
Que fais-tu ici ? !
- Je t'ai suivi
- Tu avais promis
Je m'inquiétais pour toi
Tu dois sortir d'ici immédiatement! Allez!
Encore ton intuition?
Allons y.
- Non, je reste
- Pourquoi?
Je suis un pompier
Tu n'as pas ton casque. J'ai sonné l'alarme, ils seront là dans peu de temps.
Super, le traffic va être bloqué dans toute la ville.
Il vont être retardé par les embouteillages.
C'est pour ça que tu étais là, tu vis à coté.
Ecoute moi, je veux que tu sortes. J'y tiens. Je vais voir en haut.
Non! Non Nick attends!
Viens par là, je te tiens.
Je te tiens.
Ok, Ok, Ok,
J'ai de la chance aujourdh'ui.
Je suis ton sauveur mon petit.
Allons-y tout va brûler.
- Nick
- Je t'entends, j'ai un rescapé.
La victime a eu la cheville cassée.
Nick stop!
- Quoi?
- Le placher est fragile, fais attention!
Comment as tu.. c'est pas grave.
Ho mon Dieu! Ho mon Dieu!
Tu vois, je savais que j'aurais mon baiser avant la fin de la journée.
Où est Samantha? elle était supposée être dans le park.
Oh mon Dieu! Ma fille est toujours à l'intérieur!
Elle est encore dans l'immeuble.
- Où vas-tu?
- Je vais la chercher.
Elle se cachait sous son lit
Elle se cache sous le lit, mais envoie quelqu'un d'autre.
C'est mon travail, Tru. Je suis aussi tétu que toi.
- Nick, non!
- Ecoute moi, je serai en bas dans une minute.
Nick, prends un casque.
Pas le temps, il y a une petite fille en haut. Je sais où elle est.
Tru
Je ne peux pas te parler pour l'instant
Mais tu pleures
Oui.
Je sais, cela a été dur pour nous deux, je le comprends
Non, tu comprends rien
Tru, je voudrais rembobiner la journée et la rejouer. Je ferai tout différemment.
Je te montrerai à quel point tu comptes à mes yeux
Tu as eu ta journée.
Tu en a qu'une seule.
Je pensais que tu demandais de l'aide pour toi,
je sais maintenant que c'était pour Samantha
Tu l'as sauvé.
Tu es un héro pour tout le monde.
Mais je ne veux pas paraître égoiste mais...
Je vous voulais tous les deux.
Tu as dit que ton travail consistait à aider les gens
Tu as toujours voulu faire ça.
Comme pour moi.
Alors demande le moi,
S'il te plais...
Je ne pars pas tant que tu ne le demande pas
S'il te plait demande le moi, Nick
Demande le simplement

- FIN -
Aidez moi
Te voilà, Tru.
Tu peux me rendre un service?
Oui, bien sur
Derrière moi
L'autre néon
Je peux te poser une question, Davis?
Pas de problème.
Tu aimes cet endroit?
Bien sûr que oui, je suis là depuis 8 ans.
Mais tu t'y plais ?
Quelque chose ne va pas?
Ca ne te touche pas de voir tous ces cadavres, jours après jours?
Ouais...
Bien sur, je préfèrerais m'occuper de rhumes ou autre,
mais là plus part du temps ça passe
Mon amie Lindsey travaille dans les relations publiques
Comme nous
Sauf que les clients sont décédés
Voici ce que je pense Tru
Nous sommes tous quelques part pour une raison,
parfois il faut l'accepter, quelqu'en soit la raison.
14 Heures Plus tôt
Merde.
- Allo,
- Princesse, Désolé, tu dormais?
Ca va, je dois seulement me lever dans douze heures.
Je voulais être sur qu'on se voyait toujours pour le brunch aujourd'hui.
Oui, sans problème
Super, on se voit alors tout à l'heure.
Je dois racrocher.
Batterie a plat.
A plus Tru.
Donc tu penses qu'elle m'appréciera?
Ecoute, je te l'ai déjà dit, Tru est la meilleure
Mais elle a été dur avec quelques filles.
Il y en a eu d'autres?
Peu importe.
Je crois entendre un mensonge.
Le même que tu as utilisé la première fois
pour me mettre dans ton lit.
Sérieusement,
quand je pense aux autres filles et comment cela se passait
Je pense... heu..
tu sais, je pensais que c'était la bonne mais...
et maintenant je t'es rencontré.
Chut, tu vas nous apporter de la malchance.
Superstitieuse ?
Ca dépends des sujets.
Les places de parkings, l'amour.
C'est justement de quoi on est en train de parler,
d'Amour
Je vais prendre une douche.
Pour être sûre d'être présentable pour toi et ta soeur protective.
Hey, Fais voir ça.
Qu'est ce que c'est ?
Quoi ?
Ton dos, laisse moi regarder.
Ce n'est rien, vraiment, j'ai glissé en travaillant dehors.
Tu as glissé ?
Oui
Cela n'a rien avoir avec...
Non, ça n'a rien à voir.
seulement une...
fille maladroite qui apprends la dure loi de la vie.
Il m'a fait du rentre dedans.
-Non, je n'ai pas fais du rentre dedans.
- Et t'appelles ça comment?
C'était un diner.
Tu étais seule, j'étais seule.
Je voulais juste entamer la conversation.
Tu lui a fais du rentre dedans.
De toute façon, je ne l'aurais pas amener chez moi.
Il y a tellement d'étrangers qui me font la cour pour me ramener.
Mais il a été tenace,
il a eu mon numéro
et il a appellé, et appelé encore,
et enfin obtenu un diner.
Ca va faire deux semaines.
Et c'est toute notre histoire
Mon frère est amoureux.
Déjà, je croyais qu'il venais juste de la rencontrer.
c'est vrai, mais ca avance vite.
Dieu que je déteste les gens amoureux
Ils se croient toujours meilleurs,
juste parce qu'ils ont trouvé
quelqu'un qui pourra les supporter
Au fait, tu en es où avec James?
Troisième rendez-vous, ce soir,
et tu sais ce que cela signifie.
Ah, la règle du troisième rendez-vous
- Une des plus grandes inventions ignorées de notre temps, Merci
- De rien
Alors, tu vas couchez avec lui ?
C'est la troisième fois, Tru, un simple café
Tu ne crois pas à la règle du troisième rendez vous, non ?
Je crois en toi, alors tu y crois ?
Il est trop mignon, un peu timide
Oh mon dieu, tu l'aimes bien.
Je l'aime bien.
Donc, vraiment ?
- Oui, je l'ai trouvée sympa
- Mais ?
Il n'y a pas de mais.
Tu devrais la garder Harrisson
C'est génial Tru.
Parce que, on sait tout les deux que tu a été vraiment dure avec certaine de mes copines.
He bien, soyons honnéte. Je veux dire, certaines étaient
vraiment des cas, et je ne parle même pas de celles qui se sentaient supérieurs.
Pas Sarah, elle est différente Tru.
Je ne sais pas,
mais lorsque je suis avec elle, je...
Je me sens meilleur. Tu vois?
Joli
Il faut que je te dise: son ex-mari est un vrai salaud.
- Elle est divorcée?
- Oui. Ca rajoute un peu de problème.
Mais elle croit en moi, Tru
Merde, je ne crois même pas en moi parfois
Mais cette fille, cette...
non, cette femme
Elle pense que je suis quelqu'un de special
- J'aime cette fille
- Très fort.
Quelle nuit bizarre
Mais on doit te trouver un mec.
Parce que avoir une ralation ca vaut le coup.
Allo
Hé chéri, comment vas-tu ?
- Quand, maintenant?
- Quelque chose ne va pas?
Non, ne t'inquiète pas Sarah, j'arrive.
Désolé, Tru, je dois partir
Elle n'a rien ?
Ne t'en fais pas, je peux me débrouiller
Mais je t'appelerai plus tard, promis.
Ca été un désastre
Il était hésitant et rapide.
Il a même pas osé me regarder après
Il a juste prétexter qu'il devait ce lever tôt
le lendemain et c'est enfui de mon appartement
Qu'est ce que tu as fais ?
Qu'est-ce que je pouvais faire ?
je lui ai dit aurevoir et me suis ampiffré de cookies.
Et non seulement j'ai ma plus mauvaise expérience
sexuelle avec un mec que j'aimais vraiment
Mais j'ai aussi pris 1 Kg
J'ai officiellement annulé la règle du troisième rendez-vous
C'est seulement encore une invention des mecs pour nous avoir dans leur poche.
Chérie, je suis rentré
Je te rappelerai
D'accord.
La police a trouvé le corps à 22h30
dans le maison de son ancienne femme.
Balle dans la poitrine.
C'est bien de voir que certaines personnes
ont de pires relations que les miennes
- Tu peux me tenir ça?
- Yeah
Andrew Webb. Il vit au port
Sympa.
Il aurait du garder un peu d'argent pour s'acheter un gillet parre-balles.
Oh mon Dieu !
Sarah !
Hey, c'est Harrisson, laissez moi un message.
C'est encore moi, je dois vraiment te parler.
Rappelle moi dès que tu auras mon message, OK?
Est-ce que ça va ?
Je vais bien.
Ces peronnes sont des génies.
Et les seuls questions que je conaisse sont sur Gilligan Saare.
- Allo
- Tru, c'est Meridith
Ecoute, je dois vraiment parler à harrisson,
c'est une question de vie ou de mort
Je suis à côté de lui en ce moment.
Il a été arrêté..
Pour quoi ?
On ne sait pas encore officiellement.
Je crois qu'il a tué quelqu'un.
Quoi?
Ils ont dit qu'il a tué l'ex de sa copine
- Andrew Webb?
- Oui, c'est lui. Comment tu le sais?
On vient de recevoir son corps, mais c'est impossible Mer.,
Harrisson ne pourrait jamais tuer quelqu'un.
Ca s'annonce mal, Tru, il ont trouvé son sang
dans la chambre et ses empreintes sur l'arme.
Où est-il maintenant ?
Il le ramène au commissariat. Ecoute je dois filer,
je te rappelle lorsque j'en saurais plus.
Mer, attends, Mer...
Gardez, tu peux me faire une faveur? Dis à Davis que
je serais de retour dès que je le pourrais, d'accord?
Est-ce que ça va ?
Je ne sais pas encore.
Non pas que je ne sois pas cool avec le concept des corps s'adressant à moi,
mais si tu dois m'apeller à l'aide,
cela serait vraiment le bon moment.
<b>Aide moi</b>
- Allo
- Princesse, Ho! tu dormais?
Harrisson, tu dois m'écouter et écouter attentivement
Bien,
j'ai besoin de te dire quelque chose.
Ca peut pas attendre le brunch ?
Tu nous invites toujours pour le brunch ?
Oui, mais il va se passer quelque chose auhourd'hui,
quelque chose d'important
Je sais, tu va rencontrer Sarah
Tu es tellement dramatique.
Je dois y aller, la batterie est morte.
Tu sais que tu es en avance...
d'environ...
douze heures.
Je ne reste pas
Tu sais que pour quelqu'un qui n'aime pas cet endroit, tu y es souvent.
Tu n'as jamais pensé que peut-être...
tu appartiens à cet endroit ?
Je te le dirai dans à peu près 12 heures.
C'est toi qui choisi.
C'est Harrisson, il a des problèmes.
Harrisson a toujours des problèmes.
Tu m'as fait sortir d'une réunion pour me dire ça!
Aujourd'hui c'est différent
D'accord, je te crois, en quoi aujourdh'ui est différent ?
Meredith, ça va te paraître étrange mais
crois-tu Harrisson capable de tuer quelqu'un?
Quoi? C'est quoi cette question?
- Le crois-tu?
- C'est ton frère, Tru.
Je sais qu'on n'a pas toujours été très proche avant mais
Meredith, je veux seulement une réponse hônnete,
Crois-tu qu'Harrisson soit capable de tuer quelqu'un?
Oui
- Pourquoi? Non! Je ne penses pas qu'il serait capable...
- De quoi veux-tu parler Tru? Ou c'est seulement une de tes folles hyothéses ?
Oui, oui, c'est ça
Mais écoute, je vais avoir besoin de ton aide aujourd'hui, sans aucune question
Oui, d'accord, mais la prochaine fois, pas pendant une réunion
D'accord, je te tiens au courant.
c'est ça, tiens moi au courant
Tu es en retard
Et c'est une bonne chose ne ne jamais avoir
rendu le double de tes clefs.
- Je suis contente de te voir Harrisson
- Oui, moi aussi
Tu te comportes comme-ci tu m'avais pas vu depuis longtemps.
Je te présente...
Sarah
Tu dois être, Tru. J'ai beaucoup entendu parler de toi.
Moi aussi.
Ton appart est très jolie, cet immeuble est tout simplement génail.
- Harrisson, je peux te parler une seconde?
- Doucement, Tru, tu viens juste d'arriver.
De toute façon, tu peux tout me dire
devant Sara.
OK, Hum...
J'ai rencontré Andrew hier
Andrew?
Mon ex-mari
Tru, je dois te parler.
Tru, dans le futur, un sujet de conversation interdit quand tu
rencontreras ma nouvelle petite amie : mes exs et ses exs
Reste éloignez de Sarah juste pour aujourdh'ui.
Tu ne changera jamais
Quelque soit la fille que je te présente, tu lui trouves toujours
quelque chose.
Elle est divorcée, où est le problème?
La moitié du pays est divorcée
Je n'ai rien contre elle, c'est pour toi que je m'inquiète
Je suis un grand garçon, Tru.
Si j'ai le coueur brisé, j'aurais le coeur brisé !
Tu ne peux pas toujours me protéger
Mais je peux te protéger aujourd'hui
Ecoute, va voir un film, parier sur des chevaux, ou je ne sais pas moi,
mais reste loin d'elle, je t'en pris!
Des fois, je ne te comprends pas
- Ces derniers temps c'est quasiment tout le temps
- Fais ça pour moi, tu veux?
Seulement aujourd'hui
Pourquoi est-ce que tu rends ça si difficile?
Parce que je peux.
Je peux vous aider?
Oh, je n'avais pas réalisé que vous étiez là, désolè.
Vous prenez des photos de ma maison.
Vous devriez avoir à faire des choses plus intéressantes.
Nous allons éditer un livre sur le port.
Les photos sont pour l'ambiance.
Un livre?
Un projet de livre en fait
Je vous épargne les détails, mais nous n'utiliserons
aucune photos sans votre permission
Votre bateau est tellement beau, désolé pour le dérangement
Vous avez également une très belle silhouette.
Alors, Parlez moi un peu de ce livre
Une bière, du vin, je vous sers quelque chose?
Pourquoi je pense que vous n'êtes pas intéressé dans ce livre?
Pourquoi je pense que vous étes le fille la plus perspicase que j'ai rencontré récemment ?
Elle est très jolie
Elle s'appelle Sarah
Mais je suis sur qu'il y a de meilleur sujet de conversation que ma femme
- Vous voulez vraiment rien boire?
- Désolé, je ne suis pas en avance
Mais, c'est bien de voir que
le divorce n'a rien changé à vos sentiments.
Sarah et moi ne nous somme pas divorcés, juste séparé.
Sarah n'est pas votre ex-femme?
Non, c'est ma femme.
- Allo
- Où es-tu, je t'attends depuis une demi heure?
Lindsey, je suis désolé. J'ai eu un empêchement.
J'espérais un check-up personel, tant pis,
Je t'appellerai ce soir alors.
Hé Lindsay, rappelles-toi seulement d'une chose,
La règle du troisième rendez-vous a été inventé par les mecs pour
nous mettre dans leur lit. Quoique tu fasses, ne te laisse pas avoir.
Tu prends ton rôle de grande soeur protective au sérieux, je vois
Pourquoi n'as tu pas dit à Harrisson que tu est toujours mariée.
Il m'a prévenu que tu étais dure.
Mais je ne pense pas que ta bénédiction nécessitait
un interrogatoire et une véréfication du passé.
Je suis désolé, c'est mon petit frère et parfois je m'emballe.
Ecoute
Ce n'est pas parce que nous n'avons pas signé des papiers de divorces que le marriage est toujours là
Tu connais une personne qui voudrait faire du mal à ton mari?
Les gens ne font pas de mal à Andrew
C'est Andrew qui les blesse
Je l'ai épousé, quand j'étais jeune
Trop jeune
Peut être pour ça que je croyais que c'était ma faute
Et pour une raison ou une aure, j'avais fait quelque chose de mal
Mais je l'ai mérité
Mérité quoi?
Appelle cela comme tu veux :
violence conjugale,
abus physique,
C'est tout aussi douloureux
Mais avant que j'ai eu le courage de partir,
le plus dur était passé.
Ca m'a pris des années pour comprendre que le plus dur venait seulemnt de commencer
Il ne veut pas divorcer
Non, perdre le contrôle n'est pas dans la nature d'Andrew
J'ai quelque chose qui peut t'aider à comprendre.
Je les ai trouvées dans ma boite aux lettres ce matin, pas de nom,
mais pas besoin d'être un génie pour savoir qui les a envoyés.
Ecoute, est-ce que j'aurais du dire plus tôt à Harrisson
que j'étais toujours marrié?
Probablement.
Il veut juste lui faire peur pour qu'il casse avec moi.
Il ne s'effraye pas facilement, tu sais.
Je sais.
C'est pour cela que je l'aime.
Que je l'aime vraiment.
Pareil pour moi
Tu me dis de rester loin de Sarah, et tu vas la harceler.
Tu sais qu'elle m'a appelé ?
Pratiquement en larmes! Elle pense que tu la détestes!
Je na la déteste pas, ce n'est pas le sujet
Quoi? Mais de quoi s'agit-il alors ?
Tu dois me faire confiance, croire en ce que je fais.
Ou peut être pas, je ne sais pas
Tu sais, çà avait beaucoup plus de sens quand tu pensais que les personnes décédées te parlaient
- Merçi.
- Quand es-tu devenue si hypocrite ?
Tu as couché avec ton prof et tu me tombes dessus parce que je sors avec une femme qui est séparée !
- Non, ce n'est pas à ce sujet.
- La raison, c'est qu'elle n'est pas divorcée parce qu'elle est terrifiée.
Et merde, Tru
Tu sais ce que je pense?
Je pense que c'est parce que je suis heureux
Car j'ai rencontré quelqu'un, et cela te tue que ton patetic
petit frère a une vie meilleure que la tienne.
Depuis le temps que tu essayes de me convaincre
que Meredith est l'égoiste de la famille.
- Mais en fait ça toujours été toi.
- Harrisson, tu ne comprends pas
Tu crois?
Il me semble que pour la première fois
J'ai tout compris
Laissez moi deviner
Il n'y a pas de livre
Je voulais vous posez quelques questions Mr Webb
Vous avez intérêt à parlez vite car la police sera bientôt là
Vous savez, j'aurais du le savoir
- Combien Sarah vous paye?
- Pour faire quoi?
Remuer la merde, m'obliger à lui accordez le divorce
Non de dieu, vous savez, nous jouons a ce jeu depuis des mois,
Et franchement, son manque d'originalité commence à me surprendre
- Bonjour, Andrew Webb à l'appareil...
- Je ne travaille pas pour votre femme, je ssuis là pour vous aider
- J'ai un intrus à bord
M'aidez pour quoi faire?
Pour que vous voyez demain se lever.
C'est une menace?
Non
Mais si je dois vous aider, vous devez être sincère avec moi.
Pourquoi avez-vous fais suivre Sarah ?
- Quoi?
- Pourquoi vous n'accordez pas le divorce à votre femme Mr Webb?
Parce qu'elle m'a épousé pour mon argent
Si on divorce, elle en aura la moitié.
Si on reste marié, elle aura ce que je lui donne.
Donc, vous la punissez
Elle me fait passer pour le méchant mari, ingénieux.
Elle est plus maligne que je le pensais..
- Elle vous a dit que je la battais?
- M'affirmez-vous le contraire?
Je ne l'ai jamais frappée
et je n'ai jamais frappé une femme
Pourquoi vous ne partiriez pas avant que je change ma réponse
Sarah
Sarah
Sarah
Dis moi ce qui c'est passé
Il...
Il est venu içi et il était...
il était hors de lui.
Il t'as frappé?
- Hein?
- Non
Pas cette fois mais
Il m'a fait peur
Il a dit qu'il allait me tuer.
Quoi?
Pourquoi?
A cause de toi, parce qu'il te hait
Il me hait?
Qu'est ce que j'ai fait?
Tu m'as fait tomber amoureuse de toi.
Peut-être que... qu'il serait plus sécurisant pour moi
si nous restions ensemble dorénavent, ok?
Tous les deux.
Tu sais, je ne sais plus quoi faire.
Je vais juste lui donner, je vais lui donner exactement ce qu'il veut.
Voyons, qu'est-ce que je peux faire? Il est venu ici et,
je suis trop impuissante pour me protéger toute seule.
Peut être devrais-tu te défendre.
De quoi tu parles?
- Je devrais prendre des cours de self-défense ou aller m'acheter un flingue ?
- Tu ne serais plus sans défense.
Regarde moi
Je connais un gars
Tu connais un gars
Qui peut te fournir une arme aujourd'hui
Est-ce que tu m'aimes?
Tu sais bien que oui
Alors fais moi confiance
Je connais un gars
- Ici la police
- Oui, Sarah Wabb
- Vous allez bien?
- Mon mari vient de...
- Parlez madame, votre mari vient de faire quoi madame?
Il m'a frappé. Je saigne
Est-il là? Oùest-il maintenant?
Non, il est parti...
euh... mais s'il vous plait, s'il revient
- Il a dit qu'il allait me tuer.
- Où se trouve-t-il?
Oh mon dieu le voilà.
Andrew, Andrew, arrétes ça ! STP Andr
Un ami de D.A. a trouvé ça pour moi.
Ca date de décembre dernier.
Il m'a menti.
Qu'y a-t-il?
Rien, j'étais en train de penser à haute voix.
Alors, Harrison sait que tu enquêtes sur sa copine ?
C'est pour son propre bien Meredith, crois moi.
Et que s'est-il passé une fois que la police est arrivé à leur maison ?
- Le mari était parti. La police a rempli une pleinte.
- et ?
- et rien... Sarah s'est présentée le lendemain pour être sur qu'ils abandonnent les poursuites.
- Pourquoi?
- Comportement classique d'une femme battue
J'ai l'habitude de voire ça.
Ecoute, si tu as fini avec tes recherches, j'ai une tonne de travail qui m'attend
- Merci, Meredith, je t'en dois une
- C'est noté
Comme c'est pour de la protection privée que vous cherchez,
Je dirais un semi-automatique de 9 millimétres.
Je vends beaucoup de celui là
9mm, qu'est ce que ça signifie?
C'est la taille de la balle, c'est comme la taille des chaussures.
Le 10-mm a aussi de bons arguments,
un 45 est aussi un très bon choix.
- Et celui là?
- Excellent, si votre maison est envahie par des ours grizzlys
- le 9mm est bien
- Bon choix
Alors je fais un paquet cadeau ou la petite dame préfère le porter tout suite?
Je ne peux pas, je suis désolé, je ne peux pas
Wow, Hey, on en a déjà parlé. Tu en as besoin
Qu'est-ce que ca résoud?
Je veux dire, tu penses que ca peut me rendre ma vie?
De plus, j'ai lu quelque  part
Qu'il est plus probable que ma propre arme soit utilisée contre moi
- Hey, tu veux que je le garde pour toi ?
- Non, Harrison...
- Parce que je le ferai.
Tu dois en avoir un mais pas chez toi.
Je le garde moi, le problème est résolu.
Et s'il te pose ecore un problème,
tout ce que tu as à faire c'est de m'apeller.
Je ne sais pas. J'ai un mauvais pressentiment.
Hey, on est ensemble maintenant.
Emballe le, mec.
Dieu que je n'aime pas ça
Je sais que tu veux pas me parler mais tu dois m'écouter
Comme ça tu voulais me parler?
S'il te plait
Ecoute, je suis désolé à propos de Sarah
Pour avoir douter d'elle, je sais que son mari est le méchant, je sais tout
- C'est cool. C'est bien de ta part, je le pense
- J'ai pas fini. Tu es toujours en danger
Mais merde Tru
- Sous-titre non traduit -
- Passe une bonne nuit.
- Hé, Harisson, attends !
Tu portes un flingue?
- Sous-titre non traduit -
Oh mon Dieu
Penses-tu qu'Harrisson puisse tuer quelqu'un
Oui
- Tu l'as tué
- De quoi tu parles?
Tu va le tuer, tu vas tuer Andrew ce soir
Mais de quoi tu parles, pourquoi tu dit ça?
Parce que je le sais
Tu sais quoi?
Chaque petites choses qui vont se produire aujourd'hui
Quoi? Tu es devenue voyante d'un coup?
Ce n'est pas de la voyance, enfin, je ne le crois pas.
Ce que je veux dire, et je ne suis pas sûr du nom scientifique pour ceçi,
mais en utilisant des termes simples,
Je revis les journées.
Tu revis...
les journées!
Des gens m'apelle pour les aider,
des gens morts
Je sais, je t'en ai déjà parlé mais à ce moment,
la journée recommence
J'ai ainsi la chance de pourvoir les sauver
Ca n'arrive pas tous les jours
- Sous-titre non traduit -
Comment penses-tu que je connaissais tes cartes?
<i>Prends ça.</i>
Comment penses-tu que je savais qui allait gagner le match?
Même toi tu es intrigués.
OK, Tru, je t'aime tu le sais, mais là tu as vraiment besoin d'aide ???
Tu vois ce serveur?
Dans deux secondes, je parie qu'il renverse son plateau.
Qu'est-ce que tu dis?
Et cette table, de l'autre coté de la salle
-Tru
- Il va se lever et avouer son amour à sa copine
J'aime cette fille !
Qu'est ce qui ce passe?
Est-ce que c'est un de ces reality-shows,
où on essaie de faire peur à un gars?
Dans moins d'une minute, ton portable va sonner,
ce sera Sarah bouleversée et qui  aura des ennuis
Ecoute moi bien, elle va demander à te voir.
Tu vas filer d'ici et aller tuer son mari
Tu va tuer son mari et tu sera arrêter pour son meurtre
Oh hé, tu peux m'avoir avec ce serveur et
et cet amoureux, d'accord, mais ça...
C'est inimaginable, tu ne penses pas ?
Allo
C'est Sarah
Elle a besoin de moi
Attends
- J'y vais Tru
- Tu ne peux pas
Elle a besoin de moi
- Sous-titre non traduit -
Tu ne peux pas la sauver, tu n'y peux rien.
Si tu vas là-bas ce soir, tu le tuera.
Il mérite ce qu'il va recevoir
Ca va te mener où?
En prison pour le reste de ta vie ou pire encore?
Quoi? Tu veux que je sois comme papa?
Rester sans agir, et regarder la femme que j'aime se faire tuer,
c'est cela que tu veux ?
Quoi?
Harrisson, ce n'est pas maman
Ne fais pas cela en pensant sauver maman.
Ecoute, je ne sais même pas de quoi tu parles
Harrisson
Regarde moi
Tu veux bien me regarder
J'ai 20 ans et d'une façon ou d'une autre, j'ai perdu tous ceux que j'aimais
Une mère à cause d'une balle
Un père qui à perdu l'intérêt de vivre, Meridith sombrant dans sa coke et son ambition.
Tu comprends, je ne veux pas te perdre aussi.
Il ne me resterait personne.
Je suis maudite car je peux voir le futur
Et si tu va là-bas maintenant,
je sais que je vais me retrouver toute seule.
Tu ne me perdras jamais Tru.
Mais je dois y aller
- Je dois partir
- Hey
Taxi
- Allo
- Juste pour te dire qu'Andrew Webb à été pris pour excès de vitesse le 20 décembre de l'année dernière
En fait, Mer, je ne crois pas que ce soit le bon moment
- En Californie
- Et alors?
Alors, c'est la même nuit que Sarah a appelé la police.
Rappelle toi qui a vu Andrew cette nuit là, seulement Sarah
Les flics ne l'ont pas trouvé, pourquoi?
Parce qu'il n'était pas là
Il ne veux pas divorcer
Oh mon dieu, elle l'a piégé, elle a piégé Harrisson
Elle m'a épousé pour mon fric
Meredith, Tu connais les lois sur le divorce
- Si tu divorce de ton mari dans cet état
- Tu reçoit la moitié, régime de communauté
Et si tu le tues
Tu vas en prison, qu'est ce que tu veux Tru?
Mais si une autre personne le tue, tu rammasses tout
et le bouc émisaire va en prison
Elle a dit que c'était ouvert
Quelle surprise que tu m'ais appelé.
Tu disais ne pas pouvoir supporter être à coté de moi.
C'est le cas d'habitude.
Sauf qu'aujourdh'ui, mon électricien n'est pas disponible.
Charmante comme à ton habitude, Sarah.
Très bien, ton alarme est réparée.
Comment peux-tu écouter cette musique, je peux même pas m'entendre penser
Tu as entendu?
Non, je n'ai rien entendu Andrew
- Ca je l'est entendu. Andrew sois prudent
- Chéri, appelle la police, d'accord?
OK
Tue le Harrisson
Tue le ou il nous tuera tous les deux
Non
- Je ne peux pas
- Tu es un lâche
Peut être mais, je ne peux pas le tuer.
D'accord.
Maintenant, sors de ma maison, tes empreintes sont sur l'arme.
Heureuseument, j'ai reussi à t'échapper
Sarah
Ecoute mon conseil et
plaide la légitime défense, bien que dans
ton cas cela va être dur à prouver,
avec l'effraction et tout le reste.
Police, j'écoutes,
Je...
Je voudrais signaler un meurtre
Mon mari est mort
Qu'est ce qui se passe ici?
Tentative de meurtre, je dirais
J'ai reçu un coup de fil des plus bizarres aujourd'hui
Je sais que vous ne voulez pas me parler
mais vous devez m'écouter
Une fille m'a supplié
de porter un gilet pare-balles,
Harrisson
Je t'aurais protéger
Tu le sais, non?
Adieu, Sarah.
Tu n'aurais du prendre que la moitié
Tu sais,
Je ne peux pas dire que je t'en voudrais
je ne peux pas dire que je t'en voudrais
- Sous-titre non traduit -
Tu m'as dit la vérité.
Tu pense toujours que c'est moi qui l'ai tué ?
Je ne sais pas, peut être
Probablement
Comment va la tête ?
Ca fait mal, mais moins que ma fierté
Mais bien sur!
Si tu peux réellement faire ce que tu dis,
Je te le dis,
On pourrait vraiment en tirer des bénéfices.
Oui, c'est déjà fait.
Donc j'ai suivi ton conseil.
Nous ne sommes pas venu chez moi,
nous nous sommes juste parlés.
- Seulement parlés ?
- Oui
- Bien, je suis fière de toi
- Et tu sais ce que j'ai réalisé?
Que James était un gars trop ennuyeux donc j'ai couché avec lui.
C'était le seul moyen de le faire taire.
- Et
- C'était pas mal
Il est très gentil.
On va manger des sushis demain soir.
Une bonne chose que d'avoir écouté ton conseil, Hein Tru?
Oui, tant mieux...
Hey, tu as un instant? Je ne savais pas si tu allais revenir.
- Vous aviez raison, Davis
- A propos de quoi?
Il y a bien une raison pour que je sois là, une bonne raison
Oui, je savais que tu te le découvrirai
President, 1600
Salut Tru
Salut, ca va?
La nuit est calme, je vais chercher un casse croute
Ces gars sont des génies. Les seules questions auxquelles
je sais répondre sont sur Gilligan Saare.

C'est une redif ?

C'est l'heure.
Appelle moi.
Regarde où tu vas !
Je n'ai rien manqué ?
Est-ce que je l'ai manqué ?
Non.
Hey, où est encore passé Blake ?
En retard. Pourquoi ce soir serait différent ?
Parce que c'est la dernière nuit
tous ensemble, les gars.
Désolé, je suis en retard.
Je disais bonjour à mon ex.
- Laquelle ?
- Honnêtement, je n'arrive même plus à les distinguer.
- Ok. On lève son verre.
- Gentlemen ! Ca nous a pris 4 ans,
désolé, Ethanil 5,
mais à partir de ce soir, nous sommes libres.
Nous changerons peut-être,
mais pas notre amitié.
A la meilleure nuit de notre vie !
Jolie île.
Tu crois qu'il pourrait accepter une offre ?
Harrison, je suis venu ici pour parler.
Ok, quelqu'un meurt et demande de l'aide, et tu recommences ta journée.
Ca y est on a parlé.
- Quand je disais parler, c'était d'autres choses.
- Les choses sont comme elles sont.
Meredith se drogue
Moi, je n'ai... rien.
Et toi tu as ça !
C'est un drôle de truc à croire :
revivre une journée pour sauver quelqu'un.
Je sais d'où ça vient...
Personne n'attendait de toi que tu la sauves, Tru.
Ca n'a rien à voir avec notre mère.
J'ai pris un semestre de psychologie au lycée.
Ca a toujours à voir avec la mère de quelqu'un.
Il faudrait peut-être que tu laisses le passé derrière toi.
Je ne peux pas, car le passé ne me laisse pas tranquille.
Qui aurait pensé à mettre
le double de ses clefs sous son paillasson ?
Je t'en supplie, dis moi que tu as emmené du café ?
Un muffin au cassis,
sandwich au thon sur pain complet.
et un burito végétarien de la boutique que tu aimes.
Tu as des goûts bizarres.
Tu es une femme extraordinaire.
Alors comment vas-tu ?
- Choisis le sujet.
- Je choisis les garçons pour 200 € ?
Je sais que tout n'est pas rose,
mais tu dois t'en remettre.
Je viens de lire une étude très sérieuse :
seulement 1 mec sur 7 vaut le détour.
Je dirais plutôt 1 sur un million.
Il faut que j'aille me doucher.
Et tu n'as pas quelque chose de particulier à me dire ?
Oui, merci pour le petit-déj.
De rien.
Les amis sont faits pour ça.
Ouh, ça sent mauvais.
Gordez ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Oh, mon dieu.
Est-ce que tout va bien ici ?
- Oui, Gordez est un sale con, sinon tout est normal.
- Tu aurais dû voir ta tête.
- C'est hilarant.
- Allez Tru, déconne un peu.
Ah, on a un corps qui arrive,
un vrai.
- Ca va toi ?
- Oui, peu importe.
Davis, tu est d'accord avec lui ?
Tu crois que je prends les choses trop sérieusement ?
Gordez ne voit que les corps,
toi tu vois les personnes qu'ils ont été.
Il ne comprend pas ça.
- Et toi, tu me comprends ?
- Ne prends pas ça trop à coeur.
Bonjour, entre.
Je sais que l'on travaille tous
très tard en ce moment, Meredith, mais,
la direction insiste pour faire des tests anti-drogue
au hasard parmi les employés.
Maintenant ?
Incroyable !
- Est-ce que je peux récupérer mon assistant dès qu'il aura fini ?
- En fait, on est tous testé.
C'est une question de responsabilité légale.
Va juste te faire tester dans la salle de repos.
Ok, sans problème.
Zut.
Est-ce que aujourd'hui c'était hier ?
Harrison !
C'était une question pertinente.
C'est quand même super bizarre.
Je te l'ai déjà dit :
tous les jours ne se répètent pas.
D'ailleurs, la plupart ne se répètent pas.
C'est trop dommage.
Car si ta petite histoire était vraie,
aujourd'hui serait le jour à refaire.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Tu sais le truc avec Meredith.
Elle ne te l'a pas dit ?
Le test anti-drogue à son boulot aujourd'hui.
Elle l'a raté. Elle a été virée.
Oh mon  dieu.
Tu me comprends :
si tu pouvais revenir en arrière aujourd'hui,
prévenir Meredith,
on n'aurait pas cette conversation.
Harrison, je ne choisis pas quand ça arrive.
- Alors qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ?
- Ce soir, rien.
On prendra de ses nouvelles demain.
Voir comment elle va.
Et si demain, c'était aujourd'hui une nouvelle fois ?
Bonne nuit, Harrison.
- Je peux te poser une question ?
- Bien sûr, Davis.
Est-ce que cette blouse me fait paraître corpulent ?
- Non, tu as l'air très bien.
- C'est juste que tu m'as mentionné
que cet endroit était un peu triste,
Je voulais changer pour faire plus mince,
voir s'ils en faisaient en d'autres couleurs peut-être.
Ouah, ils ont ramené tous les morts de la ville.
En fait, ils viennent tous du même endroit.
5 hommes morts, âgés tous d'environ 25 ans
L'heure de la mort se situe entre 22H30 et 23H.
Tu peux commencer à emballer leurs effets personnels.
On connaît leurs identités ?
Il manquait les portefeuilles.
Le rapport préliminaire indique un niveau élevé d'alcool.
- Pas assez pour les tuer ?
- Probablement non.
Mais il y a quelque chose d'étrange avec le 5ème gars.
Il n'y a pas d'alcool dans son système,
mais il y a la trace d'un produit chimique, l'avlocardyl.
- L'un d'eux était marié.
- C'est dommage.
Quoi d'autres peux-tu me dire ?
L'un devait parler le français.
Anniversaire de Lindsay.
Et tu n'as rien à me dire de particulier ?
Je suis nulle.
Bonjour.
Je cherche Gordez. Il est là ?
Il est en train de ramener un corps.
Je peux prendre un message ?
Oui, je suis un ami d'un ami.
Il m'a eu une interview pour un job,
et au cas où je n'aurais pas la place, je voulais le remercier pendant que j'étais en ville.
Un interview pour un boulot ?
C'est toujours marrant. C'est pour quoi ?
- Photographe.
- Post-mortem ?
- Médico-légale. Le service est à l'étage.
Ah oui, c'est vrai.
Comment ça c'est passé ?
Je ne sais pas.
J'avais rendez-vous avec le directeur pendant une demi-heure,
et en sortant, je me suis rendu compte
que j'avais quelque chose de coincé entre les dents.
- Sexy !
- Ouais, je ne suis pas sûr que le directeur soit du même avis.
J'ai besoin de ton nom pour le message.
-C'est Luc, avec un C.
-Moi c'est Tru, avec un U.
- Cet homme te dérange ?
- Oui Davis, STP, peux-tu le faire escorter hors du bâtiment ?
- Vraiment ?
- Non. Davis, voici Luc.
Oui, on s'est rencontré tout à l'heure.
Je m'étais perdu pour aller à mon interview.
- Merci pour les directions.
- Je pense que Gordez sera bientôt là.
- Si tu veux l'attendre jusqu'à...
(Aide moi)
Ca va ?
Oui.
Je vais bien.
Je dois juste.
(Aide moi)
- Ca ne te dérange d'attendre 5 secondes ici ?
- Non.
Je dois juste, désolé, je ...
Excuse moi, Davis.
Elle fait ça souvent.
Aide moi.
Sauve nous.
J'ai besoin de toi.
S'il te plaît.
Aide moi.
Qui aurait pensé à mettre
le double de ses clefs sous son paillasson ?
Très intelligent.
- Ok, alors je t'ai emmené ...
- un muffin au cassis, sandwich au thon sur pain complet.
un burito végétarien.
- Ok, comment tu savais ça ?
De la même manière que je sais que c'est ton anniversaire.
Oh mon dieu, tu t'en es souvenu.
Personne d'autres ne l'a fait.
- Oh merci.
- Voyons, comment j'aurais pu oublier.
Ecoute Harrison, je n'ai pas besoin que tu me crois,
j'ai juste besoin de ton aide.
C'est la première fois que ce n'est pas juste un corps, mais cinq.
Je n'ai pas vu leurs têtes, on n'a pas leurs identités.
Ca va être 5 fois plus dure pour les sauver.
Je dois être honnête, c'est un peu tôt
dans la journée pour avoir ce genre de conversation.
Je crois que l'un d'entre eux a été empoisonné,
mais je n'ai absolument aucune idée de ce qui a pu arriver aux 4 autres.
Et tu me dis ça, car ...
Car j'ai besoin d'infos.
Et tu connais bien mieux ce quartier là que moi.
Ecoute Starky, tu me demandes d'être Hutsch.
Je vais te dire : merci,
mais non merci.
Strip-teaseuse, Harrison ?
Ok, j'en suis.
Je voulais savoir si vous pouviez me dire
où trouver une fille, Turquoise ?
On ne donne pas ce genre d'information aux clients.
Je ne suis pas vraiment une cliente.
Oh, vous êtes là pour l'audition ?
J'ai une tête de strip-teaseuse ?
Un peu, ouais.
Tu m'as dit que les barmans savaient tout sur tout.
Il ne m'a rien dit.
T'as vraiment essayé ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire "vraiment" ?
Tu dois avoir un plan, Tru, quand tu veux des infos.
Au fait, cette Turquoise que tu cherchais,
son vrai nom est Tara.
La journée, elle travaille dans le télémarketing,
dans le bâtiment Uncle.
C'est pas possible !
Voyons, Tru.
Tu sais que j'ai la "touch" avec les femmes.
Mon amie, ici, m'a tout dit.
Harrison, merci, vraiment.
Je t'appelle tout à l'heure.
Oh, oui... je te suis dans 5 secondes.
Euh...Je vais juste rester là, à surveiller.
Elle est juste là.
Hey, je suis en train d'organiser une petite soirée, et...
et je me demandais si vous étiez déjà prise ce soir.
Excusez-moi ?
Vous ne travaillez pas au club ?
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici,
avec toutes ces questions ?
Je suis désolé, je ne savais pas...
Ca va,
c'est juste que personne ici ne sait pour mon autre travail.
Je comprends.
Et de toute façon, je suis déjà prise ce soir.
Pour toute la nuit.
Un enterrement de vie de garçon, au Perpot Hotel.
Un enterrement de vie de garçon.
Vous savez qui vous engage ?
Tout est supervisé par l'agence.
Ok.
Ecoutez, je dois retourner travailler.
Bonne chance pour ce que vous organisez.
Puive-je vous aider ?
Oui, je suis là pour l'enterrement de vie de garçon.
Oui, la chambre 1712. Elle est réservée pour 19H, mais
le divertissement n'arrive généralement que lorsqu'il fait nuit.
Pourquoi tout le monde pense que je ressemble à une strip-teaseuse ?
C'est un enterrement de vie de garçon.
Qui est-ce que vous pourriez être d'autre ?
Oui, c'est vrai.
Alors, aidez moi : à quoi je peux m'attendre ?
Y aura-t-il quelqu'un d'autre à cette soirée :
serveur, barman ?
Ces options n'ont pas été réservées.
Donc il n'y aura que les invités ce soir dans la pièce ?
Et vous.
Et moi.
Et une dernière chose, j'ai une question pour le marié,
mais je n'ai pas son numéro.
Nous ne donnons pas les coordonnées de nos invités.
Tant pis pour moi,
je ne saurai pas s'il me veut petite fleur ou diablesse ?
Il est hors de question que j'annule
mon enterrement de vie de garçon.
C'est ma dernière nuit de liberté.
- Non, vous ne comprenez pas.
- Si, je pense que si.
Robin vous envoyé.
Non, ce n'est pas...
Elle déteste l'idée de cette soirée
autant que les amis que j'y ai invité.
Robin ne s'entend pas avec vos amis ?
Ok, vous commencez à me faire peur.
Si Robin ne vous a pas envoyé, qui êtes vous ?
Je travaille à l'hôtel.
Et il y a un problème avec votre chambre d'hôtel.
Et ils m'en envoyé personnellement
pour vous expliquer la situation.
Quel est le problème la chambre ?
On la réservé deux fois.
Ca fait bien trop longtemps que tous ces gars ne se sont pas réunis.
Rien ne me fera pas annuler cette soirée,
c'est compris ?
Oui, mais...
Je vais juste appeler l'hôtel.
Non, pas besoin, on va s'arranger.
Et d'où vient cette soudaine passion pour ces médicaments peu utilisés ?
C'est du travail personnel,
j'étudie pour le test d'entrée en fac de médecine.
- Je ne pense que ce soit le genre de question du test.
- J'aime être bien préparée.
Ok, l'avlocardyl est sous forme de poudre
et est soluble dans l'eau, ça te va ?
Oui. Donc il peut être ingéré,
sans que la victime s'en rende compte ?
Dans un liquide, oui.
Y a-t-il un moyen pour savoir si quelqu’un a ingéré de l'avlocardyl ?
Pas immédiatement, mais 2, 3 heures après, oui.
Comment ?
Ils seront morts.
Je pense qu'il y a quelque chose dans les boissons.
C'est la seule chose qui paraisse logique.
Donc je dois remplacer l'alcool de la soirée
avant que les garçons n'arrivent,
et après je dois trouver qui l'a mis là.
Et tu as besoin de moi pour quoi faire ?
J'ai besoin que tu trouves une fille, Robin Wilson.
Pas de problème
Elle va peut-être  se marier dans une semaine.
Deux secondes : " se marier" ?
Là je suis très occupé, tu sais.
Tu t'es amusé toute la journée,
et on doit empêcher 5 gars de mourir avant 22H30 ce soir.
Et je dois trouver un moyen d'empêcher ça.
Je dois vraiment me répéter à chaque fois ?
Parce que là on commence à manquer de temps.
C'est bon, j'y vais
mais c'est parce que je t'aime vraiment, Tru.
- C'est l'heure de sauver quelqu'un d'autre.
- Qui ?
Meredith.
En quel l'honneur, j'ai le plaisir de ta visite ?
Une fille n'a pas le droit de rendre visite à sa soeur ?
Oui, sauf quand la soeur est en plein milieu d'une grosse affaire,
ce qui est le cas ici.
Meredith
Est-ce que tout va bien ?
Oui, je suis juste occupée
Je veux dire avec toi,
tout va bien avec toi ?
Je t'aime Tru, tu le sais.
Donc ne le prend pas personnellement
quand je te dis d'aller te faire ...
- Meredith !
- Tru, tu as 3 sujets de conversation :
1 : "as-tu des nouvelles d'Harrison ?"
2 : "maman me manque"
3 : "as-tu arrêté la drogue, Meredith ?"
Et vu ton air penaud, je penche pour le 3ème.
J'ai arrêté, Tru.
Ma dernière bêtise remonte au mois dernier.
C'est du passé !
Tu dois le comprendre.
C'est juste que... s'il y avait un test anti-drogue aujourd'hui ?
Ca pourrait arriver.
Tu le réussirais ?
C'est ridicule.
Je le réussirais, Tru.
C'est bon de l'entendre.
Désolé de douter de toi.
Oh, elle n'est pas avec toi ?
Je pensais que comme c'est l'anniversaire de Lindsay,
elle serait peut-être avec sa soeur.
Ok, tant pis, bye.
C'est la femme de ménage.
...je dois remplacer tout l'alcool...
Nous y voilà !
Oh, salut.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je suis la barman.
Sympa.
Cette salle est super.
On se retrouve,
je ne savais pas que tu étais barman.
C'est marrant, j'aurais juré
que je n'en avais pas demandé.
C'est exact, c'est un cadeau de l'hôtel
pour nous excuser du problème avec la chambre.
- Sympa.
Et sinon, que voulez-vous ?
Scotch, sans glaçon.
Gentlemen !
Un toast ... à la meilleure nuit de notre vie.
Désolé, je suis en retard.
Hey, c'est une règle : le garçon d'honneur
ne peut pas arriver en retard.
Je n'ai jamais dit que j'étais le meilleur,
juste meilleur que vous.
Ouais, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Un 6ème gars vient d'arriver.
Et alors ?
Juste 5 corps sont arrivés à la morgue.
L'un d'entre eux ne va pas mourir.
Ok, disons que tu n'es pas folle ?
C'est le 6ème gars qui l'a fait ?
Non, je n'ai vu aucun de leurs visages.
C'est à dire que n'importe lequel peut avoir fait le coup.
Celui qui n'a pas été emmené à la morgue,
c'est le tueur.
C'est quoi ça, gamine ?
Tu sais que un "7 et 7" c'est pour 7 rasades d'alcool, ok.
Bien sûr !
Vous croyez que c'est mon premier jour ?
Ca va ? on dirait que non.
Je suis juste stressé.
Alors ce qu'il te faut c'est juste un peu d'alcool.
Merci.
Tu ne penses pas que c'est mal par rapport à elle.
Je penses que c'est mal, si on en parle.
Relaxe toi, prend un verre.
Cravate.
Lunettes.
Frisé, garçon d'honneur.
Marié.
Oui,
je peux vous servir quelque chose ?
Non, ça va.
Vous ne voulez pas de ceux-là, croyez-moi.
L'hôtel avait laissé ces vieux trucs.
Vous devez apprendre à apprécier les bonnes choses,
comme le scotch.
Tu es un cadeau de l'hôtel ?
Il faut que je pense à dire merci au directeur.
- C'est normal.
Je vais même y aller de ce pas.
En fait,à cette heure,  il est probablement chez lui,
avec sa femme et ses enfants.
Mais si je fais mon travail correctement,
je ferai en sorte qu'il le sache
demain matin à la première heure.
Hey, t'as emmené ça ?
Tu crois qu'il le sait ?
Salut, les gars.
Le divertissement est arrivé.
Je vais passer une tenue plus confortable,
pourquoi n'en faites vous pas de même ?
Tout va bien ?
Je peux vous servir un cocktail ?
Plutôt un club soda,
et faites le ressembler à un vodka et soda.
Ok.
Vous conduisez ou ...
Non, je suis juste sobre.
Ca fait 18 mois.
Félicitations.
J'avais l'habitude de boire des alcools forts avant.
Merci.
Mais je ne veux pas casser l'ambiance.
Je ne veux pas que ça se sache.
...pas de trace d'alcool...
Ne vous en faites pas,
ça sera notre petit secret.
Merci.
Santé.
Quelle combinaison accélère l'effet de l'avlocardy ?
Je vais bien, merci.
Tu sais que si tu enlèves toutes les bactéries de l'intestin,
tu en as assez pour remplir une tasse à café ?
Salut Davis,
et maintenant ma question.
Combinaison ?
Pas que je sache.
Je ne pense pas que...
tu es à une fête ?
Davis ?
Je suppose que ce n'est pas le bureau du directeur ?
Deux secondes.
C'est par l'escalier en haut.
C'est Luc ?
Souhaite lui bonne chance pour son entretien.
Bonne chance pour votre entretien.
Merci.
Et dis lui de vérifier ses dents.
C'est un ami à toi ?
Ca pourrait.
Dis lui c'est tout.
Hey, excusez moi
Heu... vous voudrez peut-être vérifier vos dents ?
Merci.
Alors, à propos de l'alcool ?
Comment est-ce que ça réagit avec l'avlocardy ?
En fait, l'alcool masque les traces de ce médicament dans le corps.
Donc, disons que si j'ai pris de l'avlocardy,
et que je bois après 3 ou 4 verres martinis
Et ça te concerne parce que...
C'est juste une question.
avlocardy  + liqueur = un cadavre
sans cause de mort apparente
Ils ont tous été empoisonnés.
L'alcool a couvert les traces.
Merci beaucoup pour ton assistance.
On dirait que quelqu'un est marié.
Elle t'a bien cassé, mec.
...c'est à dire que n'importe lequel peut avoir fait le coup...
On dirait que ça ne va pas.
Si je ne savais pas que vous ne buvez pas, je vous dirais d'arrêter.
J'avais besoin de prendre l'air.
Il fait chaud dans cette pièce.
Vous ne vous êtes pas vu depuis la fac, c'est ça ?
Ca ne devrait pas être un évènement joyeux ?
Ouais.
On disait que c'étaient les meilleures années de notre vie.
Ca n'a pas vraiment été  le cas.
Ca va ?
C'est juste que j'aimerai bien revenir en arrière
et changer quelques trucs, tu sais.
Ca serait super
Vous avez déjà ressenti ça ?
Tout le temps.
Peut-être que parmi ces gars,
certains n'arrivent pas à gérer ce qui est arrivé, mais...
Quoi ?
Quelque chose est arrivé à la fac ?
On ne connaissait même pas son nom.
Qui ?
La fille de la vidéo ?
Salut gars.
Hey Blake.
Où tu étais ?
Je t'ai acheté une lap-dance.
Elle t'attend,
donc rentre donc.
Je pense que votre pause est finie.
Bonjour, entre.
Je sais que l'on travaille tous
très tard en ce moment, Meredith, mais,
la direction insiste pour faire des tests anti-drogue
au hasard parmi les employés.
Incroyable.
En tout cas, ça ne doit pas prendre plus de quelques minutes,
Va juste te faire tester dans la salle de repos.
Oui, pas de problème.
Non, ça va.
Son nom n'est pas Lindy.
Ne vous en faites pas.
Vous avez deux heures jusqu'à ce que les invités arrivent.
Salut.
On va se faire une partie de cartes.
Vous avez vu Blake ?
Non.
Hey, qu'est-ce que tu...
Tu peux ma dire ce que c'est ?
J'essayais juste de me souvenir de vos commandes.
- J'oubliais...
- Je viens de vérifier avec l'hôtel,
Ils ne nous ont pas envoyé de barman.
Surtout, ils ne connaissent pas.
- Ok, tu m'as eu.
- J'appelle la sécurité,
et je vais te faire foutre dehors.
Hey tu n'as pas le droit !
Enlève tes mains !
Hey, relaxe, c'est une fête.
- Tu crois que c'est marrant ? T'es malade ?
- Tout va bien.
Il ne voulait pas t'offenser.
Oui, t'en fais toute une montagne.
Vous savez quoi,
je vais aller me calmer deux minutes.
Tara...
attends qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Tu poses trop de questions.
Sors.
- Ecoute, fais pas ça.
- Comment tu le savais ?
...il manquait les portefeuilles...
- Tu ne fais que les voler ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu croyais ?
Ecoute, je ne l'ai jamais fais avant.
Je le jure.
Tu vas appeler les flics ?
Non.
- C'est quoi ?
- Tequila.
- Je n'ai pas emmené de tequila.
- Je l'ai trouvé derrière le bar.
Je bois ça depuis que je suis arrivé.
Deux secondes, si ce n'est pas dans l'alcool,
alors c'est dans quoi ?
Oh mon dieu.
...je pense qu'il y a quelque chose dans les boissons...
...l'avlocardyl est soluble dans l'eau...
La glace.
C'est dans la glace.
- Davis, c'est moi.
- Pour ton information, je ne suis pas le 911.
Juste une seule question, promis.
Y a-t-il un moyen de sauver quelqu'un
qui a ingéré de l'avlocardyl ?
C'est une drôle de soirée, on dirait.
Laisse moi vérifier.
Oui, on dirait que le glucagon est le seul antidote.
- Est-ce que par hasard, il y en aurait à la morgue ?
- Le glucagon est un médicament
pour le diabète en cas d'urgences.
Donc on en a peut-être dans le cabinet à médicaments.
Je t'avais dit de partir.
Allo ?
Attendez, vous ne pouvez pas.
Vous ne comprenez pas ce qui va arriver.
Je vais essayer d'imaginer :
tu vas être escorter hors de l'hôtel.
Vous êtes en train de faire une erreur.
Kit d'urgence de glucagon.
Je suis impressionné.
Tu m'as fait peur.
Il m'a fallu 4 mois avant de piquer des trucs du bureau.
Davis, je suis désolé, je ...
Tru, arrête.
Je ai écouté tes balivernes toute la journée.
C'est évident qu'il se passe quelque chose dans ta vie.
Je ne sais pas ce que c'est,
tu as peut-être des problèmes.
J'espère qu'un jour, tu te rendras compte
que tu peux être honnête avec moi.
- J'ai pas été assez clair ?
- Peut-être que je n'écoutais pas !
Je sais que quelque chose est arrivé à la fac.
Je sais que vous avez couvert cet incident.
Personne ne sait rien,
à part les 5 gars dans cette pièce.
Qu'est-ce qui est arrivé à la fille ?
C'était qui ?
- Vous ne pouvez pas vous cacher du passé.
- Tu ne crois pas que j'en suis bien conscient !
C'est Dean ? Qu'est-ce qu'il t'a dit ?
Non, il ne m'a rien dit. Il a juste...
De la glace.
Je croyais que c'était toi.
- Mais ce n'est pas toi qui a organisé ça.
- Non, qu'est-ce que ça a à voir avec tout ça ?
Je ne sais pas ce que tu manigances,
mais j'ai finalement trouvé Robin Wilson
sauf qu'elle n'est la fiancée de personne.
C'est qui ?
- Quoi ?
- Raccroche maintenant.
Il l'a trompé,
elle a annulé le mariage.
C'était il y a 3 mois.
- Tu as 10 secondes pour t'expliquer.
- Ce n'est pas un enterrement de vie de garçon, Blake.
- Le mariage a été annulé il y a des mois.
- C'est dingue pourquoi
John nous voudrait tous là ?
Parce que vous partagez un secret gênant.
Quoi qu'il ait pu arrivé à la fac, avec cette fille,
c'était John ? C'est John qui l'a fait.
Laissez moi vous aider.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait encore là ?
Je croyais que tu t'en étais débarrassé ?
Elle a une histoire très intéressante.
Je pense que ça vous intéresserait tous de l'entendre.
Pas que je veux jouer les emmerdeurs,
mais on l'avait foutu dehors.
Maintenant tu veux qu'on l'écoute ?
Je penses qu'on a tous été silencieux bien trop longtemps.
Ce n'est pas un enterrement de vie de garçon.
Plus maintenant.
Tu as fait peur à la strip-teaseuse.
On n'a plus d'alcool.
John et sa fiancée ont rompu,
il y a des mois de ça.
Aucun de vous ne le savait ?
C’est vrai, John ?
Ecoutez, je peux tout expliquer.
Voyons les gars.
La meilleure nuit de notre vie, vous vous souvenez.
Merci les gars.
- Non, ne...
- Si. Laisse moi une minute.
- Vous allez quelque part ?
- Il n'y a aucune raison pour que je reste.
Vous m'avez embarrassé devant mes amis.
Ca ne doit pas être de si bons amis que ça, Jonathan.
Ils croyaient encore que tu allais te marier.
C'est pas vraiment facile à avouer
que ta relation a échoué, tu sais.
J'allais leur dire ce soir.
- Je pensais que tout le monde avait bien besoin d'une bonne fête.
- Comment prends-tu ta boisson ?
Avec des glaçons, non ?
C'est vraiment beaucoup d'effort pour couvrir un meurtre.
- Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles.
- Laisse moi te dire 2, 3 trucs.
1 :Un de tes amis n'a pas bu une goutte d'alcool, ce soir.
Donc oui, il a de l'avlocardyl dans le sang,
mais sans l'alcool pour le cacher,
quelqu'un va comprendre ce que tu as fait.
2 : j'ai un truc de barman
même si tu bois sans glaçon, comme toi,
si tu veux garder la boisson fraîche,
tu mets de la glace pillée
au fond du verre.
Oui, de chaque verre, John.
Enfin, bien sûr si tu n'as rien fait aux glaçons,
tu n'auras pas besoin de l'antidote
que ton garçon d'honneur a dans la pièce à côté.
5 ans en retard
Pourquoi maintenant, après tout ce temps ?
Il y a 3 semaines, je lui ai envoyé une lettre
disant que j'allais aller à la police.
- Toi ?
- Je ne le supportais plus.
J'ai essayé de réparer mon erreur
et en fait j'ai failli tous nous faire tuer.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
La fille de la vidéo.
On ne connaissait même pas son nom
jusqu'à ce qu'on le lise dans le journal.
Elle était en 1ère année.
Elle a fait l'erreur de venir à une fête de fin d'études.
John l'a isolé toute seule dans une pièce.
Arrête !
Je t'ai dis non !
- Qu'est-ce qu'il t'arrive?
- Lâche moi.
Sa petite amie dit qu'il l'a giflé.
Il a nié. On l'a cru.
Mais quand il nous dit cette nuit-là
que c'était un accident, on ne l'a pas cru.
On n'a rien dit,
à personne.
Et tu as envoyé la lettre.
- C'est quelque chose de bien.
- Mais je n'ai pas eu le courage de la signer.
Il ne savait pas lequel d'entre nous
allait le dénoncer.
Donc il devait tous vous tuer.
Je suis désolé de ne pas t'avoir fait confiance.
Mais après tout ce qui s'est passé, je me fais à peine confiance.
Tu as fais la bonne chose.
Avec 5 ans de retard.
Surprise !
Surprise !
- Tu as besoin de quelque chose ?
- Comment tu savais ?
Tru, tu enlèves le côté marrant de tout.
C'est marrant pour moi.
Je pense que tu ne seras pas surprise d'apprendre
qu'il y a eu un test anti-drogue aujourd'hui à mon boulot.
C'est évident que tu savais quelque chose,
et tu as décidé de ne pas me le dire.
Donc j'appelle dans le but de ne pas dire "merci".
Si tu es curieuse de le savoir,
j'ai réussis le test.
Maintenant tu vas peut-être me lâcher et
laisser mon passé tranquille.
- Meredith, je n'essayais pas de démonter quelque chose.
J'essayais de t'aider.
Et c'est le cas, n'est-ce pas.
Bonne nuit, Tru.
- Vous vouliez me voir ?
- Ferme la porte.
- Merci de m'avoir couverte.
- Pas de problème.
Ce n'est pas la première fois que je suis payé
pour fournir un  échantillon.
Mais je dois demander
comment saviez-vous qu'il y aurait
un test anti-drogue aujourd'hui ?
J'ai eu un pressentiment.
Je ne comprends pas.
J'ai fait tout ça pour sauver 5 gars
et maintenant ils finiront peut-être en prison.
Quel est l'intérêt ?
Tu sais, Tru, ton truc c'est peut-être
plus que sauver des gens.
Ces gars avaient un secret et tu l'as découvert.
Peut-être que c'était le but.
Lindsay a une théorie que seulement 1  mec sur 7 vaut le détour.
J'ai passé toute ma soirée avec 6 gars,
et aucun n'était correct.
Serais-tu le n°7 ?
Je ne parierais pas dessus.
Ne t'en fais pas, Tru.
Il est là quelque part.
- Tu le connais ?
- Non, pas encore.
