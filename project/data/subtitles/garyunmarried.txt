- Please, let me see it, please.
- You've already seen it.
Yeah, but never in the light.
I'll show it a great pile of respect,
I promise.
But I was eighteen
when I got it, alright.
Okay.
Awesome!
Pink skull.
That's edgy and feminine.
Oh, shut up,
it's slutty and you know it.
You are not a slut.
Really? I just spent the night
with the man I hired to paint my condo.
That would make you more of a whore.
- Goodbye.
- No, no. Stay! Stay!
Come on. Come on. I'm kidding.
Alright?
Listen, I have this enormous lake house,
that I'm painting for a guy
while he is out of town, but,
how would you like to spend the rest
of the week-end with me there, okay?
I only spend one night with you and
you wanna take me away for the week-end?
I must have been pretty amazing.
Until I check the video tape
from last night, I won't know for sure.
- What was that?
- My front door.
- Is somebody here?
- I hope not.
- Hi, Dad
- I'm here.
Dad?
Okay, a few things that I probably
should have told you, aside from owning
my own painting business
and all this boying charm,
I have two kids,
- Gary? Hello?
- and an ex-wife,
We're two and a half minute
into my time.
who might be a nazi.
Why didn't you tell me?
I was gonna tell you, the very next
time we weren't having sex, okay.
Come on. It's not like I lied to you,
I don't lie, I'm not a liar.
I'm on the phone.
Vanessa, I'm really sorry. I've only
been divorced for three months,
and I haven't seen anyone since
the split and I was gonna tell you, but
you were too good to be true,
and I didn't want to scare you away.
Like the tiny little detail
about you having a family?
You didn't tell me
you were double-jointed,
at one point,
I thought I had broken you.
Yeah, well, I'm not double-jointed,
I just don't like to complain.
Hi, son. Hi, sweetie.
Where's mummy?
- She's in the kitchen.
- Great thanks.
Dad! I've got another picture of Al Gore
to put on the wall next to my bed.
That's... creepy, Louise.
Allison, what are you doing here?
It's not my week-end.
All you have in your refrigerator is
2 beers and a bottle of ranch dressing.
I know. I'm running low on beer.
Why are the kids here?
You get them every tuesday
and thursday,
every other week-end and two weeks
in the month of july, okay?
We alternate bithdays
and major holidays.
I know this is a lot of words in a row,
but please Gary, try to follow.
I'm following but you kept them last
week-end, which was suppose to be mine,
that doesn't mean
we automatically switch.
We were doing
a twelve hours juice cleanse,
- and I knew you would not honor it.
- Probably not,
when my kids are starving,
I tend to feed them.
I'm sorry if that makes me
the fun parent.
Hey kids, throw away your books,
get rid of your toothbrushes,
you're with daddy, now.
Dad says my Al Gore picture is creepy.
Honey, it's not that it's creepy,
it's just every inch of the wall
in your bedroom is covered with pictures
of either Al Gore or Mahatma Gandhi.
You know? Thank God, you have that one
picture of that guy from Entourage.
That's Che Guevera, Dad.
I don't know what the actor name is,
Louise, and I'm just glad that you...
have a crush on somebody
closer to your own age.
Your father isn't criticizing you,
he knows both you and Tom
are gonning to have lots of healthy,
wonderfull relationship.
- We know, mum.
- We know, mum.
Why do you say stuff like that to them?
Because, Children of divorce
are more likely to struggle
in their own relationship.
There is an entire chapter on it
in "Rules for a perfect divorce".
The book that Dr. Krandall
gave both of us to read.
God! You haven't even
opened yours, have you?
I don't have to read it, I have
the audio version sitting on my couch.
Gary, we both agreed
to follow Dr Krandall rules,
because it was the best for the kids.
- They are doing great.
- Really?
Have you noticed that Tommy
is scared to death of girls?
He should be affraid of girls,
they pretend to like you,
and then they take all your stuff.
Look, Tommy will like girls
when he's ready to like girls.
Dr Krandall and I have encouraged him
to make female friends in Second Life.
Oh no, that dorky computer game?
It's an online society, Gary, okay?
It's a safe place for him
to meet other teens.
Yeah, maybe a congress man.
Bye kids, have fun with your dad.
I never did.
Alright, you are a liar, that's a lie.
I know, but it felt good saying it.
Which one takes Ginkgo before bed?
I would really appreciate it if you
didn't quizz me about my own kids
It's Tommy. Louise.
I know it's Tommy.
It's Louise. Tommy!
One capsule, right before bed,
with plenty of water.
- That's Louise.
- I knew it was Louise.

Transcript : charliea
Synchro : charliea / Sixe
Hey, pal.
Hey, look at that, Second Life.
That's pretty cool.
You know, we didn't have anything
like that when I was a kid.
We had... outside.
Your mum's telling me you can meet
girls in there.
It's called "In World".
Yeah you can meet tons of girl, tons.
- You ever meet one?
- No.
There is one girl that I really like
at school, her name is Danielle,
but we are never "In World"
at the same time so...
Tommy. Listen to me, okay.
Hear me out.
If there's ever a girl that you meet
in this world,
maybe you can bring her
over to the house,
she can come to your room,
you guys can study, talk.
- A girl in my room?
- Yeah.
- I can't invite a girl over here.
- Why not?
What if she expects me to, you know,
tap it?
What would you be tapping?
- I don't know.
- Okay, that's great.
Look, you're fourteen years old.
You're not gonna have to worry
about girls for a while.
- Thank God.
- Okay.
Look, I have to go see about a job,
do me a favor,
keep an eye on your sister for me?
If I try to give you Ginkgo tonight,
don't take it.
- Hey, Dennis.
- Hey.
Has the owner been by today?
What's her name... Vanessa?
I saw her car a while ago.
Really? When?
This morning, in front of your house.
Alright, yeah. We hooked up last night,
it was amazing but
I think I might have scared her off
and she never wants to see me again.
- Jackpot!
- No.
That's not a jackpot,
I mean I really like this girl,
I wanted to see where this thing
was gonna go.
No, no, no. Don't do this,
you just got divorced.
You're a free agent.
You don't sign with the first team
that shows you their facilities.
I'm not looking for a long term
relationship with Vanessa,
I just wanna spend some time with
someone cool, sexy and has a tatoo.
You just described Paco, and he's not
looking for anything serious either.
Really?
Hey, Dennis. Is this okay...
Is it okay, if I took the fabric
to the color of the wall?
Yeah, help yourself,
just be carefull what you touch.
You could have tell me that yesterday.
Look, Vanessa, I'm really sorry
about last night.
Vanessa, please talk to me.
Look, I'm a big girl.
We had a good time last night,
I know you're not ready
for this and that's fine.
But I'm ready for this. I really am.
It's just that my ex-wife and I,
we decided
to do this divorce by a couple of rules
for the kids' sake,
like how long to wait before we start
seeing other people, and last night,
I'm pretty sure I broke
a lot of those rules,
as well as a few of
my own personal records.
Two was a personal record?
Yeah.
Look, Vanessa,
I really like you. I do.
If you give me another chance, I'd love
to see how this thing turns out.
Really?
What about the agreement
that you have with your ex-wife?
I'm gonna take care of that right now,
I'm gonna go talk to my ex-wife Allison,
and I'm gonna tell her no more rules.
Okay? Can I see you later?
I don't know, this seems like
a really bad idea.
I'll take that as a maybe.
It's open.
Sorry, I'm still getting used to having
to knock on my own door.
It's my door now,
and of course you don't have to knock,
you can ring the bell.
Look, I came over here to talk to you
about something that's really important.
And I don't want it to end in a fight.
- It's about dating.
- I'm not interested.
Delightfull.
No, I meant other people,
dating other people.
Preferably people
who don't turn the lights on during sex
and ask me
what I'm trying to accomplish.
I did that one time, Gary.
And you seemed to be lost, okay?
What is it you
don't want to fight about?
I know we've agreed
to these rules, okay?
And one part of the rules is when
it's okay to start seeing other people,
and I think that time is gonna
come up soon for either one of us,
and I think it's important that when one
of us does see someonelse,
that the other one
doesn't make a big deal out of it.
Okay, I promise when you start
seeing someone,
I'll not make a big deal about it.
Oh my Gosh! That's great. And then,
when you wanna see somebody,
I won't make a big deal out
of it either, okay?
Good, cause I'm getting married.
What?
I'm engaged, and thank you.
I have been a rack
trying to figure out
how to break it to you, and now,
I can finally tell the kids,
and wear this.
Oh my Gosh.
Who are you getting married to?
Well, someone that I've been seeing,
since we split.
Actually, you've been seeing him too...
... every Tuesday at 8am.
Dr. Krandall? You are marrying
our marriage counselor?
I know, it's just so crazy, right?
The guy that's always covered
in cat hair and crumbs?
And he wears a turtleneck sweater
even though he doesn't have a neck?
Gary, he's sensitive and brilliant,
and he makes me feel young.
Of course he does, he's eighty.
He's in his fifties.
I don't know what to say.
Well, you know what?
A lot of people go with congratulations.
Okay. You know what then?
Congratulations.
Congratulations on marrying
the person who we both went to
to try to hold our marriage together.
Oh my Gosh!
Isn't there a rule against that?
Isn't there a law against that?
Come on, Gary! Grow up!
The heart doesn't know how to follow
a bunch of stupid rules.
This is good for both of us,
maybe this will force you to move on to.
Maybe I already have.
Please.
Don't pretend to be seeing someone
just to compete with me.
That is sad.
I'm not competing with you Allison, you
are engaged, to be married, you've won.
Okay? And your prize, is a guy who rides
a bicycle with a windshield.
Hey, louise. Sweetie, will you help me
get rid of these groceries?
- Put 'em away for me.
- Sure, dad.
Hey, where's your brother?
Oh, he's in his room studying...
with a girl.
With a girl? Like a real, live--
human being person girl?
Way to go, Tommy.
Is she cute?
That's degrading.
I don't judge people by appearances.
That's why I love you, Louise.
But let's be honest.
You wouldn't have
all those pictures of Gandhi
on your bedroom wall
If he wasn't so hot.
Hey, son.
I didn't know you had company over.
It was your idea, remember?
Way to play along, Capt. Smooth.
Hi, I'm Tommy's dad.
Nice to meet you. I'm Danielle.
Hi, Danielle.
I ordered a pizza.
So if you guys
get hungry later, just...
yell.
Tommy, do you have a question?
Didn't you need me to help you with that
thing out in the hall?
Yes, I did. Excuse me.
Tommy, I need his help with the thing.
Out in the hall. It's very heavy.
We'll be right back.
Glad you brought that up.
I forgot about it.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
There is a girl in my room!
What am I supposed to do with her?!
I don't know. Talk to her.
Tell her you like her hair.
I'm not gonna lie to her, dad.
Can't you just tell her I was
called away on some emergency?
Yes. Yes, I can do that.
That's a great idea.
I'll tell her that the F.B.I.
came to the door.
And they asked for you.
And they called you away
on a top secret mission
Called operation: Wuss Bag.
Now get back in there.
And talk to your friend!
- All right.
- Look. All right. Look.
Seriously though,
she likes you,
Otherwise she wouldn't be here. Ok?
You're a good looking guy.
You better get used to this.
She smells really good.
They all do.
That's how they get ya.
Louise, would you bring daddy a beer?
Mom says it makes me an enabler.
Well, in that case
bring daddy a shot of tequila, too.
That'll make you a bartender.
Hello, gary.
Hello, dr. Krandall.
I understand allison brought you up
to speed on our little indiscretion.
I'm not sure what makes me more mad--
The fact that you're sleeping
with my ex-wife
Or you made me keep
a dream journal.
I validate your rage, Gary.
And that's why I'm here.
To give you a chance
to exact your pound of flesh.
All I ask is that you not strike me
above the neck.
I have a book jacket
photo session in the morning.
- I'm not gonna hit you.
- I think you'll find it therapeutic.
I'm interested, too,
from a research standpoint.
I've never been beaten up before.
Yeah.
I find that hard to believe.
- Walter, stop right now.
- Allison, what are you doing here?
How come you don't have to knock
before you walk into my house?
Don't be petty, all right?
Walter left a crazy note
Saying he was coming
over here to take his lumps.
I don't want the two of you
fighting over me.
No. No.
The testosterone is raging.
Come on, now.
Give me your worst.
I already gave you my worst.
And you put a ring on its finger.
Hey, there's the pizza guy.
Maybe he'll hit you below the head.
Hi.
Hi.
I really appreciate
you coming over earlier.
It was really sweet.
There's something I need to tell you.
There's already a man in my life.
This is my son, Parker.
And he really needs
to use your bathroom.
- Hey, Parker, how are ya buddy?
- Hi.
The bathroom's upstairs, Ok.
I can't believe
he doesn't have a bathroom downstairs.
Come on in. Come on in.
Everybody,
this is my friend Vanessa.
That's my ex-wife Allison.
That's our former marriage counselor
and her new fiance Dr. Walter Krandall.
Charmed.
He says things like "charmed."
he's old.
I'm old.
He's afraid of birds.
Hey, you know what?
That was in a dream journal fella.
Gary, I'm sorry I doubted you
when you said you were seeing someone.
Vanessa and I just met.
We're still learning so many
wonderful things about each other.
- Oh, my gosh. Why didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you tell me?
If I may, there are obviously issues
the two of you need to discuss.
Yeah, you should go.
As it is my field,
I was going to offer to mediate
between you and
this delightful friend of yours.
No. No way, Krandall.
This one I like.
Fine, Gary.
I'll let you handle this on your own.
As long as you understand
how difficult it is
for a single mother
under these conditions,
Which is one of the most demanding
and challenging roles that there is.
Thank you.
I love him.
Isn't he great?
He bakes his own bread.
Yeah, I buy my bread at the store.
I support America.
Ok. I guess I'll go first.
Gary didn't tell me
that he had kids or an ex-wife.
Really?
You want me--
All right, well Vanessa didn't tell me
that she had a son.
And I felt humiliated and deceived.
I also felt humiliated
and deceived,
but for me
it's kind of a turn on.
And why didn't you tell Gary
you had a son?
Well, I've been a single mom
for a long time now.
and I'm very careful
about who I introduce Parker to.
And earlier, Gary come over and said
he wanted to see where this would go.
Which I do.
And the more I thought about it,
I think that i'm actually
ready for a serious,
long-term relationship.
I'm sorry. What?
I didn't think that you'd be ready
to commit to somebody this quickly.
Me? Then you don't know
anything about me.
Commit. Please!
You guys don't know
anything about Gary.
Because I love long-term,
long, long relationships.
I mean, gee whiz, my last long-term
relationship commitment just ended.
You know, so the timing is perfect.
I better call the pizza guy
to see if he got lost or something.
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing. No. I'm ok.
God, I haven't seen you
this freaked out
since that swan
chased you at Disneyland.
Leave me alone, I'm fine.
And why wasn't that swan
chasing anyone else?!
Gary, I know what you're
going through right now.
She wants more of a relationship
Than you think you're ready to handle.
I went through the same thing
with Walter.
Do you know how I felt the first time
he put his arms around me?
Where you helping him in
or out of the tub?
I would actually like
to see you be happy?
And Vanessa out there
could be a good first step.
For whatever reason,
she seems to like you.
There may not-- there may
not be many more out there like that.
- Are you saying I'm not a catch?
- Let her decide.
Just don't give her a reason
to throw you back.
You're right, Allison.
Thank you.
But to be clear, no.
You're not a catch.
- Pizza's here.
- Thanks, honey. Go tell your brother.
I can't.
He's in his room with a girl.
- Tom has a girl in his room?
- With the door locked.
Tom, it's mommy,
what are you doing in there?
Nothing now that
you just said mommy.
Tom, honey,
why is the door locked?
It wasn't.
It was just jammed.
Remember, dad said
he was going to fix it?
Yeah. Sorry.
I'll get right on that.
Louise said you had a friend over.
Yeah, Danielle went home.
But she got online. We're both
"In World" together at a beach party.
Oh, cool. Well, sorry to bother ya.
Have fun at your beach party.
Wear lots of sunscreen.
L.O.L.
You were right. He's not ready
to have a girl over to the house yet.
I know, Gary.
You try. You mean well.
But I have better instincts
when it comes to our kids.
I know.
Hey, handsome, the pizza's here
if you get hungry. Ok?
- Ok.
- All right.
Uh, Danielle, sweetie,
You left your purse out in the open
where we could all see it.
I told her I liked her hair.
Eh, no. Let's uh--
Let's keep this open, ok?
I want to talk to you.
My name's gary.
I have an annoying ex-wife
and 2 wonderful kids.
Hi, gary. I'm Vanessa.
I'm a single mom, and I have 2 tattoos.
You want to see
where this thing goes?
Sure.
Wait a minute. 2 tattoos?
Where's the other one?
Finish painting my condo,
and I'll show ya.
Good morning.
Didn't I paint your condo
a couple weeks ago?
No, a bunch of workers painted my condo
while you hit on me.
You know what? Those workers
are living the american dream.
You show up on time, you work hard,
and just maybe your boss will get laid.
OK. Let's go take a shower.
You know what?
You go take a shower.
I'm going to lay here
and try to put a name
on some of those positions
I invented last night.
Honey, half those positions aren't new,
and the last one,
I think you stumbled into.
I might have stumbled into it,
but I'm pretty sure I stuck the landing.
You were great.
Last night was unbelievable.
There's plenty more
where that came from...
If I can ever walk again.
My back.
What's up?
- You got any shampoo?
- Yeah, just
grab one of the empty bottles, put
some water in it, and just shake it up.
Please let that be a
door-to-door chiropractor.
- Who is that?
- That's my ex-wife.
If we're quiet,
she'll probably just go away.
Gary, believe me, you need to
have a civil relationship with your ex.
So just go downstairs,
be pleasant, and see what she wants.
I know what she wants.
She already has my left one.
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, Cutie.
I love you. What's going on?
Why aren't the kids at school?
We had to stop by here to pick up
everything you forgot
- to drop off with them last night.
- What are you talking about?
I put everything they had into their
backpacks. What did I forget?
Their backpacks.
And I got a speeding ticket
on the way over here, too.
You got a speeding ticket?
What's the matter?
Your two lady friends couldn't
help get you out of it?
No, Gary.
I'm not going to sink to that level.
Why not?
They have.
You know what, Gary?
If we were at Mardi gras,
you would get way more beads,
my friend. OK?
- That's right.
- It's not in my room, mom.
We still can't find Louise's cello.
How do you lose a cello, Gary?
I don't know.
I've looked everywhere for that thing.
Get in the car.
I'll be right out. All right?
- Bye, dad.
- Do you have any tests today?
Je vais fais une exam du francias.
That's fantastic.
Too bad we're never going to Germany.
- Why are you walking like your father?
- What? I hurt my back.
My gosh! You're the only one alive
that knows how to fix it.
- What?
- Come on. You can do it.
I'll get on the ground.
You fix it.
In order to fix your back,
I would have to get on
the floor and climb all over you.
It's crossing a line.
Come on. Help me.
Help me! Just do it!
All right, but no unnecessary wiggling.
How'd you hurt it this time?
What? With lifting something?
No, I wasn't lifting weights.
What, are you painting ceilings?
Allison, I did not hurt my back
doing anything you warned me about, OK?
I hurt my back having super-amazing
hot sex with my new girlfriend.
- And I'm done.
- What?
You never even touched me!
I don't want to hear about your sex
life, OK? Learn some boundaries, man.
Boundaries?
You're engaged to our marriage
therapist. Don't you think
that's crossing a boundary?
Dr. Walter krandall did everything could
to save our marriage, including me.
And I only said that because
I knew you were going to.
I bet if Dr. Walter krandall
hurt his back
and couldn't ride his dumb little bike
around town, you'd fix it.
I would fix walter's back
because he is my fiance...
And he's also a published author
and has appeared in "Time" magazine,
and he was on the "Today" show.
Yeah. What?
Willard scott was wishing
him happy birthday?
- Are these your keys?
- Yes, they are.
Come on, tom.
We're gonna be late.
See you, dad.
That's your phone that's been buzzing?
It's just danielle.
She called me 11 times this morning.
So I stopped answering it.
I didn't know danielle
was being so possessive.
A little bit.
You know, she insists on holding
my hand all the time, even during lunch.
I can't eat.
And I think my left hand is
getting smaller from all the squeezing.
Hold it out. Let me see that left hand.
Let me see, with that left hand,
if you can pick up daddy's keys.
There you go. You're a good guy.
Listen, I got to tell you something,
Tommy, this is a good thing, OK?
This girl likes you. Right?
Plus, you're getting hand.
I am the first of my friends to get it.
That a boy!
But if she wasn't so hot,
i'd think she was crazy.
Yeah. It's a good thing
the hot ones are never crazy.

Please. Just do this thing for my back.
Come on. You just...
you get my hand up over my head,
and you sit down on my hips,
and then you straddle me,
and you just kind of rock my hips around
like this until you hear something pop.
Yeah. I'm not going to
be doing that to you, man.
Help me up.
Give me a hand.
Give me a hand here.
All right. That's good.
Gosh. My hand.
My back.
I just put my hand on my back!
If I was in my old house, forget it.
Would have cracked my back,
I would sit in my hot tub,
and I would be as good as new.
This nonstop sex with
vanessa is killing me.
That's terrible.
Did I tell you my wife
just gained 60 pounds?
Look, here's the thing with Vanessa.
You saw her. She's beautiful.
And for some reason, she thinks I'm
incredible. I've got keep up with her.
She used to having sex with
these hairless, bendy,
flexible abercrombie & fitch guys,
you know, and... You know what it is?
It's like every time, I have
to prove myself over and over again.
I got to be honest with you, Dennis.
I've never felt so vulnerable.
Remember when we used
to talk about football?
Have you found the cello yet, Gary?
Louise has practice tonight.
<i>Who is this?</i>
Are you even looking for it?
No, I'm not looking for it. I'm on
my way to work. I'm on the freeway.
What do you want me to do?
Hey, Buddy!
I only need a little
bit of the road, OK?
This guy almost killed me. It's amazing.
Holy smokes. Honor student,
my ass. You know what?
Yeah? That's real classy
with your kid in the car.
I don't have any beer, Gary.
Not even in the downstairs, my god!
What are you doing?
You're never home at this time of day!
What? I skipped a class to come
home and, you know, study for a paper.
OK, you know what? I don't need
to tell you why I'm in my own house.
Were you in my hot tub?
No, I was in my hot tub that
I built with my hands on my patio.
That my lawyer was able to get from
your friend who went
to law school on the internet.
Look, Gary,
I mean, i'm sorry about your back. I am.
But really, seriously, coming over
here and. What are you doing?
- I'm changing out of my trunks.
- In my kitchen?
Yeah, because you always
used to get mad at me
if I would track water
through the house.
Gary, you just.
I can't believe you would
just undress in front of me. God.
All right. Big deal.
I don't see what the big deal is.
I mean, getting undressed
in front of you, it's like
it's like getting undressed
in front of a dude.
A dude?
I gonna say dog, but I knew
it would rub you the wrong way.
You know what, Gary?
You've got to get your suit back on
and go. And from now on, new boundaries,
OK? You are not allowed in my house
or anywhere outside of my house.
OK? And I am not going to go in your
house. And why are you still naked?
Because my back just locked up.
I can't bend down and pick up my shorts.
- For god's sakes!
- I need your help.
Help me pick up my shorts.
All right.
All right, give me your right foot.
OK.
- Your right foot. Jeez, what are you 3?
- I'm sorry.
I can't believe you, Gary.
You come into my house,
you dig through my fridge, you drop your
pants. You know what? Do it yourself!
- OK.
- God, it's just...
Right. I don't know why you're making
such big deal out of such a tiny thing.
That's because the tiny thing
is in my kitchen.
You are cranking the air conditioner,
I was just standing in frot
of a cold refrigerator.
You know what, Gary?
This is my house!
I know it's your house,
Allison, and I respect that.
I was only using the hot tub because
of my back, and that's the truth.
Burgers are ready.
My gosh.
This is heaven on my back.
I knew that was going to happen!
And yet...
i did it anyway.
- Dad?
- Over here, honey.
- Hi, dad.
- Hi. How are you? Sorry.
I didn't find your cello yet, OK?
Hey, where's your brother?
Right behind me.
Tommy, puberty hit you hard.
- Hello, Gary.
- Hello, Krandall.
Allison asked if I could pick
Tom and Louise up from school.
Great. Where's Tom?
Unfortunately, I only had
enough room on my bike for one.
He made me run behind him!
That's not the definition
of being picked up at all!
- What's going on here, Krandall?
- Every light in the house apparently.
I understand there was an
incident between you and Allison.
She prefers not to
speak to you for a while.
Really? She's punishing me by
not coming into my house?
I hope she doesn't get really mean
and stop cashing my alimony checks.
I don't know what's going
on between the two of you,
but if you'd like to talk about it,
i'll put on my therapist's hat.
OK. Does it come with
a chin strap like that one?
Deflective humor. That's very healthy.
But if you give me your version of it,
I will offer my keen insight.
Yeah. No offense, Krandall.
I don't think so. I mean, come on.
You're going to marry my ex-wife.
You can't be much smarter than I am.
I tried talking to her,
but she wouldn't share with me either.
Me, of all people.
I'm a professional.
Do you know that one of
my clients is sir ben kingsley?
You're not supposed to tell me that.
I know. I know. I got an earful about
that from parker posey.
Listen, Danielle,
OK, I have homework to do.
OK? I really need to go.
Can't we watch each other do homework?
Did you just minimize me?
No, no. There's something
wrong with the computer.
I bet any minute now, it's just, rrr!
I like that one.
This girl's really getting to you,
isn't she?
She's driving me crazy, dad.
She calls me all the time.
She stuffs notes in my locker.
You know, today she made me
hold hands with her during the assembly.
Both hands.
It was like we were figure skating.
All right. So, Tommy,
why are you putting up with all this?
Because I'm just an average guy, OK?
- And she's a totally banging girl.
- OK. Tommy, let me tell you something.
You show me a banging girl, and
I'll show you a guy that's tired of...
Holding her hands.
OK. So... so what should I do, dad? OK?
- I don't want to break up with her.
- You just have to be honest with her.
You have to take her for a walk and
tell her to ease up a bit. That's all.
<i>A walk?</i>
Really?
Women respond to honesty.
I mean, if this girl is wearing you out,
you can't just act like nothing's wrong.
My gosh.
- Are you all right, dad?
- Nothing's wrong...
It's Danielle.
My god. She's calling
from inside the house.
Listen,
be strong, OK?
- Thanks.
- All right. You got it.
Hey, Louise.
Hi, honey. What's up?
- My ride's here.
- Look.
You don't have to go to cello practice.
You have nothing to play.
I'm in band, dad.
If I had anything better to do,
don't you think i'd be doing it?
- Hey, I'm taking off dad. OK?
- Wait. Where are you going?
Danielle and I are going
to go on that...
- that walk.
- When are you gonna be back?
I don't know. I've got to go over to
her house. So I'll just. I'll see you.
There you are, slowpoke.
Yuck. This is awful,
all these bendy,
flexible,
hairless men.
Which one is abercrombie?
- Hi. Hi, Vanessa.
- Hey, handsome.
Who was that little blonde
girl pulling your son like a wagon?
That's his girlfriend.
She's crazy... about him.
Where's parker?
Don't you have him tonight?
I did, but his dad wanted to
take him to a game, so we switched.
- Thought you'd want to hang out.
- Yeah, sure. What...
- What did you have in mind?
- I don't know.
Drink some beers,
watch some football, just be mellow.
Really?
That's fantastic.
You have no idea how good that sounds,
because I've been meaning
to tell you that my back.
- Hello, boys.
- My back is very horny.
- Would you look at this?
- Hello, my dear. Hope you don't mind.
- I let myself in.
- Not at all. What am I smelling?
The <i>Chateau Briand</i>, and it's going
to burn unless I find a set of tongs.
Walter, you are so wonderful.
This is exactly what I need tonight.
Hope your day's getting a little
bit better. I spoke to gary earlier.
Please, don't say that name. I'm having
a nice moment. Let me enjoy this.
Absolutely. That's exactly my plan.
If you want to share anything with me,
as sir ben kingsley does
each wednesday...
No, Walter.
Walter, I love you.
I just don't want to talk.
I want to relax.
Then I have something
very special for you.
- Close your eyes.
- I like the sound of that.
Keep them closed.
Oh, my god!
Beautiful, isn't it?
Walter, where the
hell did you find that?
It was in the laundry
room under a pile of clothes.
Why didn't you tell me
you had a cello in the house?
This is awful.
Admittedly I haven't played
in a while, but
why am I defending myself?
What instrument do you play?
Are you OK, sweetie?
You kind of sound like you're in pain.
Pain? Me? No.
Non. Mal?
No, I'm doing, you know, like, primal...
Like grunting noises, you know.
I don't know if you know anything
about the Silver-Back Gorilla.
- I do, actually.
- Well, then never mind.
- Just sit down.
- OK. You know what?
Speaking of gorilla colors,
i'm going to go downstairs and make
an emergency paint order.
- An emergency paint order?
- Look, don't break my chops, honey.
You knew what you were getting into the
minute you started dating a painter, OK?
OK. All right.
Cello, Allison.
- Gary, what are you doing?
- What am I doing? What are you doing?
Just dropping off the Cello.
Yeah, it turns out it was...
It was in my laundry room the whole
time. Isn't that funny? All right, bye.
No, wait.
So you just bring it in my house,
sneak it in here and act like
it was here the whole time?
I thought you were out,
and you, you broke into my house today.
I had to use the hot tub
because you would fix my back.
Look, I don't care what it was, Gary. We
need to stick to the boundaries we set.
No, no, no. The boundaries
that you set that I don't understand,
because I don't really care who
comes in whose house. It doesn't
make sense to me. And I'm not even
sure why you're so mad. Oh, my god!
My back, Allison!
Please help me!
I can't even move!
You don't know why i'm so mad, Gary?
All right.
Where do I start?
I couldn't flirt my way out
of a speeding ticket
for the first time in my life!
And then when the cop looked
at my birth date,
he asked me if I might
know his mother... and I did.
And then my stupid ex-husband
whose back is sore from
having too much sex with his
young girlfriend
undressed in front of me
and said it wasn't any different from
undressing in front of a dude!
That's it?
That's what you're so fired up about.
The dude comment?
My gosh!
I feel better!
All right!
What do you care what I think about you?
I'm your ex-husband!
Exactly, Gary.
We were married.
You had 2 children with this dude.
I don't want you to want me.
Just acknowledge that
i'm still wantable. No?
I mean, my god. You don't know
what it's like. It's different for men.
Different? I don't know what it's like
to get old? I'm like the tin man!
You had to oil-can me down there,
for crying out loud!
Look, Allison,
don't whine about this.
I mean, you're almost 40,
sure, but you're still banging.
What is...
banging?
Look, I'm sorry about today.
I shouldn't have been in your hot tub.
I'm sorry I was in your house.
I'm sorry I said that it was
like being undressed in front of a dude.
I was just being an idiot. I'm sorry.
Banging like...
like how?
Banging, like, if we had met
in a bar and I didn't know you at all
and you were wearing the red
dress and you had your hair up...
Anything else?
If you weren't talking so much
or criticizing what I was wearing
or complaining about the service...
I would go up to you in that bar,
and I would ask you to dance,
and I would do everything in my
power to get you to go to bed with me.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
Thank you.
Assuming it was last call
and there was no one there younger.
Come on. I thought it
would make you feel better.
You know, it did. A little, and then it
didn't, and then it almost did again,
and then, you know
the whole thing was over.
Got to tell you,
a lot like having sex with you.
Hey, I'll have you know, I've
invented some new positions since then.
Goodye, Gary.
- All right.
- Look...
i'm sorry I assumed you lost the cello.
I was certain I lost it, OK?
I do look good in that red dress,
don't i?
Banging.
Hey, sorry about that.
That paint order took a lot
longer than I thought it was gonna.
- So you called her a dude.
- Yes, I did.
And what's the deal with your back?
Look, OK.
I have a confession to make.
My back is really messed up from years
of playing football and surfing AND
painting houses,
and apparently my back locks
up after nonstop acrobatic sex.
What made you think you
had to do that in the first place?
Because I didn't want you to think
I was one of these old guys
that, you know,
couldn't keep up with you.
Keep up with me?
I was trying to keep up with you.
You know, I know that all divorced
guys go through a crazy time,
but most of them at least
spread it around.
You are too much of a job for one woman.
If you ever want to write
that on a bathroom wall
or maybe send out a mass e-mail
to all my friends, that would be great.
Hey, pal,
- how did it go?
- Good. You know, really good.
I told her to lay off a little bit,
and you were right. Women like?
- it you say what's on your mind. Great.
- That's great.
Tommy, your lips...
They look glossy.
And you've got...
You've got glitter all over your face.
Really?
You were making out
with her this whole time!
Yeah!
I got lip!
That's fantastic, buddy!
You know, the more I told her to,
stop holding my hand,
the more she wanted to kiss me.
I'm really considering telling her to
stop kissing me and see where it goes.
All right. Why don't you
slow your roll there, partner?
Maybe just take a little time and enjoy
smelling the lip gloss for a while.
- All right. Good night, dad.
- I'll see you in the morning.
My back is killing me.

- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Breakfast!
What did I do to deserve this?
You know what you did.
Well, I would have done it a lot faster
if I knew there was gonna be bacon.
Seriously, there's
a faster version of that?
Get out of here.
All right. I'm gonna need a frying pan.
All right.
- And a frying pan handle.
- Right.
Seriously, don't lose these, OK?
It's also how we start the car.
I know I'm going out on a limb here,
but do you have a bowl?
But I have a colander.
How fast can you work?
Honey, you have nothing to cook
with or eat off of
in this house.
What do you do when the kids are here?
We put paper plates in frisbees,
like the rest of America.
You can buy stuff, you know.
I know, but after the split,
this was the first place I found,
and I didn't want to spend a
lot of money and buy great stuff
to replace all the great
stuff that I used to have.
So you went out and got everything
you needed at what?A hardware store?
A 99 cents store actually.
You know you laugh but I tricked out
the whole house for 36 bucks.
So that explains
the plastic shower curtain
that hugs my body like a horny ghost.
Actually, no.
That came with the house.
The guy that moved out
forgot to take it with him.
Sucker.
Look, it's no big deal.
I'll get some new stuff eventually.
OK, you don't have any plates in your
house, but you have a $300 cake mixer.
Is that what that is?
I had no idea. I just know Allison
really wanted it in the divorce,
so I fought for it.

There's your mom, guys.
Come on. Throw out your paper plates
and rinse off your frisbees
this time, OK?
- Is that a new purse, mom?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Is that leather?
- Yeah.
Is that necessary?
Louise, honey, honey,
the cow was already going to be food.
You know, to not use its
skin would just be wasteful.
Does it have a special pocket
for your rationalization?
What do you do with her when she's
here, give her sarcasm lessons?
Yeah, like, 40 times a day.
Look, Gary, I hate to bring this up, but
it's the beginning of the month,
and my spousal support is late again.
Has it been a month already?
You know, that's amazing
'cause when we were married,
the months went by so slowly.
And, Gary, I have to deposit these.
Could you please stop writing
"this is a hold-up" on the memo line?
- Come on. It got you on the news.
- Look...
Why do you do this to me, Gary?
Really. My spousal support is a
hard-earned salary
for 15 years of raising your children
and being your wife.
- What did I get for being your husband?
- 15 years
of never having to flush a toilet.
Come on, kids!
Besides, walter and I get married, you
won't have to pay me any more support.
But if I don't pay spousal support,
what will I have to talk about
with all the hobos
down at the blood bank?
When are you two crazy
kids gonna set a date, anyway?
I don't know.
Walter doesn't seem to be in a hurry
to set a date. I'm OK with that.
He has been in a little funk lately.
I'm just not used
to dealing with someone whose problems
can't be solved with french fries.
I understand. You know,
walter probably hates french things.
All those painful memories
from world war i.
So walk me through this again.
Once Allison is married,
you don't have to pay any money at all?
I still have to pay child support,
but that's cool. That's for the kids,
but spousal support, my god.
That's
like paying workman's comp
to a guy that cut off your fingers.
So all you really need to do is
go light a fire under Krandall.
Yeah, that'll work. He's my
ex-therapist. I'm an ex-patient.
I'm gonna convince him
to marry my ex-wife?
You know, you're great at
convincing people to do stuff.
- You think so?
- Yeah. Remember the time
you got me to agree to a pay cut
in exchange for stock options?
I was an idiot.
You're just a guy with a van.
There was no stock.
All right, that was genius, all right?
You do the same thing to Krandall.
You get him to set a date.
- All right.
- Then,
you'll have enough money to give me
the pay raise you've been talking about.
I'll tell you what,
instead of a Raise,
how about I make you vice president?
Nice try, Gary, all right?
It's president or nothing.
You got yourself a deal.
Why don't you sit down
and tell me what's on your mind?
Where to begin, you know, Dr. Krandall?
I guess,
I've been feeling pretty adrift lately,
- You know, since I'm single.
- But you have a girlfriend, right?
Sure. I have a girlfriend, but that's
not the same as being married.
A real, live wife like Allison.
- I hope you know how lucky you are.
- Yes, allison is a wonderful woman.
I mean, Allison's amazing, dr. Krandall.
Come on. She's beautiful, she's...
She's punctual, right?
She's on time. She, she's smart.
She's very smart, and that's
something she always lets you know.
You always know she's smart,
'cause she always corrects you
if you use words wrong
or if you don't know how many justices
are on the supreme court.
- 9.
- 9.
See? You know that, too.
What are the odds two people
in the same town know that?
That's crazy!
You guys are soul mates,
for crying out loud!
I'm a little surprised, gary.
This isn't exactly how you referred
to Allison during your counseling.
I believe you once referred to her as
"Satan's life coach"?
Well, sure. All the pet names.
They sound a little corny when
they're taken out of context.
In hindsight, Allison has
a lot of amazing qualities,
Dr. Krandall, that I you know,
I took them for granted.
You actually did care
for her, didn't you?
Of course I did. We were
together for 15 years.
We made a home together.
She's the mother
to my children, you know?
I blew it with Allison, and
you can't make that mistake.
I got news for you, Krandall. There's
a lot of interest for allison out there,
all right? And if you're not careful,
I might take another run at her myself.
You're very convincing,
Gary, and you're right.
I need to make my move. Attaboy!
That's great. That's a
good decision, Krandall.
Enough of this. Let's get back to you
and your feelings of being adrift.
No, I feel great now.
I feel very connected.
You're good. You're
very good. Listen,
you got calls to make,
a wedding to plan.
I have to throw you a bachelor party.
You're gonna love it this time,
'cause these days, the ladies don't hold
feathers in front of their bodies.
Can't believe we're watching c-span.
It's my tv day, and this is
our government in action.
Yeah, I'm on the edge of my seat.
This would be a lot more interesting
if you could vote someone off.
You can, idiot, every two years.
Hey, kids, daddy made a big sale today,
so guess what!
Donuts before dinner!
- What's, what's going on here?
- Well, let me bring you up to speed.
Some old guy in a suit walked across
the room with a piece of paper.
No, not c-span. What's going on,
what's this? What is this?
They're plates dad. Vanessa bought them,
and she got bowls and dishtowels.
She's got all sorts of stuff in there.
Look at that. The esteemed gentleman
from wisconsin has his barn door open.
- Hey.
- Hey, you.
- Where'd you get all this stuff?
- From the store.
I keep forgetting
how long you were frozen.
Look, I got some kitchen
essentials for you.
I wanted to try them out, so I made
you and the kids some grilled cheese.
- Hope I didn't ruin your dinner plans.
- No, I'll turn off the porch light.
The delivery guy will
never find the house.
You are now the proud owner
of place settings for 8,
matching silverware,
water and wine glasses.
Hey, this pan looks the
same way as your old one,
except it has a handle that's
attached to it at all times.
Isn't that a little showy?
Well, what's wrong? Don't you like it?
Yeah. I like it.
It's just there's so much of it.
Look, I think I know
what's going on here.
Look, I went through the same
thing when I got divorced.
I didn't unpack any of my boxes for
3 months because I didn't want to admit
that I was a 26-year-old single mom
living in a guest house.
Well, that's not what's going on here
at all because I'm not a single mom.
I mean, you know,
not that I know of.
Gary, sooner or later, you're gonna
want to feel at home in your own house.
I got to go pick up parker.
Look, now I just want you to enjoy it.
You know, try it. You might like it.
What's wrong with you?
Well, I hope you weren't rooting
for the highway appropriations Bill
getting out of committee, 'cause
it's not gonna happen this year.
Go away, allison. I
don't have any more money.
Wake up.
OK, but Vanessa can
never know about this.
Shut up. This is serious.
It's about Walter.
What happened?
Did he have a fall?
He broke off the engagement!
- What? Why?
- Because of you!
Jeez, Louise!
Look, stop it! What did he say?
You were the one in his
office today. You tell me.
That's between me and my therapist.
Come on.
He thinks you're still
in love with me. What?
I didn't say anything that
would give him that impression.
- Then what exactly did you say?
- I don't know. I,
I told him you were beautiful.
I told him you were smart.
I told him it was great
being married to you.
Gary, what were you thinking?
It was either that
or tell him the truth.
I mean, look, you said he was
shuffling his feet about
setting a wedding date.
I had to go in there and make a sell.
Excuse me. I do not need to be sold, OK?
OK. Look, the merchandise
isn't exactly flying off the shelf, OK?
I can't believe you did this, Gary!
I mean, my god!
Don't you want me to be happy?
I want you to be married. I
don't think you can be both.
Well, thanks to you,
i'm gonna be neither.
That was the worst booty call ever.
"Om," my ass.
Get up, Krandall.
How dare you! I was
just about to transcend.
That's disgusting. If you want
to do that, lock your door, all right?
Why did you tell Allison that
i'm still in love with her?
- Because you are, Gary.
- No, I'm not. That's crazy.
Even if there was some bizarro, wacky
universe where I was in love with her.
- Which you are.
- I'm not in love with her!
Why'd you call off the engagement?
That doesn't make sense.
'cause recently I've been wrestling with
the idea that because of my immediate
attraction to Allison, I didn't do
enough to save your marriage.
Yes, and I thank god
every day that you did it!
So when you came in here yesterday,
saying all those
wonderful things about her,
I came to the painful realization
that I crossed an ethical boundary
by sleeping with your ex-wife.
Hey, I stole magazines from
your lobby. We're square.
Look, you've got to get this through
your head. The only reason I wanted you
to set a date with Allison is so I
wouldn't have to pay alimony. That's it!
Sure, that's what you thought
in your conscious mind,
but in the part of your Brain
you can never access,
or even pronounce,
you meant every word!
I think I know what's going
on in my own Brain, Krandall.
Sure. You know the simple
things like "i'm hungry,"
"i'm thirsty,"
"i need to make water."
But you never would have said those
things if you didn't mean them.
Krandall, you know me pretty well.
I don't have a lot of levels.
Gary, please, it's quite normal.
You're at a point in your divorce where.
You're at the point where lots of men
realize they were happier being married
Yeah, well, I'm not one of those guys.
Look for the signs in your own life.
Are you resisting change?
Longing for what you used to have?
Preoccupied with your
ex-wife's romantic attachments?
Does any of that sound familiar, Gary?
You're wrong about this Krandall. You're
wrong, and you're making a big mistake
if you don't marry my wife.
- Your wife, Gary?
- My ex-wife!
You knew I meant to say my ex-wife!
I said wife by accident!
By accident, Gary?
There are no accidents. The very
idea of accidents is a fallacy.
A fallacy? Is everything
about a penis with you people?
Ex-wife. Ex-wife.
It's my ex-wife. Ex-wife.
Ex-wife. Ex. Ex-wife. Ex-wife.
- Hey, handsome.
- Hi.
I wasn't ex-pecting you. Ex-pecting.
Ex-pecting you.
I went to the drugstore and I
picked up a couple things for you.
I got you some soap, some shampoo,
and a shower curtain that understands
the meaning of the word "no."
Nice.
Why aren't you using
one of the plates I got you?
If I use one of the plates,
it'll get dirty
and then it won't match
all the other plates.
Yeah, well, it's supposed to get dirty
and then clean and then dirty again.
It's kind of how plates work.
Yeah, I understand the theory
of plates, sweetheart.
It's just, I don't know.
For me, this is more fun.
What? When I'm done, I throw it on
the lawn and the sprinkler cleans it.
- What are you doing?
- Taking back the stuff I got you.
- You didn't buy me the mixer.
- Yeah, well that I just want.
All right.
Why are you making such
a big deal out of this?
You know what?
This is really my fault. I should known
you're weren't ready for any of this.
You don't have to
take all the plates back.
Are you sure you want to put the glasses
underneath. You probably have a plan.
This really isn't about the stuff.
You're not ready
to accept that this is your home.
I mean, you're a painter and
there's no paint on the walls.
If I ever paint this place, i'm gonna
use a company way better than mine.
You've been here for 3 months.
Why are you so afraid to live here?
Because this isn't my home.
My home is where Allison is.
That didn't come out right. That's.
This place is just temporary, OK?
"Temporary" means that you're going
somewhere, Gary. Where are you going?
Oh, my gosh.
I have one quesadilla off of a frisbee,
now I have to answer all
of life's tough questions.
If you ever decide that you're
ready to leave your old life
and move into your new one, let me know.
- Gary! What are you doing?
- I need to talk to you. Let me in.
No, it's after midnight.
I'm not letting you in.
What.
- I didn't know that was up there.
- That's 'cause I never locked you out.
- What do you want?
- Listen for 15 years,
you knew what was going on
inside my head.
Right now, I need you to tell me
what's going on inside my head.
Based on my experience,
nothing. Good night.
Come on, Allison.
Please help me, please.
Why should I help you, gary? You screwed
up my entire life. I got to tell you,
- i'm still a little pissed.
- Just have a seat. It'll be OK.
Look, Vanessa's mad at me
'cause I wouldn't use some plates,
and she said that I want to
get back to my old life. What?
Well, according to walter, my ex
fiance, he thinks you
still have feelings for me.
What? That's insane.
Then why did you sabotage
my relationship?
It was for the money, OK?
So you're not jealous of Walter?
You're not in love with me?
No, no.
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not in love with you at all.
I mean, I care about you a little bit.
I mean, if you were attacked
and mauled by a grizzly bear,
I would call for help on
my way out of the woods.
If I have any love for you whatsoever,
I promise you, it's
buried under thousands
and thousands of layers of resentment
and anger and bitterness
and that week we had to spend in Branson
in the same hotel room with your parents
and when your curling
iron burnt down my office
and you made me get a vasectomy
and then you made me unget it
and then you made me get it again!
- You rember all that stuff.
- Yeah.
- You're, like, so in love with me.
- What?
- Yes, you are.
- No, that's the opposite.
- I'm not. It's so obvious.
- Look at you.
No, that's not you know what?
Stand up, Allison.
- OK, kiss me.
- What?
Let's kiss.
Kiss, because the second
my lips touch yours,
i know if I'm in love with you or not.
And if I am, I'm gonna go downtown,
buy a pistol, and I'm
gonna blow my Brains out.
- But either way, I have to know.
- Gary, I already know, all right?
Come on. Kiss me.
Come on. It'll be all right.
Kiss me.
OK, fine, you know what?
Fine. Just make it quick.
All right.
Kissing Allison.
Kissing Allison.
Kissing Allison.
All right. Here we go.
Can you put your hair up,
do something with your face?
- No, I'm going to bed!
- No, no, it's OK.
You're not making this
easy on me, Allison.
OK, on the count of 3.
Could you please not act
like we're lifting a couch?
All right.
You're right. I'm sorry.
- Hang on.
- Why'd you stop me?
Now I got to go through
everything again! Kissing Allison.
- Kissing Allison
- Gary? Gary?
- What?
- What if you like it?
- What?
- I mean, like, you know, what if it's,
you know, really, really good?
Then what?
That was awful!
High-five!
Yeah.
- Yeah, you're, you're welcome.
- This is great.
There's nothing for me here.
I can move on. I'll see ya.
Good for you, Gary.
Good stuff.
What? What, what?
I'm sorry I messed things up between
you and Krandall. I really am.
And I was serious when I said
he'd really be lucky to have you.
Thanks.
Too bad he broke up with me.
- He'll be back.
- How can you know that?
I saw him pedaling his
bike up the driveway.
What?
- Hi, Walter.
- I couldn't stay away.
Allison, I know the ethics of
our situation are questionable.
But it occurred to me when Gary came
to my office for the second time...
How little I like Gary.
- What?
- I'm not gonna torture myself anymore.
- I love you, mango.
- "Mango"?
I love you, too, cranberry.
My god. What are you guys, a smoothie?
Allison, will you marry me
at a nonspecific date in the future?
Of course, Walter.
Honey.
That's so nice!
You two, this is great.
When you say "nonspecific date," you
mean you are getting married, you just.
You don't hear me at all, do ya?
All right. Well, i,
I guess I'll just leave
you two alone, then,
and, I'll just be headed out
and you two enjoy yourselves.
- I'm blindfolded.
- Right. Sorry. OK, here we go.
Come in.
Come on. It's OK.
There you go. Steady.
All right.
What do you think?
- I'm blindfolded.
- Right. Sorry. - Sorry. Here.
Welcome to my new life, OK?
- You look good in it.
- So do you.
Thank you. It's beautiful.
But the paint fumes,.
Can you open up the window, maybe?
Oh, my gosh. We could die in here.
Oh, my gosh!
Dennis painted 'em shut!
I'd fire him, but I just made him
president of the company.
Team Subs-Addicts"
- Hey, Louise. How was your day?
- Terrible.
Remember when I wrote
that letter to the epa
about toxic insulation in our school?
Yeah, honey, you write a lot of letters.
Well, it's gonna cost
the school $50,000 to fix it,
so they're canceling the art program.
- How was your day, Tommy?
- Great.
I just found out I don't have
to take art, so...
- No, thanks. I got it.
- What's that?
Just one of many boxes of yours
that's still stacked in my basement.
Come on. It's time you got the rest
of your stuff out of my house. I mean,
the ski clothes, the stereo equipment,
the comic books,
all 6 stupid seasons
of "Perfect Strangers."
Larry and Balki.
They were ill-suited to be roommates.
That's not stupid, that's genius.
Gary, it's time, OK?
I want it out by friday.
Friday?
Don't be ridiculous!
Gary, it was supposed to be out months
ago, OK? Nowhere in the divorce
- agreement does it.
- Oh, my gosh! The divorce agreement!
The piece of paper that stipulates
that you always get the upper hand
- and I get the finger.
- OK, you know what?
It is not my fault
that your lawyer's band
went on tour during our proceedings.
If Hasselhoff says you're going on ur,
You're going on tour.

" Gary Gets His Stuff Back "
Sub VO :  ¤AkaZab¤
Subs-Addicts'
[Sub-Way.fr]
Look at all this cool stuff you have
in mom's basement. What's this?
That's a beer-can hat, my friend,
and I'll have you know
I drank all those beers myself.
- That's only 3, dad.
- You know what?
You try crocheting a hat
after drinking 3 beers.
Tommy, not until you're 17!
Is this your eighth-grade yearbook, dad?
Yeah.
Let me show you something.
See...
look at this. See this tall, handsome
guy playing quarterback?
Is that you?
No, I just always thought
that guy was tall and handsome.
No, I didn't play football
until high school.
This is junior high, where I wrestled.
There. There's your daddy
wrestling right there.
Your face is being covered
by that guy's butt.
Actually...
that's my butt.
I quit after that.
Yeah, once you see your
own butt from that angle,
you know it's time to quit.
Thanks for getting
all this stuff out of here.
Yeah, just a few more
loads and all evidence
of my existence in the basement
I spent hundreds of hours
and thousands of dollars
finishing will be complete.
And many a nights passed out in.
I wasn't passed out,
Allison, I was hiding.
It's not really hiding if no
one's looking for you, Gary.
Look, I'll be back next week
to get the pool table, OK?
The pool table?
Yeah, the pool table. You probably
know it as my basement wife.
- Gary, the pool table is mine.
- What?
Yeah. I believe you gave it to me
as an anniversary gift one year?
No, no.
That was a joke.
No, that's a joke. I gave it to you,
but it's really for me.
- You know, it's a joke.
- No Gary.
That's the set-up to the joke.
The punch line is "i'm keeping it."
No, no! Allison, no!
This is my pool table!
You can't have it. She's perfect.
I love her.
You don't even use it.
What do you mean? I'm using it right now
to store old photographs,
none of which, by the way,
is of a trip to Paris,
which is what you should have got me
as an anniversary gift.
France, Allison? Really? You want to sit
on a plane for 11 hours to find out
people don't like you there, either?
- Come on, let me keep the pool table.
- What? No, no. This was a gift to me.
The divorce agreement clearly states
all gifts stay with the recipient.
You know, I wish you would stop bringing
up that stupid divorce agreement
- because I signed it under duress.
- How were you under duress?
They said if I didn't sign it,
i'd have to stay married to you!
I'm sorry about your pool table, honey.
Why is Allison being so stubborn?
I don't know. Why do bees sting people
even though they know they're gonna die?
She doesn't deserve that table.
She doesn't respect the game. She calls
the rack "that triangle thing."
What's a rack?
It's the... you know,
it's that triangle thing.
I can't believe she's got the upper hand
in everything regarding
our divorce agreement.
One day I got to read that
stupid piece of paper I signed.
Well, I think that she's
being totally unfair.
- Want to switch places?
- Yeah, sure.
So how'd things go today with your ex?
Oh, god, we fought,
as usual.
This time it was about our dog wendell.
He needs pills that cost $50 a month,
and Ronnie refuses
- to split the bill with me.
- Cheap bastard.
Thank you.
- I didn't know you had a dog.
- Yeah.
I'm kind of a dog lover.
I don't even know how many I've
rescued. I can't even count.
But when we split,
I couldn't find a place
that would let me keep them,
so Ronnie has them all.
All?
What do you mean by all?
How many dogs do you have?
7?
Tucker, Daisy, Wendell,
Arizona, Cheater, Cabot, and Gus.
But they're all really small.
Except for gus, who's, like, huge.
So Ronnie takes care of your 7 dogs?
Yeah, but it's not that hard,
except for Cabot, who needs eye drops.
And tucker, who needs anti-depressants.
Yeah, and, of course,
gus the bus, who
has to sleep in bed
with you human-style
Head on pillow.
It's really cute.
But Ronnie acts, like,
so put out by the whole thing.
He's such a Jerk!
I said he's such a Jerk.
Right, Gary?
Isn't he a Jerk?
Oh, my god!
Are you siding with Ronnie?
No, I'm not siding
with Ronnie, but 7 dogs?
Eye drops, anti-depressants,
gus the bus? Oh, my gosh!
It sounds like Ronnie kind of got the
not-so-good end of the deal there right?
What are you like,
Ronnie's best friend now?
- No, I'm not Ronnie's best friend...
- Why don't you go off and marry him?
Doesn't sound like he has room for me.
You know what?
I got to go to work.
Come on. I was just kidding around,
that's all. Come on.
You know, I totally supported
you with your pool-table issue.
And I support you, too. I just
thought it was funny with the 7 dogs.
I was trying to make a joke, that's all.
You know what? I hope that you
and Ronnie will be very happy together,
but the first time he calls
and says he's spending the night at his
"brother's," he's at his
really banging a waitress.
- How was your power walk?
- Exhilarating. What a workout.
- What happened to your hand weights?
- Stolen by skateboarders.
One on each side.
They picked me clean.
Well, this will cheer you up.
It's a picture of me in Cancun.
Spring break, my senior year of college.
Gee!
You must have been
caught in a Rainstorm.
Your t-shirt is soaked.
Yeah. I won $200 for getting
caught in that Rainstorm.
You could have won additional money
by entering some sort of breast contest.
- Thank you, honey.
- What are you doing?
Well, now that Gary finally got
all his stuff out of the way,
I can start organizing my things,
starting with all my pictures.
Why is Gary lying on his back in
front of the Washington monument?
See?
I get it.
It's as though it's his penis.
Yeah, he has a whole series
of those things: the space needle,
Giant Redwood, old faithful.
He has embarrassed me from
sea to fricking shing sea.
Well, I wouldn't give im the Cancun
photo. That would just be cruel.
No, he's not getting
that one, but believe me,
Gary's seen pictures
of me wearing a lot less, a lot less.
Actually, there's a photo
album around here somewhere.
Where is it?
- What are you looking for?
- It's a...
It's a purple satin photo album.
- Crap. I don't think it's here.
- What's in it?
Our first valentine's day,
I gave Gary some... Pictures of me.
Tasteful boudoir photos?
Yes...
And no.
Let's each take a box. We'll
treat this area like a grid.
OK.
Oh, god. It's not here.
You can give up if
you like, but I intend
to find those photos and look at them.
Easy, easy, easy!
Hey, dennis, I just
measured the entire garage.
We can totally put
the pool table in there.
We just have to play
with the garage door open
and switch to drumsticks when we're
up against the water heater, OK?
Dude, OK, but Allison's never
changed her mind about anything,
except for spending the
rest of her life with you.
It's a good point, Dennis.
You need to concentrate on all
the great things that you did get:
Comic books...
Frank Sinatra plate...
Photo album with sex
picture of Allison on it.
What did you say?
Sinatra plate.
The other thing. Go back.
What was the other one? What's that?
Here. This is for you.
You can have the Sinatra plate.
Oh, my gosh!
I thought this was long gone,
but it's not. Here it is in my hands!
What's in it?
They're just photos
of a personal nature.
May I please see her personal nature?
Come on, man. It's just
a bunch of old pictures.
No, you're not getting it. It's
much more than that, OK, Dennis?
Chalk up your drumstick, my friend,
because this is a pool table!
May I come in?
You know, except for the smile
and the nice disposition,
you look a lot like my ex-wife.
That is so funny because
you and I are often fighting!
- What do you want?
- What?
- What? What do you want?
- What? Nothing. I just, came over
to see, you know, if you needed any help
unpacking, organizing, whatnot.
You're looking for something.
Are you looking for anything?
No, Gary. I just know how hard
it is to settle into a new home, so...
'Cause I was looking through the boxes
earlier, and I found something
fascinating that you might
be interested in.
- A photo album.
- Really?
Of Tommy when he was a baby.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
I did find something that
gave me hours of pleasure
Allison that you might be interested in,
and that, of course, would be bare...
Naked ladies, their second Cd.
Sure you're not looking for anything?
Please, Gary. You always
say I got all the good stuff.
- What could I possibly be looking for?
- I don't know...
Letters, journals,
11 saucy photos of a filthy bride,
circa 1993?
So you found the valentine's day photos.
Yes, I did.
- May I have them?
- No, you may not.
You know, the divorce agreement
clearly states that all gifts
are the property of the recipient.
Photos are exempt from the rule, Gary!
They're not exempt.
They may be illegal in a few states,
but they're not exempt, Allison.
- Give me the photos!
- No, no. Hey, I have an idea:
- Yeah?
- Is it lonely?
What an unfortunate time to mock me,
because I was thinking I could trade
a few naughty Allison pictures
for some things that I would like
to have around here.
No, Gary. Absolutely not.
I refuse to deal on principle.
But you're not that principled, Allison.
In fact I have the pictures to prove it.
That was close.
That's close.
Swing and a miss!
Strike 3. You're out.
All right.
All right, so,
you're trying to Blackmail me
into giving you the pool table.
For starters.
- Starters?
- Have a seat.
We'll talk all about it.
Go on. Sit, sit.
You know, Allison, for the first time
in our 15 years together, I
have the upper hand.
And, you know, it's amazing
that you would take hat book out
of my hand, tank you very much.
There's some things I've always wanted
since we've been divorced,
and now I have the power to ask
for them. For example, I...
want the armoire.
My grandmother's armoire
that's been holding my clothes
since I was a little girl?
That's what an armoire is?
No, I-- I don't want that. Um...
What's the leather thing I put
my feet onwhen I'm watching football?
- That's an ottoman.
- I want the ottoman.
Now let's talk music.
Let's talk crows:
I get counting and black,
you keep Sheryl.
You mean, no?
I don't even want that stuff anyway.
All I really care about is the pool
table. I want it back.
No. I'm saying no to everything.
OK, great. Well,
I guess I can do whatever I want with
pouty Allison...
Allison in the jacuzzi.
I like this picture the most
'cause you look genuinely surprised
that you're not wearing any pants.
- Where are the pictures?
- How dumb do you think I am?
Very, but stay on the subject.
Where are they?
They're hidden, Allison.
I hid them in a place where
you will never find them, ever.
All right.
All right, Gary.
I give up. You win.
Bring the photos over and,
i'll give you the pool table.
That sounds good.
And... I'm sorry it had
to get so dirty, Allison,
but you left me no choice.
And I'm sorry, but when I was pulling in
I Kinda clipped the side of your van.
No, you didn't!
What are you doing?
Going to get my pictures
in your sock drawer.
What makes you think I would
hide them in my sock drawer?
Come on, Allison!
Flick.
- How much for you, sweet cheeks?
- Ira?
No, it's me! It's Gary!
I know.
Are you still in love with Ronnie?
No, I hate Ronnie. Ronnie stinks.
It's OK, Ira. He's all right.
Oh, my gosh. That's got
to be the toughest ira in America.
Look, I'm sorry I overreacted
about the whole Ronnie thing.
I was just so crazed
about this thing with Allison
and the pool table.
I apologize.
- So you never side with Ronnie again?
- Never.
Even if you think that
he's right and I'm wrong?
Even that, yes.
And you don't think I'm crazy
for having 7 dogs?
No.
I think it's cute.
Come on. I am so crazy.
I have 7 dogs! Who has 7 dogs?
My hot girlfriend's ex-husband,
who's a Jerk.
You just earned yourself a beer, mister.
All right. Let's have a toast.
To exes who stink.
I take it you didn't
get back your pool table.
I had it, Vanessa.
I had the pool table in my hands,
and then Allison just took it right out
of my sock drawer.
I'm gonna pretend I know what that
means. You can play pool here.
I know, but it's not the Same.
I need that pool table specifically.
I got to get that table out of Allison's
basement, but I don't know how.
What time does Ira get off of work?
Come on, you guys. Let's go.
All right. We got to make this quick
before Allison gets home, all right?
We're not doing anything
illegal, are we?
No. This is my ex-wife's house, Ira.
We're not car, car!
Car! Car! Car!
No, we're OK. It's gone now. Come on.
Everybody up. We're all right.
- I'm hungry.
- What?
Yeah, we'll get something to eat when
we're finished like we talked about,
- OK, Ira?
- But I'm hungry now.
All right, Ira.
Let's see what we have here.
- Hey, hey, look. Lasagna.
- I'm on the south beach diet.
Ira, we're kind of in a time
crunch here. Could you help me out?
OK, heat it up.
I'll eat around the noodles.
Oh, my god! This is ridiculous!
Ira, you want to help us out
down here or what?
You actually divorced a woman
who can cook lasagna like this?
You are a foolish, foolish man.
Hey, guys, can we move this along?
My wife's asleep,
and if she rolls over and doesn't
squish me, she'll know I'm not there.
OK, let's get started.
We're gonna have to take the pool
cue rack off the walls,
so we're gonna need a screwdriver...
or...
or some spackle.
That's cool. Either way.
All right, come on.
Help me get this tarp off.
All right. Come on, Dennis 1, 2, 3.
Put it back! Put it back!
- Put it back!
- I knew it!
I knew you were gonna try
to steal the pool table.
What? Steal the pool table?
Gary Lied.
He said we were gonna
try to save Christmas!
Are we trespassing?
Long were you laying under there?
Long enough to know you're
the worst criminal ever.
I'm not a criminal!
I came to take what was mine!
My god! You are never
gonna let this go, are you?
No. Why should i? You got
everything in the divorce!
I got totally shafted!
You got the money!
You got the cars! You got
my bar, for crying out loud!
I am so sick and tired
of hearing about everything you lost!
What about me, Gary? You think
this was my childhood dream?
To be divorced after 15 years,
and arguing through lawyers,
shuttling our kids back and forth?
You're not the only one
that lost something, Gary.
You want a pool table so bad,
go out and buy one.
I don't want to go out and buy one.
I want this one, Allison.
Why does it have to be this one?
Because this one's mine! I had so
many good memories with this one!
Yeah? That's why I want it, too!
What, we want this for the same reason?
Well, then that is completely weird.
Gary, I love this table.
What, you think I'm just trying to
hold on to it just to be vindictive?
It would fit a pattern, yeah.
We had so much fun down here.
The kids would play,
and we would have all the neighbors
come over and remember,
I'd bring drinks downstairs
for everybody and you'd yell at me
when I put the can on the wood?
Yeah, it leaves a ring.
I mean, it's...
the one part of us
I wouldn't mind holding on to.
But, you know, if you're not gonna
let it go and you're gonna
feel like you've been so shafted, then
just, you know, go ahead and take it.
I can't take it after your nice speech.
I'd be a complete tool if I took it now.
Plus Ira's gone.
No, he's still up there. I can
hear him digging through my freezer.
Ira: mind if I have the last dove bar?
You said you were on
the south beach diet!
If you want it,
just say you want it.
You keep the table, OK?
It's worth it to me to know
that you have something in your house
that reminds you of me in a good way.
You know, Gary, I don't know
if I ever said this, but I'm sorry...
It didn't work out for us.
But, you know, we started
in a good place.
We started in a great place.
- Game of 8-ball?
- I'd like that.
- Winner gets the ottoman?
- Rack'em.
I don't have to.
They're already in the triangle thing.
Did everybody have hair like that
back in the eighties?
We looked awesome.
Was it really windy back then?
No, sweetie. See, even the guys
back then, we would use a blow dryer.
Also, we used this stuff called mousse.
It was kind of like mayonnaise
that your hair ate.
Well, there's no kind way to say this,
but everyone looked kind of stupid.
Are you out of your mind?
We look fantastic.
Look at all the different
looks you have here. You have
your Boy George. Look at this.
Your crockett and your tubbs.
Look, you got the Madonna look,
the flock of Seagulls. Come on, man.
We looked good.
- Why do you do that?
- Do what? What'd I do?
- You put your collar up.
- I don't know. I think it looks cool.
- Tommy, where you going?
- I'm gonna go burn my yearbook.
Team Subs-Addicts'
Gary, you home?
You trying to lock me out?
You didn't step in the bear trap,
and I guess the anvil missed you.
Nonstop cartoon references.
I don't Miss that.
I picked up Louise's basketball uniform.
Now, you're sure you're
ready to coach girls basketball?
Are you kidding me? I can't wait.
The rest of the teams are gonna cower
in fear at the sight
of bonnie's organic market.
Look, Gary, just rember that their
last coach had a strict philosophy of
non-competive competion.
OK, well, the new coach has a
strict philosophy about their old coach:
get a haircut, get a job,
you dirty hippie.
That's nice. Nice.
Gary, where are the kids?
I got stuck at a job. Vanessa's picking
them up. She helps me out.
- Does she do that a lot?
- Sometimes.
Right now,
I think she's taking them for ice cream.
Ice cream? Before dinner.
You think that's a good idea?
Well, they're having ice cream for
dinner, so I didn't think it mattered.
- The kids are right behind me.
- Thanks for helping me out.
Hey, guys.
Check it out, mom.
Vanessa took us to get tattoos.
Look at that.
My son has a giant snake on his arm.
- Neat.
- Don't worry.
They'll be gone in,
like, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 weeks tops.
Vanessa said it would draw attention
on my guns.
You're gonna need those guns
to fight all the girls.
Look at mine, mom.
Look at that. The recycling symbol.
It took forever.
The guy can do 20 types of unicorns
but couldn't get his head around
a triangle made out of arrows.
Thanks, V.
You coming to the game tonight?
- I'm gonna be the referee.
- I'll be there, T.
T? V? What?
You don't think that
temporary tattoos could
be a gateway to permanent tattoos?
- Well, I.
- I'll take this one. Come on, Allison.
You take the kids to the street fair,
you don't care when they get their faces
painted there. You don't think that's a
gateway to permanent clownhood, do you?
I'm sorry. I was just trying to kill
some time between dinner and school.
Yeah, that's it.
Fine, really. But
you know, a trip to the library
wouldn't have been a bad idea, so...
Yeah. That's great.
And then the kids could have looked up
a bunch of words like passive
and aggressive.
I'm just socking off the floor.
Time to move it along, show's over.
I'll talk to you later, OK?
What are you doing?
Why are you so afraid
of letting me talk to her?
I'm not afraid of you talking to her.
I'm afraid of you unhinging your Jaw
and swallowing her whole.
I'm just trying to find out something
about this woman who
spend so much time with our kids.
I mean, how do I know
she's not a bad influence?
She's a good influence.
She told me she was a good influence.
Or maybe she said she
was under the influence.
Come on, she's a good girl.
She's got great judgment.
Really? You know what, Gary?
I think there are, what,
4 billion men out there,
and she picked you. Now,
I don't know what the opposite
of winning the lottery is,
but damn, I think she got it.
She took the kids out for fun, Allison.
Is that OK?
You remember fun. It's part of your
axis of evil along with Joy
and laughter.

All right, guys, listen up.
We're playing Hanson's dry cleaning, OK?
They're faster than us.
They're taller than us.
And their uniforms are
beautifully pressed and starched,
but listen,
I think we can beat them, all right?
Good luck, coach.
Hey, Vanessa,
look, this gym has a strict rule.
You can't come out the court unless
you're wearing a super hot
- cheerleader uniform.
- Too bad. I left mine at home.
You really have a hot
cheerleader uniform?
- 2 minutes, coach. 2 minutes.
- What's with the shades?
Your sunglasses.
Why are you wearing sunglasses?
I'm just getting a lot
of glare off the court.
Hey, V.
Hi, Tom.
Did you color in that tattoo?
Yeah. I'm turning it into coral snake.
It's beautiful.
But also dangerous.
All the signs are there.
The sunglasses, the whistle.
I'm raising a small-town sheriff.
All right, team, bring it in.
We're gonna dominate on 3.
1, 2, 3, dominate! Yeah.
You know,
if we all say it together,
it sounds a lot scarier, OK?
Dad, our last coach said it isn't
about the number on the scoreboard.
- The numbe of friends you make.
- OK, girls,
i'm not gonna sugarcoat this.
Losers don't deserve friends.
Get out there and win, win!
Let's Go!
Check it out. Your ex-wife sitting
next to your girlfriend.
Oh, my gosh. That's awful.
Those 2 are not a good combination.
Yesterday, I had to get right
in between them when they were.
Hugging?
You were between them
when they were hugging?
Which way were you facing?
'cause I got to tell you, I'd be torn.
No. They were fighting yesterday.
They're hugging now.
But this is much worse,
this is way worse.
I gotta break this up.
I got earrings on your forward here,
coach. Jewelry is not regulation.
I thought studs were OK.
No studs, no hoops, no danglers.
Check your rule book.
I would check my rule
book except the referee spilled
his count chocula
all over it this morning.
Here, have a seat.
Here we go. All right, Dennis,
what are they doing now?
They're talking and they're laughing.
And they're totally looking right at me.
What's up, ladies?
Are you doing? They're not
looking at you. They're looking at me.
Why couldn't they be looking at me?
Hey, coach, we're waiting on you!
I've got earrings here.
I'm working on it.
Go ahead, sweetheart, you're OK.
You're a very handsome man, Dennis.
But I'm the only thing
they have in common?
The person that hates
me the most is talking
to the person that likes me the most.
I can't have that.
Allison has 4 quarters to tell
Vanessa every stupid thing I ever did,
every dumb thing I every said,
every stupid thing I ever tried to eat.
Dude, you're right. The worst thing is,
if they keep talking,
sooner or later conversation's
bound to get around to your junk.
Too late.
The game's changed
a lot since I was a kid.
You played basketball?
Point guard.
I was lethal at the top of the key.
I could drain it from the corner,
I could dish it from the paint.
I was unstoppable.
Hey, Vanessa, you have to finish
telling me that lake havasu story.
Right. So,
all 6 girls are skinny-dipping,
and nobody rembers to turn off the boat.
Oh, my god. So it's what?
Like, the entire boat just drove away?
Yeah! And an hour later,
a couple of high school boys pull up
in a fishing boat and they
drive us back to the shore very slowly.
You know, when I was in the sorority,
we all went skinny-dipping once.
I mean, I left my bra and underwear on,
but it was very exhilarating.
What's going on?
What are you guys doing?
Vanessa, was just telling me this
really funny story about lake havasu.
That story.
I love that story.
All the kids are very thirsty outside.
Can you please bring them some juice?
That's good.
We got to keep them hydrated.
Go ahead, right out there.
When I get back, i'll tell you
my cabo story. It's insane.
That cabo story.
- What the heck are you doing?
- What? What do you mean?
Why try to be friends
with my girlfriend?
You wouldn't tell me anything about her,
so I had to find out for myself.
And you'll be happy
to know I think she's great.
She sort of reminds me of me.
In what alternate universe?
In the same universe where a girl like
that is attracted to a guy like you.
Gary, I just think she's lovely,
all right?
Good. Then you guys can go back
to arguing about tattoos, then, OK?
Gary, please,
they're henna, they'll wash off.
- Fluids are replaced.
- Sunblock. Girls need sunblock.
I told their parents they couldn't
go back old and leathery.
That's good.
Thanks a lot.
This is a good thing. I like Vanessa.
I could even see hanging out with her.
You cannot hang out with her.
You can maybe talk to her.
You can appreciate her.
You can be jealous that
your scales aren't
as soft as her skin. But...
you cannot hang out with her.
What would possibly wrong with your
girlfriend getting along with ex-wife?
How would you like it if I hung
out with your fiance all the time?
Hey, what's up?
You want to hang out sometime?
- No, thank you.
- What?
Why not?
I say this at the risk of sounding
superior, but you're beneath me.
Vanessa, where did you say
you got that belt again?
Stella on melrose.
You know? I have something I need
to return there. Do you want go with me?
No, Allison does
not want to go with you.
- Gary, yes, I would love to go.
- No, actually, she doesn't.
She changed her mind. She told me
she doesn't want to go out with you.
- I would.
- Would not.
She's trying to say she would not. She
doesn't want to spend time with you.
Here's the thing, you guys. You two
shopping together, I got to be honest.
I don't think that's
something I would enjoy.
So Vanessa, what time are you thinking?
No, Vanessa. Don't fall for it, OK?
She's not trying to be your friend.
She's just
seeing if you're
a good influence on our kid.
Of course that's what she's doing.
I'm a mom.
I get it. She's checking
out the new girlfriend.
- We're just going shopping, Gary.
- No, you're not.
No. You know what? I'm putting my foot
down. Look, that's my foot. Foot down.
I am forbidding you guys
from spending time together.
Excuse me.
Did you just say forbidding?
Yes. Forbidding. I'm forbidding
you guys from going out together.
- Forget it.
- Really?
Really.
Allison, how about we leave
as so as we're done here?
- She can't. She's forbidden.
- You know what?
I would love to,
and there's a SPA near there.
- Is it a forbidden SPA?
- We could both get massages.
No, you can't.
I could probably use massage.
My boyfriend's been stressing me lately.
You're forbidden.
Then we can go get drinks afterwards.
You know, maybe flirt with some guys.
That's great.
You're both forbidden!
I'm telling you what to do.
The man of the house has spoken!
My goodness.
Why are you so tense?
This was kind of a last-minute thing,
and I forgot to shave my legs.
Let me know if the pressure is OK.
Just relax and remember to breathe.
Is everything OK?
Everything is fine.
Everything is nice.
Is the pressure OK?
Oh, good. That's great, thank you.
I notice you wear a wedding ring.
You married?
Engaged, actually.
But I used to be married.
Your ex-husband, what's the matter?
You could not please him? What?
I mean, maybe your...
your ex-husband, he was not pleasing?
Not pleasing enough for me
to stay married to him. I'll say!
You know what? That pressure's
getting a little tough there.
What could you tell somebody
about your ex-husband
if you had a new friend,
maybe a new friend like me?
Well, I'm kind of mad at him right now.
But I guess I'd say he was bossy,
paranoid, and selfish.
He's selfish? Yeah, selfish.
Even though he offered
to make love to you every night
of the week even when you wore your
retainer and had on your granny pants?
- Selfish my ass...
- What? My God, Gary.
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?
I wanted to see if you were gonna
talk smack about me and you did.
You're crazy!
You badmouthed me to the massage
therapist, a complete stranger.
I can only imagine what kind of
things you're saying to my girlfriend.
- Get out of here.
- Look, come on.
I have a clean slate with Vanessa.
I don't want you filling her head with
all the bad things you know about me.
I will say whatever I want to say,
and you know what?
Maybe I will start by telling her
that you interrupted my $160 massage.
You're still mad about that?
Oh, my gosh.
I'm not leaving here until you promise
to just stay out of my relationship.
Me? You're the one who messed
things up with your ike turner speech.
"I forbid you, woman!"
My god, we're having a good time.
I like Vanessa
She brings out my fun side.
If you have a fun side,
I have a ballroom dancing side, OK?
- Is there a problem in here?
- Yeah, this man touched my naked body.
Yeah, but that wasn't fun for me either.
You have to come with us.
All right,
I don't want to have to do this, fellas
but I'm officer brooks, vice.
I'd like to speak to the owner.
- I am the owner.
- In that case these are for you.
Excuse me.
Where have you been?
Sorry, Pop.
The plymouth got a flat on
the way home from the record store.
We had to hitch it the whole way back.
What's going on with you, Tom?
- Sit down.
- I'm sitting down. Relax.
What did you say
To Vanessa at the party?
She walked away, she looked upset.
She didn't me even say good-bye.
- Well, I.
- You know, I don't want to hear it.
I just want you to fix it,
and I want you to fix it now.
You're pretty upset about this,
aren't you?
I am because I like Vanessa,
and if you're not seeing her,
I'm not seeing her, you follow?
OK, let me explain
it to you this way, OK?
Let's say you go to a new school, OK?
And you like the new teacher,
but there's an old teacher
from the old school that knows
all the bad stuff about you.
I get it, dad.
You're afraid mom's gonna
tell Vanessa bad stuff about you.
Well, I don't know how you
made that leap in your mind, but.
You know what?
I am losing patience.
But in that scenario,
I would go to my new teacher
and tell her all the stuff I was afraid
she was gonna hear from the old teacher.
You want me to tell
Vanessa all the things
I'm afraid your mom's
gonna tell her about me?
At least she'll be hearing it from you.
All right, thanks.
You're a good man, Tommy.
You've turned into a fine young man.
Thanks, dad.
But the onething you have to
remember about women is,
they don't usually
have a lot of faith in us.
Yeah. Hey, hey.
Hand it over.
You know, one day, I'm gonna
take one of those.
Hey, want to hear something
that will really get you mad?
I'm gonna taste them both right now.
- I got to see Vanessa.
- There's a band.
- $5.00 cover.
- Fine.
Here's your $5.00.
No. The name of the band is $5.00 cover.
It's 10 to get in.
Fine. $10.
Let me in.
I went to stunt man school.
Excuse me?
In 1993 for 3 weeks
I went to stuntman school.
It cost me $12,000,
and on the second day,
I sprained my ankle on my way
to falling out of a building class.
I'm a sore loser.
I hold a grudge.
I'm very impatient.
So much so that I'll flush
the toilet before
I'm even finished peeing.
What are you doing?
I'm telling you all
the bad things about me before
Allison has a chance to do it.
I just wanted to beat her to the punch.
So you think that if Allison tells me
that you flunked out of stuntman school,
I'm gonna break up with you?
Well, no. I didn't flunk
out of stuntman school.
I tripped over uneven pavement,
and then I quit the next day.
Thank you.
Gary, why don't you trust
me to make up my own mind about you?
I never expected you to be perfect.
Or anything close to perfect.
Well, in that case,
And you don't have to worry so much
about Allison because you'll be able
to hold this night over her
head for a very long, long time.
Why? What do you mean?
What's going on?
Wait. Where'd she go?
She was just here.
Hey, Vanessa,
she tried to sneak out again.
Oh, my god, that's Allison.
Every time I walk outside,
I end up right back here.
Hey, it's my guys!
My guys!
2 drinks.
Amazing.
Hey, get these guys a drink.
Because this lady right here,
this lady's like the coolest
lady in the whole world.
And this unattractive
lady is my ex-husband.
I am so happy right now.
OK, I'm gonna need you to
support her while I get the door, OK?
Whoa! She's 100 pounds
of jell-o shots right now.
Oh, you're so super sweet.
I totally weigh more than 100 pounds.
Watch out. She's a kisser
when she's drunk. She kisses.
I already got a mouthful on the way out.
I never kissed a black man before,
but I will again.
Yeah. Put her in the seat, OK?
Careful.
All right, would you do me a favor
and go upstairs and get some aspirin,
some B-12,
and get her cowboy sweatshirt.
- When she's drunk, she gets cold.
- Sure.
I'm so hungry.
You know what?
I'm gonna make a bundt cake.
Sorry I acted so crazy today.
I was just so afraid that
Allison was gonna say something
to you that would chang
the way that you looked at me.
Right now I'm looking
at a man who's generous enough
to help a woman who drives him crazy
99% of the time.
I think it's sweet.
Hey, you know what else is good?
Cinnabun.
You go get it.
I'm gonna wait right here.
Let me, let me put you to bed.
Now, Allison, let me come on.
All right.
Let me just lay here.
Can I lay here? Just let me lay here.
It's so cool.
I love marble.
You know, I wanted spanish tile,
but you said marble, Gary.
You are so smart.
You are so smart.
It's hard being smart, isn't it?
I'm always the smart one,
Gary, and you're always the fun one.
And I used to be fun like Vanessa,
but then I met you.
And you outfunned
me and I just got boring.
I didn't out fun you. It's just...
You married an immature Jerk,
and somebody had to step
up and act like a grownup.
I used to love that immature Jerk.
Don't talk about him like that.
It's a deal.
But you take it easy on yourself, OK,
because you were a lot of things,
but you were never boring.
I would kiss you right now
if I hadn't just thrown up in my mouth.
All right, ladies, let's go get 'em.
Let's go, go!
All right!
- Hey, Ref, what's up?
- You and Vanessa work things out?
Yes, we did.
Thank you for your advice, OK?
You be good to her.
Hey, look what the cat dragged in!
How you feeling, Allison?
Looks like Vanessa really
did bring out your fun side.
Well, if by fun side
you mean my insides, then yes.
Yes, she did.
Let's play some hoops, ladies.
Hey, you know what?
I bought these in bulk, so.
Team Subs-Addicts'
- What?
- Is it weird having boobs?
I figured. Do you use
your boobs for good or for evil?
- One for each.
- All right.
Did I tell you that my ex-husband
wants to buy our son a dirt bike?
Well, that's awesome.
... Ly bad. Awesomely bad idea.
Ronnie wants to have our son
do all of these dangerous things,
like take kickboxing
and get a BB gun
and go out for musical theater.
- Well, musical theater isn't dangerous.
- It still scares me.
Listen, I'm sorry your ex-husband
bothers you, OK? He upsets me, too.
You know what we should do?
Just to show him, we should watch
the rest of this game butt naked.
Come on,
let's take our clothes off,
and we'll show that guy.
All right, I gotta go.
My best friend Stephanie
is graduating from beauty school, so the
gang's getting together tonight my bar.
- Girl's night out?
- No, the guys will be there, too.
Snake and Dunker, and Hammer and Dave.
Dave?
What kind of a name is Dave?
I'd invite you to come along,
but I really kind of want you to meet
them one on one, 'cause they're
kind of tough in a crowd.
No worries.
And they're really protective of me
ever since Ronnie and I got a divorce.
Of course they are.
- And whenever anybody new wanders in...
- I don't want to go.
I mean, I would go, but there's
a lot of stuff for me to do here.
You're gonna sit around and think about
what it's like to have boobs.
Yes, I am.
I use mine for evil.

- Hey, here are the kids, right on time.
- Hey, guys! How was your dad's house?
Awful. Dad made us eat healthy.
- What?
- And he forced us to exercise.
And the only stuff he
let us watch on tv was violent.
Tommy, nonviolent.
What's the point of rehearsing
it on the whole drive over
here if you're gonna choke?
OK guys, go put your stuff away and wash
off the weekend you had with your dad.
What's going on here?
Tiny food. Flowers.
Oh my gosh, did Krandall die?
I'm alive and well, Gary.
Thanks to my Scandinavian genes
and a diet rich in omega 3S.
Omega 3S. Look at Krandall.
Seeing sority chicks on the side. Nice.
That's raw chicken, Gary.
So, what is going on here?
Walter and I are
having a little party tonight
to celebrate his brilliant new book.
It's called "round two of your life."
It's a how-to guide focusing
on new relationships after divorce.
Well, that sounds amazing.
I can't wait to not read it.
You know what, gary,
you actually should read it.
You can always take a couple of aspirins
afterwards for your thinkin'headache.
There a whole chapter on the importance
of being accepted into
your new partner's social circle.
So, tonight we're celebrating
my new book and introducing Allison
- to my oldest and dearest friends.
- Oldest and dear! That's great.
Sounds like a who's who of who's left.
Are you this funny when you're
making walls a different color?
My friends are gonna
adore you tonight, mango.
Thank you, cranberry.
So you're gonna meet all
of cranberry's posse tonight?
You know what, gary,
tonight meeting walter's friends
is a very important moment
in my relationship with walter.
I think you're just jealous
because your relationship
with Vanessa isn't as far along as mine.
Let me tell something. My relationship
kicks your relationship's ass.
Is that right?
You've already met Vanessa's friends?
- Yes I have. Of course I have.
- Really? I don't think so.
- I have. Really.
- Really?
- Fine what are their names?
- What her friends?
Her friends are Monica, Chandler...
- He's dim but likable.
- Poor Gary.
I'm so sorry that Vanessa hasn't
introduced you to any of her friends.
You know, maybe Vanessa's just
waiting for one of her girlfriends
to get a boyfriend who's worse than you.
For your information, she told me
that her friends are pretty protective
since her divorce,
so we're just taking it easy.
Yeah, that's exactly what I would say
if I didn't want my friends to meet you.
But then she went on to say,
"why you come hang
out with all my friends tonight?"
- Really?
- That's what I'm doing.
Where are you going? Central Perk?
No, it's at a bar, and all her friends
are gonna be there 'cause one of her
closest girlfriends graduated beauty
school. We're gonna have a big party.
I hope it goes better than
the first time you met my friends.
You remember that?
You completely embarrassed yourself.
You ran in the bathroom and climbed
out the window, and then you fled.
Yeah. I did not fled.
The door got stuck.
I had to go out the window. Right?
And then once I was outside,
I chose to go home.
Sure, Gary.
Hey, listen, have a ben gay
old time at your party tonight, OK.
If the conversation lags, just talk
about the last great tomato you had.
I love a good tomato.
Raw, cooked, grilled, sun-dried,
succulent, or stuffed with crabmeat.
I love crabmeat.
Here's to Stephanie
for finally making it through
all 6 months of beauty school.
Now none of us will ever
have to pay for highlights again.
Is there a barber in the house?
I got a hair emergency.
I need a perm.
What a surprise.
I wasn't expecting to see you.
Yeah, what's up? I was just in the'hood,
and I thought would holler "what's up"!
What is wrong with that man?
Everybody, this is the guy that
I've been seeing. Gary. Gary, this is...
No, hold on. Let me guess.
Let me guess. Hold on a second. That's,
Dunker.
That's Dave. That's Stephanie.
- Actually, I'm Dave. That's Dunker.
- And I'm Stephanie.
How about you guys all switch seats?
That way I'm still right.
I'll talk to you in a minute.
I thought that you didn't
want to meet my friends.
You said your friends were pretty rough.
I figured I'd come in,
just let'em get to know me.
Everybody likes me.
Relax. Everybody loves me!
I know. I just wish you would
have given me some warning
- so I could have put their muzzles on.
- I'll tell what. I'll be real still.
I'll let them sniff my hand first.
It'll be OK. I promise.
Vanessa, private party
upstairs wants to see a manager.
Yeah, but I'm not working tonight.
Can't ed take care of it?
Ed went to his girlfriend's
place of work to meet her friends.
It's a very important
step in a relationship.
This will only take a minute.
Do you want to come with me?
No, that's OK. I'll be down here,
and I'm gonna chill with your peeps.
Good luck,
but just don't say "chill" or "peeps".
All right.
She's pretty awesome.
But you guys already knew
that because you're the gang.
And you're the famous Gary
who painted Vanessa's condo.
That's right.
You know, this is a funny story.
I was painting a condo in her building.
She need a painter for her condo.
I was available. I wound up painting
her condo. That's how we met.
Why is that a funny story?
It's not, really.
You know what,
I probably should have said true story.
Yeah, but there's nothing
about it anyone would ever doubt.
I should have just said story.
So, Stephanie. Hey!
All right, the graduate.
Congrats! That's great. That's good.
You know, you don't look at all
like a stereotypical
- hair stylist at all.
- What does that mean?
You know,
the stereotypical hair stylist...
the gossiping, the gum chewing.
"Oh, my god! And then she totally,
like, slept with tucker."
You never heard them talk like that?
They got the crazy eye shadow,
- the big long nails.
- Like these?
Longer than that.
Like guinness book record long nails.
I'm gonna go into the bar.
Do you guys need anything while I'm up?
'cause I'm up,
and you guys are obviously not
even looking at me at all.
Everyone look down at their phones.
Perfect. You're all under my command.
Hey, Bartender,
can I get a beer, a tall one?
And then maybe take the corkscrew
and stab me in the face.
Rough night?
You could say that. Met my
girlfriend's friends for the first time.
Should do after this? Get a root canal
so you day ends on a positive note.
- How long you been divorced?
- 6 months. Is it that obvious?
Kind of. I was there a couple years ago.
Does it ever go away?
Well, here's the thing.
Vanessa said she's
gonna be a little while.
And said not to add the
word "Izzle" to anything.
- You know Vanessa?
- Yeah,
she's my new girlfriend.
Are you a friend of Vanessa's, too?
- I'm Mitch.
- Hey, Mitch. I'm Gary.
I met Vanessa. I was painting
her condo in her building,
and then she needed her condo painted,
so I did. That's how we met.
- That's a funny story.
- I know, right?
- The first guests have arrived.
- OK, I only need a couple more seconds.
I have to finish toasting
these sesame seeds,
and if you cook'em
for like a second too long. Crap!
You didn't finish sentence, dear. What
happens if you cook them for too long?
Walter, honey, I just need
3 more minutes, OK?
You've been working
since early this morning.
- Are these sesame seeds even necessary?
- You know what? No, Walter.
Sesame chicken skewers
don't need sesame.
In fact, why do we even need
the skewers? You know what we should do?
We should hurl a bunch of chicken at
our guests when they walk in the room.
Crap! Walter!
I'm thrilled that you're so excited
about this, but I want you to make sure
to relax and have fun.
Relax and have fun? Why the
hell would you say that to me?
I'm sorry. Sometimes I just spout off.
Walter, I can't relax now, OK? I just...
Do you know how long I've waited
to be part of a group like this?
I mean, educated, intelligent
people who travel and read books
and who don't quote
"caddyshack" on a daily basis.
I'm sorry. I should have understood
how important this is to you.
But I assure you,
the evening is gonna be beautiful.
And who's the author of this
"caddyshack"? Is it worth me reading?
God, do I love you.
Crap.
It looks like you're back on the horse?
I mean, you're already
meeting vanessa's friends.
I don't have a lot in common
with them, though. I mean,
Dunker and Hammer and Snoopy.
I don't know.
Yeah, they're kind of the odd squad.
What do you think of Stephanie?
I like her nails.
I could do without the attitude.
- Stephanie's kind of a nightmare.
- Yeah, I kind of agree with you.
- So when did you meet Vanessa?
- A month after my divorce.
You don't waste time.
No, you know,
I probably jumped in too fast.
I should be out there playing the field,
I mean it's Vanessa. She's super hot.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm talking to your friend Mitch.
This guy's awesome.
I thought I told you to let me know
if you were ever gonna be in here.
I can come in here anytime I want,
'cause it's open to the public.
Am I right, Gary?
- I yeah. I don't know. What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- This is my ex-husband.
- What?!
That's Ronnie?
He said his name was Mitch.
Ronnie Mitchell.
My friends call me Mitch.
Well, that's confusing.
Gary, why are you
talking to my ex-husband?
I didn't know that was Ronnie.
He told me his name was mitch.
I never would have talked to him if
he told me his name was really Ronnie.
I admit I was unclear on that point.
What, now you think
he's like a great guy?
No, but he's the first guy all night
to talk to me like I was a human being.
- Gary hates your friends.
- What?
Especially Stephanie.
- Who hates me?
- No, I don't.
- He said you were a nightmare.
- You said she was a nightmare.
- You agreed.
- I kind of agreed.
All right, Stephanie, I'm sure
that Gary didn't say anything like that.
- What's going on?
- Gary hates us.
- He does not hate you guys.
- He called you the odd squad.
- What's happening here?
- I'm going on record.
I don't like him. Me either.
- All right, you always do this.
Gary is a good guy. You can't
trust Ronnie. He's a total snake.
Yeah, thank you, Vanessa.
Why don't you ask your good
guy here why he said he rushed
into this relationship too soon.
He'd rather be playing the field.
Awkward.
All right, gary did not say that.
Gary, tell them.
Dude, what's your problem?
- Did you really say that?
- Did you, Be honest.
- What the hell you doing?
- Ira, thank god you're here.
- I can't tell how high up I am.
- I wouldn't risk it.
- I'm losing my grip!
- I'll never make it to you in time.
Why didn't you tell
me it was only 2 inches?
Because I rarely get to laugh
when I take out the trash.
They are loving the
sesame chicken skewers.
I know. Everything's going so well,
I feel like I should have bluebirds
and squirrels singing songs
and helping me out, you know?
You know, Cinderella, hiring adults
at a living wage is also an option.
God, they drink a lot.
It's like spring break
for all the old people out there.
If they start doing body shots, I quit.
Honey! You're doing such a great job.
Professor Meyers needs
another grasshopper.
I'm in the weeds here, mom.
I don't have time for blended drinks.
Allison, everyone is
having a wonderful time.
- The food is perfect.
- I know.
- The house is beautiful.
- Isn't it, though? Gosh.
There is one tiny thing, though.
It's barely worth mentioning.
What is it? Is it Tom?
Yeah, he's never bartended
for this many people before.
It's not that.
Apparently, you've been
telling everyone that
my book is a penultimate
book on divorce.
- It is.
- I know you mean
that in the nicest possibly way,
but penultimate doesn't mean best.
- It means second to last.
- What?
- God, no. It can't mean that.
- It's a common mistake, really.
I hear it all the time when I do
outreach work in shelters and jails.
Are you all right?
I've been using "penultimate" all night.
I said it about Christmas
and giving birth
and my freshman year of college. Now
they all think I didn't graduate! God!
- Allison, everyone makes mistakes.
- No, Walter, they don't.
Ph. D's and lawyers don't make mistakes.
Only high school dropouts and me.
And I. High school dropouts and I.
Or me. You know,
either is really acceptable.
I don't know why I thought
I could do this Walther.
Thanks a lot, Allison. It's all your
fault. And because of his stupid book,
you have wrecked everything
between me and Vanessa!
Yeah? Yeah? Well, 15 years
of living with you has made me dumb.
This whole thing is your fault!
- What the hell just happened?
- I was hoping you could tell me.
All I did was criticize
her on one minor thing.
You criticized Allison
on a night like tonight?
Hey, do yourself a favor, Pal.
Sleep with one eye open.
Sadly, I do. It's a family affliction.
- Open up! I know you're in there!
- Go away!
Look, don't stick your
head in the tiny oven, OK?
I'm serious Gary. If you know what's
good for you stay out of this house.
If I knew what was good for me,
I would have stayed out of your pants.
Now, open up!
- No way!
- All right, I'm coming in.
Hey! Quit it!
Stop throwing china at me!
You're making a tiny mess!
- You made me stupid, Gary!
- What does that even mean?
All those years of living
with you with the zombie movies
and the video games and the zombie
movies based on video games.
I did not make you stupid,
but you made me make a fool out
of myself in front of
vanessa and all her friends.
And her ex-husband ambushed me.
Hang on. Why is any of that my fault?
Because you always make me
do things I don't want to do.
Whether you know it or not,
you make me do it.
Big deal. You were an idiot
in front of Vanessa's friends.
I doubt any of them
were rocket scientists,
of which there are several
in my house right now laughing at me!
Why?
I used the word "penultimate"
wrong all night.
Why would you even use that word?
Why wouldn't you just say "best"?
Do you see, Gary?
This whole thing is your fault!
Gee, stop hitting me!
What is...
We can hear you inside the house.
I'm coming in the window.
I'm coming in the door.
You two have got to stop
acting like children.
She threw pla!
She threw plates at me, Krandall!
I told him not to come in!
Enough of this! Sit down!
Don't you see what's happening here?
Whenever either of you get into trouble,
you seek each other out.
No, we don't.
You had a disastrous evening,
and you raced to allison's house.
You sought refuge in the one place
you knew he would come and look for you.
Ironically,
the way you two lean on each other now
is the very thing
that would have saved your marriage.
As your therapist, I wish
I would have discovered it earlier.
But as Allison's fiance, Gary,
back the hell off!
- I'm getting kind of sick of this!
- Calm down, Krandall.
It's like being yelled at
by one of those giant dipping birds.
I'm going back in the house.
I want you two to sit here
and think about what you've done.
And when you're ready to start acting
like adults, you can come back inside.
- Your dad's really POD.
- Stop it.
You know, I gotta tell you.
In this tiny house,
your boobs look huge.
You're just trying to get on
my good side. I'm still mad at you.
Look, inside that house
there's a great party going on.
You made all the food. You made
people happy. The house looks fantastic.
Nobody's gonna rember
that you used a word wrong.
- I know.
- You know that?
How do I know that? Your bartender's
using Jelly Jars for shot glasses.
Those people are hammered. They're
not gonna remember anything. But me
you're gonna rember
everything I did wrong.
Don't tell me you
climbed out a window again.
Yes, I did.
Do you think you rushed into
things with krandall too soon?
Are you asking me if I think you
moved too quickly with Vanessa?
Yeah, but I'm doing it in a tricky way
where you think i'm talking about you.
Well, I don't think I did, but
I knew what I was looking for.
You know what you're looking for, Gary?
That's a big question
for a little house.
When your friends didn't like me,
what did I do to fix it?
You didn't have to do anything.
I didn't care what
my friends thought of you.
Thanks.
Here's a toast to you...
The penultimate ex-wife.
It sounds like it should be good, right?
- It's got "ultimate".
- Right in it.
We actually had somebody in the bathroom
searching for you stall to stall.
I'm sorry. I panicked. I felt like
I was being ambushed in there.
Well, I warned you.
But if you would have
stuck around for 5 minutes,
you would have seen everyone turn
on ronnie and ask what happened to you.
Really? You know,
I thought that might happen.
I thought dunker and
me kind of had a vibe going.
But I asked you a question in the bar.
Do you think that we jumped
into this too fast?
Yes, I do.
But hey,
I wouldn't want it any other way.
- Really?
- Really.
- Don't want to be playing the field?
- Not if you're not in it.
You're thinking about boobs again,
aren't you?
I don't have to think about'em.
I'm feeling'em.
Team Subs-Addicts"
All right, Walter.
You are all packed for your conference.
Care to hear my opening
joke for my talk on schizophrenia?
I would love to! No, I wouldn't! Yes,
I would! No, I wouldn't! Shut up!
That's better than what I have.
Hi, Allison. I'm here for the kids.
You packed a bag! What's the matter?
Allison dumped you
for someone even older?
I'm attending a seminar for
the top mariage therapists in the state.
Well, if you guys are all there,
who is gonna stay behind
and pump force people
that have no business staying married?
OK, kids! Your dad's here!
Put the wooden dummies of yourselves in
your bed and shimmy down the air ducts.
We don't want to alert the warden.
Allison, are you sure you're gonna be
all right spending this weekend alone,
specifically saturday?
Well, of course, Walter.
Don't, don't worry about me.
The 17th is no longer Gary's
and my anniversary. Just another day.
Don't be surprised if some unexpected
feelings bubble to the surface,
you know, Anger, resentment, sadness.
Yeah. I think you mean more like Joy,
relief, freedom,
and a little bit of this.
Don't worry, Walter.
I am going to stay home. I'm gonna
put this anniversary behind me.
I'm gonna fix myself a little drink, and
read this trashy little novel
I just bought, Nadia's secret."
You should also light some candles,
you should
Draw a Bath,
you should pleasure yourself.
- By that, you don't mean.
- Yes, I do.
The point is, you have
to reclaim the 17th for Allison.
I wouldn't be surprised
if Gary wasn't experiencing some
- of these unexpected feelings himself.
- What, are you kidding me? I mean,
Gary hasn't remembered
our anniversary once in 15 years.
Why, why the hell
would he rember it now?
His subconscious may remind him.
The human mind is complex.
Yeah? Well, the Gary mind is
powered by a hamster on a wheel, so...
All right.
The kids will be down in a minute.
Don't forget the kids each
have sleepovers on saturday, the 17th.
Yeah, I know.
You told me last saturday, the tenth.
So, Gary, what exactly are
you doing this saturday, the 17th?
Why do you guys keep asking me about
saturday? What, are you gonna Rob me?
If you are, it would be kind of silly
considering all the good stuff
I used to own is here.
Louise, honey, if you get homesick
at your sleepover, call your dad, OK?
- OK, mom.
- You, too, Tommy. Call me.
And, you know, if you get drunk.
Kidding. Call a cab. Let's go.

" Gary & Allison's Restaurant "
Sub VO: ¤Aka & YaYa¤
Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way. fr]
- Harris is open. Harris is open!
- Yeah! Yes!
You hide in the pocket,
you get your bell rung, princess.
I'm a pretty Lucky guy. I got beautiful
girlfriend that brings me cold beer,
and she isn't afraid to
talk smack about brett favre.
I'd say it to his unshaven face.
- I'm a dolphins girl, remember?
- I remember.
You know, once, Allison and I went
to a dolphins game in Miami in 1996.
You and Allison?
We were down there because
her grandmother passed away,
and thank god the game
went into sudden death.
Otherwise, we would have completely
forgotten about the funeral.
Hey, dad. We're hungry.
Didn't I feed you
guys twice already today?
You guys are expensive pets,
i'll tell you that.
Well, if anyone has any objections
to Chinese food,
is suggest you try to beat
the speed dial.
How about something healthy,
something like salad or fish or.
Hi. Ming Palace?
Hi. How are you? It's Gary.
Yes. Well, thank you very much.
There's 4 of us tonight.
Well, I'll see you when you get here.
- You got to learn to talk fasterlouise.
- Sorry. I froze.
And you want to be on "jeopardy"?
How does that restaurant
know exactly what
to bring you just by
hearing your first name?
Allison and I used to order
from here all the time.
OK. I have something to say.
It's a small thing, but it's
starting to get a little irritating.
Oh, my god. Please don't be an STD.
I've made it to almost 40.
You say, "Allison and i," all the time.
Really? Should it be "Allison and me"?
Look out, look out!
No. Gary, you talk about
your ex-wife constantly.
It's kind of like she's
a part of our relationship.
I mean, all we do, we sit on the couch,
and we eat takeout food,
and we talk about stuff
that you and Allison used to do.
Then this is a big miscommunication
because I kind of thought
that's what you wanted to do.
OK. I don't mean to sound conceited,
but look at this, OK?
Look at this!
All right. Men have literally
beaten up other men for this.
Complete strangers have bought
me food and clothes and drinks.
A guy once offered me a car
if I would run through his sprinklers
in my sundress.
- What kind of car?
- My jeep.
Come on, Gary! Take me out.
You know, just show me off.
Let's just start acting
like a real couple.
I hate to break it to you.
You kind of ruined the surprise.
- What surprise?
- The surprise of the big, fancy dinner
I was gonna take you to tomorrow night.
All right. You know, you don't have to
say that just because I brought it up.
No. I was going to.
I'm really taking you out to a place.
It's I've been planning on it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
OK. Can you give me a hint?
Well, I can't I'm terrible at keeping
secrets, but I hope you like food.
See? Look. I already said too much.
Is it a cool place?
Is it a new place?
- Is it a cool, new pace?
- It is both a cool and a new place, OK,
and we will not mention anyone's name
who happens to be my ex-wife, all right?
This is gonna be so great!
I already know what i'm gonna wear, OK?
You better promise me you're
not making this up, though.
I swear on my kids'lives.
Hey, guys. Be real careful
the next couple of days, OK?
Did you swear on our lives again?
I am tired of tiptoeing
through life, dad!
Gee whiz! Help yourself, Dennis.
I'm sorry.
There's no food at my house.
- My wife started another diet today.
- Then why are you so hungry?
Well, last night at 11:58,
she went on a rampage.
She ate everything in the house.
It was horrible to watch.
There was meat on the ceiling fan.
That's awful.
The worst part is, I can't find my dog.
Hello? Hi. Is this...
How do you pronounce the name
of your restaurant? Is it plah-tay?
Really?
It's just plate?
That's the best you guys
could come up with was plate?
Well, I would like a reservation
for two for tomorrow night.
You're all booked up?
OK. What I meant to say
was i'm calling to confirm
a reservation that I already
made for tomorrow night.
Yeah. Well, I could tell you my name,
but it's probably more
fun if you guess my name.
Yeah. Hello? Hello?
I've been on the phone for two hours.
Not one restaurant in this guide
can fit me in on a saturday night?
Why did you wait until the last minute?
I've forgotten how to do this, Dennis.
You know, I haven't
gone out on a date in 15 years.
I'm out of practice.
The only restaurant I ever
used to go to was leo's with Allison.
Hey. That's what i'll do. I'll bring
Vanessa to leo's. That will be great.
No. Don't take her to leo's,
man, and don't get me wrong.
I enjoyed their left overs.
You and Allison ate there,
like, 100 times.
I know. That's why it's perfect.
The food's good, I know the maitre D',
there's no bathroom attendant
so it's free to pee. It'll be great!
And the last time I was
at leo's was a long time ago.
It was, last time I was there
was mine and Allison's anniversary.
- Oh, my gosh!
- What?
I totally forgot.
I'm an idiot.
We got to pick up the paint
for that job on arlington.
- Man, you have a great memory.
- Thank you, brother.
You know, Allison never thought so.
OK. Here's to you. The 17th,
you are no longer a day
of any significance to me whatsoever.
Except in march when you're st.
Paddy's day, OK?
OK. That's only fun with other people.
All right, Nadia.
Let's see what your big
damn secret is all about.
Here we go.
"At first glance,
the manor house appeared drab to Nadia."
"No longer a stable boy, he
had grown into a strong, handsome man."
"Tears open her bodice."
"Pulsating manhood."
"As he wept over her dying body."
For god sakes!
Now anxiety issues come in many flavors.
All right.
Whose cell phone is that?
We're very clear.
No cell phones or pagers at all.
You're asked to mute them,
to not bring them int...
Sorry. I think that's me.
This is fortuitous.
I was just about to talk
about postdivorce anxiety,
and my fiancÉe is grappling
with these issues as we speak.
So let's see if she's up
for participating
for an educational purpose.
- Allison, how are you?
- I am horrible, Walter.
Before we carry on, I need to disclose.
I lit candles,
I ran a bath, I pleasured myself.
That you are on the speakerphone.
Walter, get me off.
Do you mind?
- Allison you sound troubled.
- Walter, I don't know what to do.
I've tried to put this anniversary
thing out of my head, and I can't.
If staying at home is causing you
anxiety, leave the house,
treat yourself,
reclaim this date for yourself, Allison.
OK. I guess I could take
myself out for a night on the town.
Yes. You've got the finger
on the button of your own happiness.
Pipe down, you animals!
I'm gonna tell the
maitre d'we're here, OK?
Paulie.
Gary brooks, where the hell
have you been? How's the wife?
No, it's not me. You don't know me.
Then I'm sorry. Were full.
Please try another night.
No, Paulie.
I mean, pretend you don't know me,
pretend I've never been here before,
you know what I mean?
I understand, Gary.
Getting a little something on the side.
No, no, no.
There's nothing on the side.
What's nothing on the side?
There's no baked potatoes on
the side, side orders of baked potato.
You have to get rice pilaf, mashed,
French fries, please seat us.
- Yes. Your table's right here.
- Thank you, Paulie. Pally, pal, sir.
Here. Have.
Where'd you get the glass of wine?
At the bar from the big
screen tv king of San Diego.
King of big screen,
and all you got was a glass of wine?
"This card good for one big screen Tv."
Oh, my god. This place is so sweet.
Does this mean that leo's
is gonna be our restaurant?
Yes, this is ours, OK?
Now all we have to do is get a bird,
a flower, and
a tree and we can apply for statehood.
Can I be your first lady?
No. I'm sorry,
but you'll always be my fourth.
- Really?
- Four well, I'm a guy.
I don't expect you to rack
up those kind of numbers, but, yeah.
So far, our first grownup
date is going very beautifully.
Yes, it is,
and as promised, not one mention
of Allison, except for that one,
which I mentioned only to illustrate
the point that I'm not gonna
say Allison. That's twice. I'm sorry,
but I'm done with the Allisons.
3. Darn. Allison. There. 4. I'm sorry.
When I get nervous, I have this thing
where I have to end everything with even
numbers. Used to make Allison crazy.
Damn it! Allison.
6. I'm done.
Good.
Good. Because tonight
is about Gary and Vanessa.
And my son.
I'm sorry. I told him that I would
talk to him before bed.
- Would you excuse me?
- Of course.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here with Vanessa on a date.
You brought your girlfriend here?
To our restaurant?
- On our anniversary?
- On our what now?
Gary, it's the 17th.
- It's our anniversary.
- Yes, it is. It's our anniversary.
I know because I got you a gift online,
and it's still being shipped,
but I have a tracking number. It's 11.
Gary, we're not married.
You don't have to lie anymore.
Sorry. I can't help it.
It's like a gag reflex. Listen.
You have to get out of here.
You have to go, OK?
- I am not gonna leave. You leave.
- No. I can't leave.
I'm here with Vanessa.
You have to leave.
I promised Vanessa we would have a nice,
romantic evening together
and I wouldn't mention you once,
and that's gonna be hard to do
to do with a big, fat you sitting here.
No, Gary. I am reclaiming this
date for myself in our restaurant,
- which used to be mine by the way.
- What if Vanessa sees you?
I'll wave. I like her.
Here's the plan.
We have to keep the pretty one
from seeing the angry one, you follow?
- Take her that way.
- I will.
- Hi. How are you? Let's go!
- What's wrong?
Nothing. I just didn't like our table,
and the one I wanted finally opened up.
Look at this one. This is even better.
- This is the table that you wanted?
- Yes, it is.
- It's kind of big.
- I thought maybe we could
play ping-pong later if things got dull.
Here. Have a seat.
Don't you want to sit here so you
can see this wonderful original
art by Ralph Macchio?
I can't. You know how you
have your thing with even numbers?
I can't sit with my back
facing towards the door.
Why not? What,
is your family in the Mafia?
Don't ever ask me about my business.
Hey, look! They have paper,
and on it they write what the food is.
I have been to a restaurant,
just not one with you.
You know what? Why don't we have a.
Why don't we have a caesar salad?
- You want a caesar salad?
- I don't know.
Me, too. Me, too. Right.
To your right. Your right. There you go.
- Perfecto.
- Caesar salad for two?
Yes. That would be delightful, and
take your time. We love the pageantry.
Where are you gonna go?
You're gonna miss the pageantry.
Yeah, I know, but I left my water on
that other table, and I already squeezed
Lemon into it, and who wants
to go through that drama again?
Allison, please.
You've got to get out of here.
You can keep kids for an extra weekend.
I'll keep the kids for an extra weekend.
We can use the kids as currency
in any way you see fit. Just go, OK?
Gary, no. No.
I am. I am taking back my restaurant.
It's not your restaurant,
I'm tired of you saying
- Yes, it is!
- your restaurant. No, it's not!
May 31, 1992,
I was in here, and I bought you a drink,
and life as I knew it ended, OK?
You know what?
I'm here now, and I'm just
- gonna go look at the dessert cart.
- No. You can't go over there. Sit,
please.
Who's somebody's getting married?
Not us. No. That no.
Hey. I just. Where is she?
- She went to the ladies'room.
- And you let her?
It's kind of our policy.
You know what? That's OK.
That's good. That will give me some time
to think about what to do about Allison.
She allergic to anything,
shellfish, peanuts?
- The second one, yes.
- Peanuts?
Peanuts. No.
- Allison's heading to the ladies'room.
- That's good.
That will give me some time think about
what to do about. That did you just say?
- Both your dates are in the restroom.
- Holy moly!
Hi. Right this way.
Why are you giving me a dirty look?
I held the door for you.
Hi. How are you? You're number 34.
35? I got room for one more.
- 35?
- Sit, sit down.
That's it.
I'm finished. It's over.
So you think the missus
is gonna give you a divorce?
No. I am divorced, Paulie. I've been
divorced. I was here with
my new girlfriend. Well, she was my
girlfriend up until about a minute ago.
That's your girlfriend?
What did you take her here for?
I could have gotten you into plate.
My brother's the maitre D'.
Come on!
Hey! I.
- I owe you an apology.
- Why?
Didn't anything weird
happen in the bathroom?
Nothing I wasn't expecting.
Nothing unusual went
down while you were in there?
I feel like we should preserve
some of the romance, don't you?
Yes, yes.
Let's get out of here, OK? What?
Let's, let's go somewhere else.
This isn't right. I would like to take
you someplace
that really is special to me, OK?
The maitre D'was sweating
in the caesar salad.
You know what? I totally flaked
on the Bill. I'm gonna go pay it, OK?
- Do you need money for the valet?
- You're adorable.
That's right. I forgot. Hot chicks
don't have to pay for anything.
You're welcome.
Did you say anything to her in there?
I didn't say anything. I saw her fe.
Why didn't you say anything to her?
I thought your mission in life
was to destroy me.
Look, Gary. She has a hard enough
time as it is dating you, all right?
She doesn't need me to pile on.
Besides, I was.
I was kind of touched
you remembered may 31, 1992.
I'll never forget may 31,
1992, because I was in here,
and I saw the most beautiful woman I
had ever seen walk through those doors.
And then you came in right behind her.
- Of course.
- No, Allison.
You had some great points,
too, you know?
You had your Julia Roberts
hair and those
big, Puffy Demi Moore shoulder pads.
I was way out of your league, you know?
You may have been out of my league,
but I totally got inside your uniform.
Thanks for rembering the day at least.
- That's really sweet.
- Of course. May 31.
- How could I forget?
- So how is it related to sports?
Joe Namath's birthday.
Yeah. I tried making reservations
at other places like plate,
saucer, bowl.
They were all booked up.
You mad?
That you took me to a restaurant
that you and your ex-wife used to go to
and that she was there
and it was your anniversary?
So we're OK then?
Gary, I really like you,
but you're not divorced yet.
Oh, yes, I am.
I have half my stuff to prove it.
No. You're divorcing.
There's a big difference.
You know, you still haven't
disconnected from Allison,
and you're not gonna be ready
for a real relationship until you do.
Are you giving me the heave-ho?
Heave-ho is such an ugly
and nautical way to put it,
but maybe we should slow things down,
you know, see other people.
- You need to go exploring, man.
- Can we can we stay friends?
- Of course.
- With benefits?
Like what? Dental?
We could start. You know what?
Get your taco. Let's get out of here.
- Let's, let's leave.
- What the hell?
- It's not what you think, Dennis.
- You said this was our place.
- Sorry.
- No chicks.
- I know.
- I can't here,
I can't eat at home,
I can't find my dog.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Thank you for finding my cell phone.
I was looking every where for it.
Yeah. I called you to tell you,
but you didn't pick up.
19 messages?
Yeah. I thought maybe there'd be,
like, a reward involved,
so I just kept hammering away at it.
Listen.
Now that we agreed to start seeing other
people, are you seeing other people?
- Do you really want to know that?
- Yeah, I want to know that.
I don't want to know that.
You know, I've got some worse news.
You know that party you were
going to have at my bar on sunday?
Yeah, the annual Gary's
housepainting party.
That's where I drum up all my business
by kissing all my clients'butts,
So why did you say
like it's not happening?
- Because it's not happening.
- What talking about? It's next sunday.
Somebody came in, and he reserved
the whole bar for a private party.
I reserved the whole
bar for a private party.
Yeah, but he put down a credit card.
You put down a fiver.
Hey, kids. All right.
Who's ready for 2
straight days of nonstop,
in-your-face laying around and
doing nothing and probably lots of math?
Louise, honey,
please make sure something
intelligent happens
here this weekend, OK?
I'm like Jane goodall, mom.
I'm only here to observe the apes.
Hey, Vanessa.
I didn't expect to see you here.
You guys... you back on?
Why would you say that?
Are you breaking up with me?
- Thanks a lot, Allison.
- What? What? Wait. Wait. Wait.
You guys are teasing me. Great.
OK. Good. Very nice.
Very nice. Thank you. I'm sorry.
I couldn't resist.
Bye, Gary.
I'm sorry about your party.
Yeah. You, too.
What party?
What party? The annual Gary's
housepainting party. Remember?
God, I am so glad I don't have to
have that party at my house this year.
Can I have that party
at your house this year?
- What? No.
- Please. Please, come on.
All the contractors think you're hot,
and all the interior decorators
think you're... fabulous!
- Please.
- OK, under one condition.
No. I hate "one condition."
Look, you have to go with
me up to big bear next weekend.
Beth and Jim are renewing
their wedding vows.
No, I don't. Because you got Beth
and Jim in the divorce.
I got the corn holders.
You mean donna and PJ.?
No, not the kornholters.
The actual corn holders, the little
mini corn that you plug
into the regular big corn...
- Corn holders.
- Gary, yeah, I got it. Look.
You have to go. I mean, Beth is one
of our oldest and dearest friends.
Oldest and dearest friend? What are
you talking about? Every time you guys
are together, you just backstab
each other and bicker and fight.
That's what girlfriends do, Gary. Jeez.
You don't know women at all, do you?
Look, Gary,
we were in their original wedding party.
I mean, if we don't go,
it's gonna send a message
we no longer are interested
in their happiness.
I'm Gary Brooks,
and I approved that message.
All right. Well, good luck having
your party here.
I hope your guests enjoy their
hot pockets and frosted flakes.
All right. You know what?
You win. OK. I'll go with you.
OK. Good. Good. I will pick
you up at 5:00. Don't be late.
Have your bag packed.
And for god's sakes, don't wear shorts.
I hate when your legs
sweat all over my car seat.
- Didn't we already take this drive?
- What?
For, like, 15 years?
- = 108 = -

[Sub-way. fr]
This is a nice room. You know, if mine's
not this nice, we're gonna switch.
- About that.
- Hey, what are you doing?
I told people. They know I'm here, and
the ex-wife is always the first suspect.
Gary, I don't want you to overreact,
but I need you to do something for me,
and you're not going to like it.
All right, but we got to go really
fast because I want to get in the pool.
You say "really fast" like you
do it any other way. So, I mean...
No, we...
we have to share a room.
Really? Why?
Are they all sold out?
Beth and Jim and everyone
here still think we're married.
- Good-bye.
- No, come on. Come on, Gary.
- What?
- You know my relationship with Beth.
I can't have her gloat all weekend about
how she's still married and I'm not.
OK. Hi. She is still married,
and you're not.
I'm leaving.
Alli, are you in there? It's Beth.
Hang on, Beth!
Hey, Gary, honey, let go of me!
I'm trying to answer the door!
Please, Gary.
Look, if you do this, not only can
you have your party at my house, but
I will cook, and I will flirt,
and I will guarantee you 6 new jobs.
- 8. 8. 8.
- 6. 6. 7.
- 50.
- What? No. Fine.
Fine. Fine. 8. Fine. 8. But...
But remember,
we're madly in love, OK?
And we're
totally into each other and we can't
keep our hands off each other, OK?
I thought we were supposed
to act like we're married.
You guys,
what are you doing in there?
Just coming. Hang on.
OK, here. Do you...
Promise to pretend
- to be my husband?
- I do.
It's so nice when dolphins meet.
Look at you, gorgeous lady.
Me gorgeous?
Look at you. You look great.
You have lost almost
all your baby weight.
Thanks. Louise is 11.
Yeah, you look fabulous, too.
Looks like you've really been enjoying
life, you know, out there in the
wind and the sun.
- So, Gary, how's the painting business?
- It's going good.
Actually, I just signed
a contract to get 8 new jobs.
Could you stop?
Just stop doing that...
Because it's turning me on so much,
and I don't...
I don't want be tired at the party from
all the sex we're going to be having.
Right. Well, listen,
everybody's down at the bar.
So why don't you two
come join us down there after
- you've had a chance to... settle in.
- Way in.
- You reckon?
- Yeah. You got it, sweetie.
Our Molly is in every gifted
class the school has to offer.
We are so proud.
That is great. You know, our Louise
is in every gifted class, too.
Did I tell you she was
contacted by NASA?
You mean that flyer
she got from space camp?
They don't just give them to anybody.
I thought they did. It was on our
windshield after a dodgers game.
Hey, you sexy man, would you
go get us another round of drinks?
- God, yes. That's a good idea.
- Thank you, gar bear.
You're welcome, all-batross.
You know, I'll go with you.
I'll be right back honey.
No, I don't think...
Okey-dokey.
Stuart, you guys couldn't
get out of this thing either?
No, but my wife had to agree
to let me have a weekend
in Vegas by myself,
no questions asked.
All right.
I got a lecture about how
I'm Lucky to have anything at all.
Hey, guys, look who showed up.
Boy. Leslie Martin.
She looks great.
Probably because she's divorced.
She and glen split up last year.
She looks even better than imagine
her when I'm having sex with my wife.
You know what I'm going to do, guys?
I'm going to do something I did
not have the nerve to do 15 years ago.
I'm going to go over just,
there and stand there and not say
anything until it becomes so awkward
that she finally says hi to me.
Gary Brooks.
Hey, Leslie. I didn't even see you here.
That's crazy.
- It's been forever.
- Hey, sorry to hear about you and glen.
You know what I miss
most about being married?
- What?
- Absolutely nothing. Divorce awesome!
- That's great.
- How's Allison?
- Who?
- Your wife, Allison.
We split up...
the driving
on the way here. We split it up.
She... she drove to riverside,
and then I took over.
I'm glad you're here.
You want to buy me a drink?
- They're free.
- Just like me.
Poor Gary. So nice of him
to talk to Leslie like that.
Can't imagine anything
more sad than being divorced.
I don't know. What about throwing
a party in honor of yourself maybe?
Look at him,
staring into her eyes and hanging
on every little word she says.
Yeah. Well, that's my Gary.
He's a great listener.
Looks like he'd like
to listen her brains out.
This is ridiculous.
You're making me wear pajamas?
Is it OK that I'm going commando,
or should I go back
and put on some pull-ups?
I'm going to watch some Tv.
What's the matter, Allison?
- Nothing.
- Really?
Then why are you doing
that angry page-turn?
I don't know what you're
talking about, Gary.
- Then what was that?
- Coupon.
OK. As long as nothing's wrong,
I'll drop it.
- Nothing's wrong.
- OK. Great.
What the hell was with you and Leslie?
- I knew it.
- Everybody knew it, Gary.
You were flirting with her all night.
You're supposed to be married.
- Are you jealous?
- Of course not, Gary.
I just don't want
you to blow my cover.
I mean, admit it, you were, like,
in full-on flirt mode, with the
dancing and joking
and chewing with your mouth closed.
I mean, when was the
last time you did that?
I'm surprised you even noticed
any of that. I mean, were
spending the whole time trying
to one-up Beth. It was embarrassing.
One time you told her
tommy has no cavities.
Well, he doesn't.
And their son, Joey, Braces. Yeah.
Look, Gary, the point is,
please, would you stay away from Leslie?
- You took a vow.
- I didn't take a vow. I took a deal.
Look. You know what? If you still
want to have your party at my house,
you have to remember
you and I are married.
You know what? I don't know
how you managed this, Allison,
but somehow being married to you this
time is worse than it was the last time.
I'm going to the vending machine,
and I'm going to get ice.
And I'm only making one trip.
So if you want anything,
you got to tell me now.
Do you want anything?
You want some pretzels?
You want, like...
A nutter butter or something?
Some cheese crackers?
Peanut butter crackers?
You want, like, a Kit-kat,
Snickers, Beechnut gum?
Maybe... All right.
- Bring me something with coconut.
- Too late.
Hey, Leslie. Hi.
I'm just going to get ice.
Some inconsiderate person
just took the last of it.
- Your bucket's all full.
- I know. It was me.
I hear good things
about your son's teeth.
Allison thinks i'm at the ice machine.
The machine's empty.
We've got 20 min, a half-hour tops.
That's great.
I can do it, like, 5 times.
- Wait. Hold on a second. This is crazy.
- I know. It's so wrong. I love it!
No. I promised Allison
I would be faithful this weekend.
Just this weekend?
Yes, which is ridiculous, because
I just broke up with my girlfriend, so
- this weekend would have been perfect.
- You have a girlfriend?
Had. I had a girlfriend.
Now I don't have a girlfriend.
So I'm not really cheating on anyone,
except my wife.
- Get on the bed.
- OK. I'll get on the!
It's OK.
This bed should have a warning track.
Why can't you ever
remember your key, for...
- Hey, Beth. I thought you were.
- Gary?
- Yeah.
- I'm not.
Well, yeah. I see.
Where is Gary?
He went to get me something
out of the vending machine.
That's nice. I bet he's getting
a little something for himself, too.
Hey, let's go see Leslie. It'll be fun.
What happened here?
It looks like 2 people with
ice buckets crashed into each other.
I wonder where the bodies are.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
You're good at it. Trust me.
No, I can't. I'm jeopardizing the thing
that's the most important to me.
Of course.
Your marriage.
No. This party I'm having sunday night.
Leslie, yoo-hoo. It's Beth and Allison.
- Hey, you guys.
- I've got to get out of here.
- What are you doing in there?
- Nothing.
Just trying to sneak some guy
out of my room.
Why would you say that? That's cra...
you're being sarcastic. That's good.
OK. I have to go.
You know what?
Maybe we should just leave her alone.
It sounds like she's with someone.
Did you hear a man's voice?
Hey, you guys. What's up?
We just wanted to
see what you were up to.
Well, Beth did mostly. I was in bed
when Gary got up to get some ice...
Cream sandwiches.
You haven't seen him, have you, Leslie?
There he is.
- Gary, I thought you were...
- Getting snacks for Allison? I was.
You're covered in leaves.
Wicked leaf fight with the best western
across the street. We kicked their ass.
- Well, good night, you guys.
- We're going to go make some love!
- Were you over in Leslie's room?
- Yes. I was waiting for ice to be made.
- What did you do, just out her window?
- I had to jump out a window.
I almost got caught red-handed
doing nothing wrong by my pretend wife.
Gary. Now Beth thinks there's
something wrong with our marriage.
Something's wrong with our marriage?
I'm always the last to know.
What do you care what Beth thinks?
She's a creep, that lady.
- She's like a comic-book villain.
- Beth is the one person
who, from the beginning,
said that we wouldn't make it,
and we didn't. OK? I didn't want to give
her the satisfaction of being right.
- You're kicking me out?
- Yeah, Gary,
and just like the last time,
you're asking me if I'm kicking you out.
My gosh. Easy.
I can't believe you, Gary.
I asked you to do one
tiny thing this weekend.
You couldn't do it.
I knew I couldn't count on you.
And just as I did 15 years ago,
i'd like to repronounce
Beth and Jim husband and wife.
Where's Gary?
He had to leave late last night.
One of his paint trucks exploded.
It was horrible, but beautiful...
But horrible.
Thank you for coming, everybody.
We're so happy you were
able to share this with us.
And I know some of
you have been asking.
Yes, this is the same
dress I wore 15 years ago.
For god's sakes.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- What are you doing here?
I'm here to let you know
I'm not going to let you down.
You know what? Forget it, Gary. There's
nothing you can say to make up to me.
Really? Could I have
everybody's attention, please?
- What are you doing?
- Gary, you snuck in.
You're pretty good at sneaking around.
Beth, remember when you
were cheerleading in college and
you always wanted to know who was that
hit you in the face with that peach?
Well, I'd like to come clean.
It was a nectarine.
But watching Beth and Jim Renew
their vows has really
inspired me, and I would like
to Renew my vows
- with Allison right now.
- No, no, we wouldn't.
We're real good. Allison.
- Look, I can't stand you.
- I can't stand...
Here and act like
the times that we've spent together
haven't been the best, because
- they have.
- I will kill you.
And Allison would kill me if
I didn't mention the fact that our house
is amazing. She keeps it immaculate.
And we have our 2 beautiful children.
Tommy, of course,
with his mouthful of flawless teeth,
and
flight commander Louise H. Brooks.
- Shove a sock in it.
- You know, the Russian poet
shovasockinit,
he,
he said love, like vodka,
should flow freely between
2 lovers. And that's what it's
like with me and Allison.
And I know when we first got together,
some of you were doubters, Beth,
and... but here we are.
We're still here.
We're still married. We're still
very much in love. And Allison,
if I've done anything
to disappoint you, even
something recently,
i'm sorry, and I just...
I won't let you down.
That's all I got.
They want us to kiss.
Yeah, I should have
thought this through more.
All right. Let me handle it.
Everybody.
We're divorced.
What?
It has been 7 wonderful months.
In fact,
I am already engaged to a doctor.
So... i'm sorry.
I didn't want everyone
to know about me and Gary.
But now that you do,
- the truth feels good.
- Allison, you're divorced?
I'm so sorry.
- We're divorced, too.
- Oh my god!
I wasn't supposed to say that.
We still sleep together
on occasion, though. You know...
I probably wasn't supposed
to say that either.
Anyway, thanks, Allison.
We're in therapy.
We're not divorced, but things
are looking pretty bad right now.
Thank you, Allison.
Would everyone please stop
thanking Allison for being divorced.
I thought we all knew each other
enough that we didn't have
- to lie about who we are.
- I'm gay.
I'm sorry. I came out
to Beth about 6 weeks ago, but,
we still love each other, aénd
we had already paid
for all the floral arrangements...
Which I designed.
And
Beth is dealing with this new and
exciting chapter of our lives. And...
come on.
How many of you aren't surprised?
Jim, would you help me
outside for some air, please?
Honey. Listen, everybody the bar's open,
OK? And we'll be right back.
And also... i am dating a doctor.
- Well...
- Well, good for him.
Hey, you didn't have to come here
and rescue me, you know.
I wasn't here to rescue you.
I was here to fulfill my marital duties.
Plus...
i hate when people pick on you.
I always have.
What are you talking about?
You did for 15 years.
Yeah, but I'm, like, really good at it.
Let's get a drink.
So...
The Russian poet Shovasockinit?
Yeah. You know,
his muse was his wife, Oftenisabitch.
- Gary, we got a 3-hour drive.
- All right.
We're leaving.
Yeah. Me, too. I just want to get back
home and put this all behind me.
Pretty crazy weekend.
So, I hear your daughter
is in the space program.
Yeah. We're very proud of her.
Hey, Gar. I'm gonna be in the car.
I'll see you in 5 minutes?
Team Subs-Addicts"
Brooks is at the 20.
He's at the 15.
There's only one more man to beat.
Hi. Are you enjoying yourself?
Well, I was at first, and
then I realized the man I was married
to for 15 years was trying
to score with a dead, frozen animal.
How do you think I feel 15 years having
to sleep with a dead, frozen animal?
Very nice. Very nice.
All right, Gary, i'm gonna let that go,
but I do want to ask you one thing.
Please. Why are you being so stubborn?
Just come to my house
for Thanksgiving with the kids.
No. Thanksgiving is at my house this
year. You agreed to it Allison. Come on.
Yes, I know, but seriously, Gary,
are you going to attempt
to roast a turkey?
I mean, we both know you're not capable
of putting together a thanksging dinner.
OK, I think I am capable, and that's
what scares the stuffing out of you.
Yeah. I bet you can't even tell me
what goes in stuffing.
Everything in this box...
With either water or something
called chicken stock. It's my choice.
- Anybody home?
- It's my dad!
That means he got past
the dogs at the airport.
- Hey, dad!
- Hey, Gary.
Your kids are just growing up so fast.
Yeah. They're amazing, man.
You should see them put away groceries.
- They're like artists, really.
- Thanks, dad.
I'm glad you appreciate the effort.
Come on, Louise.
Let's go put away groceries.
That was a con, you Dummy.
- And you.
- Hi, Jack.
How you doing?
Boy.
I hate to say it in front of my son,
but divorce suits you.
Well, I hate to say it in front of your
son, too, but I've never been happier.
This is nice, a little laugh
between the man who gave me life
and the woman who destroyed it.
Come on, Jack.
What have you been doing?
Well, I...
I've been traveling. Yeah?
I was shacked up with
an eskimo woman for a while.
You know, the eskimo people, they
have 100 different words for "get out."
- You want to show me to my room?
- OK.
Here we are.
- I'm sleeping on the couch?
- No. You're not sleeping on the couch.
I bought you a bed, my man.
Daddy, look at this?
An air mattress. Great.
Where do I dig my latrine?
You know, Jack, your room
is still available over at my house.
- Really?
- No, no. Maybe, but no.
My dad's staying here
with me and the kids.
You still got that shower
that gets you everywhere at once?
Yeah, I do.
'Cause two weeks in Baja, and
I'm still carrying a lot of beach on me.
I have a shower here, too, dad.
You know what?
I also had to replace that old bed with
a nice pillow-top mattress, and
I promise not to say a word if you want
to burn your incense.
That's OK, Allison. Look, my father
is staying here for Thanksgiving.
The kids are staying
here for Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving
is staying here for Thanksgiving.
The only thing that's not staying
here for Thanksgiving is you. Bye.
OK. OK, Gary.
But the offer stands, Jack,
and I know that my mom
would love to see you.
Wait a minute.
The exquisite Connie is there?
I should have let mano shave my back.
Vanessa pulled up out back, dad.
Hey, that's my friend. She's super hot.
And I told her you're not blind,
so don't do the
"I'm just shaking your hands" gag.
No. It's Parker.
You don't have to play
with Parker, Tommy,
but you do have to be
nice to Vanessa's son, OK?
I know that, but he always hits me.
- That's his age.
- In the testicles.
Hey, my dad's here.
You want to meet him?
Yeah. Great.
How are you going to introduce us?
I'll tell him you're a friend of mine,
we used to date,
and every once in a while,
you call me just to have sex.
I do not!
I know, but I'm just letting you know,
that is on the table.
Louise, where's grandpa?
He left with mom.
He said our water pressure was too low
to get all the sand
out of pirate's cove.
Oh, my gosh. She stole my dad.
She lured him away with the promise
of a mattress and a sandless crack.

- Honey.
- What?
Your pie seems a little dry.
Did Gary like dry pie?
Mom, I don't know.
You're gonna have to ask Gary, OK?
I can't. You drove him away.
I did not drive him away, OK?
I mean, why can't you just be happy
for me now that I've found Walter?
I am,
but your fiance seems a little.
Now, how do I say this politely.
Antiquey.
Mom, he is a brilliant therapist,
and he is handsome and caring,
and he's only 15 years older than me.
I told your father he should have
hugged you more as a teenager, but...
Your little breasts frightened him.
- What did I do now?
- Withheld affection from your daughter,
darling, but you're a scratch
golfer now, so it was worth it.
Now, Allie knows I love her?
Don't you, alligator?
Of course. Of course I do.
There it is. OK. There it is. OK.
Yes, Walter, it's a hell of a fish tank.
Thank you. I toyed with the
idea of becoming a marine biologist,
but we Krandalls are
not a buoyant people.
There's a common expression in sweden.
**(Suedois)**
Which means
"to sink like a Krandall."
Charlie, you rushed right past us. Come
back in. I just got some whistler crabs.
You know, they have a cream for that.
Do we have any beer?
Charlie, you do not need a beer.
It dulls your senses.
You're right. I'm gonna
eat turkey and take a nap later.
I better be on my toes.
- I see the beer.
- Like a menopausal Superman.
Connie, is it possible you
get younger every time I see you?
I don't know, Jack.
Is it possible you're stoned?
It's always possible.
One of the biggest
football days of the year,
and you replaced
the television with an aquarium.
This is every bit
as entertaing as football.
Look! A box fish just swam
through the Fiji finger coral.
That's the Marine equivalent
of a touchdown right there.
Which one of those fish
would kill me if I ate it?
All right!
You watching the Dallas game?
No, no, no, but we just watched
a carp take a dump underwater.
First of all, a carp
is a freshwater fish. Second of all,
all fish eliminate waste underwater,
so it's funny on two levels.
- You really don't have to try so hard.
- Sorry. Dad?
- So, Gary, what do you want?
- I want my dad back, Allison.
What? I got in the car to come back
here, and he jumped in all excited,
like we were going to the dog park.
Come on, Allison. With all the
hot shower talk and the pillow-top
bed and the liberal incense policy,
you sold this place
like it was Woody Harrelson's
bed and breakfast.
Gary, if you want to be with your dad,
then just bring the kids over,
and we'll have Thanksgiving dinner here.
No, Allison,
you're not stealing my Thanksgiving. No.
I am not taking a jacuzzi
with you, Jack.
Connie, it's a soak in a hot tub,
not an invite to burning man.
- Hi Gary.
- Hi honey, good to see you.
Connie and I are about to take a jacuz.
I am not taking a jacuzzi!
Dad, what are you doing? Get in the car.
Let's go back my house.
That's where Thanksgiving is this year.
Come on, Gar. Why don't
you just bring the kids over here?
- You putting on your bathing suit?
- I am not putting on a bathing suit!
Far out!
All right. You win, Allison.
We should have
Thanksgiving here. I'll go get the kids,
and I'll bring them over, all right?
You see? Was that so hard?
I mean, look. I mean, you try,
but Thanksgiving is what I do.
Can we still have our touch football
game at my house with the kids?
Of course.
Would you do me a favor?
Would you get Louise's sneakers for me?
- Yeah. I'll be right back.
- OK. Thank you.
Sure.
I'm just looking at the beers.
Like little puppies in a window.
I think the little sad
one is my favorite.
Charlie, I'm not gonna lie to you.
I have so much imported
beer in my refrigerator,
I barely have any room
for all the domestic beer I just bought.
I could really use a drinker.
Well, that's tempting, but if I left,
Connie would cut off my giblet bag.
Come to my house.
Come to my house, Charlie.
The second half of the Dallas game
is about to start.
I have a bird in the oven,
a 42-inch flat screen, no fish.
- I'll be in the car.
- Atta boy!
- Gary, this place is great.
- Yeah. It's small, but it's crappy.
And it smells like a bar.
You know, it didn't come that way.
I had to do that all by myself.
My place is like an Indiana Jones movie.
You touch the wrong thing, and you got
this great big boulder bitching at you.
So you eat in here?
Yeah, almost every day,
right in front of the Tv.
Hey, one time,
I had this big thing of ice cream,
and I went up to bed and I forgot about
it, then came down the next morning,
I picked up that sucker,
and I drank it like a giant Malt.
I will rember that story
for the rest of my life.
Vanessa and I beat the boys at football.
Parker was my teammate. He kept trying
to attack him, dad. He doesn't get it.
You told me to attack the guy
with the ball. You had the ball.
My bad.
I'm never having kids!
Oh, my god.
- Hey, sweetie.
- You'll scare it away.
- Charlie, this is my friend Vanessa.
- Hi. You must be Gary dad.
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not. You're Allison's.
Whatever.
- Are you gonna be able to join us?
- I'm all sweaty from football.
I'm gonna go upstairs and
hit the showers, but
save me a beer, and I'll be back
down to watch the game.
You are the greatest man who ever lived.
I'll drink to that.
Let's freshen up our beers. Or
is it time to tap the Pony Keg?
I'm not crying.
I just got some pretzel salt in my eyes.
- Dad, what the hell are you doing?
- Having the best day of my life.
Get in the car.
I'm taking you back. Come on.
Hey, Charlie, I found these two
20-ounce belgian beers way in the back.
They're pretty cold. Sorry about
all the frost clinging to the glass.
Dad, we're going.
- I don't think so, alligator.
- Yeah. He doesn't think so, alligator.
Dad, mom has been looking for you,
Walter is afraid he offended you,
and I haven't seen Jack since he took
the screen out of the kitchen faucet,
grabbed an apple,
and ran out the back door.
Sounds like things are really
falling apart at your house, Allison.
Wouldn't it be so much easier
if everyone just came over here?
Gary's got a beautiful turkey
in the oven. You should see it.
Hey, that reminds me.
I got to go baste my bird.
And check the turkey.
That's a good one. I like that.
You know, dad, with Gary cooking,
there's not gonna be any dinner.
Hey, if he doesn't run out of
"i don't care" juice, I don't care.
Look, Gary, don't worry. It's not ea...
- Who made that for you?
- I made it.
Look at this. It is beautiful.
It should be on the cover
of "better homes than Allison" magazine.
What? Oh, my gosh.
You can actually hear the flavor.
Listen. "I'm delicious."
"In your face."
"I'm delicious."
Stop playing with your stupid bird and
tell my dad he's coming back with me.
Look, you know what? Your dad's a grown
man. He can do whatever he wants.
But whenever you want to exchange
your hostage for my guest, call me.
A Charlie,
why don't you put your feet up? Relax.
Really?
It does look comfortable.
You want to go really crazy?
Take your shoes off first.
Nice. Nice.
This is so wrong.
This is so wrong.
Hey, it's been 20 minutes.
I have to go baste Lucille.
And check your turkey.
All right.
Lucille! Oh, my gosh.
OK. Honey? Lucille?
Allison was in here,
but I didn't see Allison leave.
Allison ate my turkey.
No, no. Allison stole my turkey.
What have you done with my bird?!
Where's my turkey? Where's Lucille?
Who is this?
Don't you play games with me.
You know who this is. I want my turkey!
Your turkey is safe, for now.
It's cooking at an undisclosed location.
Is that how you're
gonna play this, Allison?
Have my dad back at my house
in a half an hour,
or the temperature in the oven goes up
15 degrees for every minute he's late.
You wouldn't dare.
You have no idea what
i'm capable of, Gary.
Bring hiback,
and no one gets overcooked.
Honey, I wasn't snooping, but I was
looking through your underwear drawer.
Mom!
Well, somebody's got to tell you this.
Men don't like granny panties.
- They like the t-back thong, like this.
- like this.
Jack, you weren't supposed to see that.
Well, I did.
I'm downloading it to my hard drive.
OK, before I vomit into my yams, could
you please finish setting the table?
Allison, I got your father in my car.
You know, I had to tell the guy
we were going to a strip club
just to get him out of the house.
- He has to be inside the house, Gary.
- How do I know my bird's OK?
- Please, Gary. Grow up.
- Grow up? You stole my turkey.
- You stole my dad.
- That's because you stole my dad.
But you wouldn't
bring the kids over here.
Should I rinse these, or are we going
for a summer camp vibe?
Gary, you said you were just
popping in to get your VIP Card.
- Charlie, where have you been?
- With Gary,
drinking bear, eating salty snacks,
and putting my feet on furniture.
Hey, Connie,
I put our place cards together,
so right now my spoon
is touching your fork.
- Hi, son.
- Hi, Traitor.
Hold everything.
You put your feet on the furniture?!
Yes, and from now on,
that's how i'm gonna roll.
- Not in my house.
- You're damned right.
I'm moving out.
I want to get a place like Gary's.
- What?
- What?
Score!
You see what you did, Gary?
You happy now?
- What's going on here?
- Today
is Charlie Carswell's Independence Day.
And I will celebrate it every year!
My dad wants a divorce.
This is a marriage counseling emergency.
Mom, dad, I have an opening
a week from tuesday!
Damn it, Gary.
This all your fault. Why couldn't just
bring the kids over the first place?
- What it has to do with anything?
- You would have been here.
You would have gotten my mom off my back
and kept my dad entertained,
You would have taken him to football.
Hold on a second.
This is makes sense to me now.
This isn't about you thinking
I can't handle Thanksgiving.
The real fact of the matter is, you
can't handle Thanksgiving without me.
- That is ridiculous. There's one thing
If there's one thing I don't need,
it's you.
What is that?
Oh, god, Gary! The fire!
All right. Dad, come in here!
How many times do I have to tell you.
- Don't put towels next to the flame.
- You know what? Thanks a lot.
- I can handle it.
- No really, you can't handle it.
Like I would ever depend on your
for anything, like, ever again, Gary.
Gary! I cut my foot. Please help me!
- This is a giant cut here, kiddo.
- You're gonna need some stitches.
- Your dinner.
- Thanks, mom.
A lot of blood down there.
Feeling woozy.
- Walter, you're pale as a ghost.
- Actually, he's always that way.
Krandall,
put your head between your legs.
- This is not a time for insults, Gary!
- It'll keep you from passing out.
Sorry. With our history, I thought
you meant something else entirely.
Hey, Charlie, pull the car around, OK?
We got to take her to the hospital.
All right.
- Beer?
- Sure.
You want to see my underwear?
They're stitching her up now.
You know, they said that's their fourth
yam-related accident tonight.
- Thanksgiving. Who knew?
- Yeah. The holidays are nuts.
Don't get divorced, Charlie.
I mean, you're gonna lost
half your stuff, half your money,
and no matter what, your wife is
still gonna find a way to yell at you.
You seem to be managing just fine.
Yeah, that's on the outside,
but when I'm home alone, on the inside,
I get pretty sad, and I cry a lot.
- Really?
- No. It's awesome.
Thank you.
Hey, alligator, how you doing?
Great. I got a couple of stitches
in my foot,
my dinner is ruined,
my parents are getting divorced,
and I got to hear a woman with a gunshot
wound break up with her boyfriend, but
not because of the gunshot wound.
Well, I'm not leaving your mother.
I was just blowing off steam.
Thanks, dad.
- There we go. There it is.
- I'll go get the car.
How you doing there, hot wheels?
I'm so mad at myself for calling
out your stupid name when I cut my foot.
My fiance's a doctor,
my dad's a doctor, and I what do I do?
I call for a painter I don't even like.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You called for me by default, you know?
Your mom was drunk,
my dad was high, Krandall was Woozy,
and let's be honest, your dad's a
chiropractor. That doesn't really count.
I just...
I wasn't prepared for how hard this
first holiday was gonna be, you know?
Yeah. The whole day was kind of weird.
Weird? I stole a turkey, Gary.
I'm not proud of that.
Look, I wasn't really
ready to do without you either,
because you're the only one that
knows the way I like my pumpkin pie.
Dry.
I just, I just don't think
we've been apart long enough
for me to get through the holidays,
you know, without us all being together.
You have the kids for Christmas.
I could come by with them.
No. I'll probably be ready by then.
OK, that's fine, then, isn't it?
This was a darn good dinner, everybody.
Can a brother get
a gobble-gobble for the turkey?
Gobble-gobble!
Gobble-gobble!
Well, I would like to thank
everybody for salvaging what they could
from my kitchen and
bringing it over here.
And I would like to thank Connie
for being my wife.
Well, thanks, chuckles.
Put your shoes on.
We're not hillbillies.
Why is grandpa Jack always eating?
He just has a good appetite, Tom, OK?
Then why does his shirt
smell like my art teacher?
- That's incense, Tom.
- Killer incense.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Hey. Hi, Allison. I'm here for the kids.
- What. What is that?
- 24,000 nickels.
What?
I stopped at an Indian casino
on the way home from work last night.
- And I hit a jackpot.
- Well...
Congratulations.
Now get them out of my sink.
No. This is your alimony payment.
To the nickel, and it's early.
You're welcome.
- Kids, daddy's here! Let's go!
- Wait a minute.
You expect me to accept
my spousal support in nickels?
Yeah. I mean, you could take
it back to the casino and ask for Bills.
Why wouldn't you do
that when you were there?
Cause Bills are light and they bend.
And nickels are heavy and hilarious.
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, sweetie. Wide load.
I'm so glad you talked
me out of playing the flute, mom.
Louise, honey, you will thank
me for introducing you to the cello.
Here you go.
Well, if I ever need to
dispose of a body, I'll be ready.
I'll be out in a minute, guys.
You think maybe I can
drive the car to school?
I've seen you play Grand Theft Auto.
And until you can operate a vehicle
without jumping the curb and killing
a pimp, I have to say "no."
Can I have the kids next thursday?
I need to know right now. 12 seconds.
Thurs... well thursday...
10 seconds, tell me now.
I'll let you have them on wednesday.
- You're freaking me out, i'm scared!
- What?! Yes! Yes!
OK. OK. Come on.
- What happened?
- Come on. OK. Allison, steady. Steady.
I did it, yeah! I did it!
No wonder I could never find your
G-spot. It's in the Palm of your hand.
- What was that all about?
- I was bidding online
for concert tickets for me and the kids.
And I scored.
- You're taking them to a concert?
- Yeah. Michael Bolton.
Michael Bolton?!
I knew it. I knew it. You hate the kids.
It's 'cause they ruined your body,
isn't it?
I knew you were going to have
a problem with this.
I have a problem with it. Their first
concert shouldn't be Michael Bolton.
I'm sure Michael Bolton's a nice guy
and from outerspace looks like
a human being of sorts.
But come on, I mean, if I knew
that's why you wanted to switch days,
I wouldn't have agreed to it.
Why shouldn't this be their first
concert? I mean, I love Michael Bolton.
Remember? I played a CD in the delivery
room when I gave Birth to Louise.
That's why they had to put a suction cup
on her head and pull her out of you.
Well, Gary, it's too late.
Our divorce agreement states that once
we agree to switch nights, it's final.
Isn't there also a stipulation
in the divorce agreement
that we can switch back in the event
of a Michael Bolton concert?
I can't deal with this. OK? You told me
I could have the kids. That's it.
I'm taking them to the concert.
Discussion over.
Look who it is. It's Lance Armstrong's
great-great-grand father.
You ready for our bike ride?
Yeah. As soon as I get
Gary out of here. Come on.
Shall I throw his favorite ball
out the door
and close it after he gives chase?
You know what Krandall?
Here. Have some nickels.
I bet nickels were popular
when you were a lad. You can go...
Go to a picture show.
Get yourself some bread.
Maybe buy war bonds
for the boys overseas.
Over there, over there
those are way too tight, Krandall.

[Sub-way. fr]
Michael Bolton? I mean, come on.
Michael Bolton?!
It's gonna smell like a rock concert.
It'll look like a rock concert. But
to the people that are actually there,
it's gonna be like they're
all stuck in an elevator!
Can you please stop gripping
about your concert issues long enough
- to make your own pizza.
- All right. What am I supposed to do?
Make your own pizza.
It's Kinda self-explanatory.
So, what's the big deal with
the Michael Bolton thing anyway?
I'll tell you what the big deal is.
It's a big moment your first concert.
Tell me what your first concert was.
Don't even think about it. Just say it.
OK. 1995. Willtern Theater.
I saw REM, radio head, and a very
angry look on my mother's face
when I snuck into the house
at 4:00 morning.
See that. Yeah! Now, that's a concert.
That's a big moment in her life.
- What was your first concert, Dennis?
- Van Halen.
- Roth or Hagar?
- David Lee, man.
Front row.
Diamond Dave jumped into the crowd
and Broke my right arm.
Heh. Look.
It's still shorter than the other one.
See that's what's important
about a first concert.
It's gotta be a big, great memory.
You know?
Ask me what my first concert was?
- OK. What was your.
- Scott Baio.
- Who?
- Scott Baio.
- From Happy Days?
- Scott Baio from Happy Days.
It's a little known fact.
Fonzy's little cousin cut
a couple of albums back in 1982.
And my cousin Gwen dragged
me to his boys night out concert.
And she bought me a Tank top
with Scott Baio's face on it.
And my mother made me wear
it to school the next day
so I wouldn't hurt Gwen's Feelings.
- That is awful.
- On picture day.
I can't believe i'm even
friends with you, man.
Dude, I can't believe I slept with you.
Why does Allison get to
take them to their first concert?
Well, why don't you just find
another concert to take them to first?
Bruce Springsteen's playing
at the forum next week.
Really? That's great idea that
30,000 other people
had the minute they announced it.
Well, smarty pants, they always release
a handful of tickets before the show.
- Really?
- Yeah. Comps that cancel or
extra seats that open up.
It happens all the time.
You just gotta get in line early because
every scalper in town will be there.
Oh, my gosh!
That's fantastic.
Can you imagine Tom and Louise's
first concert Being Springsteen?
That be amazing. I mean it's not as cool
as David Lee roth smashing your arm.
But it's still pretty good.
It's a good 4 inches.
You know when I swim,
I just go in circles.
Louise, sweetheart, come on.
I promised your mom that you would
practice your cello tonight.
You have to practice.
But dad it's embarrassing.
People think i'm a street performer.
They keep trying to hand me money.
That's good. If we get enough money,
we can probably park
on someone's Lawn outside
the stadium. Come on.
Hey, I'm doing long division.
How about a little love for me!
Hey, Tommy, why don't you take
your sister to go get a soda. OK?
- Good evening.
- Howdy do.
- Big Springsteen fan?
- Yes, I am.
You know I hope you're not standing
in line for a ticket scalper, ma'am.
Because that is illegal.
No. I'm just a Springsteen fan like you.
Sure.
What's track 5 on side 1 of born to run?
There is no track 5.
That's an exceptional guess.
Excuse me. Gary! Gary!
What the hell?!
I just gave a street kid a dollar
because he looked like Tom,
and then I realized he was Tom!
Why am I picking up
my kids on Hollywood Boulevard?
It's kind of an emergency Allison.
See, that ticket window
is gonna open in 2 hours.
And I'm getting tickets
to see Springsteen.
So what, you have them here at 8:00
on a school night sitting on a filthy
sidewalk like homeless
bum children so you can get tickets?
Yeah. They're gonna remember
this night the rest of their lives.
This concert better not be on
the Same night as Michael Bolton.
- No. It's the night before.
- Gary, I can't believe you.
You just, can't stand it that i'm gonna
take them to their first concert.
So you have to jump in
and take them to a concert
- the day before just to tick me off?
- No. I don't want to tick you off.
I don't want their first
concert to be a disaster.
I want it to be a good memory.
It's all about just
giving the kids good memories.
I wanted a good memory on our
wedding night, but then I
found out about your "if diehard is on,
I have to watch it" policy.
How many times have
we been through this? Mclane
wants to be with his family
on Christmas. But can't
be with his family on Christmas because
he has to save Nakatomi Plaza.
Gary, listen to me.
We are going to have
a great time at Michael Bolton.
And you not gonna get them on
wednesday night just so you can
concert block me, OK?
Even if it is for Bruce.
- God, would you shut up?
- All right, look.
This is me and you here. Listen.
You have to give me the kids because
you agreed to switch nights. Right?
Our divorce stipulates that once
you agree to switch nights,
- you can't switch back.
- All right, fine, Gary.
But this isn't over. OK?
Kids, come on. Let's get your stuff.
Pack it up. We're leaving.
I think this is a new low.
Even for you.
I said "you."
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Sweetie, you saw what
happened to the neighbor's cat?
No. What happened?
He's taking a nap in the road.
He's adorable. He looks very peaceful.
And he's got a look on his
face like "mondays are a bummer."
Why are you sick, sweetie?
Because mom like Tom drive
the car in the church parking lot.
Wait. Your mother
let Tommy drive the car?
Well, if you call it driving.
Stop, start. Stop, start.
Stop, start. Barf!
- Hey, dad. Mom let me drive the car.
- Yeah, I heard. That's fantastic, man.
Check it out.
I made a right turn so perfectly,
the blinker turned off by itself.
You let Tommy drive the car.
I'm his father. That's a father's job.
Fathers have been teaching their
sons to drive for thousands of years.
I'm sorry, Gary.
Tom asked if he could give it a shot.
And I knew it was
something you'd want to do.
But then I rembered,
you stole the first concert from me.
And then the next thing I know,
we're driving through hedges
and nuns are giving us the finger. So...
Well, if you're sure
you want to play it that way, Allison,
be careful and buckle your seatbelt.
Because I can play that way, too.
That reminds me. I took Louise on her
first roller coaster ride yesterday.
- You didn't.
- Yeah. She's finally this tall.
- Tom, could I see you for a second?
- Yeah, sure.
Louise, I got you a present.
It's on your bed. I got it at the store.
- Thanks, dad.
- You got it.
What's going on?
Well, Tommy,
your dad's gonna teach you how to shave.
There were are.
- Shave what?
- Shave your.
Your beard you big
hairy lumber Jack. Come on!
- What's with the first aid kit?
- Why don't we answer that question
if and when we need it? OK, son.
This is shaving cream.
I know what shaving cream is, dad.
OK. Good. There you go.
Lather some of that on there.
All right.
There you go.
Go ahead.
Use the mirror, son. Use the mirror.
It doesn't bother you that
I don't have any hair on my face?
No, listen, you're a brooks.
You come from a long line
of incredibly hairy people.
All right?
Remember your aunt rose?
Who do you think taught me how to shave?
Now, son, a man
is only as good as his tools.
Make sure you use a razor
made by a company that also
makes ball-point pens.
These are excellent because
they're hollow inside.
And if you cut yourself and
bleed to death, you can call for help.
Have at it.
Have at it. Go ahead. Go ahead.
There you go. You having fun?
- Yeah.
- Good. That's good.
Because from here on out,
it's a giant pain in the ass.
- So why did we have to do this today?
- It's all about milestones, son.
Fathers and sons doing
things for the first time.
My father didn't get to teach me.
He's still mad at my aunt Rose.
You've got to be kidding me.
It's your first brassiere, honey.
Congratulations.
Thanks, dad. But I really
don't need this kind of pressure.
I have surprise for you guys. How would
you like to go to burgeroo's for dinner?
I called your mom, she said it was fine.
- All right.
- Here we go. Here we go.
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking pictures of you guys.
Look. You are so adorable.
Scotty, move closer. Don't be shy.
Your dad, he should be seeing this?
Do you guys always do this
before you go to Burgeroo's?
We going to Burgeroo's?
Not you, Tom.
Louise and Scotty are
going on their first date.
What?!
It's not really a date.
But you guys go wait in the car, OK.
I will be out in a minute.
I have to talk to Tommy about something.
What's going on here?
Why can't I go to Burgeroo's?
Well, your sister is going on a date.
Which brings me to something very
important that I'd like to discuss with
you. But I don't have a lot of time, so
listen carefully. OK. Here we go.
Tommy, when a man and
a women love each other very much.
I've already had this talk with dad.
Drugs.
- Someone offers you drugs...
- I've had this one, too.
Fine.
The game is called Blackjack.
Cured.
Cured.
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Krandall. But
there's a Lewis and Tom here to see you.
- Lewis and Tom?
- Louise. My name is Louise.
- Do I even look like a Lewis?
- Yeah. That's fine. Let them in, ellen.
This is a surprise.
- Hey, Dr. K.
- Is everything all right?
Not really. We need to talk to you.
Please, sit down. How did you get here?
We took public transportation.
And if the rest of the world did too.
Louise, one problem at a time. OK?
Things are getting a little
out of hand with mom and dad.
Why don't you tell me what's going on.
Well, dad took us
to Mexico the other day.
- That sounds nice.
- For dinner.
It was 6 hours in the car
and 10 minutes at a Taco stand.
Why would he do that?
So he could be with us
our first time out of the country.
OK. That sounds a bit extreme.
No. Extreme was mom taking
me on a college tour to cal State.
OK, that's crazy.
Of course it is.
Me, at a state school? Please...
What are you doing here?
The kids called and they told me
to come over.
They called me too.
Why are you on the porch?
The door's locked.
It's, like, bolted from the inside.
That's what you think scientist?
From the inside? As opposed to outside?
I used to have deadbolt on the outside,
but I got tired of my neighbors
locking me in my house!
- Is this important?
- Hey, all right. Let's go.
Tommy? Louise? Let's go!
What's going on in there, you guys?
Walter, what are you doing here?
Tom and Louise came by my office today,
told me about the little competion
you two have been engaged in.
Hey, what are they doing over there?
Is that a paper shredder?
- Are those my tickets?
- That's right, Gary.
3 Springsteen tickets,
3 Michael Bolton tickets.
Louise, honey, I love you so much.
Sweetie, don't let the bolton tickets
touch the Springsteen tickets. OK?
You have bigger issues, Gary.
Your children are very unhappy with you.
Walter, would you please let us in?
That was just the receipt.
Now do I have your undivided attention?
Yeah. Yes, you do.
If I let you in, will you
listen to what your kids have to say
and not make a grab
for the remaing tickets?
- Yes. We will.
- I promise. Yes.
- All right. All right.
- All right.
OK. We're good.
It's cool. It's OK. It's OK.
Why are you hands in the air?
It's not a stick-up.
- Sorry. I don't know.
- No. No. Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up.
You got it. You got it, Tommy.
You're the man. You're the man.
All right guys, let's not do anything
crazy. OK? Tom, Louise. Nothing crazy.
Crazy? Like buying your 11-year-old
a giant cafeteria Lady Bra?
- Seriously? You did that?
- I figured she'd grow into it.
What makes you think...
No. No. Back! Back!
Sorry. My mistake.
Was that Springsteen or Bolton?
What part of tickets
and shredder don't understand?
- Oh, my god.
- I'm sorry, Louise. We're sitting down,
we're listening to you now.
OK. Go ahead.
Why don't you begin.
Well, we want you to stop forcing us to
do stuff that we're not ready to do yet.
- Like shaving and dating.
- And driving.
Actually the driving I liked.
I'd like to see more of that.
- But everything else has to stop.
- Gary, Allison.
I think your children deserve
an explanation for your behavior.
Look, when your dad and I were married,
we were together and we saw all
those first things,
you know, together.
The walking and then the talking.
Riding your bike. Losing a tooth.
Getting a ride in an ambulance.
Tommy, that all happened
for you in one afternoon.
I guess we're just afraid
that we're gonna
- Miss out on those things, you know?
- But they are going to happen.
And we need to know how you plan
to handle them now that you're divorced.
Pop quiz my first homecoming
dance what are you going to do?
Hey, that's mine.
Hey! Wait! Wait! No!
I'm gonna call your father.
Invite him over and include him.
And we'll show him the dress.
- Good?
- I'll take pictures.
And I'll give your mom
doubles of those pictures.
And I'll take your date in the backyard,
and I'll show him how quickly
I can dig a shallow grave.
Good answer.
But of course, I'll never participate
in such an outdated sexist ritual.
Though, if I do,
I want to look really pretty.
We want to do things together with
you guys. We do. And we're gonna try.
And whoever isn't there, we'll make
sure that person is there in spirit. OK?
- What?!
- What? What was that?
I don't know.
I'm drunk with power.
Give me some of these.
You're hogging them all. Let me do some.
Hey! Tommy, stop!
Enough. I'm your father.
I'm saying this has to end.
Give me the tickets.
What the heck are these?
The freudian pips?
They're left over from a little gig
I had with 3 of my psychiatrist friends.
We were sort of an up with
people for the clinically depressed.
You're a strange man, Krandall.
Give me my tickets.
All right.
Sorry I had to put you through that.
- But it certainly was effective.
- Yeah. OK. Here.
Hi, Bruce Springsteen tickets.
This is fantastic. This is really great.
You guys gonna have the greatest time
of you life when you go to this concert.
With your mom.
What? I thought you were taking us.
I was gonna. But she's right, Tommy.
It was her idea to take
you guys to your first concert.
And I just wanted to steal it from her.
And that's not right.
So your mom should take you.
That is, if you do want to go see Bruce.
What? Are you kidding me? Bruce!
Come on guys, we're gonna rock?
Kids, you think we could, I don't know,
buy your dad a Springsteen ticket?
Time out.
That's pretty expensive, Allison.
I don't know if we can afford it.
You know what we could do.
We could sell those
Michael Bolton tickets.
And with the money we make
we could buy cup of coffee.
And then we could drink it
while we're thinking of way
to buy a Springsteen ticket.
You know, I think I have enough nickels
in my kitchen to buy you a ticket.
All right.
And with the money left over
we can get you a Michael Bolton ticket.
Can you see anything?
And how many times is this guy
going to ask us if we're ready to rock?
Everyone has clearly said that they're
ready to rock. What more does he want?
I can't believe we have to
go to another one of these tomorrow.
Are we even facing the right way?
- I wish we could go home.
- Don't ruin it for them.
These memories will last
them the rest of their lives.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Hey, guys.
Bills, all Bills.
Bills, Bil... a subscription form
for "High Times" magazine?
You've been here 2 days, dad.
How did they find you?
It's a cosmic thing.
Did my dad tell ya I put
him on one of my work crews?
Yeah, I think that's great.
I'm just gonna do it until I get
enough bread to get my van fixed.
What do you have to do to your van?
Just the usual maintenance, you know?
Rewire the black light,
update the mural,
shampoo the carpet on the ceiling.
I don't want to sound like a gear head,
dad, but maybe you can get a van
where all 4 tires are the same size.
Hey, look at this. Report card time.
The Brooks kids. Let's see how they did.
Louise Brooks, straight as.
That's my girl.
Until a blood test proves otherwise.
Check that out.
Tommy brooks. A. B+. A.
C-.
C- in PE?
How do you get a C- in gym class?
You wear your church
shoes on the wood floor?
Did you,
check his backpack for drugs?
Tommy doesn't have drugs in
his back pack, all right, dad?
Where do you suppose he would keep them?
I don't understand this.
Tommy, Tommy's my son.
He's a Brooks.
We come from a long line of athletes.
Starting with my generation of course.
I played football, I wrestled, track
not to mention
I had a trial with the Dodgers.
Hey, it's 3:00. Time for Gary to mention
his tryout with the Dodgers.
There you go, all set.
Thanks. Feels good.
How's it look?
It's the way you like it. Rickles
in the front, Kenny G in the back.
- I gotta go, my friend's picking me up.
- Your friend? You seein'somebody new?
But don't even bother
asking her about the guy.
She won't give any
information whatsoever.
But, I know he's not in my ballpark,
because my ballpark is Dodgers'stadium,
where I had a tryout, incidentally.
Come on. Just tell us, where is he from?
He was born in Canada.
Look at me?
I'm Canada!
My bacon's round.
It's really ham, but we call it bacon?
And he was a professional athlete.
Look at me? This what I'm aboot.
I played profe, time out!
You're dating a professional athlete?
What sport? Gimme a hint.
He's gay?
He's a basketball player.
Good-bye, Jack.
Good-bye.
She's dating a gay
Canadian basketball player?
You know, I got no recollection
of you ever trying out for the Dodgers.
That probably because that was the year
you decided to try and find bigfoot.
No, that was the year the son
of a bitch made it personal.

VO : ¤AkaZab¤
Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way. fr]
Louise, honey,
do you know where the fly swatter is?
No, and mom?
A fly is a living, breathing creature.
I know. That's why I need a fly swatter.
If it was dead, i'd just need a tissue.
- I got it.
- Hey, Louise, you ready to go?
It's either that,
or stay here and witness a murder.
Louise, do you have any idea
how many flies
die on my windshield every time
I drive you to the recycling center?
- It's a classic Hobson's choice, dad.
- At's how we're gonna handle this?
I say something clever, and then you
say something I don't understand?
Why don't you go wait in the car,
smarty?
Where's Tom?
He's with Walter,
he'll be back in a min.
This fly is driving me crazy.
I can't get it.
Why don't you do what you usually do?
Stop acknowledging it,
don't let it touch you,
and then just chip away
at its soul
until it loses the will to live.
Hey. So,
did you see Tommy's report card?
I know, I have. I'm so proud of him
for bringing up that science grade.
Thank you for not helping
him as much this semester.
He did great in everything,
except gym class.
I mean, how do ya how do ya
get a C- in PE? I know a kid
when I was in high school that smoked
in gym class. He got a B+.
I know, it's unacceptable,
but, Frankly, I mean, Gary...
Of all of his classes,
PE.'s the least of my worries.
Wait. All right.
- Hey, guys, how was your hike?
- Fabulous.
- Wait, time out.
- You guys went on a hike?
I've been takin'Tommy on urban nature
hikes around the neighborhood lately.
That must be fascinating. I bet you get
up real early and if you're real quiet,
you can sneak up on
the elusive man who leaves
pizza coupons on door knobs.
Actually, it was sort of cool.
Dr. K knows all kinds of stuff.
Do you know that there are places
in the neighborhood
where you can find
edible plants and animals?
Yeah, they're called
restaurants and salad bars.
- Am I right? Right?
- I guess, but
you know, you can also get nutrients
from pine needles, acorns.
But good joke about the salad bar.
Yeah. Salad bar.
All right, don't pity me.
Go wait in the car.
- Thanks, Dr. K.
- I enjoyed it, too, Tom.
I should get going.
I'm having a new phone put in.
That must be exciting. Maybe they can,
let you keep your original number.
One.
Another jab at my age. Tell me, Gary,
when you enrolled in college,
what did the operator
standing by say to you?
Now I know why Tommy
is getting a C- in gym.
- Because of Krandall.
- What are you talking about?
Think about it. When he's at my house,
he with me. 2 guys, hanging out, right?
But when he comes here, he's with
3 women, Louise, you, and Krandall.
Are you implying that Walter is
an inadequate male role model?
No, I'm implying that Walter
is an inadequate male.
Yep, well, he is enough of a man
to keep a big smile on my face.
OK, that's disgusting.
And during sex,
he never once said, "hey,
do you mind keeping this going
on your own while I go grab a beer?"
You know, in all fairness, when I came
back, you had lost interest in yourself.
I have carpal tunnel, you know that.
Look, whatever you think of him,
Gary, he is great with Tom.
He's great with Tom?
What are you talking about?
There's a 14-year old boy
roaming the neighborhoods
eating the weeds out of people's yards.
- Did you get it?
- Of course I got it.
Using skills I honed in gym class, OK?
- They taught you how to catch flies?
- No, but they taught us
hand-eye coordination, dexterity
and look, here's the bottom line.
When I have Tom, I put a little
more "manfluence" in his life
and strip away all the "kranfluence."
Give me the fly swatter. All right.
There ya go, buddy. Have at it.
What are you doing?
- That was fun, Tommy. How ya doin'?
- I'm beat.
3 hours of running and jumping
and catching frisbees?
Don't take this wrong, dad,
but you might need a puppy.
You know, we learned
a very valuable lesson today, son.
You can go to the park, you can play
football, baseball. You can shoot hoops,
play soccer. But as soon as a man and
his son start wrestling in the grass,
people call the cops.
I think we wandered into
the wrong section of the park.
I've got something really
manly planned for us tomorrow.
What? More manly than getting
my head squeezed in a leg scissor hold?
I told you if that happened, just scream
out for help if it was bothering you.
Yeah, I couldn't hear you, dad. Your
thighs were pressed against my ears.
Look, tomorrow. Paintball. Come on,
we're gonna do it. It'll be great.
It'll be me, you, grandpa,
Jack, and Dennis.
And you can bring a friend if you want,
handsome?
I don't know, dad.
Can we just go for a hike?
I mean it's, it's wildflower season.
Look, I need to talk to you
about your grades a little.
I mean, you did really good,
but a C- in gym, that's not cool.
I mean, we're Brooks men.
We have a rep to protect.
I know, I just keep forgetting
my gym bag. It's no big deal.
Well, you know you can talk to me if
you need to talk about anything, right?
- Yeah, of course.
- Anything you want to talk about?
You sure? I mean, I can really
help you school, girls, gym class.
I'm an expert in everything,
except school and girls.
Dad, there is nothing
that I need to talk about, OK?
- I'm gonna hit the showers.
- OK, I love you.
I used to love gym when I was in school.
That was my favorite class.
It was just fun. It was just a break in
the day, where you could just run wild.
Run all you want. Shoot some hoops.
Tackle each other.
The best was talkin'smack in
the locker room, afterwards.
That was always fun, you know?
Hey, Tommy. Heads up!
Oh, my god!
- Tommy! Are you OK?!
- No, I'm not OK!
What the hell was that for?!
Yeah, that's right, dad, I said hell!
- Son, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it.
- You didn't mean to what?
Deliberately roll up a towel,
wait'til I got my pants off,
and then crack me in the nards?!
- Tommy, I said "heads up."
- Yeah, and then I turned around!
But heads up doesn't mean "turn around"!
Heads up means like, Duck.
- Everyone knows that!
- Yeah? I beg to differ!
Paintball starts in an hour.
Where is private Tom?
Private tom is icing his privates.
Snapping him with a towel? Really?
I mean, what are you gonna do next?
Put bars of soap in a pillowcase
and beat him in his bunk?
All right. Look, I feel bad enough
about this without you piling on.
It was just a little locker horseplay,
and he turned into a heads up.
- That's all.
- So, you're saying this is his fault.
His testes just jumped into
the path of your towel.
Kind of, yeah. I mean, everyone knows
that heads up means you turn away.
You don't turn into a heads up.
It means a ball,
a puck, or a towel is coming your way.
I was kind of hoping we were
raising a gentleman, OK?
Not pluto, from "animal house."
- Bluto.
- Whatever.
No! That is, bluto! That's the kind
of stuff he's not learning over here!
Or on his nature walks
with "crocodile Krandall."
You know what, Gary? It's a good thing
Walter was here, because Tom got home.
He was so embarrassed, he didn't want
talk to me. Wanted to talk another man.
Wait. Wha... time out. My son's talking
to Krandall about this stuff?
Why isn't he talking to me?
I mean, I'm his father. I'm the man.
Yeah. Well, thanks to the man,
right now,
Tom is upstairs with a bag of
frozen peas on his scrotum.
Your dad's here! Bring down
that bag of peas! I'm makin'pot pie!
How are the fellas?
Hurt, angry, and a little less
trusting than they were before.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, son, but
way to man up and play hurt today.
Did you get a friend to play with us?
- What are you doing, Krandall?
- Tom invited me to join you.
No. No, Tommy, I said that you should
probably bring a friend, right?
Well, dr. K is my friend.
No, I meant, like, a school friend.
Like Brian, or Glenn.
Not a friend that needs
a chair in the shower.
Dad, Dr. Knows everything
about war and historic battles.
But this is paint ball.
You have a flag that you defend, and
you go and try to get
the other guy's flag.
You don't have to know about battles.
Hey, Dr. K, someone sounds like
the french at the battle of agincourt.
So, Tom, what do you want
for st. Crispin's day?
I'll tell you what I don't want.
Heavy French armor in the mud.
Get in the car.
All right, come on, let's go! Get'em
in here! Drag'em in here, you guys!
Come on, hurry up, hurry up! We've
got a few minutes while they reload,
and then they're gonna come at us
with everything they got, all right?
OK, we've got "boo goo" bad
guys up in the tree line!
Dad, would you stop talking like that?
You're freaking everybody out!
- Dennis is in bad shape, dad.
- Come on, Dennis, get up.
I'm in pain.
Of course you are. You had
3 breakfast sandwiches at a gas station.
What do you expect?
If something bursts out of my stomach,
kill it.
What's going on with you?
You're our point man.
You supposed to be there shooting
guys. You haven pulled the trigger.
I know. I'm just trying
to get a feel for my gun.
Well, you gotta get a feel for it,
and quick, OK? So, why don't you,
shoot Dennis.
Great. This is just like a war movie.
Ethnic guy always dies first.
Gary, if tom's truly a pacifist, perhaps
intimidation isn't the best motivator.
You wanna take over here? You wanna
be responsible for 4 souls out there,
walkin'the wire? Is that what you want?
- Actually, I'd be happy.
- Yeah, I didn't think so. Look. Dad,
Dennis, Tom, you guys form
a perimeter and meet back here at 03,
30, wait, 03, screw it!
3:30, come back at 3...
Ditty before they flank us, or we're
gonna end up in a world of hurt.
Dad, stop talking like
you were in Vietnam.
You've never been there.
All through the sixties,
all you did was manage to freak
out tents at "grateful dead" shows.
I remember you.
That's good. OK.
Let's, let's get out there and hustle.
Tommy, you cover Dennis's rear.
Would guys knock it off?
Come on, get out there, let's go!
Set a perimeter up!
Remember the altamont!
I noticed you didn't
give me an assignment.
Yeah, I thought it would
be good if you just,
stayed back here with me, Krandall.
Can you hand me my gun, Gary?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Walter.
You don't want to do this, Gary. What
can you possibly gain by shooting me?
For one thing, you'd be out of the game,
I'd have some private time with my son.
I'm not standing between you and Tom.
Yeah? Then why does he keep
coming to you for advice?
It's normal for teens to confide in
someone other than their parents.
All right. What is he telling you?
- I'm afraid that's confidential.
- That's the wrong answer.
Don't shoot me, Gary.
Why not? Give me one
good reason why I shouldn't.
At this close range, you leave
a doozy of a bruise and the guys
at the lap pool can be very cruel.
Get down, Gary! Duck!
Oh, my gosh!
It's coming from everywhere!
- Give me my gun. It's your only hope!
- No, I don't trust you!
- You can't afford not to!
- All right then!
I'm serious about Tommy, Krandall!
You stay away from him!
I'm his hero, you hear me?!
Ya don't get it, do ya?!
- Get what?
- You are his hero.
You're so much his hero, he doesn't
think he'd be able to live up to you.
Why would I think that?
He can never let me down.
Look at you, Gary.
You're a tough guy athlete.
You lettered in 4 sports, not to mention
your legendary tryout at the dodgers.
That's why he's tanking gym class.
It's less painful for him not to try,
rather than risk disappointing you.
- He could never disappoint me!
- Have you told him that?
Some things a son needs
to hear from his father.
All right, all right! Bring it in!
They got us covered from every angle,
I don't know what we're gonna do.
All right, hey, wait a minute.
Where's my dad?
I saw him at the lookout tower.
He said he's gonna smoke out the enemy.
But he said he only had enough
for himself, whatever that means.
All right. All right, guys, look,
let's call it a day.
Let's surrender.
I don't want anybody getting hurt, OK?
Surrender? I didn't come all
the way out here to get whacked
by 6 floor managers from
scooter's auto sound.
- Tom, we have.
- I'll see you in hell!
Yeah, that's right, dad.
I said hell again.
Who's with me?!
What the heck got into him?
Probably a combination of gangster rap,
video games,
and that yard long pixie stick
he inhaled at the gas station.
Gary, look out!
What did you do that for,
you crazy son of a bitch?
Needs his dad.
In fact, it's all he ever talks about.
When we go for walks around the... the,
- the...
- Krandall, stay with me.
Cul de sac.
I couldn't think of the word.
The point is, whenever we're together,
all he ever talks about is
how much he looks up to you.
Thank you, Walter. Thank you.
- I guess this is the end for me.
- Yeah, I...
I guess so, Krandall.
So, I'll see you back at the snack room?
Grab me a cheeseburger, would ya?
I'm already dead, for god's sake!
Here we go, guys. Ice cold
root beer for the victorious warrior,
- and one for Gary.
- All right.
But I'm riding this guy's coattails,
you know? I mean,
he captured the flag,
but I was on his team.
So, I'm Kinda making believe
I captured the flag, too.
OK, by that same logic,
because of my boyfriend,
I would have 3 nba championship rings.
Wait a minute. That's another clue.
OK, born in Canada,
3 championship rings, your, my!
You're dating rick fox?!
I think I said too much.
- You're really dating Rick Fox?
- No, I'm not dating anybody.
I just like messing with Gary.
So, Vanessa's dating an ex-laker?
That is so cool.
Unless you're the guy that used to date
her. I mean, who can live up to that?
Yeah, but, dad, you're practically
a pro player, yourself.
I mean, you tried out for the Dodgers.
Tommy, I probably left out a few
details about that, you know?
The tryout was an invitation
in the newspaper.
They said the first 1,500 people
that could get to the park could try out
for the dodgers,
and me and my cousin got there.
And... that was it.
My entire tryout was 2 pitches.
So, that was your big Dodger tryout?
Yeah, I just kind of
exaggerated over the years.
I was just a guy that was pretty good
at high school sports, which is nothing
to brag about, which is exactly
why I bragged about it constantly.
Your paintball story is already epic
compared to my entire sports career.
- You really think so?
- Yeah, hey,
I'm living in your shadow now,
buddy? OK?
Thanks, dad.
So what'd you do with those 2 pitches?
Well, the first one I wiffed.
The second one,
I, popped it out to the left fielder.
Yeah, he caught it with his bare hand.
But, at least you hit a ball all the way
to the outfield at dodgers stadium.
No, no, I didn't say hit
the ball to left field.
I said hit the ball
to the left fielder. He was
coming out of the dugout,
adjusting his hat.
And he just reached out,
and it Kinda just fell in his bare hand.
But, at least you hit a ball all the way
to the dugout at Dodgers'stadium.
You know I did, right?
I took this one near the end
of the battle,
- when I was unwrapping a stick of gum.
- That's nothing.
I took this one coming
out of the men's room.
- That's your own paint, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Just had to get out of that hell hole.
I didn't like what it was doing to me,
I kept wasting guys
and I didn't feel a thing.
I feel weird.
Maybe you're hungry.
Have you eaten anything since
the breakfast sandwich incident?
Yeah. I had a couple of brownies
out of Jack's backpack.
Why don't you sit here?
OK, little brother,
you're safe and warm
on a planet that loves you.
Kumbayah, my lord, kumbayah!
Kumbayah, my lord, kumbayah!
- Help me out.
- Kumbayah, my lord, kumbayah!
- What's going on over here?
- Dennis got into my brownies.
Someone's high, my lord
kumbayah!
Someone's high!
Someone's high, my lord...
It feels good to wash
all this paint off, Tommy!
All right, I'm all done.
The shower's all yours, son!
Hey, dad, heads up!
Dad, I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd
turn into it. I mean, I said head's up.
I'm so proud of you!
- Thanks, dad.
- Go get me a bag of frozen peas.
A very large bag of frozen peas!
Team Subs-Addicts"
I can't believe nobody's
thought of this.
What's, what's all that, son?
I had clear some space out of my locker
because Danielle is moving in with me.
The girlfriend's moving in?
OK, but, why buy the locker when
you're getting the combination for free?
She was always over there anyway,
and we were spending a lot of time
going back and forth between hers and
mine, so, you know, it just makes sense.
I'm proud of you, son. You know what?
I'm gonna take you to the Go-cart ranch
for one last hurrah.
How'd your old lockermate Kenny take it?
Not so good, but it's made
him take a look at his own life.
You know what? I think he's finally
gonna take that hall monitor job.
Oh, my gosh! Louise, that is awesome!
Yeah, she's got a few more finishing
touches before the open house tonight.
What are you talking about? It
already looks exactly like tracy Morgan.
It's Maya Angelou.
She's a poet and one of the most
amazing women of the 20th Century.
I don't want to disagree with you,
sweetheart, but I was reading "swimsuit"
magazine. They listed the 50 most
amazing women she wasn't mentioned.
It might not be the best time for that
kind of teasing. Louise had a tough day.
Sweetheart, what happened? Why'd
you have a tough day? What happened?
Miss St. James happened.
Miss St. James is a temporary teacher's
assistant in Louise's art class,
and apparently she's been drawing
a lot of attention from the boys.
Why?
She has arthritis?
She's a juggler?
She has enormous beach balls.
Got it, got it.
Good.
It's like every guy's IQ. Drops
50 points when she walks in a room.
When do guys stop acting so stupid, mom?
When they close the lid on the coffin.
Look, Louise, not all men are shallow
and just into looks. I mean look at me.
I married your mom. I didn't know if
she was gonna grow into that forehead.
My forehead? When you wear a Halloween
mask, his Lazy eye corrects itself.
Even my best friend Scotty,
who is smarter than me
can't take his eyes off of her.
When she walks n the room,
his Lazy eye corrects itself.
All right. Hey.
How hot is this teacher?
That's right. Were you not just
sitting here when you told your daughter
that all men are
not obsessed with looks?
How hot is this teacher?
Unbelievably hot.
It's like looking at the fricking sun.
You just.
You have to behave yourself tonight, OK?
'cause Louise is gonna be watching you.
- Of course, yeah.
- And, Gary.
Make sure to get all your giggles
out of the way now because Louise's
math teacher is still named
mr. Balzac, OK?

Your jacket is caught on the.

Maya Angelou.
- You must be Louise's dad.
- Yeah, how'd you know that?
She's only one who chose Maya Angelou
for our great American women project.
We have 5 papier-mache Britneys
and one plaster of Paris Hilton.
I'm Gary Brooks.
Erica St. James.
Louise always talks about you.
Louise has been talking about you, too.
She's darling.
She gets that from me.
I'm a quarter darling.
And, I'm part Labrador Retriever,
also, so
if you have any tennis balls floating
in your swimming pool, I'm your man.
Will you bring it back or will
I have to Chase you around the yard?
Who doesn't like to be chased?
Why don't you go ahead
and sign in and
grab a pack of the reading materials
for you and your wife?
No, that's my ex-wife, ex.
She got that title from me
when I divorced her and got her
completely out of my life, here she is.
OK. Excuse me.
- Hey, guys.
- I see you met her.
I did. I got to tell you, not impressed.
Come on, Gary. She's very pretty.
I guess so. I mean, I...
I just don't see it.
She's more symmetrical than...
than pretty.
I'm so glad you just said that, dad,
because I can't wait
for you to meet Miss Plummer.
She's the real art teacher.
She's smart and well-read, and I
want to be just like her when I grow up.
Yeah! Well, you know what?
I want a smart
and well-read woman
standing in front of me,
and I mean right now, young lady!
Go get Miss Plummer!
Laying it on a little thick, aren't we?
What? Just showing
my daughter that I'm not shallow.
But you are shallow, Gary.
You know, that would hurt
my feelings if it wasn't coming
from such a mediocre-looking person.
- I'm Joan Plummer.
- Hi. I'm Gary Brooks.
Well, we are so happy
to have Louise in class.
It's nice to have a young person
so concerned about the environment.
Well, that's our Louise.
She actually switched us
from paper plates
to eco-friendly bamboo.
Bamboo. That is amazing.
We were going through 200 plates
a week. It just made sense.
Sorry.
I wasn't sure if you were still there.
Come on. Gary, we have to go to
the rest of Louise's classes, OK?
OK, hey, it's great to meet you,
Miss Plummer, OK?
I mean, wants to be you
when she grows up.
I've known you 5 seconds;
I want to be you when I grow up.
Thank you.
Thanks, and thanks for coming.
And I'll see you at the gym, Allison.
Bye, Louise.
Bye, Miss Plummer.
- Didn't you just love her, dad?
- She was awesome, yeah.
She's so much cooler
than Miss St. James.
Way cooler. That's probably why
she dresses in so many layers and wears,
like, granny scarves.
- You guys go ahead. I'll catch up, OK?
- All right. Come on, honey.
- Dad, come here. Check out my locker.
- All right.
Danielle has really girled
it up in there, hasn't she?
You know, Kenny used to fart
in the locker and shut the door real
quick when he saw me coming.
This is way better.
Son, I don't see any
of your stuff in this locker. I'm sorry.
- No, look. It's in here. Come on.
- No, that's...
- It's right there. Right.
- I don't see it. Got to get in there.
In the back.
In the back.
OK, wait. Those baseball cards?
That's my cave.
My gosh. That perfume is murder, Tommy.
- I guess I don't notice it anymore.
- Thank you.
All right, so. But...
I'm meeting Danielle at Jim
and Ellen's Locker, so I'll see you.
Wait. Did I blow out the candle?
Yeah. I did.
Mr. Brooks. I'm glad I caught you. Did
you want a classroom phone directory?
Yes, I would. Thank you.
That's my number right there.
I have the same area code. You know,
I thought we had a lot in common,
but now it's getting kind of scary,
you know?
Well, don't be scared, but do call.
Listen, I can't call you.
You're my daughter's teacher.
It's not right.
I'm just a temp.
I'm gonna be gone in 3 weeks.
I'll call you tomorrow.
I can't believe I'm actually
calling to ask you out. This is crazy.
You know, i'm a taxpayer, you're a
teacher. You kind of work for me, right?
If we're going out on a date,
you should call me Erica.
OK, but on the date, can I call you
Miss St. James? It's Kinda hot.
I got to be honest with you.
The open house was great and the...
The art class was
the best part of the whole night.
I have to go and I'll
talk to you later. Bye.
Was that Miss Plummer?
- Well.
- I knew it! You like her, don't you?
Miss Plummer? Yeah.
- 'Course I do. She's great.
- Did you ask her out?
Well, I you know, I don't.
That be weird for you wouldn't it?
She's your teacher.
No! I love Miss Plummer.
Dad, you're single. You got to get
out there and, you know, mix it up.
- I don't. I don't.
- Call her back.
- I don't think she'd go out with me.
- Call her.
- I don't think it's a good.
- Call her!
All right.
Let me get her number out of here.
No, why don't you just hit redial?
You were just talking to her.
My fingers are kind of fat.
I want to work them out.
I got a closet full of gloves.
They don't even fit me anymore.
Miss Plummer, it's Gary Brooks again.
Hi, Gary. What do you mean, "again"?
I know.
It's probably against
your policy to consider
going out with the parent
of a student, right? So.
- Are you asking me out?
- I'm sorry.
I should have known that the school
would frown on that kind of thing.
Actually, we're free to date
whomever we want,
and it just so happens
i'm available on friday.
I'll bet you are.
- Available on friday.
- Tell her. Tell her yes.
Yes. Yeah.
We should do something friday,
and I'll call you later
and we'll just shore up some plans, OK?
- Bye, Miss Plummer.
- Thank you, dad.
You've renewed my faith in men.
What did he do,
wear pants to go get the mail?
Dad's going out with Miss Plummer
this friday night.
Really? You asked out Miss Plummer?
Yeah, I sure did.
I mean, but can you blame me?
Who wouldn't want to spend time with
such an attractive... public servant?
- What are you going to wear, dad?
- What am I gonna wear?
Shouldn't I just, you know,
concentrate on being me?
You're right.
I mean, look at me.
Even I get caught up in it sometimes.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Setting good example for our daughter.
What, are you kidding me?
What, you asked out Louise's teacher?
Why? What's the big deal?
There's nothing wrong with that.
You don't ask out your kids'teachers.
Everybody knows that. There's
too many things that can go wrong,
and knowing you, they all will.
Well, I never even thought of that.
But it wasn't even my idea.
It was Louise's idea.
So wait a minute.
She made you call Miss Plummer?
Yes, because she heard me
making a date with Miss St. James.
I'm sorry.
You asked out Miss St. James, too?
- I was trying to slip that one by her!
- Man! Gary!
Are you out of your mind?
What are you trying to sleep
with all of Louise teachers?
Look, I'm gonna sleep
with whoever I have to
to prove to my daughter
i'm not shallow, OK?
God! Gary.
Look, you've got to cancel that date.
I just don't want to hurt her feelings.
I'm sure Miss St. James
will get over it.
You mean Miss Plummer.
No, I mean Miss St. James.
No, Miss Plummer. Miss st.
James is the hot one.
I know. You have to
call and cancel the date.
I'm totally confused. We have
to start this conversation over again.
Fine. I will start. You have to cancel
the date with Miss St. James.
How do you lose me after one sentence?
Miss St. James is the hot one.
Why would I cancel the date with her?
Because, Gary, Miss Plummer is Louise's
favorite teacher and you already
asked her out, so you have
to go through with it, but just be clear
that she knows you're just taking
her out as a friend, all right?
Where do you take a friend?
I don't know.
Just someplace that isn't romantic.
Let's think for a second. Let's think
of places that aren't romantic.
The mortuary.
Lawyer's office. According to you,
the circus isn't romantic?
You know what? That was, like,
the worst valentine's day ever.
Hey, I know.
Miss Plummer belongs to my gym.
Just take her there
and make it like a workout date.
Hey, that's a good idea.
And it's a gym, so it's not romantic.
She won't get the wrong
idea and there's no booze there,
so I won't, you know,
get the wrong idea. Thank you.
- Gary, do not mess this up.
- Look, Danielle,
I wish you would have told me you
invited Brian and Tara to our locker.
They're your friends.
Are you done?
Are you done?
He should have gotten
that locker prenup.
Hey, is she here yet?
No, but you are.
What are you doing here?
I'm working out with my trainer today.
No, you're here to spy on me,
aren't you?
A little bit of that too, and you better
handle things delicately with Miss P.
Don't worry about it. I'm...
It's gonna be quick and easy.
Besides, I got to get out of here.
I got another date in 2 hours.
What? You didn't cancel
your date with Miss St. James?
Is that where we landed? 'cause that's
not what I took from our conversation.
- I can't believe you!
- I have to go out with Miss st. James.
- It's my one shot at the bigs.
- Oh, my god!
You are so shallow! I mean, the
lengths you will go to to put yourself
in the presence of a perfect specimen.
Hello, Diego.
Are you prepared
to work your core today?
Lie down on the mats
and start focusing your attention.
Yes, I will.
- How you doing?
- If you train with me, you...
Could have this.
Why, when...
I have this?
My gosh, you don't look anything at
all like Miss Plummer, the art teacher.
- Was that a compliment?
- A poor one. I'm sorry.
Let me start over.
Miss Plummer, you look fantastic.
Well, that's sweet.
And thanks for asking me out.
Of course. Are you kidding me?
I thought we really hit it off in the,
art class,
you know. I hope I didn't come
on too strong in there.
No, you're just
a really effusive person.
Yeah. Effus.
When you say effusive, you mean.
I don't know what that means.
Ha! Well, maybe i'll give
you a vocabulary lesson later.
Well, maybe after
the vocabulary lesson, we can.
You're not. Not really, right?
You're just. It's a suggestive.
Yeah, suggestive.
Good. 'cause a real
vocabulary lesson boring! All right.
All right. Well,
what do you want to do? It's...
Fridays,
usually I just like to work neck.
Well...
hey, do you want to spar?
I promise I won't hurt you.
I don't know. I never hit a girl before,
except for my cousin Gwen,
but that's 'cause she dragged
me to a scott baio concert.
Well, it'll be fun.
Do you know anything about boxing?
I wear boxers.
I got my refrigerator from a box, so...
I'm as qualified as anybody else, right?
Let's get going.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, fine.
OK. All right. All right.
- Wait a minute. You're pretty good.
- Thanks.
I was golden gloves
champion of my weight class.
I didn't know golden gloves
had a division for girls.
Yeah. They don't.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm just excited, I guess.
- Hey. Excuse me. OK.
- What's up?
- She knows!
- What?
She knows. Louise just called.
She heard Miss St. James on
the answering machine leave a message
canceling the date because
she found out about Miss Plummer.
Wait. Does Miss Plummer know
about my date with Miss St. James?
The whole teachers'lounge knows.
Well, then why would Miss Plummer
agree to come here on a date?
Oh boy. All right.
Stay close, OK? All right.
Hey, you know, i, forgot to tell you,
before you got here, I did some cardio,
maybe we should just do some stretching.
You're stretched kind of thin already,
don't you think?
- OK, stop it! Easy. I can explain.
- Explain what?
Why you asked out two teachers
from the same classroom?
My gosh. OK.
Or why you're taking one out
for a workout
and the other one
to a 5-star restaurant?
My gosh. Wait!
Just give me a second, please.
Why don't you take two?
You look like you need it.
Hey, don't get cocky.
I'm sorry!
Gary, you're getting killed out there.
- What am I supposed to do?
- I don't know. Just be honest with her.
Come clean, and for god's sakes,
try and throw a punch.
I'm trying to throw a punch,
but she's not where I'm punching.
Let's go, Gary. Don't you have another
date you need to get to?
OK, I'm so sorry about this.
OK, Miss Plummer?
All right, look. Hear me out.
I admit, I'm a very shallow person.
I judged you by the way
you looked at work. I admit it.
You can knock me out if it's
gonna make you feel any better,
but when I wake up
and I start chewing solid foods,
i'm gonna ask you out again
because I think you're fantastic.
- That's really sweet.
- Thanks.
Call me.
All right. Just wasn't your night,
champ. Come on.
- Here we go.
- I smell biscuits.
I'm so sorry about all this.
I honestly thought I was
just more evolved, but the truth is,
I guess I'm just attracted to beauty
a lot of people are.
So if that makes me shallow,
then so be it.
She really clobbered you, didn't she?
I can't hear anything you're saying.
You have to talk more into my good ear.
Did you block any of her punches?
Yeah, I was blocking a lot of her
punches until my right eye closed up,
and then I lost my depth perception,
I bet she's feeling some pain today?
Actually, I saw her.
She looked great.
Really? There's no marks on her?
Her fist isn't swollen from
me beating it with my face?
Thanks for taking me out on a date, dad.
This is Kinda neat.
Kinda neat?
Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
This is super neat,
and i'm having a great time, OK?
And listen, guys do dumb
things around beautiful girls,
and you should get used to it,
because guys are gonna start
doing really dumb things around you.
- Dad!
- It's true, sweetheart.
I got to tell you, OK,
- you're beautiful.
- I know.
Scotty's told me,
trying to get on my good side.
Yesterday,
his Lazy eye went straight on me.
I could have taken Miss Plummer.
You know me. I can fight.
It's just, she's a defenseless girl.
It would have just looked terrible.
Oh, god.
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, son. What, what happened?
Danielle threw me out.
What do you mean, she threw you out?
That was your locker.
No we got in fight then she
threw all my stuff out
in the hallway and changed the lock.
All because she found my social studies
book in mary Ellen Mazowski's locker.
- What was it doing there?
- I don't know.
She just wanted to
look at it before the test.
Doesn't mary Ellen Mazowski.
Doesn't she have her
own social studies book?
OK. I was over there
the other day after school
and I put my book in Mary
Ellen's Locker, all right? Big deal.
If this was Europe,
it wouldn't even be an issue.
Women, they really like to know that
they're the only one in your life,
you know? So what are you gonna do?
You gonna move in now with Mary Ellen?
No, I'm gonna crash
at Kenny's for a while.
You know, the moment I opened the locker
some fake dog poop fell out on me,
and I laughed like I haven't
laughed in a long time.
But you know what?
I think I need it.

Don't keep your mother waiting.
That's good. Come on, guys.
You know, dad, I'm tired of
being woken up like a fireman,
without the thrill of the job.
Come on, We'll be out of here in 5 min.
I'll pop in some toaster waffles.
- Don't make a big thing about it, OK?
- Don't make a big thing about it?
Why are you suddenly acting like
the woman I wish I'd married?
We'd better not be late. I'm the tardy
officer. How would that look?
Hey, why don't you set your alarm,
Louise?
And then you can wake me up every day.
For the same reason I'm not going
to give myself away at my wedding:
because it's not my job.
Hey, Tom, honey, don't forget to
bring some nice clothes tonight.
I can't believe you're still
making me do that, mom.
Do what?
Mom told the new neighbors
I would ask their friendless
- daughter to the school dance tonight.
- Come on, Tommy, be nice.
Be nice. They just moved in. It wouldn't
hurt you to introduce Marjorie
to the people she'll be
going to school with.
Fine. But we are officially even.
After this, I don't ever want to hear
about how my big head ruined your body.
What's going on around here?
I mean, you're being nice,
you're cleaning up for no reason.
What's, my gosh,
the doctor called, I have cancer.
Is it in my head or in my butt?
Can't I just be nice
and easygoing for no reason?
Based on my 15 years of research, no.
Don't run the dishwasher. It's broken.
What's going on with you?
Walter and I may 16.
- That's great! Allison, that's great!
- I know. Isn't it? I'm getting married.
No more Allison money!
No more alimony?
Hey, maybe that's where they got
the word "alimony" from.
- Allison money. Alimony.
- What?
- Allison money. Alimony.
- It is exciting though. I mean, really.
I feel like I finally know
where my life is headed.
I feel like I just passed a 120-pound
Kidney Stone that says she's 110.
You know, I wonder what it's
gonna be like to be married
to a man who doesn't smell
his q-tips after he uses them.
- Come on, Louise! You guys ready?
- Yep! Let's go!
I got to get going.
I have to be in long beach by 9:00.
What a happy day.
Remember in "the wizard of oz"
when the movie went from black and white
to technicolor?
I don't know how they did that.
- I am so sorry.

There's really only one way to
screw up those instructions.

- So, how bad was it?
- How bad was it?
Are you kidding me?
The water ran for 7 straight hours.
Every floorboard buckled.
The neighbors gathered around the house.
They thought the house was weeping
and it was a miracle from god!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gary.
I am so sorry.
Stop saying you're sorry.
You sound like me when we were married.
You sure you want me to stay here?
Well... tch!
I don't want you to stay here,
but after what I did,
I can't make you go to a hotel,
because you...
- You'll hold that over my head forever.
- Forever.
Right, so... I... i got you,
some beer.
And I'm gonna make you a steak.
And I insist that you stay
in the master bedroom.
Oh, my old bedroom.
Great, you know. That'll be like...
It'll be like when they show a prisoner
the cell he lived in for 15 years.
- Hey, dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
Louise, honey? Your dad is gonna
be staying with us for a couple days.
And I don't want it to
be confusing, but...
Your father and I are not getting back
together, OK? In a few days,
everything'll go back to the way it was
before, but, you know, not "before" when
we were married "before,"
before the flood "before."
I wasn't confused until you
tried to explain it that way.
Yeah. I'm with Louise. I'm...
We're not back together, right?
Right. Yeah.
Hey, son,
when you leaving for the big dance?
As soon as Cowzilla rips
the roof off and plucks me out.
That's a lousy attitude Tommy. You don't
even know what this girl looks like.
Yeah I know, but it's just not fair,
dad. Mom should have asked me first.
What's the big deal?
You take her to the dance,
you stiff-arm her through
a couple of numbers, you
let her graze over the buffet and fill
her 4 stomachs, and you bring her home.
- She's here. She's here!
- How bad is it?
OK. Look. Try not to stare.
- Hi, Marjorie. How are you?
- Nice to meet you, mr. Brooks.
It's nice to meet you. Come on in, OK?
I'm gonna say something now.
That may have been it.
Hi, Marjorie. Look at you.
You look so pretty. I love that dress.
Isn't that a pretty dress, Tom?
You know, thanks for doing this, Tom.
Total drag taking out
the new girl, right?
Hey, at one time or another,
we've all been the new girl.
You know what? Honey, hair is starting
to fall in the back. Let me help you.
Let me. Let me talk to you.
Tom, Let's go. Come on.
- Are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK.
My heart's beating so fast,
my tie is moving.
All right, look. OK.
Here's some money. OK?
OK. Do I give it to her
now or when we come home?
That's for snacks at the dance.
Sorry. I'm just...
just a little nervous, you know?
It's a pocket. OK. You all right?
Let me help calm your fears
a little here, OK?
You don't have to change the oil
in your car every 3,000 miles.
It's OK to do it every 5,000 miles.
That's fine.
What does that have to do with my date?
Nothing. I'm just trying to get
your head out of it, OK? Let's go.
Hey, Tom, come on.
Marjorie's mom's waiting.
Nice to see you, mrs. Brooks.
Nice to meet you, mr. Brooks.
Let's go, Tom.
I just want to let you know that
I am completely unprepared for this
and I blame both of you.
Are you aware that Tom just left
the house with a grown woman?
She's 15, Walter.
Was she sent from some
Island to protect mankind?
She and her family just
moved here from iowa.
Of course. Corn.
Congratulations taking over
the reins of team Allison.
Yeah. I hope you do a better job with
the franchise than I ever did? Come on!
Can we just settle for a high-five,
whatever it is your people do?
I brought over the cds of the potential
wedding bands you asked for.
We got Dixieland, Disco...
I even threw in some Country-Western
for the Texas Krandalls.
The texas Krandalls.
So when they say, "rember the alamo,"
you do.
Very funny, Gary.
I rember that joke fondly the next time
I'm lying on top of your former wife.
I'm gonna go put my bag
in your room, OK, Allison?
Wait a minute.
Why is he going to your bedroom?
I flooded his house.
The least I can do is
put him up for a couple days
and let him sleep in the master bedroom.
- And you'll be sleeping...
- In the guest bedroom.
Walter, wait a minute.
You're not jealous, are you?
Of Gary?
How long is he gonna be staying?
Allison. I forgot to tell you,
I might have exaggerated
a little bit with this girl
that works down at the coffee shop.
So if the phone rings, please answer,
"senator Brooks'office."
Two days, tops.
So, I'll see you tomorrow at school?
Promise me you're gonna have lunch
with me. I don't want to eat by myself.
Tomorrow's meatloaf day,
so I'll bring a Beaujolais.
- Dad! Dad!
- Hey, son, how are you?
Well, I think it's safe to say
that I'm in really over my head here.
Why, what happened?
I don't know if you've noticed or not,
but Marjorie's kind of hot.
The law doesn't really let me have
this conversation with you, but...
I understand the words you're saying.
I mean, we were the center
of attention all night,
and people were staring
and snapping pictures.
And then the coach slapped
on the shoulder and told me
he can use someone like me on defense.
I'm starting next week, and I don't
even know what sport I'm playing.
All right. Calm down.
When you're with a girl like Marjorie,
you're gonna draw a lot of attention?
All right. It's like driving a Ferrari?
When you're next to something
that's sleek and beautiful.
Again, I have to go with the car
metaphor for legal purposes.
People are gonna notice, you know?
I don't think I can handle that.
You know,
I'm an under-the-radar kind of guy.
Didn't a part of you
tonight like that attention?
Come on. Let me hear it. You liked it.
Yes. OK? I loved it. I felt like a god!
You felt like a god! Yes! All right!
Now go upstairs and put on
your pajamas and get ready for bed.
And tomorrow,
you sit with her at lunchtime,
and you're gonna be
the coolest guy in school.
You know,
I'm finally cooler than Randy Wilcox.
And he brought his own
son to health class.
Hey, Roomie. You know I forgot
how much I loved living here?
Gary, did you shave in
the kitchen sink a while ago?
Yes, I did. Don't worry, though.
It was mostly my face.
What are you doing?
I'm planning a wedding, Gary,
and I'm on hold with a realtor.
I'm thinking about selling
the house once I move in with Walter.
It's Allison Brooks. I spoke with
you last week. I have this wonder...
Yeah, and we saw your ad
on the bus bench. Very nice smile.
- You can't sell our house.
- No, but I can sell my house.
No. In this economy? You'd be crazy.
Let me rent it from you.
OK. What?
You don't want to uproot the kids.
They live in the house.
They have all these
great memories here.
Think of all the dead pets
buried in the backyard.
You know? Some family comes in,
they want to put in a pool, they start
digging. Next thing you know, there's
a hamster with a badge
asking a lot of questions.
I... i don't know. I mean, Gary,
I would be your landlord.
Yes, you would. You'd be my landlord,
and if I fell behind on the rent,
you could just throw
me out in the dead of winter.
- You would love that.
- I would love that.
It's perfect! So? So?
OK. Yeah, you can rent my house.
Jessica, i'm back!
You named our house "Jessica"?
When you're in prison, you get lonely,
Allison. You start to name stuff.
This is perfect. It's just
like old times. Except good.
Allison, your llama got loose.
What are you doing out there?
When I was here earlier,
I think I left my keys.
Yeah, there they are,
right where I left them.
So, what are you two doing?
Well, I am planning a wedding,
Gary is bothering me,
and you're obviously here
because you're jealous.
All right, so what if I am? I think it's
inappropriate that Gary is staying here.
There are hotels and hostels.
I could even make room at my place.
There's a pull-out
couch in the train room.
You know, Walter,
I don't like this side of you.
We're getting married,
and then you don't even trust me?
- I mean, what does that say about us?
- Wait a min, you two. Knock it off
OK? Let's just slow things
down for a second here.
Krandall has a train room?
But I know what this is.
It's just pre-wedding jitters, OK?
Let's not lose sight of
what's important here, OK?
And that is me moving out of
my dump and moving back here, OK?
Walter, you know how I feel about Gary.
I mean, I would not sleep with
Gary if it would save his life.
Which, by the way,
I think that was the way he tricked
me into doing it the first time.
All I said was,
I didn't know how much time I had left.
- And in all fairness, do any of us?
- Yeah. Well...
if I was planning on sleeping with Gary,
I would express my disgust
as vigorously as you just did.
Oh, my god. I can't believe
you are acting so irrational.
I can't deal with this right now.
I'm gonna run a bath,
take a sleeping pill, and go to bed.
If we wind up sleeping together,
you should know
I'm a man that likes to be held.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Mango.
Bear claw?
Walter, what...
What are you doing here?
I came over with a box
of apology bear claws.
The question is,
what are you two doing here?
Yeah. Gary, what are you doing here?
You told me to sleep in here!
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
I took a sleeping pill.
I just I must have, you know,
stumbled in here by accident.
- Why were you spooning me?
- Why were you backing up into me?
Hey. You know what?
When you get spooned, you back in.
That's the way I was raised.
And to think you accused
me of being overly jealous.
What, were you just...
You just walked into my house?
- You're in bed with another man.
- Please. It's not a man. It's Gary.
Exactly!
She's right, Krandall. Nothing happened.
It was just like when we were married.
Mom, where...
- What is everybody doing in here?
- Bear claw, Louise?
- Can i, mom?
- Yeah, grab one for your brother.
Thank you, dr. Krandall.
Our ride to school is here.
Have a great day.
Tommy, I have no clue what's going on in
here, but we get sugar for breakfast!
Remember, honey,
family stuff is private!
Look. Walter, I know what this must
look like, but you have to believe us.
This was an accident.
I know exactly what it looks like,
and it was no accident.
Wait a minute.
Don't throw away your marriage
with Allison. And most importantly,
you're gonna blow my shot at
getting back together with Jessica.
- Who is Jessica?
- It's the name he calls the house.
It's a prison thing.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and Jessica,
but there isn't gonna be a wedding.
Allison clearly isn't
ready to be my wife.
Walter, wait a minute!
You can't leave like this!
I believe I can, and I will!
My god, walter fell down the stairs!
Jessica, what have you done?
Walter, are you all right?
No, I'm fine.
I've never been good at storming out.
I have small feet
and a high center of gravity.
Excellent save on the bear claws,
Krandall.
Here, let me. Let me help you up.
No, leave me alone.
I'm gonna sit here and say my piece.
OK. Look. Walter, why would you
say I don't want to get married?
Because every one of your actions,
starting with flooding Gary's house,
is explainable on a subconscious level.
May I elaborate?
No. I don't think it's good
to elaborate after a fall.
Gary, come on. Walter, go on.
Gary told you not to run the dishwasher,
yet you did,
knowing it would flood his house
and he'd need a place to stay.
You're saying I did all
this deliberately just
so I could get him over here
and get into bed with him?
- Exactly.
- You're wrong.
The only reason Allison flooded
my house is because she lives
to make my life miserable,
and the only reason i'm here
is so she can make my life
miserable and save on gas.
No. Walter's right. I did this all
subconsciously knowing that Walter
was so jealous that if he
caught us in bed together, he would
call off the wedding.
God, it was all so deliberate.
Right down to the sleeping pills.
What is this,
an old episode of "quincy"?
You can say it, Mango.
You're not ready to get married.
No. No, don't say it, Mango.
- Don't say it.
- No, he's right.
I don't want to get married.
Sure, you do! Yes, you do!
Look how handsome this guy is.
You love him, he loves you,
and he's just.
He's two titanium hips away
from walking down the aisle.
It's like our whole relationship
was just a reaction
to my marriage with Gary, wasn't it?
Kiss her, Krandall. Kiss your woman.
Walter, you are a loving
and kind man, but I cannot marry
you just because you're, like,
the complete opposite of Gary.
I understand, Mango.
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't heartbroken.
But I'm gonna let you go,
and I'm gonna do it with dignity.
Starting now.
Cranberry, I'm gonna get you some ice.
Gary, would you help this wonderful,
sweet man to the sofa?
- Man, I can't believe it.
- No, I'm afraid she's gone, Gary.
This is where they've been
sending my "sports illustrated."
The baseball cards are done.
Well, let's see them. Let's see them.
What have we got? Harmon killebrew.
He's hot.
For what it's worth, you know,
i'm sorry you couldn't move
back into your old place. But, hey,
at least Allison didn't marry a guy
she wasn't in love with?
You see my crockpot?
It's over there.
Hey, dad. Hey, Dennis.
Your dad tells me you're
driving a Ferrari.
- I was driving a Ferrari. Was.
- What do you mean, was?
We were sitting outside
the lunchroom, and
I went inside to grab some milk, and...
she's gone.
Couldn't have been more than 30 seconds.
Whoever took her must have
known what he was doing.
You know, I never had to worry
about that with my old girlfriend.
I could leave Danielle anywhere.
You could leave my wife
on the front lawn with her robe open,
no one would take her.
Look. Son,
it's better to have driven a Ferrari
and lost than to have
never driven a Ferrari.
It's Danielle.
Looks like I'm back to riding the bus.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Hey guys, I saw your mom pull up.
So, put down your juice boxes,
close up your tabs You know,
let's go to your mom's house.
But you got to get the heck out of here.
You know, dad, you forgot all
about my cello practice yesterday.
Or did i?
And you forgot to remind
me about my science paper.
Sorry, hammer.
I talked to you about it last night.
You told me you finished it, so we're
gonna have to tell mom about that one.
Or do we?
Hey, guys, would you go wait in the car?
I got to talk to your dad for a second.
If we're gonna talk,
I need one of them as a witness.
I just wanted to remind
you that starting tomorrow
is that thing I told
you about last week.
Yeah, the thing.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
The thing. No. I don't know. I told you.
You want me to really
remember something, you have to
make it rhyme and turn it into
a Catchy tune.
I was hired to be a research
assistant on a project that's cool,
so I need you to drop off and
pick up the kids at their school
- for the next 6 weeks yeah.
- I can't do it.
What?
I'm renovating the mckenzie house,
big job.
That's a historic Landmark.
I got to be on site the whole time
and keep an eye on the workers.
This could really lead to
a lot more work, so, sorry,
you're gonna have to find somebody else.
That's too bad. Maybe you know
someone who could help me with these.
Yeah. I won them in a raffle.
- Laker tickets.
- They are. Yeah.
Of course, I don't think
they're very good seats because
they're behind a bench of some kind.
You win, you win, you win.
Lakers-cavaliers. You totally win.
Look. I'll drive the kids around
whenever you need me to,
I'll keep my ears open and my eyes open
for anybody that can help you part-time?
There are your tickets. It's never
a pleasure doing business with you.
I got to bring my air horn to the game.
Not you. I mean the actual one
that used to come in a can.
Well, have fun
with Dennis at the lakers.
All my orgasms were fakers
for the last 15 years

Look at these seats. These are way
better than the last time we went.
I know. Remember?
Our seats were terrible.
You put your binoculars
in front of my binoculars,
and we still couldn't
tell which dot was kobe.
We're gonna sit behind the bench.
Good morning, mr. Brooks.
Hi, Miss Peters.
I like to make all my workers feel good.
I give them a motivational
hug every morning.
That...
I'm not gonna let you down,
Miss peters. I appreciate the work,
and you're gonna find that my crew
is top-notch and professional.
Deja vu.
No. It's not deja vu, dad.
It's your fifth trip into the room.
That's not it. It's something else.
What is this place?
It's the Mckenzie house.
It's an historic Landmark.
This was owned by Hamish Mckenzie.
He was a shipping magnate
in the late 19th century.
The house was restored in 1975,
and before that,
it was a flophouse
for indigents and hippies.
That's it.
I lived here in'71.
You still got that big orgy room out
in the back yard with the giant doors?
You mean, the carriage house?
No. I'm pretty sure it was an orgy room.
I get a tax break by hiring him.
Pardon me. I'm looking for my...
- Gary, this is amazing.
- Yeah. I can't disagree.
- How long has it been?
- I don't know.
Probably since like, the last time
we saw each other which was when?
You don't recognize me, do you?
Throw a drink in my face.
See if it jogs my memory.
Anna! You're an...
Oh, my god, Anna!
You're Dennis' little sister Anna.
- It's good to see you again.
- You, too.
Anna, you were supposed
to be here an hour ago.
When you're late, you got to call me.
I'm sorry, Dennis, OK?
I was out looking for a job.
You want me off your couch, don't you?
On your couch? What's the matter?
You're not still living in Chicago?
No. I moved back after my
Jerk boyfriend dumped me.
Come on.
Who would dump you?
- Lots of guys.
- Really?
No. She's serious. Lots of guys...
lots.
Now, how'd the job search go today?
Well, I got one offer, but I don't want
to dress up like a cell phone
and hand out coupons at the racetrack.
Hey, hey, I might have a job for you.
Allison is looking for someone to
help out around the house
- part-time and with the kids.
- Really? That would be great.
How are Louise and Tom?
Fantastic and easily distracted,
in that order.
Allison, it's Gary,
the answer to all your problems,
except for you stretch marks
and your screechy voice.
We must've gotten
disconnected or something.
Here. You talk to her, OK?
Allison, hi. It's Anna Lopez.
I hear you're looking for somebody.
- What's wrong, Dennis?
- What's wrong?
Anna iback in town. You see,
I'm the oldest brother, and it's
my responsibility to look after her.
My dad said he'll murder me if
anything ever happens to her.
Your dad is not gonna murder you.
Latinos are very protective and literal.
I wasn't always
the oldest brother, Gary.
I'm starting later this afternoon.
Can you believe it?
- Hey, that's great.
- Thank you, Gary.
That's great. Save some
of that hug for Allison, OK?
Well, bye, Gary. See you, stupid.
Sorry to bother you, Gary. Louise
wanted me to come by and feed her fish.
She said you would forget.
Louise has fish?
- Come on in.
- Where's her room?
Right down the hall on the right.
It's the girly one.
How's it going over there?
Fantastic. Thank you so much
for getting me the job.
Of course. Come on. You're Dennis'
sister. I got to look out for you right?
Remember when you and
Dennis drove me to college
and you took me to the wrong Carolina?
Yeah. I still think you would've
done great at Clemson, though.
Yeah, but I didn't apply there,
and I didn't have anyplace to live,
so it would've made for
a rough freshman year.
But the job is great.
Allison is awesome,
and I guess I'll be over here a lot,
assuming the goldfish stay alive.
I don't know. We're having a bad
run in the fish world.
My toilet is known as
death's water slide.
So, this is your new house?
Yeah. It's kind of like my old house
took a dump and this one came out,
but it looks a little better with
a buzz. Can I get you a beer?
Well, I'm off the clock, and in a way,
you're my boss, so I guess I have to.
Well, congratulations.
Your first day with Allison.
You know, she's no picnic to work for,
and she's no picnic to be married to,
and she's certainly
not easy to go on a picnic
with when you're married to...
My gosh, am I speaking way too loudly?
I thought you were still the other room.
I thought I was supposed
to follow you in here.
Well, I'm glad you did
because I'm lazy. Here.
- Here's to getting to know each other.
- Here you go.
You know, I had a huge crush
on you when I was younger.
Really? I didn't know that.
I used to kiss my pillow
and pretend it was you.
What a coincidence. I used to kiss
Allison and pretend it was anyone else.
Are you nervous?
- You're trembling.
- I'm standing in the refrigerator.
Let me warm you up.
Wait. Come on, Anna. This is wrong.
You're Dennis' little sister. Come on.
Well, technically,
I'm not his little sister anymore.
I'm a grown woman,
or haven't you noticed?
Yeah. Boy, I noticed, OK?
I noticed. I noticed, I noticed.
Look. If we did go through
with this and this did happen.
Which I'm sure would be
one of the greatest things
to ever happen to me in my life,
and I am including
the time I rode behind Chuck Norris
on an escalator.
What if we broke up? Then Dennis,
his heart would be broken.
He's my best friend. I can't
let that happen to him. I'm sorry.
OK. You're right. You're a good friend.
I just wanted to fulfill an
innocent little fantasy where
I turned Gary Brooks
inside out with wild sex.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Is there any way you can
pretend for one little minute
that you're not my
brother's best friend?
Just one minute,
and I'll never bother you again.
Anna, you have to realize something. OK.
We should probably stop now.
No way. I got 48 seconds left.
I'm counting in my head.
45... 4 Hey!
I don't know how that snake
bit you on your tongue,
but I think I sucked out all the poison.
Whew! I better go find
that little bugger.
Dennis, I can explain.
You don't have to explain. I have eyes.
- Gary and I were just.
- Just
making me the happiest
older brother in the world.
Oh, my god...
I'm not following you. This is great.
Everyone in my family has been praying
that Anna would find a decent guy,
- and she finally did.
- Really? Who?
You, you knucklehead. Come on.
I'm gonna get out of here,
and you guys go back to doing
whatever it is you were doing.
That was weird, and you know what?
Now that the sense of danger
is out of it, it's really not even
that interesting anymore.
Oh, my gosh, Anna, last night
was amazing. I can't even believe it.
Morning, hon. I let you sleep in,
but you better get moving.
I did the laundry. Little thing, honey.
Would you mind emptying your pockets
before you throw stuff in the hamper?
I've been fishing change
- out of the dryer all morning.
- You did the laundry?
And the doctor called confirming
your appointment on friday.
Sweetie, could you let me know
when you make appointments
so I don't schedule stuff for the same
time? We're a team, right?
How long was I asleep?
This parlor room is
currently under renovation,
but this is where Mr. Mckenzie
took his breakfast,
drew up contracts,
and met with local merchants.
Yeah, and Dennis Hopper played
backgammon with frank zappa right there.
Pay him no mind.
That rumor is unsubstantiated.
Now, if everyone could just
head into the kitchen there...
Where.
Where tommy smothers
never made hash browns!
Hash brownies...
And yes, he did.
I think she's starting to dig me.
What's wrong?
Dad, it's Dennis' sister.
She's kind of making me a little crazy.
We hooked up like, 3 days ago, and she's
acting like we're a married couple.
That's the second
weddingi missed of yours.
No. We're not married, dad.
And that's the second divorce I missed.
Excuse me.
Hey, Gary, look who I found.
Sweetie, you forgot your lunch.
You'd forget your head
if it wasn't screwed on.
You know what? Thank you, but I'm gonna
go out to eat with the guys today, OK?
Restaurant food is full of salt,
and I like my Gary not puffy.
And I bought you some new underwear.
I thought you might like to try
a pair where the elastic band
is attached to the fabric.
How adorable are you guys?
I just want to eat you up.
I talked to mom and dad. They want all
to get together at grandma's for easter.
I can't wait for you to
meet our grandma, man. Me?
She's just gonna eat you with a spoon.
All right. What's with you people? Can't
you like somebody without eating them?
Stop it. I'll see you at dinner, OK,
and don't be late.
I'm making something special.
Bye, honey.
See you, stupid.
I've never seen Anna this happy before.
It's so great that she's with somebody
that's gonna treat her right,
- not like all the other guys.
- Yeah. You know what? To be fair,
we never heard all those
other guys' stories.
What are you doing here?
You don't have the kids today.
What, I have to have the
kids to walk into your house?
According to the court, yeah.
Look. I know you're working super
hard with school and everything, and
I really forced Dennis' sister down your
throat, so if it's a big inconvenience
it's not working for you,
i'm really sorry about that.
No. Anna is amazing.
I couldn't get along without her.
So, if she was to get angry and suddenly
leave town, that wouldn't be cool?
No. That wouldn't be cool. I mean,
I love her, and the kids love her.
The only thing that isn't cool is,
she started dating some crepy older guy.
You might know him. He's you!
Are you insane?
I finally find a perfect nanny.
Mary poppins comes floating down from
the sky. You're looking up her skirt.
She's smothering me, Allison.
She leaves "i love you, Gary"
post-its all over the house, right?
She draws hearts
on my mirrors with lipstick,
and she runs baths for me.
She rubs my feet.
What a bitch.
Look, Gary.
You cannot break up with her, OK?
If you dump her, she will dump me, and I
need her whole lot more than I need you.
- Well, find someone else.
- You are stuck, Gary, OK?
The only thing you could hope for is for
Anna to break up with you. That way,
Dennis won't be pissed at you,
and she won't leave me.
She's not gonna break up with me.
Who would leave this?
Me and any other woman with legs.
Why did you leave me?
Why did we get a divorce?
OK. There are boxes of transcripts,
Gary. You can read them?
Look.
If you want her to break up with you,
just stop being
first-date Gary, you know?
Be 10-years-Down-the-road Gary
with the open boxers at breakfast
and the peeing in the shower...
I get it.
And the gassy, scratchy, burpy, slurpy,
cutting-your-toenails-on-the-sofa Gary.
I get it! I'm a disgusting man!
How you doing?
Hey, sweetie, where you been?
At a bar. I know you probably
made dinner and everything,
but I already filled up on wings and
beer, and if you're mad, I don't care.
I'm not mad. I'll just put it in
the fridge, and you can have it later.
Don't feed it to me as left over
because I don't eat leftovers,
all right, and if you're mad about that,
I don't care.
I'm not mad.
You should eat whatever you want.
You know what? Maybe I don't
want to eat whatever I want.
What's with you? It seems like a totally
different guy just walked in the door.
Yeah. He did, OK, baby doll?
The real Gary Brooks just
walked in that door, all right?
Get used to it,
and if you're mad, I don't care.
Are you kidding?
I love it.
This means
that you are comfortable enough
in our relationship to be yourself.
We just took a huge leap forward today.
OK. All right. OK. I give.
- Timeout.
- Great.
I don't want to take a leap forward.
I just got out of a marriage,
and with you, it's like
I got back into another marriage.
It's like you're acting like my wife.
You mean, because I cook your
favorite food and take care
of you and make love to
you whenever you want?
Yeah. You're nothing like my wife.
It's been 3 days. Don't you think
this is a little intense?
Wait, wait. What are you saying?
Are you breaking up with me?
No. I'm not.
I would like you to break up with me.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.
- OK. Then, I'm breaking up with you.
Why?
Don't take this the wrong way.
You're beautiful, and I really like you,
but you're a teeny bit banas.
Here we go.
I'm getting the bana talk again.
Again? You've had the bana talk before?
Lots of times, and the bana talk
is the very first warning sign
there's something wrong.
- Anna, I didn't mean any...
- No. You blew it.
There's no coming back from banas.
- Hey, there he is.
- Talk to your sister?
Guess you didn't hear the big news.
I knew this was gonna happen, but I just
didn't think was gonna happen so soon.
- Dennis, Dennis...
- Wait, wait.
I'm gonna remember this moment forever,
and I want to make it perfect.
Wait.
Say the words I've been dying to hear.
- I dumped your sister.
- Those weren't them. Try again.
It didn't work out. I broke up with her.
That's all there is to it.
It's no big deal?
But you know what? You can't just treat
her like some toy and toss her aside.
You know, a real friend wouldn't
do that. You suck, and I quit.
We go somewhere and talk about this?
Anything you have to say to me
you can say in front of my friends,
- Your real friends?
- my real friends.
We picked 3 of these
guys up this morning.
Well, you know what? I trust them
a lot more than I trust you, Gary.
Dennis, look. It didn't work
out with me and your sister.
I tried to tell her that,
but she wouldn't listen, all right?
So it's her fault. Can you believe this,
guys? He's blaming my sister.
El Gary la hecha la culpa
a Anna porque se dejaron.
I knew that if we broke up,
it would break your heart,
and I don't want to do that to you, OK?
So it's my fault.
Can you believe this guy?
Creen este guey?
Ahora, Gary le hecha la culpa a Dennis.
To be fair,
there's two side to every story,
and I'm not sure my side
is being represented here.
Scusi, amigos.
Hermana de Dennis muy bonita pero
always aqui, aqui, aqui.
"Aqui, aqui, aqui."
I'm out of here.
Dennis, wait a second.
You said your sister was a handful,
- didn't you?
- Know what you're talking about.
You told me she got dumped by
"lots of guys, lots," your words.
We're a passionate culture.
That's all I know.
Didn't a part you want me
and your sister to work
out so you wouldn't have
to worry about her anymore?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
I got carried away. I got excited about
you being a part of our family.
Dennis, you're my best friend.
We already are family, OK?
Can't we just go back
to being you and me?
I don't know. What do you guys think?
4 of us think you should stay together,
3 are against,
and one of us thinks the
whole thing is kind of gay.
What do you think? That's 4 for staying
together 3 against, and one kind of gay.
I still got the laker tickets. We got
purple and gold paint here. We could
paint a big "l" on my chest.
Will you paint a big "a" on your chest?
Now it's unanimous.
We all think it's kind of gay.
- Oh, my gosh, dad!
- Hey, Gary.
You know Miss Peters.
- Yeah. Hi, Miss Peters.
- Mr. Brooks.
Yeah. Is my dad bothering you?
But you are kind of harshing my mellow.
Yeah. I'm gonna take a sick day.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Everything's gonna be okay, right?
I mean, buisnesses get audited
all the time, right?
Arthur wants you to relax,
Quit looking over his shoulder,
and go order us some dinner.
What do you have ESP?
You got that all from a look?
We're second cousins, man.
I'm telling you, son,
you gotta go down to Mexico yourself
and hide out until this
whole thing blows over.
You gave me that same advice when they
told me I had to repeat third grade.
OK. But if things don't work out,
and you need a new identity,
I got an x-acto knife
and a laminator in my van.
This is the only box of receipts
for Gary's painting
I could find at my house.
I hope it helps.
No, this doesn't help.
The audit is from'02-'04.
These are just receipts from 1995.
Look, Gary.
Why don't you just call Taylor?
- No. I'm not calling Taylor.
- Who's Taylor?
He's my little brother.
He's been doing Gary's
taxes for the last 10 years.
He's a financial genius.
MBA from harvard,
he was vice President of a fortune
500 company at the age of 26.
You can also read
about him in the Bible.
He did the apostles' taxes,
and he walked on water.
And also took the time year after year
to do your company's taxes for free.
Yeah, apparently, Allison,
you get what you pay for,
- because I'm being audited!
- Well.
Thank god, Dennis, that your cousin's
here. I'll never be able to thank you?
- When is your audit again?
- It's monday.
Monday?
Where is he going?
Gary, are you gonna stop being
so stubborn and just call my brother?
I'm not calling your brother, I'll tell
you why, I'm not. Give me the phone!
I'm not calling your brother. He always
acts like he's better than me, you know?
- Well, he is.
- He's not! He always talks down to me.
- He should.
- All right.
- Always makes me feel like I'm a loser.
- Gary, I mean...
All right! Enough, now.
I can't stand the guy. He's always
got some crazy nickname for me,
like boysen-Gary-pie or the Garinator.
Gary's. Truman.
Hey, go for Taylor!
Hi, Taylor.
It's your ex-brother-in-law Gary.
Yo, what's up, G force?
- Hey, T-Bone, it's your big sister.
- What's up, Alley Cat?
Yeah, look, g force here has
a little bit of a tax audit problem.
And he was wondering if
you could do him a favor.
No worries. Been looking for
a reason to get out to Cali, anyways.
No, don't come to Cali.
That's fine. I'll just mail you.
- I'll mail you all the receipts.
- It's too late. I'm already on a plane.
T-Bone out!
Well, looks like T-Bone is on his
way to see G force and Alley Cat.
That's really great. G force is
gonna go blow out his B-Rains.

Mom, they have a hamburger
that costs $23.

Bison, monk fish? Is there anything
on this menu I'm not trying to save?
I don't know, sweetheart, but there's
3 things on the menu right there
that you're not doing
a very good job of saving.
Why do we have to meet
your brother here? This is crazy.
Because this is the only place
he'll go to when he's in town.
He's a New Yorker now, Gary. There's
not a lot of things he likes about LA.
That's great. Maybe he can share
some of his insight with us.
It'd be very refreshing to hear
a New Yorker crap on LA. For a change.
Waitress, will you please
introduce me to those two engaging,
hip, VIP,
trend-setters over there? Wait!
That's my niece and my nephew!
I'm with them! Come here!
Come here, you little one.
You! Alley cat, look at you.
My goodness gracious.
You look like you've lost 190 pounds.
- What?
- I'm talking about this guy right here!
Yeah. The divorce? Look at you, Taylor.
You look like a million bucks.
That is because i'm sitting
next to Gary.
- May I get you something from the bar?
- Hi, brown eyes.
Yeah. I'd like a macallan'25,
3 ice cubes, a drizzle of club soda,
and if your phone number is on
the napkin, just know tomorrow
you get to choose where
we're going for breakfast.
The one year I don't do your taxes,
and you're in trouble with the irs.
Actually, Taylor,
i'm in trouble with the irs from
the years that you did do my taxes.
Look at this guy.
Already with the attitude.
I love it when he plays
so gruff with me.
Don't worry about the irs. I can take
care of that problem in my sleep.
The trick is you don't want
to let 'em smell the fear.
Speaking of smell, what are you wearing?
It's just fantastic.
Thanks. It's Clive Christian no. 1.
Over $2,000 a bottle.
I got it at a boutique in London.
It's amazing. Check this out.
Ivory soap. 49 cents.
- Got it at a big lots in Tarzana.
- Please.
Can we not compare smells for once, OK?
Have you met anybody cool lately,
uncle "T"?
Well, let's see. Do you consider
NFL superstar Eli Manning cool?
- That's him!
- You know Eli Manning?
I work with him.
I also work with Harrison Ford,
Shia Labeouf that is the winner
of the third season of "Survivor."
And... rae dawn chong!
Kind of peters out at the end there,
doesn't it?
So, Tom...
When are you gonna fly out to New York
and hang out with your uncle "T"?
- Can i, dad?
- We'll talk about it.
You can't expect your dad to
make a snap decision like that.
I told him to buy Google in 1998.
How's that going for you there, Gary?
- We could've been rich.
- It's true. But in Gary's defense...
Who's hungry? Let's order.
Hey, Taylor. You hungry?
Yeah. I'm still on New York Time,
so I'm kind of in the mood for sushi.
Actually, let's make it toshimi
I'm on a no-carb thing.
- Edame, miso soup, wasabi.
- Okey-dokey!
Am I gonna be OK with this
audit on monday, or what?
I think we're gonna be all right,
but can I ask you a simple business
philosophy question?
Do you hate making money?
Yes, I hate making money.
Well, then you are
doing everything right.
Why don't you use any of the tricks
or loopholes or mechanisms
- that I've set up for you?
- It's the tricks, loopholes,
and mechanisms that got me audited in
the first place. I'm a house painter.
You have my corporate headquarters
in the cayman islands.
That's completely legal.
You don't have to worry about
it till they come knocking.
They're knocking!
There's nothing here
they can ding you for.
Gary, you have to stop
thinking so small.
That is why you are where you are.
Where exactly am i, Taylor?
In a Tiny house with a Tiny
business and a Tiny life.
My life maybe Tiny,
Taylor, but I like it.
And I'll tell you what I don't like.
You. OK?
For 15 years, I put up with all your
putdowns because you were family,
but I don't have to anymore if I don't
want to, because we got divorced.
I think you're a Jerk, you're obnoxious,
you're a Jackass, and if I was you,
I would take my most expensive car
and I would drive it off
the tallest bridge in Manhattan!
That would be the maserati
and the triborough.
And I almost did that very thing on
the way to the airport.
What?
You're right about everything.
I'm a phony.
You're Rich.
You're supposed to be a phony.
You know, you don't get it.
I lost my job, I lost my accounts,
I lost my savings,
I am living on c credit cards.
Calm down, Taylor.
You're hyperventilating.
I got fi. I got fi. I got fired.
- Allison doesn't know.
- What?
Oh, my gosh.
What about all those cool cars?
Lee-leased.
What about your apartment,
the penthouse with the elevator?
Ee-ee-evicted.
What about that super-gorgeous
girl you were going out with?
Trans, trans, trans...
You were going out with a transvestite?
Transferred to London!
Oh, my gosh. All right, look. Come on.
Let's blow the dust off. Who cares?
Let's get back to the audit, what do
you say? Then we'll take the next step.
There's no next step. I neve
want to see another number again.
I'm a failure!
My accountant, Ladies and Gentlemen!
Leave me alone, and turn the light off.
If your voice was deeper, you'd sound
just like Allison on our wedding night.
Sorry. I was just trying
to lighten the mood.
- With a sex joke about my sister?
- I was wrong.
I was wrong. Look, this isn't you.
This isn't you at all.
No way, pal!
The Taylor I know is a winner!
You're a winner!
Now, let's go back downstairs.
Let's do those taxes,
attack the audit, let's kick some ass!
Come on, Taylor. Let's go! Let's go!
You're Kinda supposed to run after me.
I thought that was clear.
I can't. I can't do it anymore, Gary.
What do you mean you can't do it?
My audit is monday. You have to do it.
I'm a failure. My whole life is a lie.
I am so alone.
You're not alone. You have...
me.
You don't even like me.
Come on. I like you.
All right, my children like you.
All right?
I'm here for you, man.
Whatever you need, i'll do it for you.
Whatever it is that you need,
I'll help you.
Hold me.
I'll put the Tv on.
I'll make you some soup.
Hold me.
Run you a bath.
Get you a magazine.
I am a human being crying
out in desperation and need.
Just come here and hold me!
All right.
There, there.
You don't know what it's like
to be the family superstar.
You did it right, Gary.
You set the bar low for yourself.
Nobody ever expected great things out
of you, and you never disappointed them.
That's the toast you gave at my wedding.
Come on, Taylor. So what? You hit
a rough spot. That's not a big deal.
The important thing is you got to get
back out there, get back on the...
Is that your pants
and underpants on my dresser?
I don't deserve'em. They're the clothes
of success, and I am a failure.
I am a naked failure.
Put these on.
Oh, geez. Put 'em on! Don't!
I don't want to see that.
Excuse me.
How's the audit going?
Well, congratulations, Gary.
It only took you an hour to reduce one
of the most brilliant financial minds
in America to a frightened, insecure
mess, who won't put on his underwear.
I'm sorry. I stopped listening after
you said, "congratulations, Gary."
So... thank you.
Is he coming down to do my audit,
or what?
Who cares about your stupid audit.
My little brother is upstairs
in the fetal position.
- You have to do something.
- Why do I have to do anything?
You broke him, Gary, you fix him.
That guy got broke all by himself.
He's your brother. You help him.
I tried to get him to come home with me,
he doesn't want to leave your bedroom,
I don't know what to tell him because,
of course I can't relate to that at all.
Look, Gary. I think the best thing for
Taylor right now is just to stay busy.
And that is why I told him you
were gonna put him
- to work on one of your paint crews.
- What?
No. Are you out of your mind?
You think anybody
can put a paintbrush
in a paint can and put paint on?
All right, let me start over.
I don't want him on one
of my paint crews. I don't like the guy.
- Where's your compassion?
- You got it in the divorce!
Hey. Did something
happen to uncle Taylor?
Honey, your uncle Taylor
lost his job and his money.
And his mind.
Well, he did.
So he had a breakdown?
Yeah. It's OK, though.
You know, it happens
when people have real high-pressure
jobs and they work with a lot of money.
- So it could happen to you?
- Well... What?
Your dad is safe, honey.
But look, don't worry about uncle
Taylor, OK, because your dad
is gonna put him on one of his paint
crews to help him get back on his feet.
Then when he's on his feet,
we'll buy him a pair of shoes
so he can walk back to the airport
and go home.
But dad, come on. He's family.
You have to help him.
Is he gonna help me?
Look, be out front tomorrow
morning at 6 am, OK?
6 am? What, are we coal miners?
It's pretty simple. You take the brush,
you dip it in the paint, OK,
then you take the paint that's on
the brush and put it on the wall,
just like that, OK?
What happens if I get paint on
the clothes that you gave me?
Nobody cares about that. Listen,
the roller is when you want
to cover more area faster.
You just roll it right up
and down like that.
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?
What happens if I get paint
on the shoes that you gave me?
Nobody cares. Nobody cares if you get
paint look, hey. OK? Look. Great.
We're painters. Now, look.
Put your hand here. I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna walk you through it. Come on.
There you go. Now, when you paint,
you just go up and down.
You can do it all by yourself.
I'm gonna let go on the count of 3, OK?
1, 2... look at that!
You're doing it all by yourself!
I don't know, Gary. I don't think your
ex-brother-in-law's cut out for this.
Of course he's not cut out for this.
That's the point.
He does this, he goes crazy, and then
he begs me to go back to doing my taxes.
Hey, you're really getting
the hang of it now!
What happens when
I finish the entire wall?
Don't worry, there's like 3 other rooms
in this house we have to get to, OK?
- It's so repetive.
- Yes, it's very,
very repetitive. Every minute
is just like the minute before it, every
day is just like he day before that.
It's just all the same,
just day after day.
And there's thousands of walls to paint,
so just turn off your brain and live
your life one boring stroke at a time.
I quit.
That speech wasn't for you, dad.
That speech was for Taylor.
I'm just trying to freak
him out a little you know?
Right. And I'm proud of you
for helping him out, son.
Thanks, dad.
You know, you have a great,
big, oversized heart?
That's why i'm helping him, you think?
No. It's something I keep
forgetting to tell you. It's hereditary.
I'm gonna go to orange county.
I have a job.
If this guy starts crunching numbers,
you call me immediately, OK?
Check. And you should see
a cardiologist twice a year.
- What happened in here?
- We're done.
I mean, you're really done? Like you
covered up all of Taylor's mistakes?
We didn't have to. I've never
seen a guy take to a roller like that.
Yeah. And he actually painted two coats,
you know and didn't just say he did like
I do.
Hey. Beautiful job on
the ceiling in the bedroom.
Jack attack, I love the kitchen. Emerald
green was definitely the way to go.
Excuse me. Emerald green?
No, no. The kitchen's supposed
to be butterscotch sunset.
It just wasn't in my gut. Sometimes
you got to think outside the box, Gary.
No, no, you don't. We're painters.
We show up, we see the box, we paint it,
that's it, we're done. The box.
It's the best job I've ever had.
Look, Taylor. What the heck happened?
When I left here two hours ago,
you were holding the roller
like it was a urine sample.
I don't know. I just...
I fell in love with painting.
The silky texture, the smell,
the challenge of an unpainted wall.
When I go to bed tonight,
I am going to dream of painting.
God, Gary. Was that me?
Was I ever that young?
Garinator, you have saved my life. Now
I know why you love this job so much.
It's so... zen, so simple,
so primitive. It's like
a Monkey could do it.
Look, Taylor, I told Allison
and Tommy that I would
do right by you and I am.
- Great!
- You're fired.
- Fired?
- You're fired.
I thought the conversation was gonna
go a whole different direction.
You don't belong here, man.
You got a brilliant mind for numbers.
This job would squash you like a bug.
Come on. It's so repetive.
Every day painting and sanding,
painting and sanding,
watching the whole
world just pass you by.
I quit.
And this time I really mean it.
All right. Come on, Taylor. You got
knocked on your butt, but you gotta
get up and brush yourself off and
use that mind for what
it was made for wall street.
I don't care what you say.
This is my life now.
And if you don't want me, I will
find a paint crew out there who does.
OK, Taylor, you win.
- You're hired.
- Oh, yeah?
All right. Congratulations,
working man. You get to
wash your hands with soap that hurts.
You'll get a check next week,
but in the meantime, here... let me see.
- There's your money.
- What is this?
That's a day's pay.
- A day's pay?
- Yeah. - Hold on a second. Yeah.
I gave you too much. I overpaid you.
- Overpaid?
- I mean, it doesn't seem like much now,
but you have to imagine
it multiplied by 6 more days.
Did the rest of it go to my 401k?
Look at that.
It's Shia Labeouf.
You ready to get back on the horse,
wall street man?
Shia, hold on one second.
I will be ready
for your audit on monday.
They are gonna regret
the day they ever met me.
I know the feeling.
Shia-nola,
how'd you know I was on the left coast?
My accountant, Ladies and Gentlemen!
Hey, Allison, I just dropped
your brother off at the airport.
He told me to give you a big kiss. We'll
just lie and we'll say we did that.
- How'd the audit go?
- It was amazing.
It was T-Bone at his T-Boniest!
- Wait, did he beat them up?
- Did he beat'em up?
They kept leaving the room.
Two guys left,
one guy left
I'm pretty sure just to cry.
All right? I went into that audit
owing thousands of dollars,
I came out of the audit because
of your brother
with a check for 83 bucks.
That's great, 'cause I just got
a bill for one of Louise's classes.
All right. Just take it.

Oh, my gosh.
Louise, why are you practicing so late?
I'm sorry, dad.
I forgot this was your Tv time.
All right. Look, you know,
I got the premium package, I told you.
If I don't watch 5 hours of tv a day,
i'm throwing money out the window.
I have to practice. Grandma and grandpa
are coming for my recital tomorrow.
- You remember my recital, right?
- Remember?
Are you kidding me?
I'm your Roadie, man.
Sound check is at 11:00 sharp.
And sober, all right?
How come you didn't practice
this earlier, you know?
Well, I had choir practice after school,
then volleyball.
Then I had to study for my geography
test, and then I had my math tutor.
That's too much stuff, Louise. When
are you gonna take time to be a kid?
In my late 30s, like you.
I'd ground you for that, but then
I wouldn't have anybody to play with.
I'm gonna go watch baseball.
Play me out.
Charge!

[Sub-way.fr]
- I can't take this.
- Look, it's almost over.
Louise is gonna be playing.
Dear god. She's freaking last!
- I'm making a break for it.
- What?
Act natural. Be cool. Be cool.
Take a break.
Take a break.
Go back. Go back.
This concludes our concert.
I think all of your children were
simply marvelous, and I look forward
to seeing all of you at the next recital
at the mcmartins'house next week.
What?!
Should I bring? Ham?
Jello salad?
I'll start working on both.
Oh, my gosh. I don't mind listening
to my own daughter, but
3 hours of listening to other kids?
I was willing my appendix to burst.
I'll tell you one good thing
that came out of that recital.
I don't fear death anymore.
You've got a real prodigy
on your hands, Allison.
Please don't squander her
talents the way you did yours.
OK, look, mom, I was never going
to become an Olympic gymnast.
I have bad depth perception.
Fine. So gymnastics wasn't your thing.
But you were an excellent swimmer.
I was.
With your tiny breasts
and your huge feet,
you could glide through
that water like a little seal.
OK, look, mom, no one is
squandering Louise's talents, OK?
We both encourage her to
explore all of her interests.
Did I tell you she's starting
Mandarin lessons tomorrow?
What? You didn't tell me.
My granddaughter,
the concert cellist who speaks Chinese.
I can't wait to whip that one
out when my neighbor brags
about her blind daughter
who climbed everest.
Time out. Wait a second here.
Why does Louise have to take Chinese?
When the Chinese take over the world,
they're gonna teach it to us
all for free in the reeducation camps.
Louise is an exceptional child.
She needs to stay stimulated.
Yeah, but she's too stimulated.
You know, she's got volleyball
and cello and now Chinese?
I mean, she's pretty.
She doesn't have to be smart.
She's taking Mandarin.
- Maybe she's not.
- Maybe she is.
Maybe I'll pull out
the big gun on this one.
Please. What,
you're gonna pull out your veto here?
- Try me.
- What are you two talking about?
When we were in marriage counseling,
they gave us a tool to get
through deadlocks the veto.
You get one a year, it's ironclad,
and the other one has to honor it.
Hey, maybe we should.
Gary, think about this.
I mean, all the career opportunities
this could open up for Louise.
- A translator.
- Veto.
- Ambassador.
- Veto.
- International trade lawyer?
- Wait a second. What was that last one?
- International.
- Veto.
- The veto is finito.
- All right, fine,
- but that is your veto for the year.
- Great. Fine with me.
I would do it again if I had to.
Sayonara, Chinese.
- That's Japanese.
- I guess we'll never know, will we?
Hey, mom,
when is the recital gonna start?
It's over, Tommy.
You slept through the whole thing.
But I was here, so it counts, right?
Yes, you were here. You were here
and accounted for. That counts.
All right. I'm gonna go tell Louise
she was great. She was, wasn't she?
You know,
rather than focusing on Louise,
you might want to
spend some time on Tom.
Now, that's a boy that needs
to be interested in something.
Tommy's good at a lot of things.
He's got hobbies, you know?
He, he can fall asleep anywhere.
You know?
Hey, what about golf?
I was gonna play 18 holes
at rancho tomorrow, and I was
may I please play
18 holes at rancho tomorrow?
Hey, you know,
that's a great idea, Charlie.
Let's get Tommy interested in golf.
Can we play?
All right.
But no beer, no cigars,
and it wouldn't kill you
to walk the course.
If it would, i'd walk it.
Well, Tom, welcome to heaven on earth.
What makes you think
I'm gonna like golf so much?
Because every guy loves golf.
Hey, you're walking around
in the great outdoors.
- You're drinking beer. You're cussing.
- Yeah. I like the hell out of that.
- How about no cussing today?
- Can I have a beer?
So basically we're just
in the great outdoors?
Yeah. Have fun.
I'm just gonna sit over here
and study for my history test.
OK, Tom. I want you to bend your knees.
Keep your head down.
All right, eyes on the ball
and make sure you follow through.
Are you OK, dad?
No, I'm not OK!
The ball hit me on my neck!
Tom, you can't learn golf that quickly.
You got to keep trying.
Here we go. Try it again.
Here we go.
Sorry.
In 35 years of golf,
I have never seen anyone lose a shoe.
I guess I'm trying too hard?
Yeah, well,
that's the spin we'll put on it.
Now, from now on, what I want
you to do is to really concentrate
on keeping your feet planted.
Yes! I hit it further than Tom.
Nice shot, Louise.
I'd like to see you ricochet one off
the wall and then hit dad in the neck.
So, Louise,
why don't you try hitting another one?
- I lost it.
- It's not coming down.
I hit that sign. Sorry.
That's OK. That's just
put out there so people know
how far away 200 yards is.
So how long has
your daughter been playing?
Including today? One minute.
Don't beat yourself up over it, Tom, OK?
I know, but that guy seemed
really mad about his windshield.
Right. Look,
forget about it. He'll get over it.
Bentley, very common car.
Nobody learns golf and is good
at it on the first try. Nobody...
- Hey, look, Tom. Check it out.
- Stop showing off, Louise.
I'm still gonna get
my license before you.
You realize you have to
take a test for that, right?
A test?
I did it, Charlie.
I'm a golf dad.
You know, Tiger Woods bought his
paren a mansion and cars and trips.
I know I'm just the grandfather,
but, Louise knows I love her, right?
Listen, I've got to run this by Allison.
We got to get her into lessons.
Yeah, right. Allison. You know,
I don't think she's gonna
be quite as thrilled as we are.
Wait. Why not?
When Allie was younger, I tried to
get her interested in golf
by sort of, shoving it down her throat.
- She never told me that.
- Yeah, it ended kind of ugly.
I think it really peaked when she ran
away from golf camp down in Florida.
She was never the same
sweet little 9-year-old
after they pulled her out
of the everglades.
- No wonder she hates golf.
- And leeches.
God. She's got to go along
with this golf thing. I just...
I wish I didn't veto
chinese the way that I did.
Yeah, well,
you did lay it on pretty thick.
I love to torture Allison.
If only there was a way I could get
her to use her veto on something else.
- Wait a minute. What did you just say?
- I love to torture Allison.
No, after that.
I should get her to use
her veto on something else.
- That is a great idea.
- That's what I should do, right?
Good grief. What is that horrible noise?
Sounds like some nut on a motorcycle.
And it seems to be getting louder,
doesn't it?
- Was that Gary?
- Come on. He's in the garage.
Gary! What the hell are you doing?
I bought Tom a dirt bike.
OK, wait a minute.
So you bought our son a motorcycle.
You said get him interested in
something. He'll be interested in this.
Are you a complete idiot?
Dirt bikes are dangerous.
This is the single most irresponsible
act of parenting I have ever seen.
Boy, if I could,
I would veto the hell out of this.
Don't say that. Don't say that, Charlie.
Come on. Stay out of it.
This is about my son becoming a man, OK?
- No. Dad's right.
- Allison, please,
- don't use your veto on the motorcycle.
- Sorry. You know what? I have to.
- Hold on, dear.
- What?
Now, I can't put my finger on it, but
there's something weird going on here,
Gary and Charlie is doing
that bad acting thing
he does every time he wants
to get away with something.
What? Are you saying my concern
the well-being
of my grandson is just an act?
Well, how dare you!
All right, what's going on?
Why are you trying so hard
to get me to use my veto?
What? No, I don't want you to
use your veto on a dirt bike.
OK. All right. Fine.
- What are you doing?
- What?
You think Tommy should ride
a dirt bike, then that's what he'll do.
Good. Then you call him.
Get him down here.
- What's going on?
- Look what your dad got you.
- You bought me a dirt bike?
- You betcha.
- Mom, you're OK with this?
- Yeah.
If your dad thinks it's a good
idea, then it must be a good idea.
- Is it, dad?
- It's a real good idea, Tommy.
- Mom?
- Come on, Tommy.
Get up there. I mean,
what's the worst that can happen?
Having to learn how to type
with a pencil taped to my nose?
- Come on, Tommy. Jump inside.
- Yeah. Get on the bike, Tom.
All right. Look at you?
Look how great he looks up there, Gary.
Right?
- Why don't you start it up, sweetie?
- Yeah, Tom. Start your new dirt bike.
Be a man.
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- What? What? What?
What? Come on. Come on.
Don't be afraid. Get back up there.
You know, I heard something weird
with the axle rows connector.
You can't ride this
until I get it checked out, Tom.
Thank god.
I don't know what's going on here,
but I don't like it.
Nothing, nothing is going on here,
Allison, OK?
The only problem with that motorcycle
it's not big enough.
I've got to buy him a bigger
motorcycle and a knife.
Am I the only one left sane around here?
Fore!
Nice.
- Louise, nice shot.
- Thanks, mom.
- That's my third one in a row.
- That's great, honey.
3 in a row. That is great.
- Veto!
- What?
- Are you vetoing paper cups?
- No. Gary, i'm vetoing golf.
That's what this was all about?
You want Louise to play golf?
I'm telling you. My daughter
is not playing that awful sport.
You've got to see how good she is. She's
phenom. She's amazing. Don't veto golf.
You know what? She would have
been really good at Chinese, too.
Come on. A billion people speak Chinese.
Why do you need one more?
Veto!
Please! Finally it's an activity
that I can enjoy with my daughter,
- something I'm interested in.
- All right. So
if it really means
that much to you, maybe I can veto it!
Allie, why don't you do it for me?
Let's not kid each other here.
I'm not getting any younger,
and I would love to see
my little Louise play golf
before the big guy signs my scorecard.
Please.
You'll die when i'm done with you.
That's it, Charlie.
It's the death of a dream.
I saw it all.
I saw little Louise playing
in the dinah shore classic.
On the 18th hole, she sinks a 30-footer.
The place goes crazy, and she looks
right into the camera and goes,
"that was for my dad."
And then
she tosses me the keys
to a brand-new saturn she won.
Look at me, Gary.
What do you see?
A guy with a mustache that's...
mostly nose hair.
Gary, it's you in 20 years
if you don't do something to change it.
Ghost of Gary future,
it's you I fear most of all.
Come on. Charlie, I'm sorry
I disappointed you, but it's the veto.
- It's the one thing we have to respect.
- Knot up, betty.
This is bigger than any
stupid little agreement.
We're talking about Louisa's
future. Look.
I bet you can't name
me one famous cellist.
- Yo-yo ma.
- You see? You see?
You see? Because there aren't any.
But you can rattle on, like,
famous golfers all day long.
And maybe one of those
names could be Lulu Brooks.
- Lulu?
- Lulu. See, it chants a lot better.
- Lulu.
- Hey, it's up to you, Gary.
I leave it up to you.
But when you're my age, do you want
to be looking back at sundays
spent in some stuffy old concert hall
or walking the links
of pebble beach half in the bag?
- Nice shot, dad.
- Thanks, sweetheart.
I still feel weird about
skipping cello practice.
Well, we all do things we feel
weird about that might be wrong.
After a while, that feeling goes away.
And if the feeling goes away,
was it every really wrong?
Great. Louise, why don't you go practice
some chip shots out of the sand trap?
And remember.
I know. Hit two inches behind
the ball and follow through.
Don't tell the boy,
but she's my favorite now.
- It's Connie.
- Don't answer it.
Don't worry. I got it covered.
Connie had me record Louise's
recital the other day.
Something about memories.
Hey, buttercup.
Just calling to see how Louise's
cello practice is going.
It's wonderful.
I'm so proud of our little Angel.
You should see her.
She's playing like a pro.
I am so happy you wanted
to go to Louise's cello practice.
It's not like you.
Well, it's the new me, buttercup.
You know, I think i'm gonna
be going to a lot of
Louise's practices from now on.
Put your hat back on.
You're not supposed to get sun.
All right. Thanks, dear.
We're dead.
What? Why?
Great.
It's the two horsemen of the apocalypse.
It was Gary's idea.
He told me if I didn't play along,
i'd lose my social security.
How did you guys find us?
Louise's cello teacher
called asking where she was.
Cello? Oh cello.
When you said take her to cello,
I thought you said take her to golf.
Mom said you guys would be out here
playing golf, and I said, "of course not
"because Gary would
never do that because I vetoed golf,"
and veto is the one thing
that we both respect, Gary.
How am I supposed to
ever trust you again?
What? I don't know what
you're saying. I'm sorry.
He thinks you're playing his ball.
I'm not playing his ball.
I'm playing my ball. Look. That's my...
I forgive you, Gary.
Come on, honey, let's go.
Time out.
I'm curious as to how my daughter is
fluent in a language that I vetoed.
I don't know. Kids.
What, did you pick it up off the street?
- They're like little sponges, you know.
- Yeah, time out.
Back it up.
Whatever happened to "Gary, the veto
is the only thing we have to respect"?
OK. I ignored your veto, OK?
But you ignored mine.
But you ignored my veto first.
My veto was finito.
- You didn't know that, so technically.
- Enough!
Who cares who did what first?
The point is, you should be celebrating
the fact that you both had a hand
in creating this incredibly
wonderfully talented child.
Well, you're right, Connie.
Thanks, mom.
That's a sweet thing to say.
I would have killed to have had
a child with a fraction of this talent.
- Get the clubs.
- Yes, dear.
Gary, I'm taking Louise to cello now.
You can pick her up at 1:30,
take her to volleyball practice.
And tomorrow she has debate before
school, so you have to take her early.
And then saturday i'm taking her to
golf from 7:00 in the morning to noon.
But be sure to pop in a Chinese
tape on the way to the course
so she'll be ready for her
wednesday night lesson.
Is it too late to veto
having a second child?
I'm kidding. What? She's enriched
our lives in so many wonderful ways.
Come on, mommy. Grandma's in the car.
She says if we don't hurry up,
she's gonna go ahead and smoke.
Coming.
Well, Gary, it looks like
you may get to walk the links
of pebble beach after all,
there, golf dad.
Thank you. You know what?
Thanks for giving me the courage
to break that veto agreement, you know?
If only there was something we could
find for Tommy that he's good at.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, son.
There's got to be
something he's good at.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Look, your father is going to hang
those in your room tonight.
I don't want to hear
another word about it.
Gary, would you please tell them they
can use these activity boards I bought?
Use your activity boards
that she bought.
Yes but Dad,
tell her I'm too old for this.
Tom is too old for that.
Can your turn off the Tv, and show a
little interest in your children's life.
Tell your mother I'll show interest
in your life when there's a commercial.
You're watching a commercial.
Hey, when Billy Mays yells, I listen.
Gary? Gary,
I need you to hang these boards.
They're a great motivator
and will help keep the kids organized.
Why do they need these boards here?
Don't they have them at your house?
That's the point. It's all part of
my household continuity project.
Does that fall under the umbrella of
your "ruin Gary's life" initiative?
No, I already finished that.
I came in ahead of schedule
and under budget, thank you.
I know, I know. No, Gary.
I read a book on this, OK? Continuity
between homes makes transitions
Less Jarring for children of divorce.
Do you guys Feel Jarred?
Any other imaginary emotions
you want to pin on me?
Guys, why don't you just go
put those in your rooms, OK?
How am I supposed to play
you two against each other
if both my houses are equally lame?
Dad, Ms. Plummer said that she's going
out with you again tomorrow night.
Ms. Plummer said that
in front the class?
No, she told me in private.
Dad, please don't mess this up.
I have her for one more year.
I don't want to get a bad grade
just because I have your eyes.
Gary, i'm gonna need a key 'cause
I'm gonna be coming and going a lot.
- What?
- What? Since I broke up with Walter,
I finally have the time to make
this place work better for the kids.
No. You cannot have a key.
See, when I moved out of the house,
I kind of under the impression
I wouldnt have to see you as much.
That's how the judge sold
me on the whole divorce thing.
I wouldn't have to do
any of this at all if you
and the house weren't
a constant work in progress. I mean,
seriously when was the last time
you did anything to fix this place up?
You're right, Allison. But, you know,
I was gonna surprise you with this,
but since we're talking about it,
I'll show you. I did something
to spruce the house up.
But it's outside. Let me show you.
Just go to the... That's much better.

" Gary Hooks Up Allison "
Sub VO :   ¤Aka¤
Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way.fr]
I don't know, Gary. I've got to get up
pretty early in the morning.
- I sure had a good time, ms. Plummer.
- Well, Gary,
you've got to stop calling me
Ms. Plummer.
- You're not one of my students.
- I can't help it.
Like the incomparable David Lee roth
says, I guess I'm just hot for teacher.
- I'll stay for one drink.
- Attagirl.
That's the spirit and, you know, and
I don't know if you know this or not,
but this is our fourth date,
and I think there's some kind
of law that something's supposed
to happen after a third date.
I'm pretty sure that's not a law.
I'm pretty sure it is a law, you know,
and I've gotten out of jury duty
7 times. I know a lot about the law.
So I get the feeling you like me.
I wouldn't have sat through a two-hour,
one-woman show if I didn't like you.
Come on. You've got to admit,
Shirley Maclaine
as had a fascinating life.
Yeah, it was fascinating.
I just wish her one-woman show
was performed by a bunch
of guys throwing a football.
Well, you were a very good sport.
I was, wasn't i?
- Hey, Gar.
- Hey, Joan.
- Allison, I... We just were, Hey.
- Don't worry about it.
I've seen Gary attempt to
kiss other people before.
- What are you doing here?!
- I told you about this.
I found bookcases for Louise's room that
are exactly like the ones at my house,
and i'm just putting them together.
- Go! Come on! Get out of here!
- Well, I just...
Soon as I get my carrot
muffins out of the oven.
And, Gary, the kids can have as many
of these as they want because
they're made with oat flour
and flaxseed and they're sweetened
with applesauce.
That's not a bad idea, you know that?
And I like what you're
saying about the flaxseeds,
so you're really speaking
my language on that one.
I think I should probably go.
No, no. Hey, I don't want you to go.
I want her to go.
She's over here all the time ever
since she Broke up with Krandall.
Yeah, but, Gary, she's obviously
trying to keep busy
because of the breakup.
She really needs your support right now.
I'll support her tomorrow.
I mean, we already
supported Shirley Maclaine.
How many crotchety old bags do
we have to prop up in one day?
Besides, I don't know if you know this,
but you were just 3 min away from 2 min
of ecstasy.
Sometimes the anticipation of the event
is more exciting than the event itself.
So my reputation
as a lovemaker precedes me.
Hey, Gary,
you got to taste these muffins.
The rest of your coffees
will be right up, Mr. Brooks.
Thanks, Lindsay. Remember Lindsay?
She baby-sat Tom and Louise?
Here you go. 8 quadruple-shot mochas.
Good luck on your murder spree.
It's for my paint crew.
We're painting a second story today.
After this, they won't need ladders.
Can't we just go back to
our regular coffee place?
This place creeps me out. Look.
They have pitchers of cream.
Call me old-fashioned,
but cream should be powder.
Well, Joan took me to this
place on one of our first dates.
She says that coffee tastes better if
you enjoy it in a place that's classy.
I'm classy, too.
Excuse me.
Other people are waiting here.
Yeah, but they're
keeping it to themselves.
Burn.
Yeah, I know how fascinating
stirring is to you painters,
but, could you finish it
at the job site, please?
That's amazing.
You guessed it. Did you
as a child dream of becoming
a coffee-shop job-guesser?
Double burn.
That guy makes me Ms. Krandall. At least
Krandall kept Allison out of my hair.
Maybe should find Allison another guy.
You know anybody could set her up with?
That's impossible. Any guy worthy of
Allison is already in prison or hell.
Smoke alarm! Fire! Fire!
Oh, my gosh! Tom! Louise!
Wake up! There's a fire!
Fire! Fire!
Allison, get down from there.
There's a fire.
Gary, that was just me. I'm changing
all the batteries in your smoke alarms.
- What time is it?
- It's 6:30.
Congratulations, Allison. This is the
earliest I've ever been pissed at you.
Gary, I'm sorry, but I have a spin class
at 7:00. It was the only time I had.
How do you get in here?! What, do I got
to put steel wool around the drainpipes?
That's a good idea.
I forgot all about that.
When are you gonna be done?
Well, as soon as we get
your life in order, so, no time soon.
Are you absolutely sure this is
the best way to get Allison a date?
Yeah. It's how I sold my waterbed.
That was a really tiny lesbian.
Mr. Brooks,
you can't put this in the window.
We have a pretty strict policy
against human trafficking.
All right.
Look, Lindsay, we're all against
human trafficking, but
that's Allison. There's probably a gray
area here somewhere, right?
All right.
This is great.
I'll never get rid of Allison now.
Why don't you just go to Ms. Plummer's?
- Can't. She has cats.
- What's wrong with cats?
I can't get naked in front of cats.
They bat things that dangle.
Looks like you're stuck in there
forever, unless you want to push.
Well done.
I would have figured it out without you.
I'm sorry I took that away from you.
I know how much you people
enjoy your little victories.
That guy's just like Krandall.
- Hey, he's just like Krandall.
- That's what I just said.
No, you could set him up with Allison.
You're right.
But I can't talk to that guy.
He's mean, he hates me, and he's spooky.
Just like Allison.
- Why don't you go talk to him, man?
- You're right.
- What are you reading?
- "Archaeology today."
Well, that's kind of weird.
Today, archaeology's about old stuff,
but it's today.
Yes, I suppose it is
a bit of an oxymoron.
You don't have to call me names.
Look, I think you and I got
off on the wrong foot and,
I'd like to maybe start over.
Let me ask you a question.
Are you, are you single?
- We're still on the wrong foot. Bye.
- I know. No, not for me.
For my ex-wife. See, she's single and I
think you guys would really hit it off.
You guys would be perfect together,
seriously.
Look, I'm flattered and,
more than a little frightened.
But, I'm not gonna go out
with some woman who...
Good god! She's stunning.
I just think you guys
would really hit it off.
You have so much in common.
You're smart. She's smart.
You're an archaeologist.
She's bony.
- You know what? I'd love to meet her.
- Great. You won't be sorry, initially.
Are you,
you're sure we have enough in common?
Here's your coffee. Anything else?
Yes, I'd like a carrot muffin and,
now, can you tell me, is that made
with oat flour and flaxseed?
I hear wedding bells!
Oh, my gosh. I totally forgot
we had a date. I'm sorry.
We don't.
All right, good. I say that all the time
anyway to be safe. Come on in.
So, what's going on?
Well, I just ran into a friend who gave
me two tickets to see
- "Don Giovanni."
- That's cool. Who's he fighting?
No, it's an opera, and I got box seats.
That's terrific.
You want to meet up afterwards?
Come on, Gary.
It'll be fun.
We can get all dressed up and stop
for a glass of wine on the way,
and then go see a great opera.
Is that the one
"kill the wabbit" is based on?
You're thinking of
"flight of the Valkyries."
I promise you i'm not.
So will you go?
Yeah, I think I'll go. Besides,
you know, afterwards,
we can come back here, and
that third-date rule
that's been dogging us,
we could probably figure
out the answer to that
'cause I don't think
Allison's gonna be here.
Why, because you killed her?
No. No, I think I found
the guy for Allison.
He's great. He's smart.
He's an intellectual.
I mean, he corrected my grammar
several times. Did you know that "Ravel"
means the same as "Unravel"?
You don't have to say the "un" at all.
I've wasted so much time.
I wish you would have told me that
you were looking to set Allison up
with someone. I know the perfect guy.
No, no. Here, sit.
This is the perfect guy.
I took his picture.
That's him right there.
His name is Edward.
What do you mean, "huh"?
You don't seem "thused."
Gary you can't do that with every word.
See, look.
Listen, there's this dad at school who I
think would be much better for Allison.
Do you know Andy Russell?
Yeah. The guy that runs
the spring carnival?
If you really want to set Allison up
with someone, I think you want Andy.
What the hell's this?
- I found it tacked to a telephone pole!
- What?
5 of the tabs are missing.
Actually, don't get ahead of yourself.
Only 3 are missing.
I had to pull 2 to get the ball
rolling so you didn't look desperate.
You said yourself you have
too much time on your hands since
you broke up with Krandall, and I've
noticed. You're taking it all out on me.
So you decided just to post
my picture around the city?
What are you, nuts? I already got
a call about a bachelor party!
If you have the kids that night,
I'll take'em.
All right.
Look, I was just trying to help out.
In fact, I think I found the perfect
guy for you at the coffee shop.
Well, but if he isn't,
I know somebody who might be.
OK, look, Joan, I'm sure
your intentions are good and, Gary,
I would ask what you're thinking,
but that implies that you can, so...
Allison, give me a break. It's just
I think you're kind of in a rut.
I'm sorry.
I am not in a rut, Gary.
If I want to meet a guy,
all I have to do is put on my red dress,
blow out my hair, and shake my cookies!
God, Gary! How dare you assume that just
because I've been spending days
and days here laying shelf
liner and hanging shoe trees
and making cubbies for the kids'
school that somehow I am unfulfilled?
All right. Send your top two picks
to the coffee shop tomorrow, OK?
No druggies, no fatties.
Is that your phone?
It's OK. I'm a doctor.
Yes, nurse. What is it?
- It's Lindsay.
- Lindsay, why are you calling me?
I'm so busy right now.
Because you promised you'd
pay me 20 bucks to call you
and tell you how
Allison's dates are going.
- Why are you whispering?
- I'm at the opera.
Are you painting it?
No, I'm not painting it!
Excuse me.
All right,
so what's going on over there?
Her date's going really well.
She's been sitting with
this guy for a long time.
Is it the carrot muffin guy?
Muffin man was shot down really quickly.
She's with more of a...
Jelly-filled-donut kind of guy.
Really?
They've been sitting here for two hours.
They're talking. They're laughing.
Thanks, Lindsay.
Good news. Allison found her man.
- It's Andy, isn't it?
- Yeah. How did you know she'd pick him?
Well, your guy was too perfect.
Women don't want someone who's
all finished. They want a fixer-upper.
That's ridiculous. Who would want a
fixer-upper when you could have Edward,
- a guy who's in move-in condition?
- Because it's no fun.
They want a guy who they can fix
up exactly the way they want them.
Fix their hair, fix their clothes,
you know, introduce them to new stuff.
New stuff li coffee shops,
one-woman shows, and the opera?
- What?
- Oh, my god, I'm your fixer-upper!
Now I'm in trouble.
Thank you. It's over.
It's just intermission.
And you are not my fixer-upper.
Sure, I am. I can totally see it.
Don't you see? I mean, for 15 years,
I was with a woman that all she wanted
to do was change me...
How I acted, how I behaved,
what I wore, the way I looked.
She was at my house this morning
trying to fix the way I live.
I can't do that again. I'm sorry.
I have to be me.
Yeah, but did it ever occur to you that
I was just trying to show you some of
the things that interested in so that
you could learn a little bit about me?
Sure that's how it starts but next
thing you know, I'm taking, like
ballroom dancing classes,
i'm learning another language,
i'm buying cheese from a store
that only sells cheese.
Where does it end? At the opera.
So, then, why did you even say
that you would come with me?
Because I thought it would led to sex.
You only came to the opera to get sex?
That's the only reason any guy goes to
the opera. What, do you think these guys
running around the theater.
That guy wants to be at the opera? No.
You think that guy wants
to be at the opera? No.
All right, these two guys,
they want to be at the opera.
I think we should just go.
Something's telling me you're not
dying to see how the story ends.
It's in French.
I don't even know how it begins.
- It's Italian!
- 'cause I speak Italian, right?
So, that went well.
Just get my bag so I can go home.
Sorry.
Why'd you leave your bag at my house?
Because I thought I was going
to be spending the night.
Tonight was the night you were gonna
sleep over, and I totally blew it?
Oh, my gosh.
You know, you look very pretty tonight.
- Get... my bag!
- Right. Sorry. Sorry.
Here you go. Look. Let's be honest.
I sat through half of the opera.
That's... I get nothing?
There. We're even.
Thanks.
- Hey, Gar.
- Why wouldn't you be here?
I've been drinking coffee for the past
two hours. I'm completely wired.
So I thought I'd come over
and finish up a couple things I started.
What happened to your date with Andy?
Yeah, that's over.
What do you mean it's over? I thought
you guys were really hitting it off.
We were, we were.
We were talking. We were connecting.
W were making plans for tomorrow
and I suggested maybe we could have
lunch, you know, get some coffee,
get some new clothes,
maybe get a haircut for him, you know.
I don't know.
Contact lenses? Look for a better condo?
And then he gets up,
he goes to the bathroom, and I never
see him again. Just don't get that.
You don't get it?
You don't get it? You just met the guy,
and already you want to change him?
What is it with you people?
It's like an addiction.
Look. I don't want to change him.
I you know, I want him just to be the...
The best damn andy he can be.
Why do women always want
to change guys and fix them up
and make them like new things?
You know where I just was all night?
I was at the opera.
Joan took me to the opera!
Were you painting it?
I wasn't painting it. I wish I was
painting it. I had to sit through it.
So what, Gary so what if she was
trying to help you learn and grow?
Want know what's wrong with that?
It's annoying that's why.
You know, I'll tell you what's annoying,
is when a guy has potential
and he won't let me work with it.
OK. You know what?
I, for one, don't want to be worked on.
Gary, you are never gonna get into
a lasting relationship if you're afraid
- to open yourself up to new things.
- What about you?
You're never gonna hang onto
a guy if you keep nagging him
to change stuff
that he doesn't want to change.
Gary, what if...
What if we both keep chasing people off?
You know, eventually,
we're gonna be the only two left.
We're gonna get back together,
aren't we?
You know what?
Don't say that. That's terrible.
Oh, my god.
OK. You know what? Either
I've had too much coffee the thought
of that just given me a heart attack.
Just calm down.
Allison, next time you go out with
a guy, just don't try to change him, OK?
Yeah. OK, I won't, unless.
Unless, there's something glaring,
like a gold chain or something.
OK! You're right!
You're right! All right. I'll just...
I will let them be who they are. OK.
And, Gary, you know what?
You can't be afraid to open
yourself up to new things, you know?
You're right.
You know what? Both of us have to start
cutting other people a lot more slack.
That might be the most grown-up
thing I think you've ever said.
Thank you.
Joan was here, and I'm still
a little revved up. You want to do it?
Nah, forget it.
I don't have 2 minutes, anyway. See you.
I wanted to talk to you about
the incomplete I got last night.
All grades are final.
I know I was a Jerk
and I was pompous and obnoxious...
Yes, you were.
- But I don't deserve a second chance?
- No, you don't.
But if you do give me a second chance...
I would love to take you
to see "Don Giovanni."
I want to know if Don Giovanni
is able to Lure Zerlina
away from her fiance Masetto.
Yeah, I can Google.
Well, aren't you afraid that I might
try and fix you up the way I want you?
Let's face it. I'm a tear-down.
Any repairs you want to
make is fine with me.
- Have you been to the ballet?
- Come on!
Team Subs-Addicts"
All right. No big deal.
Minor setback.
Easy spare, Gary.
Yeah, man. Pick this one up
and we're in the finals.
- That's right.
- How long has my name been on my shirt?
All year, dad. Everyone's name
is on the shirt. We're a team, OK?
Except yours is the only shirt
with your address and instructions
for a cab driver pinned
inside your collar.
- The championships.
- Way to go, dad.
Thanks, son.
You know, it just goes to show you,
you can do anything when
you put your mind to it.
Doesn't hurt that two of the other guys
on the other team got food poisoning.
Look, Louise,
they ordered sushi in a bowling alley.
They got what they deserved, OK?
Hey, dad,
why are those 4 guys staring at you?
The Kim brothers,
from Kim brothers flooring.
They won the championship
the last 4 years.
What did you do to them?
'cause they're looking
at you like mom does.
They're floor guys, Tom.
Floor guys hate painters.
Painters hate floor guys.
Why do we hate them?
Because they scuff
perfectly painted baseboards
with their buffers.
Painters have no respect for floors.
They leave splatters everywhere.
Man, I wish we were
playing them in the finals.
I'd love to kick their asses.
We are playing them in the finals.
Well... You know,
there ain't no shame in second place.
What kind of attitude is that, stuart?
Come on. We can beat the Kims.
We get that trophy, we can rub
their noses in it for a whole year.
I mean, what's second place,
dinner at the Rusty Anchor?
Rusty Anchor.
You know, you can smell that place
all the way from the freeway.
That's how you know it's good fish.
We not playing for that. We're playing
for the trophy. I want the trophy.
I want you guys to want the trophy,
and that's what we're gonna get
when we beat the Kims' butts!
Talk big, Brooks.
We'll see you on saturday.
Yeah, don't worry, Kim. We'll be there.
We're gonna wax the floor with you.
We're gonna paint the walls with you!
Two coats!
Yeah, you know you guys are just
describing your jobs, right?
Hey, son. Do me a favor.
Return my shoes, OK?
Goody.
They're still warm and humid.
You dropped your...
Book.
Thanks. I'm Ella.
I'm Tom.
What are you reading?
Pre-calc.
I read the sequel, "calc."
You're funny.
I got to go return these shoes, OK.
- So... bye.
- All right. Bye.
Ella, let's go.

" Gary and the Trophy "
Sub VO :   ¤Aka¤
Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way.fr]
Thanks for visiting Dadland.
Welcome back to momtopia,
where the fun never starts.
Hey, do they still have that ride at
Dadland where you sit on the couch
for 6 hours and watch
your life pass you by?
I'm gonna go take a shower.
I smell like popcorn, beer, and feet.
Wait a min. Gary, did you take
them to the bowling alley again?
It's a family fun center, OK?
And, yes, I did.
Dad's team won, mom.
They're in the championship.
- Who you playing?
- Kim brothers flooring.
Second place.
We're not getting second place
this year, Allison. We're winning.
OK? I don't know if you noticed.,
my team's undefeated.
Yeah, only because you had two forfeits,
Gary, OK?
And just before you played Dave's
Roofing, Dave's mother died.
She was their best bowler.
And they played their hearts out
in her loving memory, all right?
And we still spanked them.
Well, good luck beating
the Kims without me.
- I was the best bowler on the team.
- That's right, was.
You was the best bowler on the team, OK?
But now I was am the best
bowler on the team, OK?
I'm the best bowler on
the team because I'm free.
At last I don't have you counting my
beer or throwing away my chicken wings
or using hand sanitizer on
your bowling ball after every roll.
You know, there are more germs on
a bowling ball than a dog's rectum.
Look, I think you have to
find other hobbies aside
from figuring out what has
more germs than a dog's rectum.
You know, as much as it's killing me
not to be spending mondays and thursdays
at a bowling alley, wearing
somebody else's shoes Which, again,
dog's rectum Good luck
on the championship, Gary.
Why don't you just admit it? It's
killing you that you're not on the team
when we're in the championships.
Just admit it.
You wish you were back on the team.
Admit it.
- I hate that i'm not on the team.
- Just admit it.
I just did.
You took all the fun out of that.
Look, I liked being on the team, OK?
And I was a little hurt you didn't
ask me back, but I'm over it.
- All right, good.
- And you know what? I cannot wait
until you get your butts
shellacked by the Kim brothers.
Not gonna happen, OK?
Because with a little extra coaching,
my guys are gonna be fine.
But you stink as a coach, Gary.
I mean, a little extra's just gonna
make your team a little extra stinky.
I'm the world's greatest coach. I have
a coffee mug that says that on it.
Please. Gary,
I was on your team for 7 years.
Your only motivation technique
includes shots of booze.
When your team consists of problem
drinkers, that's very motivating.
We had a good practice,
you guys, OK? But
we got to step it up a notch. We got
to really focus and stay motivated, OK?
Motivated. That means shots.
No, no, no. Dennis, no shots.
Dennis, come on. No booze today.
But this is a coaching session.
We always have shots.
You created the monster, Gary.
You're gonna have to feed it.
No shots this time, OK?
I really want us to just focus
on the practice we just had.
It was pretty good, but we can improve.
For instance, OK, stuart?
You are rushing everything.
Well, if I take too long,
Dennis drinks my beer.
- I do not.
- I know you do, Dennis.
You're the only one
that wears lip gloss.
It is lip balm,
and it's very dry in here.
Guys, come on. Just, Now can you
knock it off? Sit down. Relax.
We gotta bring our "A" game to beat
the Kim brothers. Look at them in there
They're so precise. They never
take heir eyes off their pins.
Now's your chance, Dennis.
Go drink their beer.
I don't do that.
That's not meant to rush you.
I just want to make sure
I hold my place in line.
You know what? You have Skinny arms.
If you really want that elephant, you
could just reach up there and grab it.
I'll keep a lookout if you want.
You're so sweet, tom,
but we shouldn't be seen together.
Well, why not?
I mean, I made you laugh the other day,
remember, the whole "calc" bit?
I remember, and it was funny.
Adam-Sandler funny, but let's be honest.
My people hate your people.
You're talking about painters
and floorers, not, like,
Koreans and whatever I am, right?
You're cute, but I better go.
My dad would kill me
if he saw us together.
No. Don't follow.
It's way too dangerous.
But I have to.
My nachos are up.
OK, look, there's something I want to
try to really harness our attention.
I got just the thing for that.
Whoever's driving only gets half.
Dad, that's No, please. Dad?
Come on. This is different.
Mine involves visualization.
Well, my thing has that.
Dad? Can we try mine first, please?
Now, we're gonna visualize.
Everybody close your eyes.
It's the final frame
of the championships.
There we are, playing for that big,
beautiful trophy.
I'm up, last frame.
I roll the ball.
- It's a strike!
- Way to go, Gar.
Excellent.
Anybody else see the naked Indian?
No, dad. Just relax, OK?
Everybody keep your eyes closed.
Dennis, you're up.
Your turn to bowl, my friend.
All right, it's my turn
and I've gotand my ball
I'm ready to roll.
Then I hear stuart's nose whistle.
- What?
- Your nose whistles, man.
- My nose does not whistle!
- It always whistles, all right?
Every time you sneeze, kids all
over the city get out of the pool.
Yeah, well, you know what I visualize?
Dennis' stupid orange gloves.
This is my look, all right?
This is what I am
known for in the lanes.
Dude, you're known for
drinking other people's beer.
And wearing lipstick.
It's a balm, all right?
And you know what I see?
You standing over the hand dryer
and having it blow up your shorts.
Nobody pays any attention to that.
Nobody noticed the old, smiling
hippie straddling the ball return.
All right, all right. Come on.
Can we please just concentrate?
I'm trying to get us ready for the Kims.
On the count of 3, everybody just
take a deep breath and relax. 1, 2, 3.
Did you hear it?
- I definitely heard that.
- I heard that.
Sounds like the 7 dwarfs
are going to work.
Well, you know, don't make fun of stuart
because if there's a massive earthquake
and we're all covered in rubble,
it's that nose whistle
that's gonna lead the rescue dogs to us.
You guys knew I had sinus issues
when you asked me to join the team!
This isn't fun anymore.
I quit.
Stuart, what are you doing?
We're just kidding around!
You can't quit!
I need 4 people to fill out a team.
Sorry, Gary.
I'm hanging up my shoes.
I can eat at the Rusty Anchor
anytime I want!
That's not what we're playing for!
- Well, it's over.
- No, no, no. - I want that trophy.
I just got to figure out somebody
else to put on the team
- in his place, that's all.
- What about Allison?
Dad, the only time I ever
want to hear that sentence
is if we're on a life raft
and someone has to go.
We got to get her or we got to forfeit.
No. We're gonna get that trophy somehow.
Hey, Brooks,
I just called the Rusty Anchor
and made your team
a reservation for saturday night.
It's not what we're playing for.
Hey, don't worry, OK, Kim?
Cause we're gonna be there saturday
night. We're gonna beat you.
- Not with 3 players, you're not.
- Don't worry.
I got a fourth player,
and you better brace yourself,
'cause I'm unleashing
hell itself on you.
- How is Allison?
- She's good. I'll tell her you asked.
I can't believe it.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
I don't normally wear pajamas to bed.
Listen, I'm sorry for
running out of the arcade,
but I haven't been able to
stop thinking about you,
and I wanted to make sure you're going
to the bowling alley on saturday.
Yeah. I'll be there.
What about your dad?
I don't care what he thinks.
I just want us to hang out.
You want to come in for a second?
I have to be home
before it gets dark out.
Yeah, I got to hit
the rack pretty early, too.
I'm meeting with a marine
recruiter in the morning.
What is that, your Tv? Turn it off!
It's an hour past your bedtime!
- Good morning.
- It was.
Somebody woke up on the funny
side of the bed this morning.
Here, look. I got you a breakfast
sandwich. That's for you.
Gary, what do you want?
Nothing. I you know, I was thinking bout
what you said the other day bout wanting
to be back on the bowling team.
I said I was hurt. I never said
I wanted to be back on the team.
You're too proud to really admit
it, but I'm gonna make it easy for you.
I've decided to allow you
back onto the bowling team.
Why? What happened?
I just knew how much it
meant to you to be on the team.
And now that we're playing
the kim brothers in the finals,
we can win the championship,
get that big trophy.
I'm gonna let you be a part of that.
You are welcome.
Well, forget it, Gary. It's too late.
Yo don't want me before.
Why would I do that now?
But, look, OK. I'm gonna be
brutally honest with you here.
And this,
this doesn't leave this house, OK?
the team's not gelling like it used to,
and I'm thinking about cutting somebody
loose. I'm leaning towards Stuart.
Stuart? Really?
I think Dennis is the weak link here.
- No I think I'm gonna cut loose stuart.
- What about Jack?
- I mean It's gonna be Stuart, OK?
- OK, you know what, Gary?
You said you were having
a lot more fun without me,
you know, so I don't want
to ruin that for you.
We had a lot of fun when you and I were
on the same team. We had loads of fun.
Gary, all we ever did was fight.
Fight? That was just
harmless sports banter.
"If it wasn't for the kids, I would
leave you" is harmless sports banter?
I mean, obviously you've never
spent time in a locker room, but...
Look, I need you back on the team, OK?
Just come back on the team.
All right.
I will do it...
As long as you admit that I am
a better bowler than you.
It's a team sport, Allison.
It's not about individual achievements.
- Say it.
- I'm a better bowler than you.
Well, have fun at the Rusty Anchor.
Enjoy the catfish legs.
You're a better bowler than me, OK?
Thank you, thank you.
I will be there saturday night,
but please, would you get rid of Dennis?
I'd like to finish a beer.
It's gonna be historic!
Gosh, the Kims just pulled another
strike. They're like machines.
Maybe they are machines.
That would make a lot of sense.
Would it, dad, really?
Your whole life would just get tied
together if they were machines?
You just sanitized the ball when
you rolled it the last time.
Yeah, well, I don't know what happens
to it once it disappears back there.
All right. Here I go.
Would you go, already?! Go!
Gary! This is my process.
I can't just pick up a ball,
you know what? This is not my ball.
Have you noticed the score, Bbrooks?
I know painters aren't good at math,
but our score is higher than yours.
You're gonna need a lot more
than the highest score to beat us, Kim.
No, that's pretty much
how it works, Dennis.
I am on fire.
I wish you were.
- Are these somebody's?
- Those are mine.
- Why? Why didn't you say something?
- I just said those are mine.
- You threw in the garbage!
- Stop whining. It's your turn.
How am I whining? It's my food.
You threw my...
Gary, can I give you some advice?
Look, I'm just trying to help, OK?
We can still win this thing,
but I think you need a lighter ball.
- I don't need a lighter ball.
- You know what?
Men lose muscle mass
when they get older.
Stop. Just stop.
I don't need a lighter ball, OK?
Gosh! Look what you made me do now!
You would have more control
with a lighter ball.
I'll rember that the next time
I decide to bludgeon.
You know what, Gary?
You should be thanking me, OK?
I'm the only one that's
keeping us alive here.
I am the best bowler you have.
You're right, Allison. Thank you.
Thank you for making me miserable.
I can't bowl with you around.
I never could.
It's like you get inside my head and you
annoy all the talent out the other side.
Why did you want
me back on the team?
- I didn't! Stuart quit!
- Oh, crap.
Game over? 'cause we weren't supposed
to say that until the game's over.
What did you do?
What, did you just lie to me?
I wanted that trophy so bad, I thought
I could put up with you one night.
I was wrong.
Counting how many beers I've had,
throwing away my food,
sanitizing your ball,
doing that stupid ickey shuffle
before every time you roll the ball.
- I should have just forfeited.
- You know what?
- It's not too late.
- Where are you going? What?
No, you know what? Why don't you stay?
You're the queen of the lanes tonight.
You're the best bowler in the world.
You stay. I'll leave, OK?
But then what would we do
without our brilliant coach?
You'd probably sanitize the whole lanes.
That's what you've been doing all night.
You know what? If you want to
wallow in germs, be my guest.
- OK, think I will.
- That's nice.
Dog's rectum.
There it is. Dog's rectum.
Man, on attention, bowlers.
Would the party responsible for Tom
Brooks please report to the arcade?
The party responsible for Tom Brooks.
- Hey, mom.
- What happened?
I got my hand stuck in the claw machine.
Did you hear my name over
the announcement? It's pretty cool.
Why were you trying to steal
something out of the claw machine?
It's not stealing, mom. I put all my
money in it just for that red Teddy bear
but the claw wouldn't drop it.
What happened to you, Brooks?
What, are you bowling or forfeiting?
I'm dealing with my kid right now.
Why don't you leave me alone, all right?
This is your son?
Why am I not surprised?
What do you mean by that?
He's confused by
a machine with one button.
Don't make fun of him.
He was doing it for me.
- I like him, daddy.
- You're seeing bobby Kim's daughter?
You are not going to go out
with the son of a painter.
Excuse me.
Are you saying that my son isn't good
enough to go out with your daughter?
If you're talking about the kid with
his arm stuck in the machine,
yeah, that's what i'm saying.
Let me tell something Kim. You
can make fun of me and you can make fun
of my bowling team, my friends.
You can make fun of her all you want.
That's good. But listen,
when it comes to my kids, back off.
Yeah, that's right.
Our son is a bright young man who any
girl would be lucky to go out with.
Thanks, mom.
Is it loosening up at all?
Because my point would have
a better impact if you
weren't stuck in a prize slot.
Just tell your son to stay
away from my daughter.
You know what, Allison?
Maybe we should put our fighting aside
to take care of Kim brothers flooring.
Yeah, absolutely.
But then we're gonna pick up
right where we left off, right?
Definitely.
What do you say, Kim?
Let's get back out there
and settle this with our balls.
You know what he meant.
You don't put live animals in here,
do you?
Something's licking my finger.
Getting the feeling back
in your hand yet, son?
Yeah, my hand's still pretty sore.
You know, that's the last time
I do anything stupid for a girl.
Well, after your next 8 or 9
stupid things that you do,
you won't even bother
saying that anymore.
Ella was really sweet, Tom.
You should have told
us you were seeing her.
Yeah, that's probably over.
You didn't see the look on her face
when the maintenance guy
had to hold up a towel
so I could pee in a bottle.
You bowled a heck of a game, Allison.
- Thank you.
- Listen...
I still only have 3 people on my team,
and there's going to be
a new league starting off.
- Would you...
- No I'm not bowling on your team.
Thank god.
I can't believe we left with
this lovely little piece of hardware.
It is beautiful.
Yeah, no one expected us
to walk away with that.
Yeah, that's what the Kims get
for leaving their van door open.
Team Subs-Addicts"
I mean, it's just like it's
driving me crazy, Gary.
There is something I'm supposed to
tell you. I can't remember what it is.
- Who cares? Forget about it, dad.
- No. It's important.
Why can't I remember anything?
Lots of reasons, dad.
Ounces and ounces of reasons.
- Hey, grandpa.
- Hey, Louise,
did I ask you to
remind me of anything?
You said if anyone ever asks,
that you were with us at the movies.
No, that's not it,
but that still stands.
Hi, dad.
OK, Gary, I hate to break it to you,
but it's time to put
your nose to the grindstone.
I thought we agreed. You don't
really like it, and I'm not good at it.
No, no, you're not.
I'm talking about buckling down
this weekend
because Tom is failing history.
- And you want to know why?
- Cos' there is too much of it.
Because didn't do his report on Hoover.
This happens every time he is here.
That sounds accusatory.
Then I nailed it,
because I'm accusing you.
Look, Gary,
you never make him do his work.
Hey, Tommy, how come you didn't
do your report on herbert hoover?
'cause it was my weekend with you,
dad, and as a child of divorce,
I try to spend what little time
we have creating memories together.
You did that childhood divorce
speech on me once in the pet store,
and now I'm stuck raising
your stupid pygmy hamster.
Gary, you have to chip in
and be tougher on Tommy.
I'm so tired of having to
be the nag all the time.
We're all tired of it, Allison.
We're exhausted.
Gary, I talked to his teacher,
and he'll let him make up his report,
but it has to be in on monday and it
has to be good, or he is going to flunk,
and the next thing you know, he's
gonna be painting houses. No offense.
Hello, ma'am. Is your husband home?
I'll tell you what little girl. I take
a box of thin mints and some tagalongs.
How you doing?
Look at you guys.
How are you?
You guys got big.
If we were in Afghanistan,
you'd be working in the opium fields,
and you'd be getting married.
And you, Allison.
As they say over there,
you look, l lovely.
Thank you.
Hey, das is this what you
were trying to remember?
Yeah, your brother's come home
from Afghanistan.
How you doing, dad?
Good to see you.
How come you didn't pick
me up at the airport?
He was with us at the movies.

"Gary and His Half Brother"
VO By : ¤Aka¤
Team Subs-Addicts"
So we're 200 miles outside of Kabul.
I'm in the lead vehicle.
My tour gunner spots something up ahead,
and it's moving erratically.
So we don't take any chances.
We call in an air strike.
5 minutes later...
Get down!
Turns out, it was just a goat.
You killed a goat?
No. We missed him by 11 kilometers.
Little fella came on board with us.
He was our mascot for the next 8 months.
Till Christmas. Then we ate him.
I'm kidding. I'm just kidding.
We didn't eat him.
So am I old enough for you to explain
this half-brother thing to me?
Sure.
Well, your uncle Mitch and i, we
we have different mothers
who live far apart and
summers we would spend with dad.
Wait, grandpa Jack had 2 wives?
You want to handle that Mclovin'?
Well, it was the late sixties.
We were not really
married officially.
Brother groovy said these are your old
ladies for as long as it's cool, and...
But grandpa Jack loved
both these women very much.
That's why daddy and uncle Mitch
are half-brothers. The end.
Yeah, but how can grandpa
Jack be in love with 2 women?
You love peanut butter
and Jelly, right?
And if you can have them both
at the same time.
I said the end! OK?
Anyway, I'm gonna go, OK?
Mitch, congratulations
on your retirement.
- It's really great to have you back.
- Thank you.
I'm just glad to be someplace where i'm
not forced to go to Toby Keith concert.
Well, if there's anything I can
do for you, just let me know.
- Great. Will you marry me?
- You.
Come on, Allison. Don't tell me Gary's
in your league and I'm not.
Well, Gary was never in
my league to begin with.
He's more like a drunk spectator
who ran onto the field.
Gary, I'm going to be by tomorrow
to pick up Louise for golf camp.
Please rember.
Tommy's paper. Herbert hoover.
10 pages. I got it.
We're gonna take care of it.
You heard her, Tom.
I want 2 pages written
by 10:00 tonight.
And if I catch you in your room
horsing around... she's gone. Listen,
Louise, you're in charge of food.
Order meat lover's.
You can eat around the murder.
All right.
Tommy, you're in charge of beers, OK?
Imported before domestics,
bottles before cans.
If you get to a point where daddy's
drinking domestic out of a can,
tell me it's time for bed.
- Gotcha, dad.
- Hey, look.
We only doing this cause your uncle
Mitch is home and it's a big deal.
But tomorrow you got to get
started on that paper, OK?
OK, fine.
- What's so funny?
- You as a dad. It always cracks me up.
I'm a better dad
than you were a marine.
Really? I had an entire
platoon follow my every order.
- You can barely control 2 kids.
- Yeah, but you had a gun.
So you're really gonna make
me sleep on this couch?
No, you don't have to
sleep on the couch.
You can get the bottom
bunk in Tommy's room, too.
- Or I could have your room.
- You're not getting my room.
- I'll wrestle you for it.
- No. What?
- You're gonna Wrestle for it.
- We're not children. We're not gonna
Wrestle every time you don't get
your way like when we were kids.
- Give me your room.
- No, not give me my room.
- To sleep on the couch.
- Don't want the couch.
- How about the bottom bunk in Tommy's.
- I don't want the bottom bunk.
Wrestle.
You got movement at your 3:00.
Swoop in and fire.
Swoop in and fire!
It's too loud!
I got the enemy all over here.
Louise, help!
Hang on.
Let me switch to my grenade launcher.
Die, you Nazi scum!
Guys!
- Hey, Gar.
- Hi, dad.
Hi, daddy.
It's a little loud.
Sorry, hippie.
You know what else is loud?
Real war.
Louise, "die, you Nazi scum"?
Big fan of the Nazis?
Great. You probably woke
up all the neighbors.
Good job. Really...
all right!
What the hell's going on, Brooks?
It's 2 in the am.
Hey, Mr. Piscazzi. They were
playing a video game.
Excuse me.
Good evening, sir.
Staff Sergeant Mitchell Brooks.
We had an audio malfunction
with the gaming device,
- but the situation's been remedied.
- I wake up early. I watercise.
Of course you do.
Even through your robe, I can see
you pursue an intense fitness regime.
Don't worry about it. You won't be
bothered again for the rest
of the night. You have my word.
All right. You got it.
Don't worry about nothing.
Keep it down.
Great job, Mitch.
You almost got us all whacked.
- Come on, kids, go to bed, OK?
- All right.
I'm sorry, man, all right.
Kids were keeping me company.
Besides, after I woke them up,
they couldn't get back to sleep.
I'm going back to bed.
I got to work in the morning.
Since you're here.
You want help me get
through the next level? Come on.
- No. I have to go to work.
- I'll wrestle you for it.
I'm going to bed.
I can't believe you bit me.
War is hell.
Morning, dad.
I see reveille's a little
Loosey-Goosey around here.
Grab some chow.
Uncle Mitch let me
and tom cook breakfast.
Here's the thing, Mitch. We usually
don't cook breakfast in the kitchen
because of, well, this and...
I fired the cleaning lady.
I had to 'cause she divorced me.
Don't worry about it. We'll jump on KP.
As soon as we're done playing hoops.
- Let's go.
- Hey, we don't have a hoop.
We do now. Uncle Mitch Rolled
Mr. Piscazzi's over to our driveway.
You stole that guy's hoop?
Gary, I fought for the man's freedom,
all right?
I think he'd want me to have it.
Let's go!
Hey, hot stuff, wait a minute.
You got a herbert hoover report.
I have today and tomorrow, dad.
Well, OK. I don't want you fooling
around with the margins this time.
Your last report looked
like a Grocery list.
It won't be that hard.
Herbert hoover was born.
He did some stuff.
He was president. I'm already on page 6.
Hey, you guys can play for 15 minutes.
That's it.
Man.
I see you're doing the dishes.
I have a question.
Why are the kids outside
- playing basketball in their pajamas?
- 'cause they both Suck at rugby?
Gary, Louise has to be at
golf camp in 40 minutes.
I bet Tom hasn't even
start on his report.
Really?
How much would you like to bet?
- Hundred dollars.
- I was bluffing. He hasn't started.
Louise, Tom, get in here.
Gary, this is typical of you.
I'm taking tom back to my house
to make sure he'll get it done.
Time out.
This is my house, my kids, my rules.
Back off. He'll get it done.
He's playing with his uncle. Relax.
Listen, how many times
do I have to say this?
You can't have fun
until the work is done.
That's a good one, Scary Poppins.
Louise, go get ready for golf camp.
Tom, start your report.
The kids are with me.
They go by my rules.
If you'll excuse me.
Just, do what your mom said.
I'll move it back, Mr. Piscazzi.
What's that?
You're awesome.
- Hi, Allison.
- Hi.
Did you get prettier
since last night?
God, Mitch, i'm a mess.
Gary, how'd you let
this one get away?
I lit the barn on fire
and slapped her on the ass.
You know Mitch,
you got all the looks,
the charm, the brains, and, Gary,
you got to give me half
of everything you own.
I gotta go get to work
and I'm gonna bring Tommy
to make sure he finishes his report?
Don't do that.
He'll do it here.
Didn't you hear what Allison said?
He's gotta finish. It's important.
I'll make sure he gets it done. How?
You can't wrestle Tommy into writing
a report. I tried. It doesn't work.
I know how important this is.
Once I know my mission, i'm on it.
- You sure?
- It's done.
- Tom report? You'll clean the kitchen?
- Done. Done.
- Mr. Piscazzi?
- Dead.
No, just bring him
his hoop back, OK?
Right. Glad I asked.
Hey, you guys!
Here.
- This is not KFC.
- Yes, it is.
It's the new grilled chicken.
You'll like it.
It's so tender.
You can taste all
the herbs and spices.
Do you think it's, like,
five herbs and six spices?
I don't know.
Just eat it, OK?
What if it's, like, ten herbs
and one amazing spice?
I hope this conversation never ends.
Hey, Mitch, it's Gary.
Hey, Gary.
What's going on?
Tom's almost done with
the greatest report on hoover ever.
That's great.
Come on home. I picked up dinner.
We had a little car trouble.
We might not be home for a while.
I'll come pick you up.
Where are you guys?
Las Vegas.
Nevada?
People are smoking indoors and drinking
outdoors, so I'm gonna say yeah, Nevada.
Dad, god, you got here fast.
You drive really fast when your kids
have been taken across state lines.
We crossed a state line?
Yes, and when you're done
with your report on hoover,
we can start one on
the geography of the southwest.
Where's Mitch?
He's in the casino.
OK, I'm gonna go kill him.
Call the concierge, tell them I need
a big bag of lime and a shovel.
Hey, when you see uncle Mitch, tell him
we have tickets to Danny Gans, 11:00.
No, you don't. You don't have tickets
to Danny Gans at 11:00,
'cause you're gonna be in
the car with me at 11:00. And that's it!
Hey, Gar.
This is, Awkward.
We only have three
tickets for Danny Gans.
No one is going to Danny Gans, OK?
What, you called in sick to work so you
can go on a road trip Vegas with Mitch?
- Why didn't you just tell me that?
- You never would have signed off on it.
Let's not play that game, son.
I want you guys dressed and packed.
Meet me in the lobby
in 15 minutes, OK?
Fifteen minutes.
You know,
I just got back from the war.
So if you're looking to tie a yellow
ribbon around something,
I've got a few suggestions for you.
Hey. What the hell are you doing?!
Going with the ten,
that's what I'm doing.
Are you crazy,
bringing Tommy all the way out here?
I told you on the phone.
We were at home
working on his report, and the place
was all messy and depressing.
- You know?
- Whose fault is that?
Hey, it's not my fault you
divorced your hot cleaning lady.
So instead of cleaning up,
you come to Vegas?
Yeah, his report was on hoover,
so I figured hoover dam's
only a couple hours away by car.
- It's four hours away by car.
- Three, grandma.
- Here, blow on these.
- Time out. Six the hard way.
- There you go.
- Give it, give it, give it.
So you tossed my son in a car,
and you dragged him across the desert?!
We stopped in barstow for lunch.
By the way, have you had this
grilled chicken from KFC?
It was amazing.
You should have called me.
You should have called me.
It's chicken, man.
I thought I'd just tell you
the next time I saw you.
- He has a paper due.
- I know.
He's doing it.
He's just doing it in Las Vegas.
- We had a lot of fun today.
- You can't have fun
until the work is done.
- Did I just say that?
- I know I didn't.
Oh my gosh! Do you see what
you've done ou big ummy?
You've turned me into Allison.
We're leaving, now.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're leaving.
You're gonna march upstairs,
pack your bags.
- We're going home. Let's go.
- Stop yelling at me, Allison.
Don't call me Allison.
We're leaving.
You sure? 'cause I got you a room.
It's under the name "Allison."
Excuse me.
Officer.
What now?
I have it on good authority
that this prisoner
is smuggling drugs
somewhere on his person.
- Where would that be?
- In his vagina.
Give me that.
Great. Now we don't have a broom.
What happened to you, man?
You used to be fun.
I have children, Mitch, OK?
When you have children, somebody
has to be the responsible adult.
Usually that's Allison,
but when you come to town,
you act like me,
so I have to act like Allison.
- I'm just acting like me.
- You're not acting like you
you're acting like me.
Staying up past the kids' bedtime,
playing video games off time,
driving off to Vgas.
That's classic me.
You're stealing my bit.
And the worst part is,
now because you're around,
I see point of view on everything. I've
made that woman's life a living hell.
And if you ever tell her I said that,
I swear to god I will kill you.
Not if I kill you first. Which I could
do right now with anything in this room.
- No, you couldn't.
- Go ahead, find something.
- I was just looking for a paper clip.
- I know.
These your sons?
'fraid so.
Didn't believe in spanking, did you?
I thought I raised you
guys better than this.
Dad, you didn't raise us at all.
Well, then this was inevitable.
- He started it!
- He tackled me!
- He said I had a vagina. You do.
- Hey, knock it off! Knock it off.
Look at you two.
Gah, fighting like teenagers.
You should be helping each other out.
You both have been through
terrible situations.
One of you's been in a
senseless quagmire fighting
a devious enemy,
and Mitch was in a war.
You should have each other's backs.
You're family...
I'm pretty sure.
- Dad's right, you know.
- Sorry, dad. Thanks.
All right, you two can go.
Your fine's been paid.
I had to cash in
the danny gans tickets.
Sorry, grandpa.
All right. His act hasn't been the same
since his partner got eaten by a tiger.
- Dad, I'm pretty sure that Mitch,
- Why? Why? Just...
so I guess we're driving home, then.
That would be
the responsible thing to do.
It's a Shame.
Got a free hotel suite, drink coupons.
Car's not gonna be
ready till tomorrow.
It would be responsible
to drive home.
Dad, will you watch
tom for a couple hours?
'cause me and my brother
are gonna go hit the tables!
All right, i'm proud of you guys.
You know, getting out of Jail,
going out gambling together.
I can't wait to tell your sister.
We have a sister?
Yeah, you remember that peanut
Butter and Jelly, you know?
Well, it turns out I may have washed
it down with a glass of hot chocolate.
- Hey, you guys didn't Both.
- Top drawer.
Amazing.
Tommy did a really
great job on his report.
He really did. Mitch and I just took
turns staying with him in his bedroom,
making sure he didn't horse around,
and he got the job done.
This section on the hoover dam
It's almost like he was there.
That's the internet for you.
It can take you anywhere in the world.
- Great job, Gary. Thank you.
- Thank you.
This is for you.
- What is it?
- Just open it. Go ahead.
Gary. It's beautiful.
What is this for?
Just, just you put up with
a lot of stuff, so that's for you.
- It's really sweet.
- Thank you. You got it.
I'm gonna go home. Mitch and I are gonna
have a couple beers and unwind from
all the work we put in helping
Tommy with his report.
So how was danny gans?
We had to sell the tickets
so Tommy could bail us out of Jail.
- This is not over!
- It never is!

Team Subs-Addicts"
Gary, last night was wonderful for me.
- It was wonderful for me, too.
- You probably never thought
you could just spend the night
with a woman and not have sex.
After 15 years of marriage,
it's amazing what you can
accomplish when it's not your choice.
Well, I appreciate you understanding.
It's important that we don't rush this,
but your patience will be rewarded.
- Really?
- Yeah. Just not right now.
OK. See you later, Gary, and again,
thank you for last night.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Well, Mitch, there goes
another satisfied customer
from Gary's house of love.
Over 5 serves.
- You got nothing.
- I got nothing.
- How did you know?
- I'm a marine.
I can hear an enemy scout sneaking
into a foxhole from 200 yards away.
Last night,
I didn't hear that.
Look, Joan's a great woman, Mitch,
you know?
It's just we had
a few missteps on our way
and she doesn't want to seal
the deal until we've really
made sure we're right
for each other. It's torture.
- So why are you hanging in there, man?
- Cause she's fantastic! She's beautiful
she's a schoolteacher, she's willing
to put up with a guy who's divorced
with an annoying ex-wife, two kids,
and a deadbeat brother
who's sleeping on his couch.
Another Veteran comes home
and gets treated like crap.
Well, you are welcome for the freedom.
I'm just kidding? You're my brother.
I love having you around.
- It's been great.
- Look, you're right. I've been kind
getting your way around here. So I think
it's time I pack my stuff and moved on.
No, no. Mitch, where are you gonna go?
Tommy's room.
That's your big plan?
You're gonna move on 20 feet?
Yeah, yeah.
And if you're available later,
I sure could use help
moving some of this stuff.
I'd love to, but I have to get to work.
And thanks to Joan,
I have to go take a cold shower.
Allison called. Something about
replacing her garbage disposal.
Oh, my gosh! I totally forgot!
I told her I would do that for her.
Now I got to go to Allison's house,
but now I don't need that cold shower.
Deeper.
Hold on to it.
Now...
Let it all out.
Oh, my god!
Slower.
Oh... my... god.
Namaste.
Thank you for letting
my energy be one with yours.
Seven, I'm sorry.
I was still feeling your energy...
but we were somewhere else
and they weren't here. Bye.
- Bye, Seven. Thank you.
- Pleasure.
Your home is an oasis
of calm and beauty.
- It's much like your soul.
- Thank you.
- That'll be $200.
- Oh, god.
I, I got that right over here.
You know, Allison, I would love
to give you a private session.
- I think you're ready.
- I'm ready. I'm eager.
I am an eager bea...
I am eager.
That's wonderful.
And then maybe after the session,
I can take you out for an...
An herbal tea.
That is so weird.
You love herbal tea, and I am having a
birthday party for myself this saturday.
Why don't you come?
All right.
It would be my...
It would be my honor to be here to
help you celebrate turning, what, 24?
Seven, you are so...
In the ball park.
Until then,
this Jasmine oil is for your...
Heart chakra.
Thank you.
I am so tired of oiling my own chakra.
What's the matter?
Aren't your girls cold enough?
For crying out loud,
my tongue used to get stuck on that.
I am overheated.
I just finished a workout, all right?
- What do you want?
- I'll tell you what I don't want.
I don't want to be here
fixing your garbage disposal.
You know what? Just
get it over with and get out, OK? And
don't make mess and don't eat anything.
After I saw where you store your food,
that's not a problem.
Let's go ahead and add "no talking"
to the list, OK?
Why are you so cranky? I thought
yoga was supposed to mellow you out.
I am very mellow, Gary.
Bite me.
I saw your yoga instructor
walking down the driveway.
- What's his name? Nine?
- Seven, Gary.
Well, I saw those pants he was wearing.
I think calling him "four"
would have been generous.
You're just jealous because
he's in shape and you're "a shape."
Well, Joan doesn't have any complaints.
Then she probably
hasn't had sex with you yet.
What do I do about this?
Wait a minute.
You guys haven't done anything?
I thought we added
"no talking" to the list.
That was before I found out
Joan and you hadn't closed the deal.
How do you know that?
You don't get anything.
The last time you had action,
you sat on your keys.
Gary, just shut up
and fix the garbage disposal!
- Fine. Stay out of my way.
- Fine! Stay out of my way!
- No, stay out of my way.
- Fine. I will.
Look out.
Watch it. Watch...
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
Oh, my gosh.
What do we do now?
What do you think we should do?
- What do you think we should?
- I think I should leave.
- Do you think i should leave?
- Want to leave? Then you should leave.
OK, I'm gonna leave.
- Oh, my god! You're just gonna leave?
- No, I'm not gonna leave.
- I think we should talk about this.
- I'm gonna leave.
Gary, I can't believe we did this.
I mean, what were you thinking?
Me? Why are you blaming it on me?
Why is it my fault?
- Hello! You're the man.
- Oh, yeah.
You had ice cream bars on your boobs.
OK, I'm sorry.
In what world is that me setting you up?
Because you know I love ice
cream and you know I love boobs.
You totally set me up.
Look, we cannot tell anybody
that we did this, OK? No one.
Right. I'm gonna run out and tell
my friends about having sex with you.
Hey! Then I know!
I'll brag about the time I sneezed
and peed a little in line at the bank!
I'm gonna go.
- What are you doing? I don't have any beer.
- Getting a beer.
Yeah, I always kept one taped up behind
the light in case of emergencies.
But if I knew this was
gonna be the emergency,
I would have taped up
a wobbly chair and a noose.
Gary, what is your brother doing here?
I forgot. I told mitch to come
by and bring me my pipe wrench.
Just act natural like nothing happened.
Come in.
Hey, here he is.
- You just did it.
- What?
That's crazy, Mitch.
Tell him he's crazy.
I hate myself!
- Way to play along, Allison.
- I'm sorry, Gary, but I really do!
What are you crying for?
I wasn't bad.
Yes, Gary, it was! You have
never been a good judge of that.
So does this mean you guys
are getting back together?
Oh, my god! No!
What a horrible, horrible thing to say!
What's wrong with you? Don't even
joke like that, Mitch. Watch it.
I wasn't trying to be funny.
It's a legitimate question.
I mean, Allison just...
Gave you her most precious gift.
Her gift was a lot more
precious two kids ago.
Yeah? You still unwrapped it
like a drunk monkey.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
i'm going to schedule myself a flea dip.
Stop looking at me like that, Mitch!
Nothing happened!
I had meaningless sex with my ex-wife.
The end.
Great. I just spent 5 years in
afghanistan trying to convince
them that Americans aren't
a bunch of decadent freaks.
And here you are, jumping bed to bed,
listening to your Rock'n'roll music,
wearing your blue jeans!
You just made America
less safe today, Gary.
Nice job!
I didn't hear you come in.
If you were an enemy combatant,
you wouldn't be able to say that,
'cause your throat would
already be slashed!
Hey, is that a real gumball machine?
Yeah.
Have all you want.
- Here are your bags, uncle Mitch.
- Thanks, Louise.
Hey, hold on a second.
Let me give you a little
something for the effort. Here.
- Here you go.
- What?
You said I could have all I wanted.
- Thanks, uncle Mitch.
- You bet.
So, roomie...
Flip you for top bunk.
All right.
Here we go.
- Call it.
- Heads.
Sorry. All right.
You got bottom.
- But I didn't even see if it was...
- Trust me.
- You got bottom.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Hop on those bags.
I just fixing the garbage disposal
'cause I knew you wouldn't be home.
- I can leave.
- No. It's good. You know what?
The party's tomorrow night.
It'll be nice to have it fixed, so...
So...
- Yeah.
- So...
Look, Gary, I've been thinking
a lot about what happened.
- Shouldn't we talk about this?
- I don't need to talk about it.
But shouldn't we just
talk about it and try...
We don't need to talk about it,
we don't need to read articles about it,
we don't need to take an intimacy quiz,
we're not gonna
act out our feelings with little puppets
or hit each other with anger sticks,
unless the padding's taken off
and I get to go first.
Just let it go. We had sex.
It was a mistake. We're done.
- OK, forgotten.
- Thank you.
So I'm thinking about having
mini quiches at my party.
What do you think?
How did we get here from "mini quiches"?
I don't know, Gary.
We need help.
Yes, we do.
Thank you for coming, Walter.
I'm happy you called me.
You said there was a problem.
I'm not sure what it is.
I'm glad we could put our complicated
past aside and discuss it.
What's complicated about our past?
Allison and I separated, you guys
started dating, we got divorced,
you guys got engaged,
and then she dumped you.
Thank you for the "Tv guide" recap
of the most painful year of my life.
You really need this guy?
We have to see Dr. Krandall about this?
Yes, Gary, unless you want to start
all over with a new therapist.
No, I don't want a new therapist, but do
we have to use the one
that did grief counseling
for the survivors of the "Titanic"?
I'm not gonna let your insults
dissuade me from my mission, Gary.
Whatever it is you want to discuss,
I will advise you
in a purely professional manner.
Gary and I slept together.
Animals! Filthy, disgusting animals!
The two of you should be fixed!
Fixed!
Excuse me.
Please continue.
OK, Walter, I know this is
difficult for you,
but, please, you have to help us
understand what's going on here.
Fine. It's not uncommon
for a divorced couple
to relapse into a physical relationship.
It's comfortable, it's familiar,
and there's no strings attached.
But why us? I mean, the sex wasn't even
good when we were married, you know?
It took me a CPR mummy to realize
how magical a kiss could really be.
Really?
Because you doing foreplay is like a
seal learning a new song on bike horns.
Look, don't beat
yourselves up over this.
You're intelligent, thoughtful
people who caught a mistake early on.
Just be grateful you
only slept together once.
- Actually, it was twice.
- Skank!
Miscreants!
Insatiable, lust-filled heathens!
You should be locked up!
Locked up!
- Good to see Krandall again.
- He looks good, doesn't he?
Dude, not cool!
Heat rises.
Sorry.
Look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, OK?
I'm just gonna go get a can of beer
and a half-dozen hard-boiled eggs.
You're gonna wish you
never started this war.
Get ready for some shock and awe!
Wait, wait.
This is my room, OK?
And these are my rules.
You're here to sleep where I tell you,
You're gonna move your bags, and you're
gonna replace every single gumball.
Anything coming out
of me is due un the fact
you took us for burgers
and you ordered onions rings.
All right? Not me, you!
So just get in the bottom bunk!
I'm proud of you, standing up
to me like that. That had to feel good.
Thanks.
- Still want the top bunk, though.
- Yeah, I'm good with that. Go ahead.
Hey, how'd you get
tricked into bartending?
I volunteered.
When I was in the military,
I didn't see a whole lot
of women in short dresses,
so I thought it'd be best
if I stood behind something.
Well, the lady would like a margarita.
OK. And, Joan, what would you like?
That's a little leatherneck
humor for you right there.
I'll have the same.
I'm gonna check out the food, OK?
This must be a little weird for you,
having Joan & Allison in the same room.
No, it's not weird at all.
Tonight is all about Joan.
I mean, look at her. She's smokin'.
Allison's my ex-wife.
We're divorced, and we're just gonna
ACT like a normal divorced couple, OK?
Just mind your own business.
Here comes Allison.
- What? Nothing.
- You look great, in a
"desperately clinging
to your youth" kind of way.
Gee, thanks, Gary.
You look nice, in a...
"peaked in high school" kind of way.
If I didn't know you, I'd say there's
something still going on between you two
in a really kind of messed up way.
There's nothing going
on between us, Mitch.
No, no.
Whatever it was before, it is over.
We did it. It was great.
It's done, OK? OK?
All right.
Hey, Gary, you want to try
one of these mini quiches?
I, think I might be allergic to those.
Happy birthday. And I...
brought you a little something.
It's a pebble I found while walking
the beaches of the black sea.
- That's very nice. Thank you.
- Well, actually, it found me.
It was late july.
I was walking along...
Hey, just could you just excuse me for,
like, one second?
But, seriously, I love the rock. I do.
Hi, Joan. Boy, you look pretty.
Gary, I need to talk to you.
- What did you mean, "it was great"?
- What?
You said the sex was great.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did, Gary.
You told Mitch, "we did it,
it was great,
and it's done." I want to know what
the hell you meant by "it was great."
I probably meant it was great, OK?
I mean, you, you moved around.
You made noise, you had your legs
wrapped around me like a cage fighter.
Crap, Gary. It was great.
- It was great for you, too?
- Yeah, It was amazing, all right?
Don't raise your voice.
I didn't do it on purpose or anything.
Why couldn't it have been awful,
like when we were married? You know,
it was the very first time
I imagined your head on your body.
Why didn't you picture
seven's head on my body?
Next time I will.
Hi, Seven.
I am ready for those private lessons.
Great. I'll check my calendar.
I'm free anytime...
You know, morning, afternoon.
I can have all these
people gone in 15 minutes.
- Hey, I need to talk to you, Allison.
- No, no.
Yeah, I do.
Hey, come here.
- What, Gary?
- What do you mean, "next time"?
I didn't mean to say that, all right?
Believe me, I don't want to do it again.
Then why are you wearing
your "i want to do it again" dress?
I'm not. I'm wearing my "i want
to do it again but not with you" dress.
And what about you, with the nice jacket
that shows off your shoulders and gives
you the illusion of a waist?
Thank you. I'm not wearing it for you.
I'm wearing it for Joan.
I am not wearing this for you, OK?
So leave me alone.
You leave me alone, all right?
I got it. I got it.
- I got it.
- I thought you fixed it!
I couldn't fix it! You kept dragging me
up to your bedroom to have sex with me!
I dragged you?
You were chasing me around like
I was made out of biscuits.
You jumped on me like a mountain lion
jumps on a hiker with a broken leg.
God, Gary, look at this mess. You know
what? This is just like our marriage.
I'd ask you to do one little thing, but
course, you can't be bothered to do it.
This can't be anything like
our marriage because we keep having sex.
I cannot believe I am in here making out
with you while there is a gorgeous man
waiting in there for me.
Now, if you don't mind, Gary,
i'm going to see how many
times seven goes into 39.
Happy birthday to you
am I the only one who knows this?
You know, all in all,
it was one of my better parties.
It was rockin', right up to the point
where everybody found out we had sex
and Joan threw a drink in my face.
Do your eyes still
sting from the tequila?
Well, the left one is
completely clouded over, so no.
But the right one,
I'm starting to see shapes out of that.
I think that's you over there, right?
So you think you still
got a shot with Seven?
Who cares?
I mean, he wears a toe ring.
And his real name is Larry, you know?
What was I...
- What was I thinking?
- You'll find a guy, Allison.
I'm 39.
Yeah, but you're also
divorced with two kids.
Why do you think we ended
up back in bed together?
I don't know.
I think it's like Krandall said,
you know? It's just easy and familiar.
New relationships are hard.
Yeah, but, why, Gary?
Why was it so good?
It didn't have the weight of the whole
marriage on it: the mortgage,
the bills, the kids.
It was just crazy and wild
and fun, like when we first
started dating, that's all.
That's exactly what it was.
So if we knew divorce
was gonna be this hard,
do you still think
we would have done it?
I would marry and divorce
you all over again.
- That is so sweet.
- I'm a charmer.
But if we have a chance of
making this divorce work,
- we can't end up in bed together.
- Never again. Ever.
Are you ever gonna fix
the garbage disposal?
You should probably just hire a guy.
Team Subs-Addicts"
- S'il te plaît, laisse-moi le voir.
- Tu l'as déjà vu.
Oui, mais jamais à la lumière.
Je lui montrerai beaucoup de respect,
je te promets.
Mais j'avais 18 ans quand
je l'ai eu, d'accord ?
Génial !
Un crâne rose.
C'est tendance et féminin.
La ferme, ça fait salope et tu le sais.
T'es pas une salope.
Vraiment ? J'ai passé la nuit avec
le mec engagé pour peindre mon appart.
Ça fait plus de toi une pute.
- Au revoir.
- Non, non. Reste ! Reste !
Allez. Allez. Je plaisante.
D'accord ?
J'ai cette énorme maison
au bord du lac,
que je peins pour un mec
quand il n'y est pas, mais,
ça te dirais de passer
le reste du week-end là-bas avec moi ?
Je sais pas, une nuit avec toi, et
tu veux m'emmener en week-end ?
J'ai vraiment dû être excellente.
Tant que j'aurais pas regardé la vidéo
de cette nuit, j'en serai pas sûr.
- C'était quoi ?
- Ma porte d'entrée.
- Il y a quelqu'un ?
- J'espère que non.
- Salut, papa.
- On est là.
Papa ?
Y a quelques trucs que j'aurai
dû te dire, en plus d'avoir
ma propre entreprise de peinture
et tout ce charme enfantin,
j'ai 2 enfants.
- Gary ? Coucou ?
- Et une ex-femme.
On dépasse de 2 minutes et demie
sur mon temps.
Qui est peut-être une nazie.
- Pourquoi tu m'as rien dit ?
- J'allais te le dire,
dès qu'on aurait arrêté
de faire l'amour.
C'est pas si je t'avais menti,
je mens pas, je suis pas un menteur.
Je suis au téléphone !
Vanessa, je suis désolé.
Je suis divorcé que depuis 3 mois,
je n'ai vu personne depuis
la séparation et j'allais te le dire,
mais c'était trop beau,
et je voulais pas te faire peur.
Comme le petit détail sur
le fait d'avoir une famille ?
Tu m'as pas dit
que tu étais désarticulée,
à un moment,
j'ai cru que je t'avais cassé.
Je ne suis pas désarticulée,
je n'aime juste pas me plaindre.
Salut, fiston. Salut, ma puce.
Où est maman ?
- Dans la cuisine.
- Merci.
Papa ! J'ai une nouvelle photo d'Al Gore
pour le mur à côté de mon lit.
C'est flippant, Louise.
Allison, qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
C'est pas mon week-end.
Tout ce que tu as dans ton frigo,
c'est 2 bières et un pot de sauce ranch.
Je sais, j'ai presque plus de bières.
Pourquoi les enfants sont-ils là ?
Tu les as tout les mardis et jeudis,
tout les autres week-ends
et 2 semaines au mois de juillet, OK ?
On alterne les anniversaires
et les vacances importantes.
Je sais, ça fait beaucoup de mots
d'affilés, mais essaye de suivre.
Je suis, mais tu les as eu
le week-end dernier, qui était le mien,
ça veut pas dire qu'on échange.
On faisait une purification au jus
de 12 heures,
- je sais que tu l'aurais pas respecté.
- Probablement pas,
quand mes enfants sont affamés,
j'ai tendance à les nourrir.
Désolé si ça fait de moi
le parent marrant.
Les enfants, jetez vos livres,
balancez votre brosse à dents,
vous êtes avec papa, maintenant.
Papa dit que ma photo d'Al Gore
est flippante.
Chérie, c'est pas que ce soit flippant,
mais chaque centimètre
de ta chambre est couverte de photos
d'Al Gore ou de Gandhi.
Dieu merci, tu as cette photo
du mec d'Entourage.
C'est Che Guevera, papa.
Je connais pas le nom de l'acteur,
je suis juste content que
tu aies le béguin pour quelqu'un
de presque ton âge.
Ton père ne te critique pas, Louise,
il sait que toi et Tom
allez avoir beaucoup de relations
saines et magnifiques.
- On sait, maman.
- On sait, maman.
Pourquoi tu dis des choses comme ça ?
Les enfants du divorce ont
plus de chances
de lutter dans leurs propres relations.
Il y a un chapitre entier sur ça
dans "Régles pour un divorce parfait".
Le livre que Dr. Krandall
nous a donné à lire.
Tu l'as même pas ouvert ?
Pas besoin, j'ai la version audio
assise sur mon canapé.
On était d'accord pour suivre
les régles de Dr Krandall,
parce que c'était le mieux pour
les enfants.
- Ils vont bien.
- Vraiment ?
T'as remarqué que
Tommy a peur des filles ?
Il a raison de l'être,
elles prétendent t'aimer
et prennent toutes tes affaires.
Écoute, Tommy aimera les filles
quand il sera prêt à les aimer.
Dr Krandall et moi l'avons encouragé
à se faire des amies sur "Second Life".
Ce jeu de geek ?
C'est une société en ligne, d'accord ?
C'est un endroit sûr
pour qu'il rencontre des filles.
Ou peut-être un membre du Congrès.
Salut les enfants, amusez-vous avec
votre père. Moi, ça m'est jamais arrivé.
T'es une menteuse, c'est un mensonge.
Je sais, mais ça fait du bien.
Qui prend de la Ginkgo ?
J'apprécierai que
tu me testes pas sur mes enfants.
C'est Tommy. Louise.
Je sais que c'est Tommy.
C'est Louise. Tommy !
Une capsule, juste avant le coucher,
avec beaucoup d'eau.
- C'est Louise.
- Je savais que c'était Louise.

Hé, mon pote.
Tiens donc, Second Life.
C'est plutôt cool.
Tu sais, on n'avait rien de tel
quand j'étais petit.
On avait... dehors.
Ta mère m'a dit que tu pouvais
y rencontrer des filles.
Ça s'appelle "In World". Tu peux
en rencontrer des tonnes, des tonnes.
- T'en as rencontré ?
- Non.
Il y a une fille que j'aime vraiment
à l'école, elle s'appelle Danielle,
mais on est jamais "In World"
au même moment...
Écoute-moi, écoute moi bien.
S'il y a une fille que tu rencontres
dans ce monde,
tu pourrais peut-être la ramener
à la maison,
aller dans ta chambre,
vous pourriez étudier, parler.
Une fille dans ma chambre ?
- Je peux pas inviter une fille ici.
- Pourquoi ?
Elle va s'attendre à ce que...
je l'emballe.
Qu'est-ce tu emballerais ?
- Je sais pas.
- OK, c'est génial.
Écoute, tu as 14 ans.
T'as pas à t'inquiéter des filles
- avant un moment.
- Dieu merci.
Je dois aller voir pour du boulot,
rends-moi service,
surveille ta sœur pour moi.
Si j'essaye de te donner du Genkgo
ce soir, le prends pas.
- Salut, Dennis.
- Salut.
La propriétaire est passée aujourd'hui ?
Quel est son nom... Vanessa ?
- J'ai vu sa voiture.
- Oui ? Quand ?
Ce matin, devant ta maison.
Oui, on est sorti ensemble hier.
C'était génial, mais
je pense l'avoir effrayé
et qu'elle voudra jamais me revoir.
- Jackpot !
- Non.
C'est pas le jackpot,
j'aime bien cette fille,
je voulais voir où ça pouvait aller.
Non, non, non. Ne fais pas ça,
tu viens de divorcer.
Tu es libre.
Tu signes pas avec la première équipe
qui te montre son équipement.
Je cherche pas une relation
à long terme avec Vanessa,
je veux juste passer un peu de temps
avec quelqu'un de cool, sexy et tatoué.
Tu viens de décrire Paco,
et il cherche rien de sérieux non plus.
Vraiment ?
Hé, Dennis. Est-ce que je...
Je peux prendre
la couleur d'origine du mur ?
Bien sûr, mais attention
à ce que vous touchez.
Vous auriez pu me dire ça hier.
Je suis vraiment désolé
à propos de la nuit dernière.
Parle-moi, s'il te plaît.
Je suis une grande fille,
on a passé un bon moment hier,
je sais que t'es pas prêt et ça me va.
Mais je suis prêt pour ça. Vraiment.
C'est juste que
mon ex-femme et moi avons décidés
de divorcer selon certaines règles
pour le bien des enfants.
Genre combien de temps avant de sortir
avec quelqu'un, et hier,
j'ai dû en enfreindre beaucoup,
tout comme j'ai battu certains
records personnels.
Deux était ton record ?
Ouais.
Écoute, Vanessa,
je t'apprécie vraiment. C'est vrai.
Donne-moi une autre chance, j'aimerai
voir comment les choses vont tourner.
Vraiment ?
Et au sujet de l'accord avec ton ex ?
Je vais m'en occuper maintenant,
je vais aller lui parler,
et lui dire plus de règles.
On se voit plus tard ?
Je ne sais pas, ça semble être
une mauvaise idée.
Je prends ça comme un peut-être.
C'est ouvert.
Désolé, je dois m'habituer
à frapper à ma porte.
C'est ma porte maintenant,
et t'es pas obligé de frapper,
tu peux sonner.
Je suis venu ici pour te parler
de quelque chose de très important,
et je veux pas qu'on se dispute.
- C'est à propos de rencard.
- Pas intéressée.
Charmant.
Non, sortir avec d'autres personnes.
Genre, des gens qui allument pas
la lumière pendant l'amour
en me demandant
ce que j'essaye de faire.
J'ai fait ça une fois.
Et t'avais l'air perdu, OK ?
Et tu voulais pas qu'on se dispute ?
Je sais qu'on était d'accord
sur ces règles,
et que l'une d'elles est
sur sortir avec quelqu'un d'autre.
Je pense que ça arrivera
bientôt pour l'un de nous deux,
et que c'est important que,
lorsque ça arrivera
l'autre n'en fasse pas
toute une histoire.
D'accord, je te promets que quand
tu sortiras avec quelqu'un,
j'en ferai pas une histoire.
C'est génial ! Et ensuite,
quand tu sortiras avec quelqu'un,
j'en ferai pas une histoire non plus.
Bien, parce que je vais marier.
Quoi ?
Je suis fiancée, et merci.
Parce que j'ai lutté
pour trouver un moyen de
te l'annoncer, et maintenant,
je peux finallement le dire
aux enfants, et porter ça.
Mon Dieu !
Avec qui tu vas te marier ?
Quelqu'un que je vois depuis
notre séparation.
En fait, tu le vois aussi...
tout les mardis à 8 h.
Dr. Krandall ? Tu te maries avec
notre conseiller conjugal ?
Je sais, c'est fou, n'est-ce pas ?
Le gars toujours couvert
de poils de chat et de miettes,
et qui porte un long col alors
qu'il a pas de cou ?
Il est sensible et intelligent,
et je me sens jeune avec lui.
- Bien sûr, il a 80 ans.
- Il a la cinquantaine.
Je sais pas quoi dire.
En général,
les gens disent félicitations.
OK. Tu sais quoi ?
Félicitations.
Félicitations pour ton mariage
avec la personne qu'on a vu
pour sauver notre mariage.
Oh mon Dieu !
Y a pas une règle contre ça ?
Y a pas de loi contre ça ?
Allez, grandis !
Le cœur ne répond pas
à de stupides règles.
C'est bon pour nous deux, peut-être que
ça te forcera à tourner la page.
C'est peut-être déjà fait.
Allons.
Fais pas semblant de voir quelqu'un
pour rivaliser avec moi.
C'est triste.
Je rivalise pas avec toi, tu es fiancée,
bientôt mariée, tu as gagné.
Et ta récompense, c'est un mec qui fait
du vélo avec un pare-vent.
Louise, ma puce, tu m'aides à ranger
- ces courses pour moi ?
- Bien sûr, papa.
Où est ton frère ?
Il étudie dans sa chambre...
avec une fille.
Avec une fille ?
En vrai, une personne vivante ?
Bien joué, Tommy.
Mignonne ?
C'est dégradant. Je juge pas
les gens sur leurs apparances.
C'est pour ça que je t'aime.
Mais soyons honnête,
t'aurais pas toutes ces photos de Gandhi
dans ta chambre s'il était pas canon.
Salut, fils. Je savais pas
que tu avais de la compagnie.
C'était ton idée, non ?
En plein dans le mille,
Cap'tain Pipeau.
- Salut, je suis le papa de Tommy.
- Echantée, Danielle.
Salut. J'ai commandé une pizza.
Alors, si vous avez faim plus tard,
criez. Tu as une question ?
Tu voulais pas que je t'aide avec
le truc dans le couloir ?
Tout à fait. Je te l'emprunte,
j'ai besoin de son aide avec le truc.
Dans le couloir. C'est du lourd.
On revient tout de suite.
Merci d'y avoir penser.
J'avais oublié.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Y a une fille dans ma chambre !
Je fais quoi avec elle ?!
Je sais pas. Parle-lui.
Dis-lui que tu aimes ses cheveux.
Je vais pas lui mentir !
Tu peux pas lui dire
qu'on m'a appelé pour une urgence ?
Je peux le faire. Excellente idée.
Je vais lui dire que le F.B.I. est venu,
qu'ils t'ont demandé,
et t'ont emmené pour
une opération top secrète
appellé : Opération dégonflé.
Retourne dans ta chambre.
Et parle à ton amie !
- D'accord.
- Écoute...
sérieusement, elle t'aime bien,
Sinon, elle serait pas là. OK ?
Tu es beau gosse. Va falloir t'y faire.
Elle sent vraiment bon.
Comme toutes,
c'est comme ça qu'elles t'attrapent.
Louise, tu pourrais
m'apporter une bière ?
Maman dit que ça fait de moi
une serveuse.
Dans ce cas, apporte aussi un shot
de tequila. Ça fera de toi une barmaid.
- Bonjour, Gary.
- Bonjour, Dr. Krandall.
J'ai compris qu'Allison vous a mis
au courant de notre petite indiscrétion.
Je sais pas ce qui n'énerve le plus.
Le fait que vous couchiez avec mon ex
ou que vous m'ayez fait faire
un journal des rêves.
Je corrobore votre colère.
C'est pour cela que je suis ici.
Pour vous donner une chance
de vous venger.
Tout ce que je demande,
c'est de pas frapper au dessus du cou.
Je fais des photos pour la couverture
d'un livre, demain matin.
- Je vais pas vous frapper.
- Vous trouverez ça thérapeutique
et j'aimerais avoir
un point de vue scientifique.
- Je me suis jamais fait frapper.
- C'est dur à croire.
- Walter, arrête tout de suite.
- Allison, que fais-tu ici ?
Pourquoi toi tu frappes pas
avant d'entrer chez moi ?
Sois pas mesquin. Walter m'a laissé
un mot débile disant qu'il venait ici
prendre une raclée. Je veux pas
que vous vous battiez pour moi.
Non, la testostérone fait rage.
Allez, donnez tout ce que vous avez.
Je vous l'ai déjà donné
et vous avez mis une bague à son doigt.
Voici le livreur de pizza,
peut-être qu'il vous frappera, lui.
Salut.
Salut.
J'apprécie que tu sois venu ce matin.
C'était vraiment mignon.
Je dois t'avouer quelque chose.
Il y a déjà un homme dans ma vie.
Voici mon fils, Parker.
Et il doit utiliser ta salle de bain.
- Salut, Parker, ça va mon pote ?
- Salut.
La salle de bain est à l'étage, OK ?
Je le crois pas qu'il ait pas
de salle de bain en bas.
Entre.
Tout le monde, voici mon amie,
Vanessa.
Voici mon ex-femme Allison.
Notre ancien conseiller conjugal
et son nouveau fiancé,
Dr. Walter Krandall.
Charmé.
Il dit des trucs comme "charmé",
il est vieux.
Je suis vieux ?
Il a peur des oiseaux !
C'était dans
mon journal des rêves, l'ami.
Je suis désolé d'avoir douté de toi
quand tu disais que tu voyais quelqu'un.
On vient de se rencontrer.
On apprend encore
des trucs formidables l'un sur l'autre.
- Pourquoi tu m'as rien dit ?
- Pourquoi toi, tu m'as rien dit ?
Si je puis me permettre, il y a
des choses dont vous devriez parler.
Vous devriez y aller.
Vu mon domaine, je me proposais
d'arbitrer la conversation
entre vous et votre charmante compagne.
Hors de question.
Celle-ci, je l'aime bien.
Bien. Je vous laisse vous en occuper,
tant que vous comprennez
à quel point c'est difficile
pour une mère célibataire
dans ces conditions,
qui est l'un des rôles les plus exigeant
et stimulant qui existent.
Merci.
Je l'adore.
Il est pas génial ?
Il fait son propre pain.
J'achète mon pain dans un magasin.
Je supporte l'Amérique.
OK. J'y vais en premier.
Gary m'a pas dit qu'il avait
des enfants ou une ex-femme.
Vraiment ?
Tu veux...
D'accord, Vanessa ne m'a pas dit
qu'elle avait un fils.
Et je me suis sentie humiliée et déçue.
Je me suis aussi senti humilié et déçu,
mais moi, ça m'excite.
Et pourquoi n'avoir pas dit
à Gary que vous aviez un fils ?
Je suis mère-célibataire
depuis longtemps, maintenant,
et je suis prudente sur
les gens que je présente à Parker.
Et plus tôt, Gary m'a dit
qu'il voulait voir où la relation irait.
Et c'est le cas.
Et plus j'y pense,
je pense être prête pour une relation
à long terme.
Pardon, quoi ?
Je pensais pas que tu serais prêt à
t'engager avec quelqu'un si rapidement.
Moi ? Alors tu ne sais rien sur moi.
Je m'engage. S'il te plaît !
Vous savez rien à propos de Gary.
Parce que j'aime le long, long terme,
les longues, longues relations.
Ma dernière relation à long terme
vient de se finir.
Donc le timing est parfait.
Je ferais mieux d'appeler le livreur,
voir s'il s'est perdu ou quoi.
- C'est quoi ton problème ?
- Rien. Tout va bien.
Je n'ai pas vu aussi paniqué
depuis que l'oie
t'a poursuivi à Disneyland.
Laisse-moi, tout va bien.
Et pourquoi
l'oie ne poursuivait que moi ?!
Je sais ce que tu ressens en ce moment.
Elle veut plus que ce que
tu crois être capable de gérer.
J'ai vécu la même chose avec Walter.
Tu sais ce que j'ai ressenti
quand il a mis ses bras autour de moi ?
Tu l'aidais à rentrer ou
à sortir du bain ?
Je voudrais vraiment te voir heureux,
et Vanessa pourrait être
un bon premier pas.
Pour je ne sais quelle raison,
elle a l'air de bien t'aimer.
Il n'y en a sûrement
pas beaucoup comme elle dans le coin.
- Je suis pas un bon parti ?
- À elle de décider.
Ne lui donne pas de raison
de te rejetter.
Tu as raison, Allison. Merci.
Mais qu'on soit clair, non,
t'es pas un bon parti.
- Les pizzas sont là.
- Merci, chèrie. Va le dire à ton frère.
Je peux pas.
Il est dans sa chambre, avec une fille.
- Tom a une fille dans sa chambre ?
- Avec la porte fermée.
Tom, c'est maman,
qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Rien maintenant que tu as dit "maman".
Tom, chéri, pourquoi
la porte est fermée ?
Non, elle est juste coincée.
Tu te souviens, papa a dit
qu'il allait la réparer ?
Oui, désolé.
Je m'en occupe.
Louise a dit que tu avais une amie ici.
Danielle est rentrée.
Mais elle est en ligne. On est
"In World" à une fête sur la plage.
Désolé de t'avoir dérangé.
Amuse-toi bien à ta fête.
Mets de la crème solaire.
LOL.
T'avais raison. Il est pas prêt
à avoir une fille à la maison.
Je sais. Tu essayes.
Tu penses bien faire.
Mais j'ai un meilleur instinct
à propos de nos enfants.
Je sais.
Hé, le tombeur, la pizza est là,
si tu as faim, OK ?
- OK.
- D'accord.
Danielle, ma grande,
tu as laissé ton sac
là où on pouvait tous le voir.
Je lui ai dit que j'aimais ses cheveux.
Non...
Laissons ça ouvert, OK ?
Je veux te parler.
Je m'appelle Gary. J'ai une ex
ennuyante et deux magnifiques enfants.
Bonjour, Gary. Je suis Vanessa,
mère-célibataire avec 2 tatouages
Tu veux voir où ça va aller ?
Bien sûr.
Attends un peu. 2 tatouages ?
Où est l'autre ?
Finis de peindre mon appart,
et je te le montrerai.
- Please, let me see it, please.
- You've already seen it.
Yeah, but never in the light.
I'll show it a great pile of respect,
I promise.
But I was eighteen
when I got it, alright.
Okay.
Awesome!
Pink skull.
That's edgy and feminine.
Oh, shut up,
it's slutty and you know it.
You are not a slut.
Really? I just spent the night
with the man I hired to paint my condo.
That would make you more of a whore.
- Goodbye.
- No, no. Stay! Stay!
Come on. Come on. I'm kidding.
Alright?
Listen, I have this enormous lake house,
that I'm painting for a guy
while he is out of town, but,
how would you like to spend the rest
of the week-end with me there, okay?
I only spend one night with you and
you wanna take me away for the week-end?
I must have been pretty amazing.
Until I check the video tape
from last night, I won't know for sure.
- What was that?
- My front door.
- Is somebody here?
- I hope not.
- Hi, Dad
- I'm here.
Dad?
Okay, a few things that I probably
should have told you, aside from owning
my own painting business
and all this boying charm,
I have two kids,
- Gary? Hello?
- and an ex-wife,
We're two and a half minute
into my time.
who might be a nazi.
Why didn't you tell me?
I was gonna tell you, the very next
time we weren't having sex, okay.
Come on. It's not like I lied to you,
I don't lie, I'm not a liar.
I'm on the phone.
Vanessa, I'm really sorry. I've only
been divorced for three months,
and I haven't seen anyone since
the split and I was gonna tell you, but
you were too good to be true,
and I didn't want to scare you away.
Like the tiny little detail
about you having a family?
You didn't tell me
you were double-jointed,
at one point,
I thought I had broken you.
Yeah, well, I'm not double-jointed,
I just don't like to complain.
Hi, son. Hi, sweetie.
Where's mummy?
- She's in the kitchen.
- Great thanks.
Dad! I've got another picture of Al Gore
to put on the wall next to my bed.
That's... creepy, Louise.
Allison, what are you doing here?
It's not my week-end.
All you have in your refrigerator is
2 beers and a bottle of ranch dressing.
I know. I'm running low on beer.
Why are the kids here?
You get them every tuesday
and thursday,
every other week-end and two weeks
in the month of july, okay?
We alternate bithdays
and major holidays.
I know this is a lot of words in a row,
but please Gary, try to follow.
I'm following but you kept them last
week-end, which was suppose to be mine,
that doesn't mean
we automatically switch.
We were doing
a twelve hours juice cleanse,
- and I knew you would not honor it.
- Probably not,
when my kids are starving,
I tend to feed them.
I'm sorry if that makes me
the fun parent.
Hey kids, throw away your books,
get rid of your toothbrushes,
you're with daddy, now.
Dad says my Al Gore picture is creepy.
Honey, it's not that it's creepy,
it's just every inch of the wall
in your bedroom is covered with pictures
of either Al Gore or Mahatma Gandhi.
You know? Thank God, you have that one
picture of that guy from Entourage.
That's Che Guevera, Dad.
I don't know what the actor name is,
Louise, and I'm just glad that you...
have a crush on somebody
closer to your own age.
Your father isn't criticizing you,
he knows both you and Tom
are gonning to have lots of healthy,
wonderfull relationship.
- We know, mum.
- We know, mum.
Why do you say stuff like that to them?
Because, Children of divorce
are more likely to struggle
in their own relationship.
There is an entire chapter on it
in "Rules for a perfect divorce".
The book that Dr. Krandall
gave both of us to read.
God! You haven't even
opened yours, have you?
I don't have to read it, I have
the audio version sitting on my couch.
Gary, we both agreed
to follow Dr Krandall rules,
because it was the best for the kids.
- They are doing great.
- Really?
Have you noticed that Tommy
is scared to death of girls?
He should be affraid of girls,
they pretend to like you,
and then they take all your stuff.
Look, Tommy will like girls
when he's ready to like girls.
Dr Krandall and I have encouraged him
to make female friends in Second Life.
Oh no, that dorky computer game?
It's an online society, Gary, okay?
It's a safe place for him
to meet other teens.
Yeah, maybe a congress man.
Bye kids, have fun with your dad.
I never did.
Alright, you are a liar, that's a lie.
I know, but it felt good saying it.
Which one takes Ginkgo before bed?
I would really appreciate it if you
didn't quizz me about my own kids
It's Tommy. Louise.
I know it's Tommy.
It's Louise. Tommy!
One capsule, right before bed,
with plenty of water.
- That's Louise.
- I knew it was Louise.
Gary Unmarried: 1x01 - Pilot
Transcript : charliea
Synchro : charliea / Sixe
Hey, pal.
Hey, look at that, Second Life.
That's pretty cool.
You know, we didn't have anything
like that when I was a kid.
We had... outside.
Your mum's telling me you can meet
girls in there.
It's called "In World".
Yeah you can meet tons of girl, tons.
- You ever meet one?
- No.
There is one girl that I really like
at school, her name is Danielle,
but we are never "In World"
at the same time so...
Tommy. Listen to me, okay.
Hear me out.
If there's ever a girl that you meet
in this world,
maybe you can bring her
over to the house,
she can come to your room,
you guys can study, talk.
- A girl in my room?
- Yeah.
- I can't invite a girl over here.
- Why not?
What if she expects me to, you know,
tap it?
What would you be tapping?
- I don't know.
- Okay, that's great.
Look, you're fourteen years old.
You're not gonna have to worry
about girls for a while.
- Thank God.
- Okay.
Look, I have to go see about a job,
do me a favor,
keep an eye on your sister for me?
If I try to give you Ginkgo tonight,
don't take it.
- Hey, Dennis.
- Hey.
Has the owner been by today?
What's her name... Vanessa?
I saw her car a while ago.
Really? When?
This morning, in front of your house.
Alright, yeah. We hooked up last night,
it was amazing but
I think I might have scared her off
and she never wants to see me again.
- Jackpot!
- No.
That's not a jackpot,
I mean I really like this girl,
I wanted to see where this thing
was gonna go.
No, no, no. Don't do this,
you just got divorced.
You're a free agent.
You don't sign with the first team
that shows you their facilities.
I'm not looking for a long term
relationship with Vanessa,
I just wanna spend some time with
someone cool, sexy and has a tatoo.
You just described Paco, and he's not
looking for anything serious either.
Really?
Hey, Dennis. Is this okay...
Is it okay, if I took the fabric
to the color of the wall?
Yeah, help yourself,
just be carefull what you touch.
You could have tell me that yesterday.
Look, Vanessa, I'm really sorry
about last night.
Vanessa, please talk to me.
Look, I'm a big girl.
We had a good time last night,
I know you're not ready
for this and that's fine.
But I'm ready for this. I really am.
It's just that my ex-wife and I,
we decided
to do this divorce by a couple of rules
for the kids' sake,
like how long to wait before we start
seeing other people, and last night,
I'm pretty sure I broke
a lot of those rules,
as well as a few of
my own personal records.
Two was a personal record?
Yeah.
Look, Vanessa,
I really like you. I do.
If you give me another chance, I'd love
to see how this thing turns out.
Really?
What about the agreement
that you have with your ex-wife?
I'm gonna take care of that right now,
I'm gonna go talk to my ex-wife Allison,
and I'm gonna tell her no more rules.
Okay? Can I see you later?
I don't know, this seems like
a really bad idea.
I'll take that as a maybe.
It's open.
Sorry, I'm still getting used to having
to knock on my own door.
It's my door now,
and of course you don't have to knock,
you can ring the bell.
Look, I came over here to talk to you
about something that's really important.
And I don't want it to end in a fight.
- It's about dating.
- I'm not interested.
Delightfull.
No, I meant other people,
dating other people.
Preferably people
who don't turn the lights on during sex
and ask me
what I'm trying to accomplish.
I did that one time, Gary.
And you seemed to be lost, okay?
What is it you
don't want to fight about?
I know we've agreed
to these rules, okay?
And one part of the rules is when
it's okay to start seeing other people,
and I think that time is gonna
come up soon for either one of us,
and I think it's important that when one
of us does see someonelse,
that the other one
doesn't make a big deal out of it.
Okay, I promise when you start
seeing someone,
I'll not make a big deal about it.
Oh my Gosh! That's great. And then,
when you wanna see somebody,
I won't make a big deal out
of it either, okay?
Good, cause I'm getting married.
What?
I'm engaged, and thank you.
I have been a rack
trying to figure out
how to break it to you, and now,
I can finally tell the kids,
and wear this.
Oh my Gosh.
Who are you getting married to?
Well, someone that I've been seeing,
since we split.
Actually, you've been seeing him too...
... every Tuesday at 8am.
Dr. Krandall? You are marrying
our marriage counselor?
I know, it's just so crazy, right?
The guy that's always covered
in cat hair and crumbs?
And he wears a turtleneck sweater
even though he doesn't have a neck?
Gary, he's sensitive and brilliant,
and he makes me feel young.
Of course he does, he's eighty.
He's in his fifties.
I don't know what to say.
Well, you know what?
A lot of people go with congratulations.
Okay. You know what then?
Congratulations.
Congratulations on marrying
the person who we both went to
to try to hold our marriage together.
Oh my Gosh!
Isn't there a rule against that?
Isn't there a law against that?
Come on, Gary! Grow up!
The heart doesn't know how to follow
a bunch of stupid rules.
This is good for both of us,
maybe this will force you to move on to.
Maybe I already have.
Please.
Don't pretend to be seeing someone
just to compete with me.
That is sad.
I'm not competing with you Allison, you
are engaged, to be married, you've won.
Okay? And your prize, is a guy who rides
a bicycle with a windshield.
Hey, louise. Sweetie, will you help me
get rid of these groceries?
- Put 'em away for me.
- Sure, dad.
Hey, where's your brother?
Oh, he's in his room studying...
with a girl.
With a girl? Like a real, live--
human being person girl?
Way to go, Tommy.
Is she cute?
That's degrading.
I don't judge people by appearances.
That's why I love you, Louise.
But let's be honest.
You wouldn't have
all those pictures of Gandhi
on your bedroom wall
If he wasn't so hot.
Hey, son.
I didn't know you had company over.
It was your idea, remember?
Way to play along, Capt. Smooth.
Hi, I'm Tommy's dad.
Nice to meet you. I'm Danielle.
Hi, Danielle.
I ordered a pizza.
So if you guys
get hungry later, just...
yell.
Tommy, do you have a question?
Didn't you need me to help you with that
thing out in the hall?
Yes, I did. Excuse me.
Tommy, I need his help with the thing.
Out in the hall. It's very heavy.
We'll be right back.
Glad you brought that up.
I forgot about it.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
There is a girl in my room!
What am I supposed to do with her?!
I don't know. Talk to her.
Tell her you like her hair.
I'm not gonna lie to her, dad.
Can't you just tell her I was
called away on some emergency?
Yes. Yes, I can do that.
That's a great idea.
I'll tell her that the F.B.I.
came to the door.
And they asked for you.
And they called you away
on a top secret mission
Called operation: Wuss Bag.
Now get back in there.
And talk to your friend!
- All right.
- Look. All right. Look.
Seriously though,
she likes you,
Otherwise she wouldn't be here. Ok?
You're a good looking guy.
You better get used to this.
She smells really good.
They all do.
That's how they get ya.
Louise, would you bring daddy a beer?
Mom says it makes me an enabler.
Well, in that case
bring daddy a shot of tequila, too.
That'll make you a bartender.
Hello, gary.
Hello, dr. Krandall.
I understand allison brought you up
to speed on our little indiscretion.
I'm not sure what makes me more mad--
The fact that you're sleeping
with my ex-wife
Or you made me keep
a dream journal.
I validate your rage, Gary.
And that's why I'm here.
To give you a chance
to exact your pound of flesh.
All I ask is that you not strike me
above the neck.
I have a book jacket
photo session in the morning.
- I'm not gonna hit you.
- I think you'll find it therapeutic.
I'm interested, too,
from a research standpoint.
I've never been beaten up before.
Yeah.
I find that hard to believe.
- Walter, stop right now.
- Allison, what are you doing here?
How come you don't have to knock
before you walk into my house?
Don't be petty, all right?
Walter left a crazy note
Saying he was coming
over here to take his lumps.
I don't want the two of you
fighting over me.
No. No.
The testosterone is raging.
Come on, now.
Give me your worst.
I already gave you my worst.
And you put a ring on its finger.
Hey, there's the pizza guy.
Maybe he'll hit you below the head.
Hi.
Hi.
I really appreciate
you coming over earlier.
It was really sweet.
There's something I need to tell you.
There's already a man in my life.
This is my son, Parker.
And he really needs
to use your bathroom.
- Hey, Parker, how are ya buddy?
- Hi.
The bathroom's upstairs, Ok.
I can't believe
he doesn't have a bathroom downstairs.
Come on in. Come on in.
Everybody,
this is my friend Vanessa.
That's my ex-wife Allison.
That's our former marriage counselor
and her new fiance Dr. Walter Krandall.
Charmed.
He says things like "charmed."
he's old.
I'm old.
He's afraid of birds.
Hey, you know what?
That was in a dream journal fella.
Gary, I'm sorry I doubted you
when you said you were seeing someone.
Vanessa and I just met.
We're still learning so many
wonderful things about each other.
- Oh, my gosh. Why didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you tell me?
If I may, there are obviously issues
the two of you need to discuss.
Yeah, you should go.
As it is my field,
I was going to offer to mediate
between you and
this delightful friend of yours.
No. No way, Krandall.
This one I like.
Fine, Gary.
I'll let you handle this on your own.
As long as you understand
how difficult it is
for a single mother
under these conditions,
Which is one of the most demanding
and challenging roles that there is.
Thank you.
I love him.
Isn't he great?
He bakes his own bread.
Yeah, I buy my bread at the store.
I support America.
Ok. I guess I'll go first.
Gary didn't tell me
that he had kids or an ex-wife.
Really?
You want me--
All right, well Vanessa didn't tell me
that she had a son.
And I felt humiliated and deceived.
I also felt humiliated
and deceived,
but for me
it's kind of a turn on.
And why didn't you tell Gary
you had a son?
Well, I've been a single mom
for a long time now.
and I'm very careful
about who I introduce Parker to.
And earlier, Gary come over and said
he wanted to see where this would go.
Which I do.
And the more I thought about it,
I think that i'm actually
ready for a serious,
long-term relationship.
I'm sorry. What?
I didn't think that you'd be ready
to commit to somebody this quickly.
Me? Then you don't know
anything about me.
Commit. Please!
You guys don't know
anything about Gary.
Because I love long-term,
long, long relationships.
I mean, gee whiz, my last long-term
relationship commitment just ended.
You know, so the timing is perfect.
I better call the pizza guy
to see if he got lost or something.
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing. No. I'm ok.
God, I haven't seen you
this freaked out
since that swan
chased you at Disneyland.
Leave me alone, I'm fine.
And why wasn't that swan
chasing anyone else?!
Gary, I know what you're
going through right now.
She wants more of a relationship
Than you think you're ready to handle.
I went through the same thing
with Walter.
Do you know how I felt the first time
he put his arms around me?
Where you helping him in
or out of the tub?
I would actually like
to see you be happy?
And Vanessa out there
could be a good first step.
For whatever reason,
she seems to like you.
There may not-- there may
not be many more out there like that.
- Are you saying I'm not a catch?
- Let her decide.
Just don't give her a reason
to throw you back.
You're right, Allison.
Thank you.
But to be clear, no.
You're not a catch.
- Pizza's here.
- Thanks, honey. Go tell your brother.
I can't.
He's in his room with a girl.
- Tom has a girl in his room?
- With the door locked.
Tom, it's mommy,
what are you doing in there?
Nothing now that
you just said mommy.
Tom, honey,
why is the door locked?
It wasn't.
It was just jammed.
Remember, dad said
he was going to fix it?
Yeah. Sorry.
I'll get right on that.
Louise said you had a friend over.
Yeah, Danielle went home.
But she got online. We're both
"In World" together at a beach party.
Oh, cool. Well, sorry to bother ya.
Have fun at your beach party.
Wear lots of sunscreen.
L.O.L.
You were right. He's not ready
to have a girl over to the house yet.
I know, Gary.
You try. You mean well.
But I have better instincts
when it comes to our kids.
I know.
Hey, handsome, the pizza's here
if you get hungry. Ok?
- Ok.
- All right.
Uh, Danielle, sweetie,
You left your purse out in the open
where we could all see it.
I told her I liked her hair.
Eh, no. Let's uh--
Let's keep this open, ok?
I want to talk to you.
My name's gary.
I have an annoying ex-wife
and 2 wonderful kids.
Hi, gary. I'm Vanessa.
I'm a single mom, and I have 2 tattoos.
You want to see
where this thing goes?
Sure.
Wait a minute. 2 tattoos?
Where's the other one?
Finish painting my condo,
and I'll show ya.
Bonjour.
J'ai pas repeint ton appartement
il y a deux semaines ?
Non, des mecs ont repeint
mon appartement
pendant que tu me draguais.
Ces mecs vivent le rêve américain.
T'arrives à l'heure, tu bosses dur et
peut-être que ton boss pourra coucher.
Ok. Allons prendre une douche.
Tu sais quoi ?
Tu vas prendre une douche.
Je vais rester ici
et essayer de trouver un nom
à ces positions
que j'ai inventées la nuit dernière.
Chéri, la moitiée de ces positions
sont pas nouvelles et, sur la dernière,
je crois que t'as trébuché.
Il est possible que j'aie trébuché,
mais je suis bien retombé.
Tu étais super.
C'était une nuit incroyable.
Il y en a encore plein en réserve...
si j'arrive encore à marcher.
Mon dos !
Quoi de neuf ?
- Tu as du shampoing ?
- Oui, faut juste
prendre une des bouteilles vides,
y mettre un peu d'eau et secouer.
Faites que ce soit un chiropracteur
qui fait du porte-à-porte.
- C'est qui ?
- Mon ex-femme.
Si on fait pas de bruit,
elle s'en ira sûrement.
Crois-moi, il faut que tu aies
une relation normale avec ton ex.
Alors, descend,
sois gentil et vois ce qu'elle veut.
Je sais ce qu'elle veut.
Elle a déjà eu la gauche.
- Salut, papa.
- Salut, beauté.
Je t'aime. Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Pourquoi ils sont pas à l'école ?
On a dû s'arrêter ici pour prendre
tout ce que tu avais oublié
- de leur déposer hier soir.
- De quoi tu parles ?
J'ai mis tout ce qu'ils avaient
dans leurs cartables. J'ai oublié quoi ?
Leurs cartables.
Et j'ai eu une amende pour
excès de vitesse en venant ici.
T'as eu une amende ?
Il t'arrive quoi ?
Tes deux amies féminines
ne t'ont pas aidé à t'en sortir ?
Je vais pas m'abaisser à ce niveau.
Pourquoi pas ?
Je l'ai fait, moi.
Tu sais, si on était à Mardi gras,
tu aurais bien plus de perles,
mon ami. Ok ?
- C'est vrai.
- Pas dans ma chambre.
On trouve toujours pas
le violoncelle de Louise.
- Comment tu perds un violoncelle ?
- Je sais pas, je l'ai cherché partout.
Louise, va dans la voiture.
J'arrive de suite, d'accord ?
- Au revoir, papa.
- T'as des contrôles aujourd'hui ?
Je vais fais une exam du français.
Formidable ! Dommage
qu'on soit jamais allé en Allemagne.
- Pourquoi tu marches comme ton père ?
- Quoi ?
Je me suis fait mal au dos.
Oh mon Dieu ! Tu es
la seule personne qui sait le réparer.
Allez, tu peux le faire.
Je me mets par terre, tu le répares.
Pour réparer ton dos,
il faudrait que j'aille
par terre et te monte dessus.
C'est franchir la limite.
Allez, aide-moi.
Fais-le, c'est tout !
D'accord, mais pas d'agitation inutile.
Comment tu t'es fait ça cette fois ?
En portant quelque chose ?
- Non, je soulevais pas de poids.
- T'as peint des plafonds ?
Je me suis pas fait mal en faisant
un truc pour lequel tu m'avais prévenu.
Je me suis fait mal en faisant des trucs
étonnants avec ma nouvelle petite amie.
- Et j'ai fini !
- Quoi ?
Tu m'as pas touché !
Je veux pas entendre parler
de ta vie sexuelle, ok ?
- Apprends les limites.
- Les limites ?
Tu es fiancée
à notre conseiller conjugal.
Tu ne crois pas
que c'est franchir une limite ?
Le Dr. Krandall, a tout fait pour
sauver notre mariage, y compris moi...
Et j'ai dit cela que
parce que tu allais le faire.
Je parie que si le Dr. Krandall
se blessait et pouvait plus
faire de son vélo débile,
tu le remettrais en place.
Je remettrais son dos en place
parce qu'il est mon fiancé...
et aussi un auteur publié
qui est apparu dans le "Time",
et est passé dans le "Today show".
Oui ! Willard Scott lui souhaitait
un joyeux anniversaire ?
- Ce sont tes clefs ?
- Oui.
Allez, Tom.
On va être en retard.
À plus, papa.
C'est ton portable
qui vibre sans arrêt ?
C'est Danielle.
Elle m'a appelé 11 fois ce matin.
Alors, j'ai arrêté de répondre.
Je savais pas que
Danielle était si possessive.
Un petit peu.
Tu sais, elle insiste pour me tenir
la main tout le temps, même à midi.
Je peux pas manger.
Et je crois que ma main gauche
devient plus petite à force.
Sors là. Montre-la-moi.
Montre-moi si tu peux attraper
les clefs de papa avec cette main.
Et voilà.
T'es un bon garçon.
Écoute, je dois te dire un truc,
C'est bien ce qui t'arrive, non ?
Cette fille t'aime bien ?
En plus, tu te fais la main.
Je suis le premier
de mes potes à le faire.
Bon garçon !
Mais si elle n'était pas si sexy,
je dirais qu'elle est folle.
Ouais. C'est une bonne chose
que les plus sexy soient jamais folles.

Denis, s'il te plaît. Fais ce truc
pour mon dos. Allez, faut juste...
que tu mettes ma main sur ma tête,
que tu t'asseyes sur moi,
puis tu m'enjambes,
et tu tires sur mon bassin jusqu'à
ce que tu entendes un truc craquer.
Je vais pas te faire ça, mec.
Aide-moi. Donne-moi ta main.
Donne-moi la main.
D'accord.
C'est bon.
Ma main.
Mon dos.
Je viens de mettre la main sur mon dos !
Si j'étais dans mon ancienne maison,
Allison aurait fait craquer mon dos,
je me serais mis dans mon jacuzzi
et je serais comme neuf.
Le sexe non-stop avec
Vanessa me tue.
C'est horrible.
Je t'ai dit que ma femme
venait de prendre 10 kilos ?
Voilà le truc avec Vanessa.
Tu l'as vu, elle est magnifique.
Et je sais pas pourquoi,
elle pense que je suis incroyable.
Faut que je sois au niveau.
Elle couchait avec ces mecs souples,
sans poils, bronzés,
des mecs H&M...
Tu sais ce que c'est ?
C'est comme si, je devais
à chaque fois faire mes preuves.
Pour être franc avec toi, Denis,
je me suis jamais senti si vulnérable.
Tu te rappelles
quand on parlait de football ?
T'as trouvé le violoncelle ?
Louise a une répétition ce soir.
<i>Qui est-ce ?</i>
Tu l'as cherché au moins ?
<i>Non, je le cherche pas.
Je suis en route pour le travail.</i>
<i>Je suis sur l'autoroute.
Que veux-tu que je fasse ? Hé, mec !</i>
J'ai juste besoin
d'un peu de route, ok ?
Ce mec a failli me tuer. C'est fou.
Putain. Étudiant d'honneur, mon cul.
Tu sais quoi ?
Oui ? C'est vraiment classe
avec ton gamin dans la voiture.
- J'ai pas de bière, Gary.
- Même pas en bas... ?
Mon Dieu !
Que fais-tu ? T'es jamais
à la maison à cette heure-là !
Quoi ? J'ai séché un cours pour rentrer
étudier pour un...
J'ai pas besoin de te dire
pourquoi je suis chez moi !
- T'étais dans mon jacuzzi ?
- Non, j'étais dans mon jacuzzi,
- que j'ai construit de mes mains.
- Que mon avocat a pu récupérer
à ton ami qui a pris des cours
de droit sur internet.
Écoute, je suis vraiment désolé
pour ton dos.
Mais vraiment, venir ici et...
qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- J'enlève mon maillot.
- Dans ma cuisine ?
Oui, parce que tu t'énervais toujours
si je laissais des traces d'eau
- dans la maison.
- Tu viens de...
J'arrive pas à croire
que tu te déshabilles devant moi.
Ça va. Je vois pas où est le problème.
Me déshabiller devant toi c'est comme...
me déshabiller devant un mec.
Un mec ?
J'allais dire un chien, mais je savais
que ça te plairait pas.
Tu sais quoi ?
Rhabille-toi et va-t-en.
Et à partir de maintenant,
nouvelles limites, Ok ?
Pas le droit de venir dans ma maison
ou même en dehors de ma maison !
Et je n'irais pas chez toi.
Et pourquoi es-tu toujours nu ?
Parce que mon dos vient de se coincer,
je peux pas me baisser.
Bon Dieu !
Faut que tu m'aides
à ramasser mon caleçon.
D'accord.
Donne-moi ton pied droit.
- Ton pied droit. T'as 3 ans ou quoi ?
- Pardon.
J'y crois pas, tu viens chez moi,
te sers dans le frigo, tu enlèves
ton pantalon. Débrouille-toi seul !
Mon Dieu, c'est juste...
D'accord.
Je sais pas pourquoi tu fais
tout un plat d'une si petite chose.
C'est que cette petite chose
est dans ma cuisine.
T'as mis la clim,
et j'étais en face du frigo.
Va-t-en de chez moi !
Je sais que c'est chez toi,
et je respecte ça.
Je suis juste allé dans le jacuzzi
à cause de mon dos, c'est la vérité.
Les hamburgers sont prêts.
Mon Dieu, c'est le paradis dans mon dos.
Oui.
Je savais que ça allait arriver !
Et pourtant...
je l'ai fait quand même.
- Papa ?
- Par ici, chérie.
- Salut, papa.
- Comment tu vas ? Désolé.
J'ai pas encore retrouvé
ton violoncelle ? Où est ton frère ?
Juste derrière moi.
Tommy, la puberté a fait mal.
- Bonjour, Gary.
- Bonjour, Krandall.
Allison a demandé si je pouvais
récupérer Tom et Louise à l'école.
Super.
Où est Tom ?
Malheureusement, j'avais de la place
que pour un sur mon vélo.
Il m'a fait courir derrière lui !
C'est pas du tout la définition
"d'aller chercher" !
Qu'est-ce qui vous chiffone, Krandall ?
Les lumières allumées, pour commencer.
J'ai compris qu'il y avait eu
un incident entre vous et Allison.
Elle préfère ne pas vous parler
pendant un moment.
Vraiment ? Elle me punit
en ne venant pas chez moi ?
J'espère qu'elle m'en voudra pas et
qu'elle arrête d'encaisser la pension.
Je sais pas ce qui se passe entre vous,
mais si t'as envie d'en parler,
je mets ma casquette de thérapeute.
Elle s'attache comme celle-là ?
Humour détourné, c'est très sain.
Mais si vous me donnez votre version,
je vous ferez part de mon avis éclairé.
Sans offense, Krandall,
mais je crois pas.
Vous épousez mon ex,
vous pouvez pas être plus malin que moi.
J'ai essayé de lui parler,
mais elle veut pas m'en parler non plus.
Moi, parmi tout le monde.
Je suis un professionnel.
Vous savez qu'un de mes clients
est Sir Ben Kingsley ?
Vous êtes pas censé me le dire !
Je sais. Je me suis engueulé
avec Parker Posey à ce sujet.
Écoute, Danielle, J'ai des devoirs
à faire. Je dois vraiment y aller.
<i>On peut se regarder faire nos devoirs ?</i>
<i>Tu viens de me réduire ?</i>
Non, non.
Y a un problème avec mon ordinateur.
Ça va revenir, c'est juste...
J'aime bien celle-là.
- Elle est vraiment accro, non ?
- Elle me rend folle, papa.
Elle m'appelle tout le temps,
laisse des mots dans mon casier.
Elle m'a fait lui tenir la main
pendant l'assemblée.
Les deux mains. Comme si
on faisait des figures en patin.
Pourquoi tu te prends la tête avec ça ?
Je suis juste un mec moyen, Ok ?
Et c'est une bonnasse.
Ok.
Laisse-moi te dire un truc.
Montre-moi une bonnasse
et je te montre un mec qui en a marre...
de tenir ses mains.
Ok. Alors...
qu'est-ce que je dois faire ?
Je veux pas rompre avec elle.
Tu dois être honnête avec elle.
Tu dois la sortir
et lui dire de se calmer. C'est tout.
La sortir ?
Vraiment ?
Les femmes aiment l'honnêteté.
Si cette fille te fatigue,
tu peux pas faire
comme si tout allait bien.
Mon Dieu.
- Ça va, papa ?
- Y a rien...
C'est Danielle.
Mon Dieu, elle appelle de la maison.
Écoute,
sois fort, Ok ?
- Merci.
- Pas de quoi.
Salut, chérie. Quoi de neuf ?
- Mon lift est là.
- Ok. Écoute.
T'as pas à aller au cours
de violoncelle. T'as rien pour jouer.
Je suis dans le groupe, papa.
Tu crois pas que si j'avais
mieux à faire, je le ferai ?
- Hé, je sors, ok ?
- Attend. Où tu vas ?
Danielle et moi allons...
- sortir.
- Tu reviens quand ?
Je sais pas. Je dois passer chez elle.
Alors... on verra.
Te voilà, lambin.
C'est dégueulasse,
tout ces mecs souples,
flexible,
et sans poils.
C'est lequel H ?
- Salut, Vanessa.
- Hé, mon mignon.
C'était qui la blonde qui
traînait ton fils comme un wagon ?
C'est sa copine.
Elle est folle... de lui.
Où est Parker ? Tu l'as pas ce soir ?
Son père voulait l'emmener
à un match, alors on a échangé.
- Je me disais qu'on pouvait se voir.
- Oui, bien sûr. À quoi...
- À quoi tu pensais ?
- Je sais pas.
Boire des bières, regarder le foot,
relax.
Vraiment ?
C'est génial.
T'imagines pas comment c'est bien,
parce que je voulais te dire
que mon dos...
- Salut, les gars.
- Mon dos est très excité.
- Regardez-moi ça.
- Bonsoir, ma chère.
J'espère que ça te dérange pas.
Je suis rentré.
Pas du tout.
Qu'est-ce que je sens ?
Le Chateau Briand et ça va brûler
si je trouve pas des pincettes.
Walter, tu es super. C'est
exactement ce qu'il me faut ce soir.
J'espère arranger ta journée.
J'ai parlé à Gary tantôt.
S'il te plaît, ne dis pas son nom.
Je passe un bon moment, me le gâche pas.
Absolument, c'est mon plan. Si
tu veux partager quelque chose,
comme Sir Ben Kingsley le fait
tout les mercredis...
Walter, je t'aime. Je veux juste
ne pas parler. Je veux me détendre.
Alors j'ai quelque chose de spécial
pour toi. Ferme les yeux.
J'aime le son que ça fait.
Garde-les fermés.
- Oh, mon Dieu !
- Magnifique, n'est-ce pas ?
Walter, où diable as-tu trouvé ça ?
Dans la buanderie,
sous une pile de vêtements.
Pourquoi ne pas m'avoir dit que
tu avais un violoncelle ?
C'est horrible.
Je reconnais être un peu rouillé mais...
pourquoi je me justifie ?
De quel instrument tu joues ?
Ça va, mon cœur ?
On dirait que tu as mal.
Mal ? Moi ? Non.
Non. Mal ?
Non, je fais des trucs...
comme des grognements.
Je sais pas si
tu t'y connais en gorille.
- En fait, oui.
- Alors tant pis.
- Assis-toi.
- Ok. Tu sais quoi ?
En parlant de gorille,
je vais descendre faire
une commande de peinture d'urgence.
- Une commande d'urgence ?
- Me cassse pas mon délire, chérie.
Tu savais à quoi t'attendre
en sortant avec un peintre, ok ?
Ok. Très bien.
Violon-salut.
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Ce que je fais ? Et toi ?
Je dépose le violoncelle.
Il s'avère qu'il était...
dans la buanderie pendant tout ce temps.
Drôle, non ? Ok, salut.
Non, attends.
Alors tu le ramènes chez moi,
en douce comme s'il avait été
là tout ce temps ?
Je pensais que tu étais sorti et
tu t'es introduit chez moi, aujourd'hui.
J'ai dû utiliser le jacuzzi
pour mon dos.
Je m'en fiche, Gary.
On doit s'en tenir à ce qu'on a dit.
Non, non. Ce que tu as dit
et ce que je comprends pas,
parce que je me fiches
de qui rentre chez qui, ça n'a
aucun sens pour moi.
Et je sais pas pourquoi... Mon Dieu !
Mon dos, Allison !
S'il te plaît, aide-moi !
Je peux même plus bouger !
Tu sais pas pourquoi je suis en colère ?
Très bien. Par où je commence ?
J'ai pas échappé à l'excès de vitesse
grâce à mon charme
pour la première fois de ma vie !
Et quand le flic a regardé
ma date de naissance,
il m'a demandé si je connaissais
sa mère... ce qui était le cas.
Ensuite, mon idiot d'ex-mari
dont le dos est bloqué
dû à trop de sexe
avec sa jeune petite-amie,
se déshabille devant moi
et dit que c'est pareil que
de se déshabiller devant un mec !
C'est tout ?
C'est pour ça que tu m'en veux.
Le mot "mec" ?
Mon Dieu !
Je me sens mieux !
Très bien !
Pourquoi tu t'inquiètes de ce que
je pense ? Je suis ton ex !
Exactement, Gary.
On a été marié.
J'ai eu deux enfants avec ce type.
Je veux pas que tu me désires.
Juste savoir que je plais encore.
Tu sais pas comment c'est.
C'est différent pour les mecs.
Différent ? Je sais pas ce que c'est
de vieillir ? Je suis le tin-man !
T'as dû me graisser à l'instant !
Écoute, te plains pas.
T'as presque 40 ans,
mais t'es toujours bonne.
Quoi... Bonne ?
Écoute, désolé pour aujourd'hui.
J'aurais pas dû utiliser ton jacuzzi.
Désolé d'être entré chez toi.
Désolé d'avoir que
c'était pareil que devant un mec.
J'ai été idiot, excuse-moi.
Bonne... comment ?
Bonne, genre si on était dans un bar
et que je te connaissais pas
et si tu portais ta robe rouge
avec tes cheveux relevés...
Rien d'autre ?
Si tu parlais pas autant
ou critiquait pas
ma tenue ou le service...
J'irai dans ce bar
et t'inviterai à danser,
et je ferai tout ce que je peux
pour te mettre dans mon lit.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui, vraiment.
Merci.
Supposant que ce soit le dernier verre
et qu'il y ait personne de plus jeune.
Allez. Je pensais que
ça te ferait du bien.
Presque. Un peu, et puis plus,
et presque encore,
et enfin, c'était fini.
Beaucoup comme
coucher avec toi, en fait.
J'ai inventé de nouvelles
positions depuis.
Bonsoir.
- Très bien.
- Écoute...
je m'excuse de t'avoir
accusé pour le violoncelle.
J'étais sûr de l'avoir perdu.
Elle me va bien
ma robe rouge, n'est-ce pas ?
Bonne.
Désolé.
Ça a pris plus de temps
que je le pensais.
- Alors tu l'as traité de mec ?
- Oui.
C'est quoi le problème avec ton dos ?
D'accord, je dois t'avouer un truc.
Mon dos est plutôt abîmé de toutes
ces années de football, de surf et
de peinture, et apparemment,
il se bloque
après du sexe accrobatique très long.
Pourquoi tu as fait ça, d'ailleurs.
Je voulais pas que tu penses
que je suis un de ces vieux
qui sait plus tenir la longueur.
Tenir la longueur ?
C'est moi qui esssayait de tenir.
Je sais que les mecs divorcés
font n'importe quoi,
mais au moins, la plupart font ça
vite fait, bien fait.
Toi, il te faut plus qu'une femme.
Si tu veux marquer ça
sur le mur d'une salle de bain
ou faire un mail groupé pour
tout mes amis, ce serait génial.
Hé, mon pote.
- comment c'était ?
- Bien, vraiment bien.
Je lui ai dit de me lâcher un peu
et tu avais raison. Les femmes
- adorent quand tu dis ce que tu penses.
- C'est génial.
Tes lèvres...
On dirait du gloss.
Et tu as...
Tu as des paillettes sur le visage.
Sérieux ?
Vous vous embrassiez
pendant tout ce temps !
Ouais ! Je suis canon !
C'est terrible, mon pote !
Et plus je lui disait
d'arrêter de me tenir la main,
plus elle voulait m'embrasser.
Je vais lui dire d'arrêter de
m'embrasser, pour voir.
Vas-y mollo, partenaire.
Prends un peu de temps pour
apprécier les lèvres au gloss.
- Très bien. Bonne nuit.
- À demain.
J'ai le dos en compote.

Good morning.
Didn't I paint your condo
a couple weeks ago?
No, a bunch of workers painted my condo
while you hit on me.
You know what? Those workers
are living the american dream.
You show up on time, you work hard,
and just maybe your boss will get laid.
OK. Let's go take a shower.
You know what?
You go take a shower.
I'm going to lay here
and try to put a name
on some of those positions
I invented last night.
Honey, half those positions aren't new,
and the last one,
I think you stumbled into.
I might have stumbled into it,
but I'm pretty sure I stuck the landing.
You were great.
Last night was unbelievable.
There's plenty more
where that came from...
If I can ever walk again.
My back.
What's up?
- You got any shampoo?
- Yeah, just
grab one of the empty bottles, put
some water in it, and just shake it up.
Please let that be a
door-to-door chiropractor.
- Who is that?
- That's my ex-wife.
If we're quiet,
she'll probably just go away.
Gary, believe me, you need to
have a civil relationship with your ex.
So just go downstairs,
be pleasant, and see what she wants.
I know what she wants.
She already has my left one.
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, Cutie.
I love you. What's going on?
Why aren't the kids at school?
We had to stop by here to pick up
everything you forgot
- to drop off with them last night.
- What are you talking about?
I put everything they had into their
backpacks. What did I forget?
Their backpacks.
And I got a speeding ticket
on the way over here, too.
You got a speeding ticket?
What's the matter?
Your two lady friends couldn't
help get you out of it?
No, Gary.
I'm not going to sink to that level.
Why not?
They have.
You know what, Gary?
If we were at Mardi gras,
you would get way more beads,
my friend. OK?
- That's right.
- It's not in my room, mom.
We still can't find Louise's cello.
How do you lose a cello, Gary?
I don't know.
I've looked everywhere for that thing.
Get in the car.
I'll be right out. All right?
- Bye, dad.
- Do you have any tests today?
Je vais fais une exam du francias.
That's fantastic.
Too bad we're never going to Germany.
- Why are you walking like your father?
- What? I hurt my back.
My gosh! You're the only one alive
that knows how to fix it.
- What?
- Come on. You can do it.
I'll get on the ground.
You fix it.
In order to fix your back,
I would have to get on
the floor and climb all over you.
It's crossing a line.
Come on. Help me.
Help me! Just do it!
All right, but no unnecessary wiggling.
How'd you hurt it this time?
What? With lifting something?
No, I wasn't lifting weights.
What, are you painting ceilings?
Allison, I did not hurt my back
doing anything you warned me about, OK?
I hurt my back having super-amazing
hot sex with my new girlfriend.
- And I'm done.
- What?
You never even touched me!
I don't want to hear about your sex
life, OK? Learn some boundaries, man.
Boundaries?
You're engaged to our marriage
therapist. Don't you think
that's crossing a boundary?
Dr. Walter krandall did everything could
to save our marriage, including me.
And I only said that because
I knew you were going to.
I bet if Dr. Walter krandall
hurt his back
and couldn't ride his dumb little bike
around town, you'd fix it.
I would fix walter's back
because he is my fiance...
And he's also a published author
and has appeared in "Time" magazine,
and he was on the "Today" show.
Yeah. What?
Willard scott was wishing
him happy birthday?
- Are these your keys?
- Yes, they are.
Come on, tom.
We're gonna be late.
See you, dad.
That's your phone that's been buzzing?
It's just danielle.
She called me 11 times this morning.
So I stopped answering it.
I didn't know danielle
was being so possessive.
A little bit.
You know, she insists on holding
my hand all the time, even during lunch.
I can't eat.
And I think my left hand is
getting smaller from all the squeezing.
Hold it out. Let me see that left hand.
Let me see, with that left hand,
if you can pick up daddy's keys.
There you go. You're a good guy.
Listen, I got to tell you something,
Tommy, this is a good thing, OK?
This girl likes you. Right?
Plus, you're getting hand.
I am the first of my friends to get it.
That a boy!
But if she wasn't so hot,
i'd think she was crazy.
Yeah. It's a good thing
the hot ones are never crazy.

Please. Just do this thing for my back.
Come on. You just...
you get my hand up over my head,
and you sit down on my hips,
and then you straddle me,
and you just kind of rock my hips around
like this until you hear something pop.
Yeah. I'm not going to
be doing that to you, man.
Help me up.
Give me a hand.
Give me a hand here.
All right. That's good.
Gosh. My hand.
My back.
I just put my hand on my back!
If I was in my old house, forget it.
Would have cracked my back,
I would sit in my hot tub,
and I would be as good as new.
This nonstop sex with
vanessa is killing me.
That's terrible.
Did I tell you my wife
just gained 60 pounds?
Look, here's the thing with Vanessa.
You saw her. She's beautiful.
And for some reason, she thinks I'm
incredible. I've got keep up with her.
She used to having sex with
these hairless, bendy,
flexible abercrombie & fitch guys,
you know, and... You know what it is?
It's like every time, I have
to prove myself over and over again.
I got to be honest with you, Dennis.
I've never felt so vulnerable.
Remember when we used
to talk about football?
Have you found the cello yet, Gary?
Louise has practice tonight.
<i>Who is this?</i>
Are you even looking for it?
No, I'm not looking for it. I'm on
my way to work. I'm on the freeway.
What do you want me to do?
Hey, Buddy!
I only need a little
bit of the road, OK?
This guy almost killed me. It's amazing.
Holy smokes. Honor student,
my ass. You know what?
Yeah? That's real classy
with your kid in the car.
I don't have any beer, Gary.
Not even in the downstairs, my god!
What are you doing?
You're never home at this time of day!
What? I skipped a class to come
home and, you know, study for a paper.
OK, you know what? I don't need
to tell you why I'm in my own house.
Were you in my hot tub?
No, I was in my hot tub that
I built with my hands on my patio.
That my lawyer was able to get from
your friend who went
to law school on the internet.
Look, Gary,
I mean, i'm sorry about your back. I am.
But really, seriously, coming over
here and. What are you doing?
- I'm changing out of my trunks.
- In my kitchen?
Yeah, because you always
used to get mad at me
if I would track water
through the house.
Gary, you just.
I can't believe you would
just undress in front of me. God.
All right. Big deal.
I don't see what the big deal is.
I mean, getting undressed
in front of you, it's like
it's like getting undressed
in front of a dude.
A dude?
I gonna say dog, but I knew
it would rub you the wrong way.
You know what, Gary?
You've got to get your suit back on
and go. And from now on, new boundaries,
OK? You are not allowed in my house
or anywhere outside of my house.
OK? And I am not going to go in your
house. And why are you still naked?
Because my back just locked up.
I can't bend down and pick up my shorts.
- For god's sakes!
- I need your help.
Help me pick up my shorts.
All right.
All right, give me your right foot.
OK.
- Your right foot. Jeez, what are you 3?
- I'm sorry.
I can't believe you, Gary.
You come into my house,
you dig through my fridge, you drop your
pants. You know what? Do it yourself!
- OK.
- God, it's just...
Right. I don't know why you're making
such big deal out of such a tiny thing.
That's because the tiny thing
is in my kitchen.
You are cranking the air conditioner,
I was just standing in frot
of a cold refrigerator.
You know what, Gary?
This is my house!
I know it's your house,
Allison, and I respect that.
I was only using the hot tub because
of my back, and that's the truth.
Burgers are ready.
My gosh.
This is heaven on my back.
I knew that was going to happen!
And yet...
i did it anyway.
- Dad?
- Over here, honey.
- Hi, dad.
- Hi. How are you? Sorry.
I didn't find your cello yet, OK?
Hey, where's your brother?
Right behind me.
Tommy, puberty hit you hard.
- Hello, Gary.
- Hello, Krandall.
Allison asked if I could pick
Tom and Louise up from school.
Great. Where's Tom?
Unfortunately, I only had
enough room on my bike for one.
He made me run behind him!
That's not the definition
of being picked up at all!
- What's going on here, Krandall?
- Every light in the house apparently.
I understand there was an
incident between you and Allison.
She prefers not to
speak to you for a while.
Really? She's punishing me by
not coming into my house?
I hope she doesn't get really mean
and stop cashing my alimony checks.
I don't know what's going
on between the two of you,
but if you'd like to talk about it,
i'll put on my therapist's hat.
OK. Does it come with
a chin strap like that one?
Deflective humor. That's very healthy.
But if you give me your version of it,
I will offer my keen insight.
Yeah. No offense, Krandall.
I don't think so. I mean, come on.
You're going to marry my ex-wife.
You can't be much smarter than I am.
I tried talking to her,
but she wouldn't share with me either.
Me, of all people.
I'm a professional.
Do you know that one of
my clients is sir ben kingsley?
You're not supposed to tell me that.
I know. I know. I got an earful about
that from parker posey.
Listen, Danielle,
OK, I have homework to do.
OK? I really need to go.
Can't we watch each other do homework?
Did you just minimize me?
No, no. There's something
wrong with the computer.
I bet any minute now, it's just, rrr!
I like that one.
This girl's really getting to you,
isn't she?
She's driving me crazy, dad.
She calls me all the time.
She stuffs notes in my locker.
You know, today she made me
hold hands with her during the assembly.
Both hands.
It was like we were figure skating.
All right. So, Tommy,
why are you putting up with all this?
Because I'm just an average guy, OK?
- And she's a totally banging girl.
- OK. Tommy, let me tell you something.
You show me a banging girl, and
I'll show you a guy that's tired of...
Holding her hands.
OK. So... so what should I do, dad? OK?
- I don't want to break up with her.
- You just have to be honest with her.
You have to take her for a walk and
tell her to ease up a bit. That's all.
<i>A walk?</i>
Really?
Women respond to honesty.
I mean, if this girl is wearing you out,
you can't just act like nothing's wrong.
My gosh.
- Are you all right, dad?
- Nothing's wrong...
It's Danielle.
My god. She's calling
from inside the house.
Listen,
be strong, OK?
- Thanks.
- All right. You got it.
Hey, Louise.
Hi, honey. What's up?
- My ride's here.
- Look.
You don't have to go to cello practice.
You have nothing to play.
I'm in band, dad.
If I had anything better to do,
don't you think i'd be doing it?
- Hey, I'm taking off dad. OK?
- Wait. Where are you going?
Danielle and I are going
to go on that...
- that walk.
- When are you gonna be back?
I don't know. I've got to go over to
her house. So I'll just. I'll see you.
There you are, slowpoke.
Yuck. This is awful,
all these bendy,
flexible,
hairless men.
Which one is abercrombie?
- Hi. Hi, Vanessa.
- Hey, handsome.
Who was that little blonde
girl pulling your son like a wagon?
That's his girlfriend.
She's crazy... about him.
Where's parker?
Don't you have him tonight?
I did, but his dad wanted to
take him to a game, so we switched.
- Thought you'd want to hang out.
- Yeah, sure. What...
- What did you have in mind?
- I don't know.
Drink some beers,
watch some football, just be mellow.
Really?
That's fantastic.
You have no idea how good that sounds,
because I've been meaning
to tell you that my back.
- Hello, boys.
- My back is very horny.
- Would you look at this?
- Hello, my dear. Hope you don't mind.
- I let myself in.
- Not at all. What am I smelling?
The <i>Chateau Briand</i>, and it's going
to burn unless I find a set of tongs.
Walter, you are so wonderful.
This is exactly what I need tonight.
Hope your day's getting a little
bit better. I spoke to gary earlier.
Please, don't say that name. I'm having
a nice moment. Let me enjoy this.
Absolutely. That's exactly my plan.
If you want to share anything with me,
as sir ben kingsley does
each wednesday...
No, Walter.
Walter, I love you.
I just don't want to talk.
I want to relax.
Then I have something
very special for you.
- Close your eyes.
- I like the sound of that.
Keep them closed.
Oh, my god!
Beautiful, isn't it?
Walter, where the
hell did you find that?
It was in the laundry
room under a pile of clothes.
Why didn't you tell me
you had a cello in the house?
This is awful.
Admittedly I haven't played
in a while, but
why am I defending myself?
What instrument do you play?
Are you OK, sweetie?
You kind of sound like you're in pain.
Pain? Me? No.
Non. Mal?
No, I'm doing, you know, like, primal...
Like grunting noises, you know.
I don't know if you know anything
about the Silver-Back Gorilla.
- I do, actually.
- Well, then never mind.
- Just sit down.
- OK. You know what?
Speaking of gorilla colors,
i'm going to go downstairs and make
an emergency paint order.
- An emergency paint order?
- Look, don't break my chops, honey.
You knew what you were getting into the
minute you started dating a painter, OK?
OK. All right.
Cello, Allison.
- Gary, what are you doing?
- What am I doing? What are you doing?
Just dropping off the Cello.
Yeah, it turns out it was...
It was in my laundry room the whole
time. Isn't that funny? All right, bye.
No, wait.
So you just bring it in my house,
sneak it in here and act like
it was here the whole time?
I thought you were out,
and you, you broke into my house today.
I had to use the hot tub
because you would fix my back.
Look, I don't care what it was, Gary. We
need to stick to the boundaries we set.
No, no, no. The boundaries
that you set that I don't understand,
because I don't really care who
comes in whose house. It doesn't
make sense to me. And I'm not even
sure why you're so mad. Oh, my god!
My back, Allison!
Please help me!
I can't even move!
You don't know why i'm so mad, Gary?
All right.
Where do I start?
I couldn't flirt my way out
of a speeding ticket
for the first time in my life!
And then when the cop looked
at my birth date,
he asked me if I might
know his mother... and I did.
And then my stupid ex-husband
whose back is sore from
having too much sex with his
young girlfriend
undressed in front of me
and said it wasn't any different from
undressing in front of a dude!
That's it?
That's what you're so fired up about.
The dude comment?
My gosh!
I feel better!
All right!
What do you care what I think about you?
I'm your ex-husband!
Exactly, Gary.
We were married.
You had 2 children with this dude.
I don't want you to want me.
Just acknowledge that
i'm still wantable. No?
I mean, my god. You don't know
what it's like. It's different for men.
Different? I don't know what it's like
to get old? I'm like the tin man!
You had to oil-can me down there,
for crying out loud!
Look, Allison,
don't whine about this.
I mean, you're almost 40,
sure, but you're still banging.
What is...
banging?
Look, I'm sorry about today.
I shouldn't have been in your hot tub.
I'm sorry I was in your house.
I'm sorry I said that it was
like being undressed in front of a dude.
I was just being an idiot. I'm sorry.
Banging like...
like how?
Banging, like, if we had met
in a bar and I didn't know you at all
and you were wearing the red
dress and you had your hair up...
Anything else?
If you weren't talking so much
or criticizing what I was wearing
or complaining about the service...
I would go up to you in that bar,
and I would ask you to dance,
and I would do everything in my
power to get you to go to bed with me.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
Thank you.
Assuming it was last call
and there was no one there younger.
Come on. I thought it
would make you feel better.
You know, it did. A little, and then it
didn't, and then it almost did again,
and then, you know
the whole thing was over.
Got to tell you,
a lot like having sex with you.
Hey, I'll have you know, I've
invented some new positions since then.
Goodye, Gary.
- All right.
- Look...
i'm sorry I assumed you lost the cello.
I was certain I lost it, OK?
I do look good in that red dress,
don't i?
Banging.
Hey, sorry about that.
That paint order took a lot
longer than I thought it was gonna.
- So you called her a dude.
- Yes, I did.
And what's the deal with your back?
Look, OK.
I have a confession to make.
My back is really messed up from years
of playing football and surfing AND
painting houses,
and apparently my back locks
up after nonstop acrobatic sex.
What made you think you
had to do that in the first place?
Because I didn't want you to think
I was one of these old guys
that, you know,
couldn't keep up with you.
Keep up with me?
I was trying to keep up with you.
You know, I know that all divorced
guys go through a crazy time,
but most of them at least
spread it around.
You are too much of a job for one woman.
If you ever want to write
that on a bathroom wall
or maybe send out a mass e-mail
to all my friends, that would be great.
Hey, pal,
- how did it go?
- Good. You know, really good.
I told her to lay off a little bit,
and you were right. Women like?
- it you say what's on your mind. Great.
- That's great.
Tommy, your lips...
They look glossy.
And you've got...
You've got glitter all over your face.
Really?
You were making out
with her this whole time!
Yeah!
I got lip!
That's fantastic, buddy!
You know, the more I told her to,
stop holding my hand,
the more she wanted to kiss me.
I'm really considering telling her to
stop kissing me and see where it goes.
All right. Why don't you
slow your roll there, partner?
Maybe just take a little time and enjoy
smelling the lip gloss for a while.
- All right. Good night, dad.
- I'll see you in the morning.
My back is killing me.

- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
Petit-déjeuner !
J'ai fait quoi pour mériter ça ?
Tu sais ce que t'as fait.
Je l'aurais fait plus vite
si j'avais su que j'aurais du bacon.
Sérieux, y a une version plus rapide ?
Bouge de là.
Je vais avoir besoin d'une poêle.
D'accord.
- Et d'une poignée pour la poêle.
- OK.
Ne perds pas ça,
ça sert aussi pour démarrer la voiture.
Je sais que je suis sur la corde raide,
mais as-tu un bol ?
Mais j'ai une passoire.
Tu peux aller vite ?
Chéri, t'as rien pour cuisiner
ou manger ici.
Tu fais comment quand t'as les enfants ?
On met du papier dans des freesbes,
comme le reste de l'Amérique.
Tu pourrais acheter des trucs.
Mais après la séparation, c'est
le premier endroit que j'ai trouvé,
je voulais pas dépenser d'argent
à acheter de belles choses
pour remplacer les belles choses
que j'avais avant.
Donc t'es allé acheter tout ce dont
t'avais besoin où ça ?
- Dans une quincaillerie ?
- "Tout à 99 cents" en fait.
Tu rigoles, mais j'ai retapé
toute la maison pour 36 dollars.
Ça explique
le rideau de douche en plastique
qui se colle à mon corps
comme un fantôme excité.
En fait, non.
Ça faisait partie de la maison.
Le mec qui a déménagé a oublié
de le prendre avec lui.
Le débile.
Écoute, c'est pas un problème.
Je finirai par avoir de nouveaux trucs.
T'as pas d'assiettes chez toi,
mais t'as un robot à 300 $.
C'est à ça que ça sert ?
Je savais pas. Je sais juste
qu'Alison y tenait beaucoup au divorce,
donc, je me suis battu.

Voilà maman, les enfants.
Allez. Jetez vos assiettes en papier
et rincez vos freesbees
cette fois, OK ?
- C'est un nouveau sac, maman ?
- Oui, oui.
- C'est du cuir ?
- Oui.
C'est nécessaire ?
Chérie, la vache allait déjà
servir de nourriture.
Ne pas se servir de sa peau
aurait été du gaspillage.
Il y a une poche spéciale
pour ta tentative d'explication ?
Tu fais quoi quand elle est là,
tu lui donnes des leçons de sarcasme ?
Ouais, au moins 40 fois par jour.
Je déteste parler de ça,
mais c'est le début du mois et
la pension est encore en retard.
Ça fait déjà un mois ?
C'est étonnant, tu sais,
quand on était marié,
les mois passaient si lentement.
Et Gary, je dois l'encaisser,
tu pourrais arrêter d'écrire
"c'est un hold-up" comme ordre ?
- Ça t'a fait passer dans le journal.
- Écoute...
Pourquoi tu me fais ça, Gary ?
Ma pension est un salaire durement gagné
pour les 15 ans passés à
élever tes enfants et à être ta femme.
- J'ai eu quoi pour avoir été ton mari ?
- 15 ans
à jamais tirez la chasse.
Allez, les enfants !
Walter et moi allons nous marier,
t'auras plus à payer de pensions.
Mais si je paie pas de pension,
de quoi je pourrai parler
avec tous les chômeurs,
là-bas, à la banque ?
Quand est-ce que
vous allez fixer une date ?
Je sais pas.
Walter a pas l'air pressé de
fixer une date. Et ça me va.
Il a eu un peu la trouille dernièrement.
C'est que je suis pas habituée
à gérer quelqu'un dont les problèmes
peuvent pas être réglés avec des frites.
Je comprends, Walter doit
sûrement détester les trucs français.
Tous ces souvenirs douloureux
de la Première Guerre mondiale.
Alors, encore une fois.
Une fois qu'Alison sera mariée, t'auras
plus à lui donner d'argent du tout ?
Je devrais toujours payer
pour les enfants. Mais ça va, ça.
Mais payer pour l'épouse, c'est...
c'est comme donner une prime
à un gars qui t'a coupé un doigt.
Donc, tout ce que t'as à faire,
c'est allumer la flamme de Krandall.
Oui, ça marchera. C'est mon
ex-thérapeute, je suis son ex-patient.
Je vais le convaincre d'épouser
mon ex-femme ?
T'es fort pour convaincre les gens
de faire des choses, tu sais.
- Ah bon ?
- Oui. Souviens-toi la fois
où tu m'as fait accepter de pas être
payé en échange de stock options ?
J'ai été idiot.
T'es juste un mec avec un van.
Il y avait pas de stock.
C'était du génie, d'accord ?
Fais pareil avec Krandall.
Tu le fais fixer une date.
- OK.
- Et alors,
tu auras assez d'argent pour m'accorder
cette augmentation dont tu m'as parlé.
Je vais te dire un truc,
à la place de l'augmentation,
si je te faisais vice-président ?
Bien essayé.
Mais c'est président ou rien.
Marché conclu.
Asseyez-vous et dites-moi ce qui
se passe dans votre tête.
Par quoi commencer ?
Je crois que,
j'ai plus vraiment de buts
ces derniers temps,
- Depuis que je suis célibataire.
- Mais vous avez une petite amie ?
Bien sûr, j'ai une petite amie, mais
c'est pas comme être marié.
À une vraie femme, comme Alison.
- J'espère vous réalisez votre chance.
- Oui, Alison est une femme formidable.
Allison est fantastique, Dr Krandall.
Elle est belle, elle est...
Elle est ponctuelle, non ? Elle
est à l'heure. Elle est intelligente
Elle est très intelligente,
et elle vous le fait savoir.
Vous savez qu'elle l'est,
parce qu'elle vous corrige tout le temps
si vous utilisez un mauvais mot
ou si vous ne savez pas combien de juges
il y a à la cour suprême.
- 9.
- 9.
Vous savez ça aussi.
Quelles sont les chances que
2 personnes de la même
ville savent ça ? C'est fou !
Sérieusement !
Je suis un peu surpris, Garry.
Ce n'est pas exactement comme ça que
vous parliez d'Alison en consultation.
Je crois qu'une fois vous l'avez appelée
"Coach de Satan"?
Bien sûr.
Tous les noms d'oiseaux.
Ils sonnent un peu usés quand
ils sont pas dits dans le contexte.
À posteriori, Allison a beaucoup
d'étonnantes qualités, Dr. Krandall,
- que j'avais pris pour acquis.
- Vous aviez de l'affection pour elle ?
Bien sûr.
On a été ensemble pendant 15 ans.
On a construit un foyer ensemble.
Elle est la mère de mes enfants,
vous savez ? J'ai foiré avec Allison, et
vous ne pouvez pas faire la même erreur.
Faut que je vous dise, Krandall. Il y a
beaucoup d'intérêt pour Alison dehors,
OK ? Et si vous ne faites pas attention,
je pourrais retenter ma chance aussi.
Vous êtes très convaincant,
et vous avez raison.
Il faut que je fasse un truc. C'est ça !
C'est super. Bonne décision, Krandall.
Ça suffit. Occupons-nous de vous et
de votre sentiment d'abandon.
Non, je me sens bien. Je me sens
reconnecté. Vous êtes très bon.
Écoutez, faut que vous passiez des coups
de fil, un mariage à préparer.
Je dois organiser un enterrement de vie
de garçon. Vous allez adorer
car de nos jours, les filles tiennent
plus de plumes devant leurs corps.
J'arrive pas à croire qu'on regarde
la chaine parlementaire.
C'est mon jour de télé,
et c'est notre gouvernement en action.
Ouais, je suis sur le bord de mon siège.
Ce serait beaucoup plus intéressant
si on pouvait en éliminer.
Tu peux, idiot, tous les deux ans.
Salut les enfants,
Papa a fait une grosse vente aujourd'hui
Alors, devinez quoi !
Des donuts avant le diner !
- Quoi, qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ?
- Laisse-moi te résumer.
Des vieux en costumes marchent à travers
la salle avec des bouts de papier.
Non, pas la chaine parlementaire.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ? C'est quoi ça ?
Ce sont des assiettes papa. Vanessa
les a achetées ainsi que des bols.
Elle a plein de trucs là-bas.
Regarde ça. L'honorable gentleman
du Winsconsin a sa braguette ouverte.
- Hé.
- Hé, toi.
- Où as-tu eu tous ces trucs ?
- À un magasin.
J'avais oublié que tu avais été congelé.
Regarde,
t'as tout le nécessaire de cuisine
Je voulais les essayer, alors
je vous ai fait du fromage grillé.
J'espère ne pas avoir gâché tes projets.
Non, j'éteindrais la lumière du porche.
Le livreur ne trouvera jamais la maison.
Tu es maintenant l'heureux propriétaire
d'un service d'assiettes pour 8,
qui va avec les couverts,
les verres à eau et à vin.
Cette poêle est la même que l'autre
sauf qu'elle a
une poignée tout le temps.
C'est pas un peu clinquant ?
Qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
Tu l'aimes pas ?
Si, je l'aime.
Ça fait juste un peu trop pour moi.
Je crois que je sais ce qui se passe.
J'ai connu la même chose
quand j'ai divorcé.
Pendant 3 mois, j'ai pas déballé
mes cartons, car je voulais pas admettre
que j'étais mère célibataire à 26 ans
vivant dans une pension de famille.
C'est pas la même chose,
je suis pas mère célibataire.
Enfin, pas que je sache.
Tôt ou tard, tu voudras te sentir
chez toi dans ta propre maison.
Je dois allez chercher Parker.
J'ai juste envie que tu l'apprécies.
Essaye, tu vas l'adorer.
Qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
Eh bien, j'espère que t'attends pas
que la loi de finances soit adoptée,
parce que ça n'arrivera pas cette année.
Part Allison.
J'ai plus d'argent.
Réveille-toi.
OK, mais Vanessa doit pas savoir.
La ferme, c'est sérieux.
C'est au sujet de Walter.
Qu'est-ce qui c'est passé ?
Il est tombé ?
Il a annulé le mariage !
- Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
- À cause de toi !
Mince !
Arrête ! Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ?
Tu étais dans son bureau,
aujourd'hui, alors dis-moi.
Ça regarde que moi et mon thérapeute.
Il pense que
tu es toujours amoureux de moi.
J'ai rien dit qui aurait pu
donner cette impression.
- Alors qu'est-ce que tu lui as dit ?
- Je sais pas, je...
Je lui ai dit que tu étais belle,
que tu étais intelligente.
Que c'était bien d'être marié avec toi.
Tu pensais à quoi ?
C'était ça ou je lui disais la vérité.
Tu disais qu'il traînait les pieds
pour fixer une date de mariage.
Je devais y aller
pour faciliter la transaction.
Excuse-moi.
J'ai pas besoin d'être vendue, OK ?
Mais la marchandise a pas l'air
de se vendre très bien, non ?
Je peux pas croire que tu aies fait ça !
Tu veux pas que je sois heureuse ?
Je veux que tu sois mariée,
mais toi, tu peux pas être les 2.
Grâce à toi,
je serais ni l'un ni l'autre.
C'était ma pire partie
de jambes en l'air.
"Om," mon cul.
Debout, Krandall.
Comment osez-vous !
J'allais me transcendancer.
C'est dégoûtant. Si vous voulez
faire ça, fermez votre porte, OK ?
Pourquoi vous avez dit à Allison
que je l'aimais toujours ?
- Parce que c'est le cas.
- Non, ça l'est pas. C'est fou ça !
Et même s'il y avait un univers bizarre
et farfelu où j'étais amoureux d'elle...
- Ce que vous êtes.
- Je suis pas amoureux d'elle !
Pourquoi vous avez annulé le mariage ?
C'est absurde.
Parce que j'ai été torturé par l'idée,
qu'à cause de mes sentiments, je n'ai
pas fait assez pour votre mariage.
Et j'en remercie Dieu tous les jours !
Donc quand vous êtes venu ici hier,
dire toutes ces choses merveilleuses
à son sujet,
je me suis dit douloureusement
que j'avais franchi une frontière
éthique en couchant avec votre ex-femme.
J'ai volé des magazines
dans votre bureau. On est quitte.
Écoutez, vous devez me comprendre.
Si je voulais que vous fixiez
une date avec Allison c'était pour
plus payer de pension alimentaire !
Bien sûr, c'est la manifestation
de votre conscience,
mais dans la partie de votre cerveau
où vous n'avez pas accès
vous vouliez dire chacun de ces mots !
Je pense savoir ce qui
se passe dans mon cerveau.
Vous savez les choses simples,
comme "j'ai faim,"
"j'ai soif,"
"je dois d'uriner."
Mais si vous avez dit ces choses, c'est
qu'à un certain niveau vous les vouliez.
Krandall, vous me connaissez bien.
J'ai pas beaucoup de niveaux.
Gary, c'est tout à fait normal. Vous
êtes à un moment de votre divorce...
Vous êtes à un moment ou beaucoup
réalisent qu'ils étaient mieux mariés.
Eh bien, je suis pas un de ces gars.
Regardez les signes dans votre propre
vie. Craignez-vous le changement ?
Regrettez-vous ce que vous aviez ?
Etes-vous préoccupé par les aventures
de votre ex-femme ?
Cela vous semble familier, Gary ?
Vous vous trompez, Krandall.
Et vous feriez une grosse erreur si
vous vous mariez pas avec ma femme.
- Votre femme ?
- Mon ex-femme !
Vous savez que je voulais dire
mon ex-femme ! C'est un accident !
Par accident ?
Il n'y a pas d'accident.
L'idée même d'accident est une erreur.
Une erreur ? Pourquoi tout
tourne pas autour du pénis chez vous ?
Ex-femme. Ex-femme.
C'est mon ex-femme. Ex-femme.
Ex-femme. Ex. Ex-femme. Ex-femme.
- Hé, mon beau.
- Salut.
Je t'attendais pas. A-ttendais.
A-ttentais.
Je suis allé au drugstore et
je t'ai pris quelques trucs.
J'ai pris du savon, du shampoing
et un rideau de douche qui
comprend le sens du mot "non".
Super.
T'utilises pas une de mes assiettes ?
Si je le fais, elle sera sale
et elle ira pas avec les autres.
Eh bien, c'est censé être sale
puis propre, puis sale.
C'est un peu comme ça que ça marche.
Je comprends la
théorie des assiettes, mon cœur.
Je sais pas...
Pour moi, c'est plus amusant.
Quoi ? Quand j'ai fini, je la jette
sur la pelouse et l'arroseur les lave.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je reprends les trucs
que je t'ai donnés.
- Tu m'as pas acheté le mixer.
- J'en ai juste envie.
Très bien.
Pourquoi tu en fais toute une histoire ?
Tu sais quoi ?
C'est de ma faute.
J'aurais dû savoir que
t'étais pas prêt pour ça.
Pas la peine de reprendre les assiettes.
T'es sûre pour les verres en dessous ?
Oui, tu dois l'avoir prévu.
C'est pas pour ces trucs.
C'est que t'es pas prêt à accepter
que c'est ta nouvelle maison.
Tu es peintre et il y a pas
de peinture sur les murs.
Si je devais peindre ici, j'appellerais
une entreprise mieux que la mienne.
Ça fait 3 mois que t'es ici.
Pourquoi tu as si peur de t'installer ?
Parce que c'est pas ma maison.
Ma maison est là où est Alison.
C'était mal dit. C'est...
Cet endroit est temporaire, OK ?
"Temporaire" veut dire que
tu vas quelque part. Où vas-tu ?
Mince, j'ai mangé une tortilla
dans un freesbee,
et je me retrouve à répondre
à des questions existentielles.
Si jamais tu décides que tu es prêt
à quitter ton ancienne vie
et à emménager dans une nouvelle,
fais-le-moi savoir.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Il faut que je te parle.
Il est plus de minuit.
Je te laisse pas entrer.
Que...
- Je savais pas que c'était là.
- Parce que je t'ai jamais enfermée.
- Que veux-tu ?
- Écoute, pendant 15 ans,
tu as su ce qui se passait dans ma tête.
J'ai besoin que tu me dises
ce qui s'y passe, maintenant.
D'après mon expérience, rien.
Bonne nuit.
Aide-moi, s'il te plaît.
Pourquoi je t'aiderais ?
Tu as bousillé toute ma vie, je dois
dire que je suis toujours énervée.
Assieds-toi. Ça va aller.
Vannessa m'en veut
parce que j'utilise pas d'assiettes
et elle dit que je veux retourner
à mon ancienne vie. Quoi ?
D'après Walter, mon ex-fiancé,
tu as toujours des sentiments pour moi.
Quoi ? C'est insensé !
Alors pourquoi as-tu
saboté ma relation ?
C'était pour l'argent, d'accord ?
Alors, t'es pas jaloux de Walter ?
Et pas amoureux de moi ?
Non. Je suis pas amoureux de toi.
Pas du tout.
Je veux dire que...
je tiens à toi.
Si tu étais attaquée par un grizzly,
j'appellerai des secours
en sortant de la forêt.
Si j'éprouvais de l'amour pour toi,
je te promets que c'est enfoui
sous des milliers de couches
de rancœur, de colère et d'amertume.
Et cette semaine qu'on a dû
passer à Branson,
dans la même chambre que tes parents
et quand ton fer à cheveux
a brulé mon bureau,
quand tu m'as fait faire une vasectomie
puis me la faire annuler,
puis refaire à nouveau !
- Tu te souviens de tout ça.
- Oui.
- T'es vraiment amoureux de moi.
- Quoi ?
- Si tu l'es !
- Non, c'est le contraire.
Tu l'es, Gary.
Regarde toi, c'est évident.
Non, ça l'est pas. Tu sais quoi ?
Lève-toi.
- Embrasse-moi ?
- Quoi ?
Embrassons-nous.
Parce qu'à la seconde
où mes lèvres te toucheront,
je saurais si je suis amoureux
de toi ou pas. Et si c'est le cas,
j'irais en ville, acheter un pistolet,
et me faire sauter la cervelle.
- Mais de toute façon, je dois savoir.
- Je le sais déjà, d'accord ?
- Allez. Embrasse-moi.
- Non, Gary...
OK, tu sais quoi ?
D'accord, mais fait vite.
D'accord.
Embrasser Allison.
Embrasser Allison.
Embrasser Allison.
On y va. Tu peux relever tes cheveux,
faire quelque chose avec ton visage ?
- Non ! Je vais au lit.
- Non, c'est bon.
Tu me facilites pas les choses.
OK, à 3.
1...
Tu pourrais faire comme si
on n'allait pas soulever un canapé ?
D'accord.
- Tu as raison, désolé.
- Attends.
Pourquoi tu m'as arrêté ?
Maintenant je dois tout recommencer !
Embrasser Allison. Embrasser Allison.
Embrasser Allison.
- Quoi ?
- Et si tu aimes ça ?
- Quoi ?
- Oui, je veux dire, tu vois,
si c'est, vraiment vraiment bon ?
Alors, quoi ?
Oh, c'était horrible !
Tope là !
Ouais.
Ouais, je t'en prie.
C'est super.
Il y a rien pour moi ici.
Je peux passer à autre chose.
Tant mieux pour toi, Gary.
Quoi ? Quoi, quoi ?
Désolé d'avoir foutu le bordel
entre toi et Krandall. Vraiment.
Et j'étais sérieux quand j'ai dit
qu'il avait de la chance de t'avoir.
Merci.
Dommage qu'il ait rompu.
- Il reviendra.
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Je l'ai vu sur son vélo dans l'allée.
- Quoi ?
- Salut, Walter.
- Je pouvais pas rester loin.
Je sais que l'éthique
de notre situation n'est pas claire.
Mais, quand Gary est venu me voir
la seconde fois, j'ai pensé que...
- que j'aime pas beaucoup Gary.
- Quoi ?
Je vais pas continuer à me torturer.
- Je t'aime, ma mangue.
- "Ma mangue" ?
Je t'aime aussi, myrtille.
Ha ! Mon Dieu. Vous êtes quoi ?
Des smoothies ?
Alison, veux-tu m'épouser, à une
date non spécifique dans le futur ?
Bien sûr, Walter.
Chérie.
C'est si beau !
Vous deux, c'est super.
Quand tu dis "à une date non spécifique"
tu veux dire vous allez vous marier...
Vous m'entendez pas du tout là ?
OK, je crois que je...
je vais vous laisser seul, alors.
Et...
je vais partir,
et vous laisser profiter.
- bandés.
- Ah oui, désolé. Voilà.
Entre.
Allez, c'est bon.
Voilà, doucement.
Très bien.
T'en penses quoi ?
- J'ai les yeux bandés.
- Ah oui, désolé.
Bienvenue dans ma nouvelle vie.
- Ça te va bien.
- À toi aussi.
Merci.
C'est très joli.
Mais les odeurs de peinture...
Tu pourrais ouvrir la fenêtre ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
On pourrait mourir ici.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Dennis les a peintes fermées !
Je le virerais bien, mais je viens
de le nommer président de l'entreprise.
Team Subs-Addicts"
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Breakfast!
What did I do to deserve this?
You know what you did.
Well, I would have done it a lot faster
if I knew there was gonna be bacon.
Seriously, there's
a faster version of that?
Get out of here.
All right. I'm gonna need a frying pan.
All right.
- And a frying pan handle.
- Right.
Seriously, don't lose these, OK?
It's also how we start the car.
I know I'm going out on a limb here,
but do you have a bowl?
But I have a colander.
How fast can you work?
Honey, you have nothing to cook
with or eat off of
in this house.
What do you do when the kids are here?
We put paper plates in frisbees,
like the rest of America.
You can buy stuff, you know.
I know, but after the split,
this was the first place I found,
and I didn't want to spend a
lot of money and buy great stuff
to replace all the great
stuff that I used to have.
So you went out and got everything
you needed at what?A hardware store?
A 99 cents store actually.
You know you laugh but I tricked out
the whole house for 36 bucks.
So that explains
the plastic shower curtain
that hugs my body like a horny ghost.
Actually, no.
That came with the house.
The guy that moved out
forgot to take it with him.
Sucker.
Look, it's no big deal.
I'll get some new stuff eventually.
OK, you don't have any plates in your
house, but you have a $300 cake mixer.
Is that what that is?
I had no idea. I just know Allison
really wanted it in the divorce,
so I fought for it.

VO By :  ¤AkaZab¤
[Subs-Addicts']
[Sub-Way.fr]
There's your mom, guys.
Come on. Throw out your paper plates
and rinse off your frisbees
this time, OK?
- Is that a new purse, mom?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Is that leather?
- Yeah.
Is that necessary?
Louise, honey, honey,
the cow was already going to be food.
You know, to not use its
skin would just be wasteful.
Does it have a special pocket
for your rationalization?
What do you do with her when she's
here, give her sarcasm lessons?
Yeah, like, 40 times a day.
Look, Gary, I hate to bring this up, but
it's the beginning of the month,
and my spousal support is late again.
Has it been a month already?
You know, that's amazing
'cause when we were married,
the months went by so slowly.
And, Gary, I have to deposit these.
Could you please stop writing
"this is a hold-up" on the memo line?
- Come on. It got you on the news.
- Look...
Why do you do this to me, Gary?
Really. My spousal support is a
hard-earned salary
for 15 years of raising your children
and being your wife.
- What did I get for being your husband?
- 15 years
of never having to flush a toilet.
Come on, kids!
Besides, walter and I get married, you
won't have to pay me any more support.
But if I don't pay spousal support,
what will I have to talk about
with all the hobos
down at the blood bank?
When are you two crazy
kids gonna set a date, anyway?
I don't know.
Walter doesn't seem to be in a hurry
to set a date. I'm OK with that.
He has been in a little funk lately.
I'm just not used
to dealing with someone whose problems
can't be solved with french fries.
I understand. You know,
walter probably hates french things.
All those painful memories
from world war i.
So walk me through this again.
Once Allison is married,
you don't have to pay any money at all?
I still have to pay child support,
but that's cool. That's for the kids,
but spousal support, my god.
That's
like paying workman's comp
to a guy that cut off your fingers.
So all you really need to do is
go light a fire under Krandall.
Yeah, that'll work. He's my
ex-therapist. I'm an ex-patient.
I'm gonna convince him
to marry my ex-wife?
You know, you're great at
convincing people to do stuff.
- You think so?
- Yeah. Remember the time
you got me to agree to a pay cut
in exchange for stock options?
I was an idiot.
You're just a guy with a van.
There was no stock.
All right, that was genius, all right?
You do the same thing to Krandall.
You get him to set a date.
- All right.
- Then,
you'll have enough money to give me
the pay raise you've been talking about.
I'll tell you what,
instead of a Raise,
how about I make you vice president?
Nice try, Gary, all right?
It's president or nothing.
You got yourself a deal.
Why don't you sit down
and tell me what's on your mind?
Where to begin, you know, Dr. Krandall?
I guess,
I've been feeling pretty adrift lately,
- You know, since I'm single.
- But you have a girlfriend, right?
Sure. I have a girlfriend, but that's
not the same as being married.
A real, live wife like Allison.
- I hope you know how lucky you are.
- Yes, allison is a wonderful woman.
I mean, Allison's amazing, dr. Krandall.
Come on. She's beautiful, she's...
She's punctual, right?
She's on time. She, she's smart.
She's very smart, and that's
something she always lets you know.
You always know she's smart,
'cause she always corrects you
if you use words wrong
or if you don't know how many justices
are on the supreme court.
- 9.
- 9.
See? You know that, too.
What are the odds two people
in the same town know that?
That's crazy!
You guys are soul mates,
for crying out loud!
I'm a little surprised, gary.
This isn't exactly how you referred
to Allison during your counseling.
I believe you once referred to her as
"Satan's life coach"?
Well, sure. All the pet names.
They sound a little corny when
they're taken out of context.
In hindsight, Allison has
a lot of amazing qualities,
Dr. Krandall, that I you know,
I took them for granted.
You actually did care
for her, didn't you?
Of course I did. We were
together for 15 years.
We made a home together.
She's the mother
to my children, you know?
I blew it with Allison, and
you can't make that mistake.
I got news for you, Krandall. There's
a lot of interest for allison out there,
all right? And if you're not careful,
I might take another run at her myself.
You're very convincing,
Gary, and you're right.
I need to make my move. Attaboy!
That's great. That's a
good decision, Krandall.
Enough of this. Let's get back to you
and your feelings of being adrift.
No, I feel great now.
I feel very connected.
You're good. You're
very good. Listen,
you got calls to make,
a wedding to plan.
I have to throw you a bachelor party.
You're gonna love it this time,
'cause these days, the ladies don't hold
feathers in front of their bodies.
Can't believe we're watching c-span.
It's my tv day, and this is
our government in action.
Yeah, I'm on the edge of my seat.
This would be a lot more interesting
if you could vote someone off.
You can, idiot, every two years.
Hey, kids, daddy made a big sale today,
so guess what!
Donuts before dinner!
- What's, what's going on here?
- Well, let me bring you up to speed.
Some old guy in a suit walked across
the room with a piece of paper.
No, not c-span. What's going on,
what's this? What is this?
They're plates dad. Vanessa bought them,
and she got bowls and dishtowels.
She's got all sorts of stuff in there.
Look at that. The esteemed gentleman
from wisconsin has his barn door open.
- Hey.
- Hey, you.
- Where'd you get all this stuff?
- From the store.
I keep forgetting
how long you were frozen.
Look, I got some kitchen
essentials for you.
I wanted to try them out, so I made
you and the kids some grilled cheese.
- Hope I didn't ruin your dinner plans.
- No, I'll turn off the porch light.
The delivery guy will
never find the house.
You are now the proud owner
of place settings for 8,
matching silverware,
water and wine glasses.
Hey, this pan looks the
same way as your old one,
except it has a handle that's
attached to it at all times.
Isn't that a little showy?
Well, what's wrong? Don't you like it?
Yeah. I like it.
It's just there's so much of it.
Look, I think I know
what's going on here.
Look, I went through the same
thing when I got divorced.
I didn't unpack any of my boxes for
3 months because I didn't want to admit
that I was a 26-year-old single mom
living in a guest house.
Well, that's not what's going on here
at all because I'm not a single mom.
I mean, you know,
not that I know of.
Gary, sooner or later, you're gonna
want to feel at home in your own house.
I got to go pick up parker.
Look, now I just want you to enjoy it.
You know, try it. You might like it.
What's wrong with you?
Well, I hope you weren't rooting
for the highway appropriations Bill
getting out of committee, 'cause
it's not gonna happen this year.
Go away, allison. I
don't have any more money.
Wake up.
OK, but Vanessa can
never know about this.
Shut up. This is serious.
It's about Walter.
What happened?
Did he have a fall?
He broke off the engagement!
- What? Why?
- Because of you!
Jeez, Louise!
Look, stop it! What did he say?
You were the one in his
office today. You tell me.
That's between me and my therapist.
Come on.
He thinks you're still
in love with me. What?
I didn't say anything that
would give him that impression.
- Then what exactly did you say?
- I don't know. I,
I told him you were beautiful.
I told him you were smart.
I told him it was great
being married to you.
Gary, what were you thinking?
It was either that
or tell him the truth.
I mean, look, you said he was
shuffling his feet about
setting a wedding date.
I had to go in there and make a sell.
Excuse me. I do not need to be sold, OK?
OK. Look, the merchandise
isn't exactly flying off the shelf, OK?
I can't believe you did this, Gary!
I mean, my god!
Don't you want me to be happy?
I want you to be married. I
don't think you can be both.
Well, thanks to you,
i'm gonna be neither.
That was the worst booty call ever.
"Om," my ass.
Get up, Krandall.
How dare you! I was
just about to transcend.
That's disgusting. If you want
to do that, lock your door, all right?
Why did you tell Allison that
i'm still in love with her?
- Because you are, Gary.
- No, I'm not. That's crazy.
Even if there was some bizarro, wacky
universe where I was in love with her.
- Which you are.
- I'm not in love with her!
Why'd you call off the engagement?
That doesn't make sense.
'cause recently I've been wrestling with
the idea that because of my immediate
attraction to Allison, I didn't do
enough to save your marriage.
Yes, and I thank god
every day that you did it!
So when you came in here yesterday,
saying all those
wonderful things about her,
I came to the painful realization
that I crossed an ethical boundary
by sleeping with your ex-wife.
Hey, I stole magazines from
your lobby. We're square.
Look, you've got to get this through
your head. The only reason I wanted you
to set a date with Allison is so I
wouldn't have to pay alimony. That's it!
Sure, that's what you thought
in your conscious mind,
but in the part of your Brain
you can never access,
or even pronounce,
you meant every word!
I think I know what's going
on in my own Brain, Krandall.
Sure. You know the simple
things like "i'm hungry,"
"i'm thirsty,"
"i need to make water."
But you never would have said those
things if you didn't mean them.
Krandall, you know me pretty well.
I don't have a lot of levels.
Gary, please, it's quite normal.
You're at a point in your divorce where.
You're at the point where lots of men
realize they were happier being married
Yeah, well, I'm not one of those guys.
Look for the signs in your own life.
Are you resisting change?
Longing for what you used to have?
Preoccupied with your
ex-wife's romantic attachments?
Does any of that sound familiar, Gary?
You're wrong about this Krandall. You're
wrong, and you're making a big mistake
if you don't marry my wife.
- Your wife, Gary?
- My ex-wife!
You knew I meant to say my ex-wife!
I said wife by accident!
By accident, Gary?
There are no accidents. The very
idea of accidents is a fallacy.
A fallacy? Is everything
about a penis with you people?
Ex-wife. Ex-wife.
It's my ex-wife. Ex-wife.
Ex-wife. Ex. Ex-wife. Ex-wife.
- Hey, handsome.
- Hi.
I wasn't ex-pecting you. Ex-pecting.
Ex-pecting you.
I went to the drugstore and I
picked up a couple things for you.
I got you some soap, some shampoo,
and a shower curtain that understands
the meaning of the word "no."
Nice.
Why aren't you using
one of the plates I got you?
If I use one of the plates,
it'll get dirty
and then it won't match
all the other plates.
Yeah, well, it's supposed to get dirty
and then clean and then dirty again.
It's kind of how plates work.
Yeah, I understand the theory
of plates, sweetheart.
It's just, I don't know.
For me, this is more fun.
What? When I'm done, I throw it on
the lawn and the sprinkler cleans it.
- What are you doing?
- Taking back the stuff I got you.
- You didn't buy me the mixer.
- Yeah, well that I just want.
All right.
Why are you making such
a big deal out of this?
You know what?
This is really my fault. I should known
you're weren't ready for any of this.
You don't have to
take all the plates back.
Are you sure you want to put the glasses
underneath. You probably have a plan.
This really isn't about the stuff.
You're not ready
to accept that this is your home.
I mean, you're a painter and
there's no paint on the walls.
If I ever paint this place, i'm gonna
use a company way better than mine.
You've been here for 3 months.
Why are you so afraid to live here?
Because this isn't my home.
My home is where Allison is.
That didn't come out right. That's.
This place is just temporary, OK?
"Temporary" means that you're going
somewhere, Gary. Where are you going?
Oh, my gosh.
I have one quesadilla off of a frisbee,
now I have to answer all
of life's tough questions.
If you ever decide that you're
ready to leave your old life
and move into your new one, let me know.
- Gary! What are you doing?
- I need to talk to you. Let me in.
No, it's after midnight.
I'm not letting you in.
What.
- I didn't know that was up there.
- That's 'cause I never locked you out.
- What do you want?
- Listen for 15 years,
you knew what was going on
inside my head.
Right now, I need you to tell me
what's going on inside my head.
Based on my experience,
nothing. Good night.
Come on, Allison.
Please help me, please.
Why should I help you, gary? You screwed
up my entire life. I got to tell you,
- i'm still a little pissed.
- Just have a seat. It'll be OK.
Look, Vanessa's mad at me
'cause I wouldn't use some plates,
and she said that I want to
get back to my old life. What?
Well, according to walter, my ex
fiance, he thinks you
still have feelings for me.
What? That's insane.
Then why did you sabotage
my relationship?
It was for the money, OK?
So you're not jealous of Walter?
You're not in love with me?
No, no.
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not in love with you at all.
I mean, I care about you a little bit.
I mean, if you were attacked
and mauled by a grizzly bear,
I would call for help on
my way out of the woods.
If I have any love for you whatsoever,
I promise you, it's
buried under thousands
and thousands of layers of resentment
and anger and bitterness
and that week we had to spend in Branson
in the same hotel room with your parents
and when your curling
iron burnt down my office
and you made me get a vasectomy
and then you made me unget it
and then you made me get it again!
- You rember all that stuff.
- Yeah.
- You're, like, so in love with me.
- What?
- Yes, you are.
- No, that's the opposite.
- I'm not. It's so obvious.
- Look at you.
No, that's not you know what?
Stand up, Allison.
- OK, kiss me.
- What?
Let's kiss.
Kiss, because the second
my lips touch yours,
i know if I'm in love with you or not.
And if I am, I'm gonna go downtown,
buy a pistol, and I'm
gonna blow my Brains out.
- But either way, I have to know.
- Gary, I already know, all right?
Come on. Kiss me.
Come on. It'll be all right.
Kiss me.
OK, fine, you know what?
Fine. Just make it quick.
All right.
Kissing Allison.
Kissing Allison.
Kissing Allison.
All right. Here we go.
Can you put your hair up,
do something with your face?
- No, I'm going to bed!
- No, no, it's OK.
You're not making this
easy on me, Allison.
OK, on the count of 3.
Could you please not act
like we're lifting a couch?
All right.
You're right. I'm sorry.
- Hang on.
- Why'd you stop me?
Now I got to go through
everything again! Kissing Allison.
- Kissing Allison
- Gary? Gary?
- What?
- What if you like it?
- What?
- I mean, like, you know, what if it's,
you know, really, really good?
Then what?
That was awful!
High-five!
Yeah.
- Yeah, you're, you're welcome.
- This is great.
There's nothing for me here.
I can move on. I'll see ya.
Good for you, Gary.
Good stuff.
What? What, what?
I'm sorry I messed things up between
you and Krandall. I really am.
And I was serious when I said
he'd really be lucky to have you.
Thanks.
Too bad he broke up with me.
- He'll be back.
- How can you know that?
I saw him pedaling his
bike up the driveway.
What?
- Hi, Walter.
- I couldn't stay away.
Allison, I know the ethics of
our situation are questionable.
But it occurred to me when Gary came
to my office for the second time...
How little I like Gary.
- What?
- I'm not gonna torture myself anymore.
- I love you, mango.
- "Mango"?
I love you, too, cranberry.
My god. What are you guys, a smoothie?
Allison, will you marry me
at a nonspecific date in the future?
Of course, Walter.
Honey.
That's so nice!
You two, this is great.
When you say "nonspecific date," you
mean you are getting married, you just.
You don't hear me at all, do ya?
All right. Well, i,
I guess I'll just leave
you two alone, then,
and, I'll just be headed out
and you two enjoy yourselves.
- I'm blindfolded.
- Right. Sorry. OK, here we go.
Come in.
Come on. It's OK.
There you go. Steady.
All right.
What do you think?
- I'm blindfolded.
- Right. Sorry. - Sorry. Here.
Welcome to my new life, OK?
- You look good in it.
- So do you.
Thank you. It's beautiful.
But the paint fumes,.
Can you open up the window, maybe?
Oh, my gosh. We could die in here.
Oh, my gosh!
Dennis painted 'em shut!
I'd fire him, but I just made him
president of the company.

- Hé, Louise. Comment a été ta journée ?
- Horrible.
Tu te rappelles quand
j'ai écrit cette lettre
au sujet de l'isolation toxique
de l'école ?
Ouais, chérie.
T'écris plein de lettres.
Eh bien, ça va coûter 50 000 $
à l'école pour arranger ça,
donc ils suppriment les Arts Plastiques.
- Et ta journée, Tommy ?
- Super.
Je viens de découvrir que
j'aurais pas Art, alors...
- Non, merci. C'est bon.
- C'est quoi ça ?
Juste un de tes cartons
qui remplissent mon garage.
Il est temps que tu enlèves
le reste de tes affaires de chez moi.
Les affaires de ski, ta chaine hi-fi,
tes bandes dessinées,
les 6 saisons stupides
de "Larry et Balki."
Larry et Balki. Ils étaient
mal assortis pour être colocs'.
C'est pas stupide, c'est génial.
Gary, il est temps, d'accord ?
J'en veux plus d'ici vendredi.
Vendredi ?
Sois pas ridicule !
T'aurais dû le faire il y a des mois.
Dans l'accord de divorce,
- il est pas dit...
- Oh, mon Dieu, l'accord !
Le bout de papier qui stipule que
tu as toujours la plus grosse part
- et moi les miettes.
- Tu sais quoi ?
Je n'y suis pour rien
si le groupe de ton avocat
est parti en tournée
pendant la procédure.
Si Hasselhoff te dit
que tu pars en tournée, t'y vas.

Regarde ces trucs cool qu'on a trouvés
dans la cave chez maman. C'est quoi ?
C'est une casquette
en cannette de bière.
Et faut que tu saches que
j'ai bu toutes ces bières tout seul.
- Y en a que 3, papa.
- Tu sais quoi ?
Essaie de faire un chapeau en crochet
après avoir bu 3 bières.
Pas avant d'avoir 17 ans !
C'est ton livre d'or de 4e, papa ?
Ouais.
Laisse-moi te montrer un truc.
Tu vois...
Regarde ça. Tu vois ce beau grand mec
qui joue quaterback ?
C'est toi ?
Non, j'ai juste toujours trouvé
que ce mec était grand et beau.
J'ai pas joué au football
avant le lycée.
Ça, c'est le collège,
où je faisais de la lutte.
Là. Voilà ton père faisant de la lutte.
Ton visage est couvert
par le derrière de ce mec.
En fait...
c'est mes fesses.
J'ai arrêté après.
Une fois que t'as vu
tes fesses sous cet angle,
tu sais qu'il est temps d'abandonner.
Merci d'enlever tous ces trucs d'ici.
Ouais, encore quelques boîtes
et toutes les preuves
de mon existence dans la cave
où j'ai passé des heures
et des milliers de dollars à finir,
seront envolées.
Et beaucoup de nuits ivres aussi.
J'étais pas ivre, je me cachais.
C'est pas vraiment se cacher
si personne ne te cherche.
Je reviendrai la semaine prochaine
pour le billard, OK ?
Le billard ?
Tu dois la connaître,
c'est ma femme quand je suis à la cave.
- Gary, le billard est à moi.
- Quoi ?
Je crois que tu me l'as donné
comme cadeau pour nos un an de mariage.
Non, non.
C'était une blague.
C'était une blague de
te l'avoir donné, il était pour moi.
- C'était une blague.
- Non.
C'est la préparation de la blague.
La chute, c'est "Je le garde."
Non, non ! Allison, non !
C'est mon billard !
Tu peux pas l'avoir.
Il est parfait. Je l'aime.
Tu t'en sers même pas.
Comment ça ? Je m'en sers
pour ranger de vieilles photos,
aucuness d'entre elles
n'est d'un voyage à Paris
que tu aurais dû m'offrir
comme cadeau d'anniversaire.
La France ? Vraiment ?
Tu veux passer 11 heures en avion
pour découvrir qu'on t'aime pas là-bas ?
- Allez, laisse-moi garder le billard.
- Quoi ? Non. C'était mon cadeau.
L'accord de divorce établit que
les cadeaux restent à leur destinataire.
J'aimerais que tu arrêtes de ramener
cet accord de divorce stupide
- parce que j'ai signé sous la menace.
- Comment as-tu été menacé?
Ils ont dit que si je le signais pas,
je resterais marié avec toi !
Je suis désolé pour le billard, chéri.
Pourquoi Allison est si têtue ?
Pourquoi les abeilles piquent alors
qu'elles savent qu'elles vont mourir ?
Elle mérite pas ce billard.
Elle respecte pas le jeu.
Elle appelle le "rack",
le truc en triangle.
C'est quoi un rack ?
C'est... tu sais,
le truc en triangle.
Je peux pas croire qu'elle ait le dessus
sur tout pour l'accord de divorce.
Un jour, faudra que je lise ce stupide
morceau de papier que j'ai signé.
Je trouve qu'elle est vraiment injuste.
- On échange nos places ?
- Bien sûr.
Alors, comment ça s'est passé
avec ton ex ?
Mon Dieu, on s'est disputé
comme d'habitude.
Cette fois c'était pour
notre chien, Wendell.
Il a besoin de cachets à 50 $ par mois,
et Ronnie refuse
- de partager la facture avec moi.
- Sale enfoiré.
Merci.
- Je savais pas que t'avais un chien.
- Oui.
Je suis une amoureuse des chiens.
Je sais même plus combien j'en ai sauvé.
Je peux même plus les compter.
Mais quand on s'est séparé,
j'ai pas trouvé
j'ai pas pu tous les garder,
alors Ronnie les a tous.
Tous ?
Tu veux dire quoi par tous ?
T'as combien de chiens ?
7 ?
Tucker, Daisy, Wendell,
Arizona, Cheater, Cabot, et Gus.
Mais ils sont vraiment petits.
À part Gus, qui est plutôt énorme.
Ronnie s'occupe de tes 7 chiens ?
Oui, mais c'est pas compliqué
à part Cabot, qui a besoin de gouttes.
Et Tucker, d'anti-dépresseurs.
Et bien sûr
Gus le bus, qui doit
dormir dans un lit avec toi
comme un humain,
la tête sur l'oreiller.
C'est vraiment mignon.
Mais Ronnie est tellement
contrarié par tout ça.
C'est vraiment un abruti !
J'ai dit que c'est vraiment un abruti.
Hein, Gary ?
C'est un abruti ?
Oh, mon Dieu !
T'es du côté de Ronnie ?
Je suis pas du côté de Ronnie,
mais 7 chiens ?
Des gouttes, des anti-dépresseurs,
Gus le Bus ? Oh, mon Dieu !
On dirait que Ronnie a eu la partie
du deal pas trop à son avantage ?
T'es devenu le meilleur ami
de Ronnie ?
- Je suis pas son meilleur ami...
- Pourquoi tu te maries pas avec lui ?
Il a pas de place pour moi, on dirait.
Tu sais quoi ?
Faut que j'aille bosser.
Allez, je plaisantais. C'est tout.
Je t'ai complètement soutenu
avec tes problèmes de billard.
Et je te soutiens aussi. J'ai juste
trouvé que les 7 chiens, c'était marrant.
J'essayais de plaisanter, c'est tout.
Tu sais quoi ? J'espère que Ronnie
et toi serez heureux ensemble,
mais quand il appellera pour dire
qu'il passe la nuit chez
"son frère", il sera en train
de baiser la serveuse.
- Comment était ta marche sportive ?
- Revigorant. Quelle séance !
Où sont tes poids ?
Volés par des skaters.
Un de chaque côté.
Ils m'ont bien eu.
Ceci va te redonner le sourire.
Une photo de moi à Cancún.
Vacances de printemps,
en dernière année de fac.
Waw !
T'avais dû te faire surprendre
par un orage.
Ton tee-shirt est trempé.
Ouais. J'avais gagné 200 $ pour m'être
fait prendre dans cet orage.
T'aurais pu gagner plus en faisant
une sorte de concours de seins.
- Merci, chéri.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Maintenant que Gary a récupéré
toutes ses affaires, je peux
commencer à organiser les miennes,
en commençant par ces photos.
Pourquoi est-ce que Gary est allongé sur
le dos devant la statue de Washington ?
Tu vois ?
J'ai compris.
C'est comme si c'était son pénis.
Il a toute une série de ces trucs :
l'aiguille spatiale,
le séquoia géant, les geysers.
Il m'a embarrassé
sur toutes les mers du monde.
Eh bien, je ne lui donnerais pas
la photo de Cancún, ce serait cruel.
Non, il n'aura pas celle-là,
mais crois-moi,
Gary a vu des photos de moi où
je portais beaucoup moins de vêtements.
En fait, il y a un album
quelque part par là.
Où est-il ?
- Qu'est ce que tu cherches ?
- C'est un...
C'est un album photo violet.
- Merde. Je crois pas que ce soit ici.
- Quoi donc ?
Pour notre première St Valentin,
j'ai donné à Gary... des photos de moi.
Des photos de goûts dans le boudoir ?
Oui...
Et non.
Prenons chacun une boîte.
On va quadriller cet endroit.
OK.
Oh, mon Dieu. Ce n'est pas là.
Tu peux abandonner,
mais j'ai l'intention
de trouver ces photos
et de les regarder.
Doucement, doucement !
Dennis, je viens de mesurer
tout le garage.
On peut vraiment y mettre le billard.
On devra juste laisser
la porte du garage ouverte,
et prendre des baguettes quand
on sera contre la chaudière, OK ?
OK, mais Allison n'a jamais
changé d'avis sur rien,
à part sur le fait de passer
le reste de sa vie avec toi.
Tu marques un point.
Il faut que tu te concentres
sur tous les super trucs que t'as eus :
Les bandes dessinées...
l'assiette de Frank Sinatra...
L'album photo avec des photos
d'Allison nue dedans.
T'as dit quoi ?
L'assiette de Sinatra.
L'autre truc. Recommence.
C'était quoi l'autre ? C'était quoi ?
C'est pour toi.
Tu peux prendre l'assiette de Sinatra.
Oh, mon dieu !
Je pensais que ça avait disparu
depuis longtemps, mais non.
Y a quoi dedans ?
C'est juste, des photos
de nature personnelle.
Puis-je voir sa nature personnelle ?
Allez, mec.
Ce sont que des vieilles photos.
Non, tu comprends pas.
C'est bien plus que ça, c'est...
Mets de la craie sur tes baguettes,
mon ami, parce que ceci est un billard !
Puis-je entrer ?
Tu sais, à part le sourire
et la bonne disposition,
tu ressembles beaucoup à mon ex-femme.
C'est si drôle parce que
toi et moi nous disputons souvent !
- Tu veux quoi ?
- Quoi ?
- Tu veux quoi ?
- Quoi ?
Rien. Je suis juste venue pour voir,
si t'avais pas besoin d'aide
pour déballer, organiser. Tout ça.
On dirait que tu cherches un truc.
Tu cherches un truc ?
Non. Je sais juste combien
c'est difficile de s'installer, alors...
Parce que j'ai regardé dans les cartons
et j'ai trouvé un truc
fascinant qui pourrait t'intéresser.
- Un album photo.
- Vraiment ?
De Tommy quand il était bébé.
- C'est gentil.
- Ouais.
J'ai trouvé un truc qui m'a donné
des heures de plaisirs
et qui pourrait t'intéresser,
et ça, bien sûr serait...
"Bared Naked ladies",
leur deuxième CD.
T'es sûre que tu ne cherches rien ?
S'il te plaît. Tu dis toujours
que j'ai eu les bons trucs.
- Qu'est-ce que je pourrais chercher ?
- Je sais pas...
Des lettres, des journaux,
11 photos insolentes
d'une mariée vulgaire,
datées d'environ 1993 ?
T'as trouvé
les photos de la St Valentin.
Oh que oui.
- Puis-je les avoir ?
- Oh que non.
Tu sais, l'accord de divorce établit
clairement que les cadeaux
sont la propriété du destinataire.
Les photos sont exemptées de la règle !
Elles le sont pas. Elle pourraient
être illégales dans des États,
mais elles sont pas exemptées.
- Donne-moi les photos !
- Non, non. J'ai une idée...
Ouais ? Est-ce esseulé ?
Quel malheureux moment pour te moquer,
je pensais pouvoir échanger
des photos de la coquine
contre des trucs
que j'aimerais avoir ici.
Non. Absolument pas.
Je refuse d'adhérer à ce principe.
Mais tu n'as pas tant de principes.
En fait, j'ai des photos qui le prouvent.
T'y étais presque.
Presque.
Lancé et raté !
3e Strike. Tu sors.
Très bien.
Très bien, alors,
tu essaies de me faire du chantage
pour avoir le billard.
En entrée.
- En entrée ?
- Assieds-toi.
On va en parler.
Allez, assieds-toi.
Tu sais, Allison, pour la première fois
en 15 ans ensemble,
j'ai la main.
Et, tu sais, c'est surprenant,
que tu prennes ce livre de mes mains,
merci beaucoup.
Il y a des choses que j'ai toujours
voulues depuis le divorce,
et j'ai maintenant le pouvoir
de les demander. Par exemple, je...
veux l'armoire.
L'armoire de ma grand-mère
qui contient mes habits
depuis que je suis petite ?
C'est ça, une armoire ?
Non, je veux pas ça...
C'est quoi le truc où je mets
mes pieds quand je regarde du foot ?
- C'est un tabouret ottoman.
- Je veux l'ottoman.
Parlons de musique.
Parlons de "Crows" :
je prends "Counting" et "Black",
tu gardes "Sheryl".
Tu dis "non" ?
Je veux pas de ces trucs en fait.
Tout ce qui compte vraiment,
c'est le billard. Je le veux.
Non. Je dis non à tout.
OK, super. Bien, je suppose
que je peux faire ce que je veux
d'Allison qui fait la moue...
Allison dans le jacuzzi.
Cette photo est celle que je préfère
parce que t'as l'air vraiment surprise
de pas porter de sous-vêtements.
- Où sont les photos ?
- Tu crois que je suis débile ?
Très, mais change pas de sujet.
Où sont-elles ?
Elles sont cachées.
À un endroit où
tu les trouveras jamais.
Très bien.
Très bien, Gary.
J'abandonne. Tu as gagné.
Amène les photos,
je te donnerai le billard.
Ça a l'air bien.
Et... je suis désolé que ça ait dû
être si méchant, Allison,
mais tu m'as pas laissé le choix.
Je suis désolé, mais quand je me suis
garée, j'ai enfoncé le côté de ton van.
Non, t'as pas fait ça !
Tu fais quoi ?
Je vais chercher mes photos
dans ton tiroir à chaussettes.
Pourquoi tu penses qu'elles sont
cachées dans mon tiroir à chaussettes ?
Allez, Allison !
Voilà.
- Combien pour toi, ma belle ?
- Ira ?
Non, c'est moi ! C'est Gary !
Je sais.
T'es toujours amoureux de Ronnie ?
Non, je déteste Ronnie. Ronnie pue.
C'est bon, Ira. Il est cool.
Oh, mon dieu. Ça doit être
le Ira le plus fort d'Amérique.
Écoute, je suis désolé d'avoir
mal réagi à propos de cette histoire.
J'étais juste si fou par
ce truc avec Allison
et le billard.
Je m'excuse.
- Tu prendras plus le parti de Ronnie ?
- Jamais.
Même si tu penses qu'il a raison
et que j'ai tort ?
Même ça, oui.
Et tu crois pas que je suis folle
d'avoir 7 chiens ?
Non.
Je trouve que c'est mignon.
Allez, je suis vraiment folle.
J'ai 7 chiens ! Qui a 7 chiens ?
L'ex-mari de ma petite amie sexy,
qui est un abruti.
Tu viens de gagner une bière, monsieur.
Très bien. Portons un toast.
Aux ex qui puent.
Donc, t'as pas récupéré le billard.
Je l'avais.
J'avais le billard dans mes mains,
et puis Allison me l'a pris
de mon tiroir à chaussettes.
Je vais faire semblant d'avoir compris.
Tu peux jouer au billard ici.
Je sais, mais c'est pas pareil.
Il me faut ce billard précisément.
Il faut que je fasse sortir ce billard
de la cave d'Allison, mais comment ?
À quelle heure Ira finit de travailler ?
Allez les mecs, allons-y.
On doit faire ça vite
avant qu'Allison rentre, d'accord ?
On fait rien d'illégal,
n'est-ce pas ?
Non. C'est la maison de mon ex-femme.
On ne... voiture, voiture !
Voiture ! Voiture ! Voiture !
Non, on est bon. Elle est partie. Allez.
Tout le monde debout. Ça va.
- J'ai faim.
- Quoi ?
On mangera quelque chose
quand on aura fini, comme on a dit,
- OK, Ira ?
- Mais j'ai faim là.
D'accord, Ira.
Voyons ce qu'on a ici.
- Hé, regarde. Des lasagnes.
- Je suis le régime de South Beach.
Ira, le moment est plutôt critique.
Tu veux bien m'aider ?
OK, réchauffe-les.
Je mangerai autour des pâtes.
Mon Dieu. C'est ridicule !
Ira, tu veux nous aider là,
ou quoi ?
Tu as vraiment divorcé d'une femme
qui prépare des lasagnes comme ça ?
Tu es un homme stupide.
Les mecs, on peut continuer ?
Ma femme dort,
et si elle se retourne et m'écrase pas,
elle saura que je suis pas là.
OK, commençons.
On va devoir enlever les
casiers à queues du mur,
il va nous falloir un tournevis...
ou...
ou de l'enduit de rebouchage.
L'un ou l'autre...
Très bien.
Aidez-moi à enlever cette bâche.
Allez Dennis. 1, 2, 3.
Remettez-la ! Remettez-la !
- Remettez-la !
- Je le savais !
Je savais que tu allais venir
voler ce billard.
Quoi ? Voler un billard ?
Gary a menti.
Il a dit qu'on allait essayer
de sauver Noël !
On viole votre domicile ?
Depuis combien de temps t'es là ?
Assez pour savoir que
t'es un mauvais criminel.
Je suis venu reprendre
ce qui est à moi !
Tu ne vas jamais
laisser tomber, n'est-ce pas ?
Pourquoi je devrais ?
Tu as tout eu dans le divorce.
Je me suis fait avoir !
T'as eu l'argent !
Les voitures ! Mon bar, nom de Dieu !
J'en ai marre de t'entendre parler
de tout ce que t'as perdu !
Et moi ? Tu crois que c'était
mon rêve de petite fille ?
De divorcer au bout de 15 ans,
et de me disputer avec des avocats,
faire la navette pour nos enfants ?
T'es pas le seul
à avoir perdu quelque chose, Gary.
T'as tellement envie d'un billard,
va t'en acheter un.
Je veux pas en acheter un.
Je veux celui-là.
Pourquoi ça doit être celui-là ?
Parce que c'est le mien !
J'ai tant de bons souvenirs avec lui !
C'est aussi pour ça que je le veux !
On le veut pour la même raison ?
Eh bien, ça craint.
J'adore ce billard.
Tu crois que j'essaie juste de le garder
pour être vindicative ?
Ça te ressemble, oui.
On s'est tellement amusé ici.
Les enfants jouaient,
et tous les voisins venaient
et tu te rappelles,
je descendais à boire pour
tout le monde, et tu criais
quand je posais un verre sur le bois ?
Ouais, ça laisse des traces.
Je veux dire que...
c'est la part de nous
à laquelle je veux bien m'accrocher.
Mais si tu ne laisses pas tomber
et continues
à penser que tu t'es fait avoir,
alors vas-y, prends-le.
Je peux pas après ton discours.
Je serais un idiot si je le prenais.
En plus, Ira est parti.
Non, il est encore là. Je l'entends
fouiller dans le congélateur.
Ça vous dérange pas
si je prends la dernière glace ?
T'as dit que t'étais au régime
de South Beach !
Si tu la veux,
dis-le simplement.
Tu gardes le billard, OK ?
Ça vaut la peine de savoir
que tu as une chose chez toi
qui te fait penser à moi en bien.
Je sais pas si je te l'ai déjà dit
mais je suis désolée...
que ça n'ait pas marché pour nous.
Mais on avait bien commencé.
On avait super bien commencé.
- Une partie à 8 boules ?
- Avec plaisir.
- Le gagnant à l'ottoman ?
- Rassemble les boules.
J'ai pas à le faire.
Elles sont déjà dans le triangle.
Tout le monde avait
cette coupe dans les années 80 ?
On était magnifique.
Il y avait beaucoup
de vent à cette époque ?
Non, chérie. À l'époque, même
les garçons se servaient d'un séchoir.
On se servait aussi
d'un truc appelé "mousse".
C'était comme une mayonnaise
que tes cheveux mangeaient.
Y a pas de façon sympa de dire ça,
mais vous avez tous l'air stupide.
T'as perdu la tête ?
On a l'air fantastique.
Regarde tous les looks qu'il y a.
Tu as
Boy George. Regarde ça.
Crockett et Tubbs.
Regarde, il y a le look Madonna,
le rassemblement de mouettes. Allez.
On était beau.
- Pourquoi tu fais ça ?
- Je fais quoi ?
- Tu relèves ton col.
- Je sais pas. Je trouve que c'est cool.
- Où tu vas ?
- Je vais brûler mon livre d'or.
Team Subs-Addicts"
- Hey, Louise. How was your day?
- Terrible.
Remember when I wrote
that letter to the epa
about toxic insulation in our school?
Yeah, honey, you write a lot of letters.
Well, it's gonna cost
the school $50,000 to fix it,
so they're canceling the art program.
- How was your day, Tommy?
- Great.
I just found out I don't have
to take art, so...
- No, thanks. I got it.
- What's that?
Just one of many boxes of yours
that's still stacked in my basement.
Come on. It's time you got the rest
of your stuff out of my house. I mean,
the ski clothes, the stereo equipment,
the comic books,
all 6 stupid seasons
of "Perfect Strangers."
Larry and Balki.
They were ill-suited to be roommates.
That's not stupid, that's genius.
Gary, it's time, OK?
I want it out by friday.
Friday?
Don't be ridiculous!
Gary, it was supposed to be out months
ago, OK? Nowhere in the divorce
- agreement does it.
- Oh, my gosh! The divorce agreement!
The piece of paper that stipulates
that you always get the upper hand
- and I get the finger.
- OK, you know what?
It is not my fault
that your lawyer's band
went on tour during our proceedings.
If Hasselhoff says you're going on ur,
You're going on tour.

" Gary Gets His Stuff Back "
Sub VO :  ¤AkaZab¤
Subs-Addicts'
[Sub-Way.fr]
Look at all this cool stuff you have
in mom's basement. What's this?
That's a beer-can hat, my friend,
and I'll have you know
I drank all those beers myself.
- That's only 3, dad.
- You know what?
You try crocheting a hat
after drinking 3 beers.
Tommy, not until you're 17!
Is this your eighth-grade yearbook, dad?
Yeah.
Let me show you something.
See...
look at this. See this tall, handsome
guy playing quarterback?
Is that you?
No, I just always thought
that guy was tall and handsome.
No, I didn't play football
until high school.
This is junior high, where I wrestled.
There. There's your daddy
wrestling right there.
Your face is being covered
by that guy's butt.
Actually...
that's my butt.
I quit after that.
Yeah, once you see your
own butt from that angle,
you know it's time to quit.
Thanks for getting
all this stuff out of here.
Yeah, just a few more
loads and all evidence
of my existence in the basement
I spent hundreds of hours
and thousands of dollars
finishing will be complete.
And many a nights passed out in.
I wasn't passed out,
Allison, I was hiding.
It's not really hiding if no
one's looking for you, Gary.
Look, I'll be back next week
to get the pool table, OK?
The pool table?
Yeah, the pool table. You probably
know it as my basement wife.
- Gary, the pool table is mine.
- What?
Yeah. I believe you gave it to me
as an anniversary gift one year?
No, no.
That was a joke.
No, that's a joke. I gave it to you,
but it's really for me.
- You know, it's a joke.
- No Gary.
That's the set-up to the joke.
The punch line is "i'm keeping it."
No, no! Allison, no!
This is my pool table!
You can't have it. She's perfect.
I love her.
You don't even use it.
What do you mean? I'm using it right now
to store old photographs,
none of which, by the way,
is of a trip to Paris,
which is what you should have got me
as an anniversary gift.
France, Allison? Really? You want to sit
on a plane for 11 hours to find out
people don't like you there, either?
- Come on, let me keep the pool table.
- What? No, no. This was a gift to me.
The divorce agreement clearly states
all gifts stay with the recipient.
You know, I wish you would stop bringing
up that stupid divorce agreement
- because I signed it under duress.
- How were you under duress?
They said if I didn't sign it,
i'd have to stay married to you!
I'm sorry about your pool table, honey.
Why is Allison being so stubborn?
I don't know. Why do bees sting people
even though they know they're gonna die?
She doesn't deserve that table.
She doesn't respect the game. She calls
the rack "that triangle thing."
What's a rack?
It's the... you know,
it's that triangle thing.
I can't believe she's got the upper hand
in everything regarding
our divorce agreement.
One day I got to read that
stupid piece of paper I signed.
Well, I think that she's
being totally unfair.
- Want to switch places?
- Yeah, sure.
So how'd things go today with your ex?
Oh, god, we fought,
as usual.
This time it was about our dog wendell.
He needs pills that cost $50 a month,
and Ronnie refuses
- to split the bill with me.
- Cheap bastard.
Thank you.
- I didn't know you had a dog.
- Yeah.
I'm kind of a dog lover.
I don't even know how many I've
rescued. I can't even count.
But when we split,
I couldn't find a place
that would let me keep them,
so Ronnie has them all.
All?
What do you mean by all?
How many dogs do you have?
7?
Tucker, Daisy, Wendell,
Arizona, Cheater, Cabot, and Gus.
But they're all really small.
Except for gus, who's, like, huge.
So Ronnie takes care of your 7 dogs?
Yeah, but it's not that hard,
except for Cabot, who needs eye drops.
And tucker, who needs anti-depressants.
Yeah, and, of course,
gus the bus, who
has to sleep in bed
with you human-style
Head on pillow.
It's really cute.
But Ronnie acts, like,
so put out by the whole thing.
He's such a Jerk!
I said he's such a Jerk.
Right, Gary?
Isn't he a Jerk?
Oh, my god!
Are you siding with Ronnie?
No, I'm not siding
with Ronnie, but 7 dogs?
Eye drops, anti-depressants,
gus the bus? Oh, my gosh!
It sounds like Ronnie kind of got the
not-so-good end of the deal there right?
What are you like,
Ronnie's best friend now?
- No, I'm not Ronnie's best friend...
- Why don't you go off and marry him?
Doesn't sound like he has room for me.
You know what?
I got to go to work.
Come on. I was just kidding around,
that's all. Come on.
You know, I totally supported
you with your pool-table issue.
And I support you, too. I just
thought it was funny with the 7 dogs.
I was trying to make a joke, that's all.
You know what? I hope that you
and Ronnie will be very happy together,
but the first time he calls
and says he's spending the night at his
"brother's," he's at his
really banging a waitress.
- How was your power walk?
- Exhilarating. What a workout.
- What happened to your hand weights?
- Stolen by skateboarders.
One on each side.
They picked me clean.
Well, this will cheer you up.
It's a picture of me in Cancun.
Spring break, my senior year of college.
Gee!
You must have been
caught in a Rainstorm.
Your t-shirt is soaked.
Yeah. I won $200 for getting
caught in that Rainstorm.
You could have won additional money
by entering some sort of breast contest.
- Thank you, honey.
- What are you doing?
Well, now that Gary finally got
all his stuff out of the way,
I can start organizing my things,
starting with all my pictures.
Why is Gary lying on his back in
front of the Washington monument?
See?
I get it.
It's as though it's his penis.
Yeah, he has a whole series
of those things: the space needle,
Giant Redwood, old faithful.
He has embarrassed me from
sea to fricking shing sea.
Well, I wouldn't give im the Cancun
photo. That would just be cruel.
No, he's not getting
that one, but believe me,
Gary's seen pictures
of me wearing a lot less, a lot less.
Actually, there's a photo
album around here somewhere.
Where is it?
- What are you looking for?
- It's a...
It's a purple satin photo album.
- Crap. I don't think it's here.
- What's in it?
Our first valentine's day,
I gave Gary some... Pictures of me.
Tasteful boudoir photos?
Yes...
And no.
Let's each take a box. We'll
treat this area like a grid.
OK.
Oh, god. It's not here.
You can give up if
you like, but I intend
to find those photos and look at them.
Easy, easy, easy!
Hey, dennis, I just
measured the entire garage.
We can totally put
the pool table in there.
We just have to play
with the garage door open
and switch to drumsticks when we're
up against the water heater, OK?
Dude, OK, but Allison's never
changed her mind about anything,
except for spending the
rest of her life with you.
It's a good point, Dennis.
You need to concentrate on all
the great things that you did get:
Comic books...
Frank Sinatra plate...
Photo album with sex
picture of Allison on it.
What did you say?
Sinatra plate.
The other thing. Go back.
What was the other one? What's that?
Here. This is for you.
You can have the Sinatra plate.
Oh, my gosh!
I thought this was long gone,
but it's not. Here it is in my hands!
What's in it?
They're just photos
of a personal nature.
May I please see her personal nature?
Come on, man. It's just
a bunch of old pictures.
No, you're not getting it. It's
much more than that, OK, Dennis?
Chalk up your drumstick, my friend,
because this is a pool table!
May I come in?
You know, except for the smile
and the nice disposition,
you look a lot like my ex-wife.
That is so funny because
you and I are often fighting!
- What do you want?
- What?
- What? What do you want?
- What? Nothing. I just, came over
to see, you know, if you needed any help
unpacking, organizing, whatnot.
You're looking for something.
Are you looking for anything?
No, Gary. I just know how hard
it is to settle into a new home, so...
'Cause I was looking through the boxes
earlier, and I found something
fascinating that you might
be interested in.
- A photo album.
- Really?
Of Tommy when he was a baby.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
I did find something that
gave me hours of pleasure
Allison that you might be interested in,
and that, of course, would be bare...
Naked ladies, their second Cd.
Sure you're not looking for anything?
Please, Gary. You always
say I got all the good stuff.
- What could I possibly be looking for?
- I don't know...
Letters, journals,
11 saucy photos of a filthy bride,
circa 1993?
So you found the valentine's day photos.
Yes, I did.
- May I have them?
- No, you may not.
You know, the divorce agreement
clearly states that all gifts
are the property of the recipient.
Photos are exempt from the rule, Gary!
They're not exempt.
They may be illegal in a few states,
but they're not exempt, Allison.
- Give me the photos!
- No, no. Hey, I have an idea:
- Yeah?
- Is it lonely?
What an unfortunate time to mock me,
because I was thinking I could trade
a few naughty Allison pictures
for some things that I would like
to have around here.
No, Gary. Absolutely not.
I refuse to deal on principle.
But you're not that principled, Allison.
In fact I have the pictures to prove it.
That was close.
That's close.
Swing and a miss!
Strike 3. You're out.
All right.
All right, so,
you're trying to Blackmail me
into giving you the pool table.
For starters.
- Starters?
- Have a seat.
We'll talk all about it.
Go on. Sit, sit.
You know, Allison, for the first time
in our 15 years together, I
have the upper hand.
And, you know, it's amazing
that you would take hat book out
of my hand, tank you very much.
There's some things I've always wanted
since we've been divorced,
and now I have the power to ask
for them. For example, I...
want the armoire.
My grandmother's armoire
that's been holding my clothes
since I was a little girl?
That's what an armoire is?
No, I-- I don't want that. Um...
What's the leather thing I put
my feet onwhen I'm watching football?
- That's an ottoman.
- I want the ottoman.
Now let's talk music.
Let's talk crows:
I get counting and black,
you keep Sheryl.
You mean, no?
I don't even want that stuff anyway.
All I really care about is the pool
table. I want it back.
No. I'm saying no to everything.
OK, great. Well,
I guess I can do whatever I want with
pouty Allison...
Allison in the jacuzzi.
I like this picture the most
'cause you look genuinely surprised
that you're not wearing any pants.
- Where are the pictures?
- How dumb do you think I am?
Very, but stay on the subject.
Where are they?
They're hidden, Allison.
I hid them in a place where
you will never find them, ever.
All right.
All right, Gary.
I give up. You win.
Bring the photos over and,
i'll give you the pool table.
That sounds good.
And... I'm sorry it had
to get so dirty, Allison,
but you left me no choice.
And I'm sorry, but when I was pulling in
I Kinda clipped the side of your van.
No, you didn't!
What are you doing?
Going to get my pictures
in your sock drawer.
What makes you think I would
hide them in my sock drawer?
Come on, Allison!
Flick.
- How much for you, sweet cheeks?
- Ira?
No, it's me! It's Gary!
I know.
Are you still in love with Ronnie?
No, I hate Ronnie. Ronnie stinks.
It's OK, Ira. He's all right.
Oh, my gosh. That's got
to be the toughest ira in America.
Look, I'm sorry I overreacted
about the whole Ronnie thing.
I was just so crazed
about this thing with Allison
and the pool table.
I apologize.
- So you never side with Ronnie again?
- Never.
Even if you think that
he's right and I'm wrong?
Even that, yes.
And you don't think I'm crazy
for having 7 dogs?
No.
I think it's cute.
Come on. I am so crazy.
I have 7 dogs! Who has 7 dogs?
My hot girlfriend's ex-husband,
who's a Jerk.
You just earned yourself a beer, mister.
All right. Let's have a toast.
To exes who stink.
I take it you didn't
get back your pool table.
I had it, Vanessa.
I had the pool table in my hands,
and then Allison just took it right out
of my sock drawer.
I'm gonna pretend I know what that
means. You can play pool here.
I know, but it's not the Same.
I need that pool table specifically.
I got to get that table out of Allison's
basement, but I don't know how.
What time does Ira get off of work?
Come on, you guys. Let's go.
All right. We got to make this quick
before Allison gets home, all right?
We're not doing anything
illegal, are we?
No. This is my ex-wife's house, Ira.
We're not car, car!
Car! Car! Car!
No, we're OK. It's gone now. Come on.
Everybody up. We're all right.
- I'm hungry.
- What?
Yeah, we'll get something to eat when
we're finished like we talked about,
- OK, Ira?
- But I'm hungry now.
All right, Ira.
Let's see what we have here.
- Hey, hey, look. Lasagna.
- I'm on the south beach diet.
Ira, we're kind of in a time
crunch here. Could you help me out?
OK, heat it up.
I'll eat around the noodles.
Oh, my god! This is ridiculous!
Ira, you want to help us out
down here or what?
You actually divorced a woman
who can cook lasagna like this?
You are a foolish, foolish man.
Hey, guys, can we move this along?
My wife's asleep,
and if she rolls over and doesn't
squish me, she'll know I'm not there.
OK, let's get started.
We're gonna have to take the pool
cue rack off the walls,
so we're gonna need a screwdriver...
or...
or some spackle.
That's cool. Either way.
All right, come on.
Help me get this tarp off.
All right. Come on, Dennis 1, 2, 3.
Put it back! Put it back!
- Put it back!
- I knew it!
I knew you were gonna try
to steal the pool table.
What? Steal the pool table?
Gary Lied.
He said we were gonna
try to save Christmas!
Are we trespassing?
Long were you laying under there?
Long enough to know you're
the worst criminal ever.
I'm not a criminal!
I came to take what was mine!
My god! You are never
gonna let this go, are you?
No. Why should i? You got
everything in the divorce!
I got totally shafted!
You got the money!
You got the cars! You got
my bar, for crying out loud!
I am so sick and tired
of hearing about everything you lost!
What about me, Gary? You think
this was my childhood dream?
To be divorced after 15 years,
and arguing through lawyers,
shuttling our kids back and forth?
You're not the only one
that lost something, Gary.
You want a pool table so bad,
go out and buy one.
I don't want to go out and buy one.
I want this one, Allison.
Why does it have to be this one?
Because this one's mine! I had so
many good memories with this one!
Yeah? That's why I want it, too!
What, we want this for the same reason?
Well, then that is completely weird.
Gary, I love this table.
What, you think I'm just trying to
hold on to it just to be vindictive?
It would fit a pattern, yeah.
We had so much fun down here.
The kids would play,
and we would have all the neighbors
come over and remember,
I'd bring drinks downstairs
for everybody and you'd yell at me
when I put the can on the wood?
Yeah, it leaves a ring.
I mean, it's...
the one part of us
I wouldn't mind holding on to.
But, you know, if you're not gonna
let it go and you're gonna
feel like you've been so shafted, then
just, you know, go ahead and take it.
I can't take it after your nice speech.
I'd be a complete tool if I took it now.
Plus Ira's gone.
No, he's still up there. I can
hear him digging through my freezer.
Ira: mind if I have the last dove bar?
You said you were on
the south beach diet!
If you want it,
just say you want it.
You keep the table, OK?
It's worth it to me to know
that you have something in your house
that reminds you of me in a good way.
You know, Gary, I don't know
if I ever said this, but I'm sorry...
It didn't work out for us.
But, you know, we started
in a good place.
We started in a great place.
- Game of 8-ball?
- I'd like that.
- Winner gets the ottoman?
- Rack'em.
I don't have to.
They're already in the triangle thing.
Did everybody have hair like that
back in the eighties?
We looked awesome.
Was it really windy back then?
No, sweetie. See, even the guys
back then, we would use a blow dryer.
Also, we used this stuff called mousse.
It was kind of like mayonnaise
that your hair ate.
Well, there's no kind way to say this,
but everyone looked kind of stupid.
Are you out of your mind?
We look fantastic.
Look at all the different
looks you have here. You have
your Boy George. Look at this.
Your crockett and your tubbs.
Look, you got the Madonna look,
the flock of Seagulls. Come on, man.
We looked good.
- Why do you do that?
- Do what? What'd I do?
- You put your collar up.
- I don't know. I think it looks cool.
- Tommy, where you going?
- I'm gonna go burn my yearbook.
Team Subs-Addicts'
Gary, t'es lŕ ?
T'essaies de m'enfermer dehors ?
T'as évité le pičge ŕ ours,
et faut croire que l'enclume t'a ratée.
Toujours tes références
aux dessins animés.
Ça me manque pas.
J'ai pris la tenue de basket de Louise.
T'es sűr de vouloir entraîner
une équipe de filles ?
Tu rigoles ? J'ai hâte.
Les autres équipes vont frémir
de peur ŕ la vue du...
"Marché Bio de Bonnie".
Rappelle-toi que leur précédent
coach avait pour philosophie
la compétition sans concurrence.
Hé bien, le nouveau coach a
une philosophie sur l'ancien :
Va te couper les cheveux
et trouve un boulot, sale hippie.
Sympa.
Oů sont les gamins ?
J'étais coincé sur un boulot.
Vanessa les ramčne, elle m'aide.
- Elle fait ça souvent ?
- Des fois.
Lŕ, elle les emmčne prendre une glace.
Une glace ? Avant le dîner,
tu crois que c'est une bonne idée ?
En fait y a de la glace pour dîner.
Je crois pas que ce soit important.
Salut.
Les gamins arrivent.
Merci de m'aider.
Hé, les enfants.
Regarde, maman. Vanessa nous a emmenés
nous faire tatouer.
Voyez-vous ça.
Mon fils a un serpent géant sur le bras.
- Classe.
- T'inquičte pas.
Ils seront partis dans
2, 3, 4, 5 ou 6 semaines max.
Vanessa a dit que ça attirerait
l'attention sur mes bras.
Tu vas en avoir besoin
pour vaincre ces filles.
Regarde le mien, maman.
Oh, regardez ça.
Le symbole du recyclage.
Ça a été trop long.
Le mec peut faire 20 sortes de licornes,
mais il arrivait pas ŕ faire
un triangle en flčches.
Merci, V.
Tu viens au match ce soir ?
- Je serais l'arbitre.
- J'y serais T.
T ? V ? Quoi ?
Tu crois pas qu'un tatouage temporaire
pourrait conduire
ŕ un tatouage permanent ?
- Eh, bien je...
- Je m'en occupe. Allons Allison.
Quand t'emmčnes les enfants ŕ la foire,
peu importe que leur visage
y soit peint. Ça va pas les mener
ŕ ętre des clowns permanents.
J'essayais juste de faire passer
le temps entre le dîner et l'école.
Ça va, c'est bon. Mais,
tu sais un passage ŕ la bibliothčque
n'aurait pas été une mauvaise idée...
Oui, c'est super.
Comme ça ils pourraient chercher
des mots comme indifférents
et agressifs.
Je suis en train de laver le sol.
Il est temps de bouger, allez.
On se parle plus tard, OK ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Pourquoi t'as si peur que je lui parle ?
J'ai pas peur que tu lui parles.
J'ai peur que tu sortes tes dents
et que tu la manges toute crue.
J'essaie juste de connaître la femme qui
passe tant de temps avec nos enfants.
Et si elle avait mauvaise influence ?
C'est une bonne influence.
Elle me l'a dit.
Ou peut-ętre qu'elle m'a dit
qu'elle était sous influence.
C'est une brave fille.
Elle est de bon conseil.
Vraiment ? Tu sais quoi ?
Je crois qu'il y a
4 milliards d'hommes sur terre,
et elle t'a choisi toi.
Je sais pas quel est l'opposé
de gagner au loto,
mais merde, je crois qu'elle l'a fait.
Elle est sortie s'amuser
avec les enfants.
Tu te souviens, s'amuser.
Ça fait partie
de ton axe du mal avec
la joie et l'allégresse.

OK, les filles. Écoutez.
On joue le pressing Hanson, OK ?
Elles sont plus rapides,
plus grandes que nous.
Et leurs maillots sont repassés
et amidonnés.
Mais je pense qu'on peut gagner.
Bonne chance, coach.
Le gymnase a une rčgle stricte.
Tu peux pas venir sur le terrain
ŕ moins de porter une tenue
- sexy de pompom girl.
- Dommage, j'ai pas pris la mienne.
T'en as une ?
- 2 minutes, coach. 2 minutes.
- C'est quoi les lunettes ?
Tes lunettes.
Pourquoi tu portes des lunettes ?
C'est juste qu'on me foudroie du regard.
Hé, V.
Salut Tom.
T'as colorié ce tatouage ?
Ouais. Je le transforme
en serpent de corail.
C'est magnifique.
Mais dangereux aussi.
Tous les signes sont lŕ.
Les lunettes noires, le sifflet.
J'élčve un petit shérif.
OK, l'équipe, rassemblez-vous.
On va faire "dominate" ŕ 3.
1, 2, 3, dominate ! Ouais.
Vous savez,
si on le dit tous ensemble,
c'est beaucoup plus effrayant.
Notre ancien coach disait que le nombre
de points n'était pas important,
- c'est le nombre d'amis qui l'est.
- OK, les filles,
Je vais pas prendre de gants.
Les perdants méritent pas d'amis.
Allez-y et gagnez, gagnez !
Allez !
T'as vu ça ? Ton ex est assise
ŕ côté de ta petite amie.
Oh, mon Dieu. C'est terrible.
Ces deux-lŕ ne font pas la paire.
Hier, j'ai dű me mettre entre elles
alors qu'elles se prenaient
dans les bras ?
T'étais entre elles ŕ ce moment-lŕ ?
T'étais face ŕ qui ?
Moi, je ne saurais pas choisir.
Elles se disputaient hier
et lŕ elles se font un câlin.
Mais c'est pire, c'est bien pire.
Faut que j'arręte ça.
Votre joueuse a des boucles d'oreille.
Les bijoux ne sont pas acceptés.
Je croyais que ça passait.
Pas de clous, ni d'anneaux.
Regardez dans votre livre.
C'est ce que j'aurais fait
si l'arbitre n'avait pas renversé
son chocolat dessus ce matin.
Assieds-toi.
Alors, elles font quoi lŕ ?
Elles parlent et elles rigolent.
Et elles sont en train de me mater.
Ça va, les filles ?
Elles te regardent pas toi,
elles me regardent moi.
Pourquoi elles me regarderaient pas ?
Hé, coach, on vous attend !
J'ai des boucles d'oreille, lŕ.
J'y travaille.
Vas-y chérie, ça va.
Tu es trčs beau.
Mais je suis la seule chose
qu'elles aient en commun.
La personne qui me déteste le plus parle
ŕ celle qui m'aime le plus.
Ça peut pas se passer.
Allison a tout un match pour raconter
ŕ Vanessa tous les trucs débiles que
j'ai fait que j'ai dit, tous les trucs
stupides que j'ai voulu manger.
T'as raison. Et le pire c'est que,
tôt ou tard, la conversation
va se porter sur ton machin.
Trop tard.
Le basket est différent
de quand j'étais gamin.
Tu jouais au basket ?
Meneur de jeu.
J'étais mortel pour nos adversaires.
Je pouvais tirer ŕ 3 points,
et défendre en zone.
On pouvait pas m'arręter.
Il faut que tu finisses de
me raconter cette histoire ŕ Havasu.
Ah oui.
Alors,
les 6 filles nagent nues,
et personne a pensé ŕ arręter le bateau.
Oh, mon Dieu. Et alors quoi ?
Le bateau est parti ?
Ouais ! Et une heure plus tard,
deux lycéens dans un bateau de pęche
se sont arrętés et nous ont ramenées
sur la côte trčs lentement.
Quand j'étais dans une fraternité,
on était allées se baigner nues.
J'avais gardé mon soutien-gorge et
ma culotte, mais c'était trčs grisant.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Vous faites quoi ?
Vanessa me racontait cette histoire
trčs marrante sur le lac Havasu.
Cette histoire.
J'adore cette histoire.
Les gamins dehors ont vraiment soif.
Tu pourrais leur amener du jus ?
C'est bon.
Il faut les hydrater.
Vas-y, juste lŕ.
Quand je reviens, je te raconterais
l'histoire de Cabo. C'est délirant.
Cette histoire-lŕ...
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
- Quoi ? Que veux-tu dire ?
Pourquoi tu veux ętre amie avec elle ?
Tu veux rien me dire sur elle,
alors je me débrouille seule.
Et tu vas ętre content de savoir
que je la trouve super.
Elle me rappelle un peu moi.
Dans quel univers parallčle ?
Dans un univers oů une fille comme ça
est attirée par un mec comme toi.
Je la trouve juste adorable, OK ?
Bien. Alors, vous pouvez recommencer
ŕ vous disputer pour des tatouages, OK ?
S'il te plaît,
c'est du henné, ils vont partir.
- Fluides remplacés.
- Crčme solaire pour les filles.
J'ai dit aux parents
qu'ils rentreraient pas vieillis.
C'est bien.
Merci beaucoup.
C'est bien, je l'apprécie.
Je me verrais męme traîner avec elle.
Tu peux pas traîner avec elle.
Ŕ la limite, tu peux lui parler.
Tu peux l'apprécier.
Tu peux ętre jalouse
que tes écailles ne soient pas
aussi douces que sa peau. Mais...
tu peux pas traîner avec elle.
Qu'y a-t-il de mal ŕ ce que
ta petite amie et ton ex s'entendent ?
T'aimerais que je traîne avec ton fiancé
tout le temps ?
Hé, ça va ?
Tu voudrais pas traîner des fois ?
- Non, merci.
- Quoi ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Au risque de passer pour supérieur,
je dois dire que tu me conviens pas.
Vanessa, oů as-tu eu
cette ceinture, déjŕ ?
Chez Stella sur Melrose.
Faut que je rapporte un truc lŕ-bas.
Tu veux venir avec moi ?
Non, Elle veut pas y aller avec toi.
- Si, j'adorerai.
- Non, en fait, elle veut pas.
Elle a changé d'avis. Elle m'a dit
qu'elle voulait pas y aller avec toi.
- Mais si.
- Mais non.
Elle essaie de dire non.
Elle veut pas passer de temps avec toi.
Le truc les filles, c'est que vous deux
faisant du shopping ensemble,
je crois pas que ce soit
un truc que j'aimerais.
Alors, ŕ quelle heure ?
Non, te laisse pas avoir.
Elle essaie pas d'ętre ton amie.
Elle veut voir si t'as une bonne
influence sur nos enfants.
Bien sűr.
Je suis une maman.
J'ai compris, elle teste
la nouvelle petite amie.
- On va juste faire du shopping.
- Non, c'est pas vrai.
Vous savez quoi ? Je mets mon pied
par terre. Vous voyez, c'est mon pied.
Je vous interdis
de passer du temps ensemble.
Excuse-moi.
Tu viens de dire "interdit" ?
Oui. Interdit. Je vous interdis
de sortir ensemble.
- Oubliez ça.
- Vraiment ?
Vraiment.
Et si on partait dčs qu'on a fini ici ?
- Elle peut pas. C'est interdit.
- Tu sais quoi ?
J'adorerais, et il y a un spa, lŕ-bas.
- C'est un spa interdit ?
- On pourrait se faire masser ensemble.
Non.
Un massage pourra me faire du bien.
Mon petit ami me stresse, ces temps-ci.
C'est interdit.
Et on peut aller prendre un verre aprčs.
Et flirter un peu aussi, peut-ętre.
C'est super.
Ça vous est interdit !
Je vous dis quoi faire.
L'homme de la maison a parlé !
Mon Dieu.
Pourquoi ętes-vous si tendue ?
C'était un peu
une idée de derničre minute,
et je me suis pas rasé les jambes.
Dites-moi si la pression vous convient.
Relaxez-vous
et n'oubliez pas de respirer.
Tout va bien ?
Tout va bien.
Tout est super.
La pression est bien ?
Oh, oui. C'est super, merci.
J'ai vu que vous portiez une alliance.
Vous ętes mariée ?
Fiancée, en fait.
Mais j'étais mariée.
Votre ex-mari, il s'est passé quoi ?
Vous ne pouviez le satisfaire ?
Quoi ?
Je veux dire que peut-ętre votre...
votre ex-mari,
ne vous satisfaisait pas ?
Pas assez pour que
je reste mariée avec lui
vous savez quoi ?
La pression devient un peu forte lŕ.
Que pourriez-vous dire sur votre mari
si vous aviez un nouvel ami,
un nouvel ami comme moi.
Eh bien,
je suis en colčre contre lui, lŕ.
Mais je crois que je dirais
qu'il était tyrannique,
paranoďaque et égoďste.
Il est égoďste ?
Ouais, égoďste.
Bien qu'il acceptait
de vous faire l'amour toutes les nuits
męme quand vous portiez votre appareil
dentaire et vos culottes de mamie ?
- Égoďste, mon cul...
- Quoi ? Mon Dieu, Gary.
- Tu fais quoi ici ?
- Ce que je fais ?
Je voulais voir si t'allais parler
de moi en mal et tu l'as fait.
T'es fou !
Tu disais du mal de moi ŕ un masseur,
un parfait inconnu.
J'imagine le genre de choses
que tu vas dire ŕ ma petite amie.
Sors d'ici.
Allez.
J'ai une ardoise propre avec Vanessa.
Je veux pas que tu lui bourres la tęte
de mauvaises choses sur moi.
Je dirais tout ce que je veux
et tu sais quoi ?
Je commencerai peut-ętre par la fois
oů tu as interrompu mon massage ŕ 160 $.
Tu m'en veux toujours pour ça ?
Mon Dieu.
Je pars pas tant que tu promets pas
de rester en dehors de ma relation.
Moi ? C'est toi qui fout tout en l'air
avec ton discours ŕ la Ike Turner.
"Je te l'interdis, femme !"
On passe un bon moment. Je l'aime bien,
elle fait ressortir mon côté marrant.
Si t'as un côté marrant,
moi j'ai un côté danseur d'opéra, OK ?
- Il y a un problčme ici ?
- Oui, cet homme a touché mon corps nu.
Oui, mais c'était pas drôle
pour moi non plus.
Vous devez nous suivre.
Trčs bien,
Je veux pas avoir ŕ faire ça, mais
je suis l'officier Brooks.
Je veux parler au propriétaire.
- Je suis le propriétaire.
- Dans ce cas, tenez. Excusez-moi.
Oů étais-tu ?
Désolé, P'pa.
La Plymouth a crevé en revenant
du magasin de disques.
On a dű faire du stop pour rentrer.
Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive, Tom ?
- Assieds-toi.
- Je m'assieds, du calme.
Qu'as-tu dit ŕ Vanessa ŕ la fęte ?
Elle est partie, l'air contrarié.
Elle m'a męme pas dit au revoir.
- Eh bien, je...
- Je ne veux pas t'entendre.
Je veux juste que tu arranges ça,
et maintenant.
T'es vraiment contrarié, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui, parce que j'aime bien Vanessa,
et que si tu la vois plus,
Je la verrais plus, tu suis ?
OK, laisse-moi t'expliquer un truc.
Disons que t'es dans une nouvelle école.
Et que t'aimes la nouvelle prof,
mais qu'il y a toujours
celle de l'ancienne école qui connaît
tous les mauvais trucs sur toi.
Je comprends, papa.
T'as peur que maman dise ŕ Vanessa
de mauvaises choses sur toi.
Je sais pas comment t'as fait
pour trouver ça, mais...
Tu sais quoi ?
Je perds patience.
Mais dans ce scénario,
j'irais voir ma nouvelle prof
et lui dirait tout ce que j'avais peur
qu'elle apprenne par l'ancienne prof.
Tu veux que je dise
ŕ Vanessa tout ce que
j'ai peur que maman
lui raconte sur moi ?
Au moins, elle les apprendra de toi.
D'accord, merci.
T'es un homme bien, Tommy.
T'es devenu un bon jeune homme.
Merci, papa.
Mais ce dont tu dois te rappeler
ŕ propos de femmes,
c'est qu'elles croient en général
pas beaucoup en nous.
Hé, hé.
Ramčne-la.
Tu sais, un jour, j'en goűterais une.
Hé, tu veux entendre un truc
qui va vraiment te mettre en colčre ?
Je vais goűter les deux maintenant.
Faut que je voie Vanessa.
Y a un groupe.
- 5.00 $ Cover.
- OK.
Voilŕ tes 5 $
Non. Le nom du groupe est 5.00 $ cover.
C'est 10 pour entrer.
OK. 10 $.
Laisse-moi entrer.
J'ai fait une école de cascadeurs.
Pardon ?
En 1993 pendant 3 semaines,
j'ai fait une école de cascadeurs.
Ça m'a couté 12,000 $,
et le deuxičme jour,
je me suis foulé la cheville en allant
ŕ un cour de chutes.
Je suis un sacré loser.
Je suis rancunier.
Je suis trčs impatient.
Si impatient que je tire la chasse
avant męme d'avoir fini de faire pipi.
Tu fais quoi ?
Je te dis tous les mauvais trucs sur moi
avant qu'Allison le fasse.
Je veux lui couper l'herbe sous le pied.
Tu penses que si Allison me dit que
tu t'es sauvé de l'école de cascadeur,
je vais rompre avec toi ?
Non, je me suis pas sauvé
de l'école de cascadeurs.
J'ai trébuché sur une dalle
et je suis parti le jour d'aprčs.
Merci.
Pourquoi tu me laisses pas
me faire ma propre opinion ?
J'ai jamais voulu que tu sois parfait.
Ou quoi que ce soit
proche de la perfection.
Eh bien, dans ce cas...
Et t'inquičte pas autant pour Allison
parce qu'elle pourra
se repasser cette soirée dans sa tęte
pendant trčs longtemps.
Pourquoi ? Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Attends. Elle est partie oů ?
Elle était juste lŕ.
Hé, Vanessa,
elle a encore essayé de s'échapper.
Mon Dieu, c'est Allison.
Dčs que je sors dehors,
je finis par revenir ici.
Hé, ce sont mes potes !
Mes potes !
2 verres.
C'est étonnant.
Hé, apportez-leur un verre.
Parce que cette femme-lŕ,
c'est la femme la plus cool du monde.
Et cette femme moche est mon ex-mari.
Je suis si content en ce moment.
Tu m'aides ŕ la tenir
pendant que j'ouvre la porte ?
Elle pčse comme 50 kg
de "shots" de gelée lŕ.
T'es tellement super gentille.
Je pčse carrément plus de 50 kg.
Fais attention. Elle embrasse
quand elle est bourrée.
J'ai déjŕ eu droit
ŕ un sur la bouche en sortant.
J'avais jamais embrassé un black,
mais je le referai.
Mets-la sur la chaise.
Doucement.
Tu veux bien me rendre service
et aller en haut prendre de l'aspirine,
du B-12, et son sweatshirt de cowboy.
Quand elle est ivre, elle prend froid.
Bien sűr. J'ai si faim.
Vous savez quoi ?
Je vais faire un gâteau.
Désolé d'avoir été si débile.
J'avais peur qu'elle te dise des choses
qui changeraient
la façon que t'as de me regarder.
Je suis face ŕ un homme
suffisamment généreux
pour aider une femme qui le rend fou
99% du temps. Je trouve ça charmant.
Vous savez ce qui est bon aussi ?
Des beignets ŕ la cannelle.
Tu vas les chercher.
Je vais attendre ici.
Laisse-moi te mettre au lit.
Allez Allison, viens.
D'accord.
Laisse-moi m'allonger ici.
Je peux m'allonger ici ?
On est si bien.
J'adore le marbre.
Tu sais, je voulais
du carrelage ŕ l'espagnol,
mais tu voulais du marbre.
T'es trop intelligent.
Tu es trop intelligent.
C'est dur d'ętre intelligent, non ?
Je suis toujours l'intelligente
et toi t'es toujours le marrant.
Avant j'étais marrante comme Vanessa,
et puis je t'ai rencontré.
Et tu m'as enlevé mon côté marrante
pour me rendre ennuyeuse.
J'ai pas enlevé ton côté marrant.
C'est...
que t'as épousé un abruti immature,
et quelqu'un a dű agir comme un adulte.
J'aimais cet abruti immature.
Ne parle pas de lui comme ça.
Ça marche. Mais sois pas trop dur
avec toi, tu étais beaucoup de choses,
mais jamais ennuyante.
Je t'embrasserais si je venais pas
de vomir dans ma bouche.
D'accord les filles. Allez-y !
Allez-y !
Trčs bien !
- L'arbitre, quoi de neuf ?
- Vous vous ętes réconciliés ?
Oui.
Merci de ton conseil.
Sois bon avec elle.
Hé, regarde ce que le chat a ramené !
Comment tu te sens ?
On dirait vraiment que Vanessa
a fait ressortir ton côté marrant.
Si par mon côté marrant, tu veux dire
ce que j'ai dedans, eh bien oui.
Oui, elle l'a fait.
Jouons au Basket, les filles.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je les ai achetés chez un grossiste.
TEAM Subs-Addicts'
Gary, you home?
You trying to lock me out?
You didn't step in the bear trap,
and I guess the anvil missed you.
Nonstop cartoon references.
I don't Miss that.
I picked up Louise's basketball uniform.
Now, you're sure you're
ready to coach girls basketball?
Are you kidding me? I can't wait.
The rest of the teams are gonna cower
in fear at the sight
of bonnie's organic market.
Look, Gary, just rember that their
last coach had a strict philosophy of
non-competive competion.
OK, well, the new coach has a
strict philosophy about their old coach:
get a haircut, get a job,
you dirty hippie.
That's nice. Nice.
Gary, where are the kids?
I got stuck at a job. Vanessa's picking
them up. She helps me out.
- Does she do that a lot?
- Sometimes.
Right now,
I think she's taking them for ice cream.
Ice cream? Before dinner.
You think that's a good idea?
Well, they're having ice cream for
dinner, so I didn't think it mattered.
- The kids are right behind me.
- Thanks for helping me out.
Hey, guys.
Check it out, mom.
Vanessa took us to get tattoos.
Look at that.
My son has a giant snake on his arm.
- Neat.
- Don't worry.
They'll be gone in,
like, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 weeks tops.
Vanessa said it would draw attention
on my guns.
You're gonna need those guns
to fight all the girls.
Look at mine, mom.
Look at that. The recycling symbol.
It took forever.
The guy can do 20 types of unicorns
but couldn't get his head around
a triangle made out of arrows.
Thanks, V.
You coming to the game tonight?
- I'm gonna be the referee.
- I'll be there, T.
T? V? What?
You don't think that
temporary tattoos could
be a gateway to permanent tattoos?
- Well, I.
- I'll take this one. Come on, Allison.
You take the kids to the street fair,
you don't care when they get their faces
painted there. You don't think that's a
gateway to permanent clownhood, do you?
I'm sorry. I was just trying to kill
some time between dinner and school.
Yeah, that's it.
Fine, really. But
you know, a trip to the library
wouldn't have been a bad idea, so...
Yeah. That's great.
And then the kids could have looked up
a bunch of words like passive
and aggressive.
I'm just socking off the floor.
Time to move it along, show's over.
I'll talk to you later, OK?
What are you doing?
Why are you so afraid
of letting me talk to her?
I'm not afraid of you talking to her.
I'm afraid of you unhinging your Jaw
and swallowing her whole.
I'm just trying to find out something
about this woman who
spend so much time with our kids.
I mean, how do I know
she's not a bad influence?
She's a good influence.
She told me she was a good influence.
Or maybe she said she
was under the influence.
Come on, she's a good girl.
She's got great judgment.
Really? You know what, Gary?
I think there are, what,
4 billion men out there,
and she picked you. Now,
I don't know what the opposite
of winning the lottery is,
but damn, I think she got it.
She took the kids out for fun, Allison.
Is that OK?
You remember fun. It's part of your
axis of evil along with Joy
and laughter.

" Gary Breaks Up His Ex-Wife and Girlfriend "
Sub VO :
¤AkaZab¤  &  Gaillots
Subs-Addicts'
[Sub-Way.fr]
All right, guys, listen up.
We're playing Hanson's dry cleaning, OK?
They're faster than us.
They're taller than us.
And their uniforms are
beautifully pressed and starched,
but listen,
I think we can beat them, all right?
Good luck, coach.
Hey, Vanessa,
look, this gym has a strict rule.
You can't come out the court unless
you're wearing a super hot
- cheerleader uniform.
- Too bad. I left mine at home.
You really have a hot
cheerleader uniform?
- 2 minutes, coach. 2 minutes.
- What's with the shades?
Your sunglasses.
Why are you wearing sunglasses?
I'm just getting a lot
of glare off the court.
Hey, V.
Hi, Tom.
Did you color in that tattoo?
Yeah. I'm turning it into coral snake.
It's beautiful.
But also dangerous.
All the signs are there.
The sunglasses, the whistle.
I'm raising a small-town sheriff.
All right, team, bring it in.
We're gonna dominate on 3.
1, 2, 3, dominate! Yeah.
You know,
if we all say it together,
it sounds a lot scarier, OK?
Dad, our last coach said it isn't
about the number on the scoreboard.
- The numbe of friends you make.
- OK, girls,
i'm not gonna sugarcoat this.
Losers don't deserve friends.
Get out there and win, win!
Let's Go!
Check it out. Your ex-wife sitting
next to your girlfriend.
Oh, my gosh. That's awful.
Those 2 are not a good combination.
Yesterday, I had to get right
in between them when they were.
Hugging?
You were between them
when they were hugging?
Which way were you facing?
'cause I got to tell you, I'd be torn.
No. They were fighting yesterday.
They're hugging now.
But this is much worse,
this is way worse.
I gotta break this up.
I got earrings on your forward here,
coach. Jewelry is not regulation.
I thought studs were OK.
No studs, no hoops, no danglers.
Check your rule book.
I would check my rule
book except the referee spilled
his count chocula
all over it this morning.
Here, have a seat.
Here we go. All right, Dennis,
what are they doing now?
They're talking and they're laughing.
And they're totally looking right at me.
What's up, ladies?
Are you doing? They're not
looking at you. They're looking at me.
Why couldn't they be looking at me?
Hey, coach, we're waiting on you!
I've got earrings here.
I'm working on it.
Go ahead, sweetheart, you're OK.
You're a very handsome man, Dennis.
But I'm the only thing
they have in common?
The person that hates
me the most is talking
to the person that likes me the most.
I can't have that.
Allison has 4 quarters to tell
Vanessa every stupid thing I ever did,
every dumb thing I every said,
every stupid thing I ever tried to eat.
Dude, you're right. The worst thing is,
if they keep talking,
sooner or later conversation's
bound to get around to your junk.
Too late.
The game's changed
a lot since I was a kid.
You played basketball?
Point guard.
I was lethal at the top of the key.
I could drain it from the corner,
I could dish it from the paint.
I was unstoppable.
Hey, Vanessa, you have to finish
telling me that lake havasu story.
Right. So,
all 6 girls are skinny-dipping,
and nobody rembers to turn off the boat.
Oh, my god. So it's what?
Like, the entire boat just drove away?
Yeah! And an hour later,
a couple of high school boys pull up
in a fishing boat and they
drive us back to the shore very slowly.
You know, when I was in the sorority,
we all went skinny-dipping once.
I mean, I left my bra and underwear on,
but it was very exhilarating.
What's going on?
What are you guys doing?
Vanessa, was just telling me this
really funny story about lake havasu.
That story.
I love that story.
All the kids are very thirsty outside.
Can you please bring them some juice?
That's good.
We got to keep them hydrated.
Go ahead, right out there.
When I get back, i'll tell you
my cabo story. It's insane.
That cabo story.
- What the heck are you doing?
- What? What do you mean?
Why try to be friends
with my girlfriend?
You wouldn't tell me anything about her,
so I had to find out for myself.
And you'll be happy
to know I think she's great.
She sort of reminds me of me.
In what alternate universe?
In the same universe where a girl like
that is attracted to a guy like you.
Gary, I just think she's lovely,
all right?
Good. Then you guys can go back
to arguing about tattoos, then, OK?
Gary, please,
they're henna, they'll wash off.
- Fluids are replaced.
- Sunblock. Girls need sunblock.
I told their parents they couldn't
go back old and leathery.
That's good.
Thanks a lot.
This is a good thing. I like Vanessa.
I could even see hanging out with her.
You cannot hang out with her.
You can maybe talk to her.
You can appreciate her.
You can be jealous that
your scales aren't
as soft as her skin. But...
you cannot hang out with her.
What would possibly wrong with your
girlfriend getting along with ex-wife?
How would you like it if I hung
out with your fiance all the time?
Hey, what's up?
You want to hang out sometime?
- No, thank you.
- What?
Why not?
I say this at the risk of sounding
superior, but you're beneath me.
Vanessa, where did you say
you got that belt again?
Stella on melrose.
You know? I have something I need
to return there. Do you want go with me?
No, Allison does
not want to go with you.
- Gary, yes, I would love to go.
- No, actually, she doesn't.
She changed her mind. She told me
she doesn't want to go out with you.
- I would.
- Would not.
She's trying to say she would not. She
doesn't want to spend time with you.
Here's the thing, you guys. You two
shopping together, I got to be honest.
I don't think that's
something I would enjoy.
So Vanessa, what time are you thinking?
No, Vanessa. Don't fall for it, OK?
She's not trying to be your friend.
She's just
seeing if you're
a good influence on our kid.
Of course that's what she's doing.
I'm a mom.
I get it. She's checking
out the new girlfriend.
- We're just going shopping, Gary.
- No, you're not.
No. You know what? I'm putting my foot
down. Look, that's my foot. Foot down.
I am forbidding you guys
from spending time together.
Excuse me.
Did you just say forbidding?
Yes. Forbidding. I'm forbidding
you guys from going out together.
- Forget it.
- Really?
Really.
Allison, how about we leave
as so as we're done here?
- She can't. She's forbidden.
- You know what?
I would love to,
and there's a SPA near there.
- Is it a forbidden SPA?
- We could both get massages.
No, you can't.
I could probably use massage.
My boyfriend's been stressing me lately.
You're forbidden.
Then we can go get drinks afterwards.
You know, maybe flirt with some guys.
That's great.
You're both forbidden!
I'm telling you what to do.
The man of the house has spoken!
My goodness.
Why are you so tense?
This was kind of a last-minute thing,
and I forgot to shave my legs.
Let me know if the pressure is OK.
Just relax and remember to breathe.
Is everything OK?
Everything is fine.
Everything is nice.
Is the pressure OK?
Oh, good. That's great, thank you.
I notice you wear a wedding ring.
You married?
Engaged, actually.
But I used to be married.
Your ex-husband, what's the matter?
You could not please him? What?
I mean, maybe your...
your ex-husband, he was not pleasing?
Not pleasing enough for me
to stay married to him. I'll say!
You know what? That pressure's
getting a little tough there.
What could you tell somebody
about your ex-husband
if you had a new friend,
maybe a new friend like me?
Well, I'm kind of mad at him right now.
But I guess I'd say he was bossy,
paranoid, and selfish.
He's selfish? Yeah, selfish.
Even though he offered
to make love to you every night
of the week even when you wore your
retainer and had on your granny pants?
- Selfish my ass...
- What? My God, Gary.
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?
I wanted to see if you were gonna
talk smack about me and you did.
You're crazy!
You badmouthed me to the massage
therapist, a complete stranger.
I can only imagine what kind of
things you're saying to my girlfriend.
- Get out of here.
- Look, come on.
I have a clean slate with Vanessa.
I don't want you filling her head with
all the bad things you know about me.
I will say whatever I want to say,
and you know what?
Maybe I will start by telling her
that you interrupted my $160 massage.
You're still mad about that?
Oh, my gosh.
I'm not leaving here until you promise
to just stay out of my relationship.
Me? You're the one who messed
things up with your ike turner speech.
"I forbid you, woman!"
My god, we're having a good time.
I like Vanessa
She brings out my fun side.
If you have a fun side,
I have a ballroom dancing side, OK?
- Is there a problem in here?
- Yeah, this man touched my naked body.
Yeah, but that wasn't fun for me either.
You have to come with us.
All right,
I don't want to have to do this, fellas
but I'm officer brooks, vice.
I'd like to speak to the owner.
- I am the owner.
- In that case these are for you.
Excuse me.
Where have you been?
Sorry, Pop.
The plymouth got a flat on
the way home from the record store.
We had to hitch it the whole way back.
What's going on with you, Tom?
- Sit down.
- I'm sitting down. Relax.
What did you say
To Vanessa at the party?
She walked away, she looked upset.
She didn't me even say good-bye.
- Well, I.
- You know, I don't want to hear it.
I just want you to fix it,
and I want you to fix it now.
You're pretty upset about this,
aren't you?
I am because I like Vanessa,
and if you're not seeing her,
I'm not seeing her, you follow?
OK, let me explain
it to you this way, OK?
Let's say you go to a new school, OK?
And you like the new teacher,
but there's an old teacher
from the old school that knows
all the bad stuff about you.
I get it, dad.
You're afraid mom's gonna
tell Vanessa bad stuff about you.
Well, I don't know how you
made that leap in your mind, but.
You know what?
I am losing patience.
But in that scenario,
I would go to my new teacher
and tell her all the stuff I was afraid
she was gonna hear from the old teacher.
You want me to tell
Vanessa all the things
I'm afraid your mom's
gonna tell her about me?
At least she'll be hearing it from you.
All right, thanks.
You're a good man, Tommy.
You've turned into a fine young man.
Thanks, dad.
But the onething you have to
remember about women is,
they don't usually
have a lot of faith in us.
Yeah. Hey, hey.
Hand it over.
You know, one day, I'm gonna
take one of those.
Hey, want to hear something
that will really get you mad?
I'm gonna taste them both right now.
- I got to see Vanessa.
- There's a band.
- $5.00 cover.
- Fine.
Here's your $5.00.
No. The name of the band is $5.00 cover.
It's 10 to get in.
Fine. $10.
Let me in.
I went to stunt man school.
Excuse me?
In 1993 for 3 weeks
I went to stuntman school.
It cost me $12,000,
and on the second day,
I sprained my ankle on my way
to falling out of a building class.
I'm a sore loser.
I hold a grudge.
I'm very impatient.
So much so that I'll flush
the toilet before
I'm even finished peeing.
What are you doing?
I'm telling you all
the bad things about me before
Allison has a chance to do it.
I just wanted to beat her to the punch.
So you think that if Allison tells me
that you flunked out of stuntman school,
I'm gonna break up with you?
Well, no. I didn't flunk
out of stuntman school.
I tripped over uneven pavement,
and then I quit the next day.
Thank you.
Gary, why don't you trust
me to make up my own mind about you?
I never expected you to be perfect.
Or anything close to perfect.
Well, in that case,
And you don't have to worry so much
about Allison because you'll be able
to hold this night over her
head for a very long, long time.
Why? What do you mean?
What's going on?
Wait. Where'd she go?
She was just here.
Hey, Vanessa,
she tried to sneak out again.
Oh, my god, that's Allison.
Every time I walk outside,
I end up right back here.
Hey, it's my guys!
My guys!
2 drinks.
Amazing.
Hey, get these guys a drink.
Because this lady right here,
this lady's like the coolest
lady in the whole world.
And this unattractive
lady is my ex-husband.
I am so happy right now.
OK, I'm gonna need you to
support her while I get the door, OK?
Whoa! She's 100 pounds
of jell-o shots right now.
Oh, you're so super sweet.
I totally weigh more than 100 pounds.
Watch out. She's a kisser
when she's drunk. She kisses.
I already got a mouthful on the way out.
I never kissed a black man before,
but I will again.
Yeah. Put her in the seat, OK?
Careful.
All right, would you do me a favor
and go upstairs and get some aspirin,
some B-12,
and get her cowboy sweatshirt.
- When she's drunk, she gets cold.
- Sure.
I'm so hungry.
You know what?
I'm gonna make a bundt cake.
Sorry I acted so crazy today.
I was just so afraid that
Allison was gonna say something
to you that would chang
the way that you looked at me.
Right now I'm looking
at a man who's generous enough
to help a woman who drives him crazy
99% of the time.
I think it's sweet.
Hey, you know what else is good?
Cinnabun.
You go get it.
I'm gonna wait right here.
Let me, let me put you to bed.
Now, Allison, let me come on.
All right.
Let me just lay here.
Can I lay here? Just let me lay here.
It's so cool.
I love marble.
You know, I wanted spanish tile,
but you said marble, Gary.
You are so smart.
You are so smart.
It's hard being smart, isn't it?
I'm always the smart one,
Gary, and you're always the fun one.
And I used to be fun like Vanessa,
but then I met you.
And you outfunned
me and I just got boring.
I didn't out fun you. It's just...
You married an immature Jerk,
and somebody had to step
up and act like a grownup.
I used to love that immature Jerk.
Don't talk about him like that.
It's a deal.
But you take it easy on yourself, OK,
because you were a lot of things,
but you were never boring.
I would kiss you right now
if I hadn't just thrown up in my mouth.
All right, ladies, let's go get 'em.
Let's go, go!
All right!
- Hey, Ref, what's up?
- You and Vanessa work things out?
Yes, we did.
Thank you for your advice, OK?
You be good to her.
Hey, look what the cat dragged in!
How you feeling, Allison?
Looks like Vanessa really
did bring out your fun side.
Well, if by fun side
you mean my insides, then yes.
Yes, she did.
Let's play some hoops, ladies.
Hey, you know what?
I bought these in bulk, so.
Team Subs-Addicts'
- Quoi ?
- C'est bizarre d'avoir des seins ?
J'en étais sûr. Tu t'en sers
pour faire le bien ou le mal ?
- Un pour chaque.
- D'accord.
Je t'ai dit que mon ex veut
acheter une motocross à notre fils ?
C'est génial...
... ment nul.
Une idée génialement nulle.
Ronnie veut que notre fils
fasse tous ces trucs dangereux,
comme du kickboxing,
et lui donner un bébé-pistolet
et sortir voir une comédie musicale.
Une comédie musicale,
c'est pas dangereux.
Ça me fait quand même peur.
Je suis désolé que ton ex-mari
t'embête. Il me dérange aussi.
Tu sais quoi ?
Pour lui montrer, on devrait regarder
le reste du match les fesses à l'air.
Enlevons nos vêtements,
et on va lui montrer.
Je dois y aller.
Ma meilleure amie Stéphanie
a eu son diplôme d'esthéticienne, alors
la bande se réunit ce soir, à mon bar.
- Une soirée entre filles ?
- Non, les mecs seront là aussi.
Snake et Dunker, et Hammer et Dave.
Dave ?
C'est quoi ce prénom ?
Je t'aurais invité, mais
j'ai envie que tu les rencontres
un par un, parce qu'ils sont
un peu durs en groupe.
Pas de problèmes.
Et ils me protègent beaucoup
depuis que j'ai divorcé de Ronnie.
Bien sûr.
- Et dès que quelqu'un de nouveau...
- Je veux pas y aller.
J'irais bien,
mais j'ai plein de choses à faire ici.
Tu vas rester ici, à réfléchir
à ce que ça fait d'avoir des seins ?
Oui, c'est ça.
Je m'en sers pour faire le mal.

- Voilà les enfants, pile à l'heure.
- Salut, c'était comment chez papa ?
Horrible.
Il nous a fait manger sainement.
- Quoi ?
- Et il nous a obligés à faire du sport.
Et la seule chose qu'il nous a laissé
regarder à la télé était violente.
Non violent !
À quoi ça sert de répéter
sur le chemin
si tu te plantes en arrivant ?
Rangez vos affaires et lavez-vous
du week-end avec votre père.
Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ici ?
Apéritifs. Fleurs.
Mon Dieu, Krandall est mort ?
Je suis vivant, Gary.
Grâce à mes gènes scandinaves
et un régime riche en Omega 3.
Omega 3 ? Apparemment, Krandall
fréquente les filles des sororités*.
C'est du poulet cru, Gary.
Alors, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Walter et moi donnons
une petite fête, ce soir
pour célébrer son super nouveau livre,
"Le deuxième round de votre vie."
C'est une méthode pour apprendre à avoir
de nouvelles relations après un divorce.
Ça a l'air génial.
J'ai hâte de ne pas le lire.
Tu devrais le lire, en fait.
Tu pourras toujours prendre
de l'aspirine pour ton mal de tête.
Il y a tout un chapitre sur l'importance
d'être accepté par le cercle social
de ton nouveau partenaire.
Alors ce soir, on fête mon livre
et je présente Allison
- à mes plus vieux et plus chers amis.
- Vieux, chers ! C'est super.
On dirait
une réunion de ceux qui restent.
Vous êtes aussi marrant quand vous
peignez des murs de plusieurs couleurs ?
Mes amis vont t'adorer, ma mangue.
Merci, myrtille.
Alors, tu vas rencontrer
la bande des myrtilles ce soir ?
Tu sais, rencontrer ses amis
est un moment très important
de ma relation avec Walter.
Je pense que t'es juste jaloux
parce que ta relation
avec Vanessa est pas
aussi avancée que la mienne.
Laisse-moi te dire un truc. Ma relation
botte les fesses de la tienne.
Ah bon ? As-tu déjà rencontré
les amis de Vanessa ?
- Oui. Bien sûr que oui.
- Vraiment. Je crois pas.
- Mais si.
- Vraiment ?
- OK comment ils s'appellent ?
- Qui, ses amis ?
Ses amis sont Monica*, Chandler...
- Joey. Il est faible, mais sympa.
- Pauvre Gary.
Je suis désolé que Vanessa
ne t'ait présenté aucun de ses amis.
Tu sais, peut-être
qu'elle attend qu'une de ses amies
ait un copain pire que toi.
Elle m'a dit que ses amis
étaient assez protecteurs
depuis son divorce,
alors on y va doucement.
C'est exactement ce que je dirais
si je voulais pas que tu les rencontres.
Mais après elle a dit,
"pourquoi tu viens pas
au bar avec nous ce soir ?"
- Vraiment ?
- Je vais faire ça.
Où tu vas ? Au Central Perk* ?
Non, c'est dans un bar et tous ses amis
y seront parce qu'une de ses amies
les plus proches
a eu son diplôme d'esthéticienne.
J'espère que ça se passera mieux
que quand t'as rencontré mes amis.
Tu t'en souviens ?
Tu t'es ridiculisé.
Tu as couru aux toilettes,
escaladé la fenêtre et tu t'es enfui.
Je me suis pas enfui.
La porte était coincée.
J'ai dû sortir par la fenêtre, OK ?
Et une fois dehors,
j'ai choisi de rentrer.
Bien sûr, Gary.
Passe un bon moment gay,
à l'ancienne, ce soir.
Si tu te perds dans la conversation,
parle de ta dernière tomate.
J'adore les tomates.
Crues, cuites, grillées, séchées,
juteuses, ou farcies au crabe.
J'adore le crabe.
À Stephanie, pour avoir enfin réussi
les 6 mois d'école d'esthéticienne.
Plus aucun d'entre nous n'aura à payer
pour se faire des mèches.
Il y a un coiffeur par ici ?
J'ai besoin d'une coupe en urgence.
Une permanente.
Quelle surprise !
Je m'attendais pas à te voir.
Ouais, comment ça va ?
Je passais juste
dans le quartier
pour vous faire un coucou.
Qu'est-ce qui va pas chez lui ?
Tout le monde, c'est le mec
que je vois, Gary. Gary, ce sont...
Attends. Laisse-moi deviner.
Une seconde, c'est...
Dunker.
Ça, c'est Dave et là, Stéphanie.
- En fait, je suis Dave, voici Dunker.
- Et je suis Stéphanie.
Pourquoi ne pas changer de places ?
Comme ça j'aurais raison.
Je reviens dans un instant.
Je pensais que tu voulais pas
les rencontrer.
T'as dit qu'ils étaient assez durs.
Pourquoi pas venir,
pour faire leur connaissance ?
Tout le monde m'aime.
Relax.
J'aurais aimé que tu me préviennes,
- j'aurais pu les museler.
- Je serai très sage.
Je leur laisserai me sentir la main.
Ça ira bien. Je te le promets.
Vanessa, la fête privée à l'étage
veut voir un responsable.
Mais je travaille pas ce soir.
Ed peut pas s'en occuper ?
Ed est au boulot de sa copine,
pour rencontrer ses amis.
C'est une étape importante
dans une relation.
Ça prendra qu'une minute.
Tu veux venir ?
C'est bon, je vais rester
à papoter avec tes potos.
Bonne chance,
mais ne dis pas "papoter" ou "potos".
Très bien.
Elle est géniale.
Mais vous le savez déjà,
parce que vous êtes "la bande".
Et tu es le fameux Gary
qui a peint son appart.
C'est ça.
C'est une histoire plutôt drôle.
Je peignais un appart dans son immeuble.
Elle en cherchait justement un.
J'étais disponible.
C'est comme ça qu'on s'est rencontré.
En quoi c'est drôle ?
Ça l'est pas, en fait.
J'aurais dû dire
que c'était une histoire vraie.
Sauf que rien ne nous fait
penser le contraire.
J'aurais juste dû dire une histoire.
Alors, Stephanie, la diplômée.
Félicitations ! C'est génial.
Tu n'as pas du tout l'air
d'une coiffeuse
- stéréotypée.
- C'est à dire ?
Tu vois, la coiffeuse stéréotypée...
les ragots, le chewing-gum.
"Mon Dieu ! Et après elle a, genre,
carrément couché avec Tucker."
Vous voyez pas ?
Elles ont trop de maquillage,
- les ongles longs.
- Comme ça ?
Plus long.
Genre, livre Guinness des records.
Je vais au bar. Vous voulez quelque
chose pendant que je suis debout ?
Parce que je suis debout
et que vous ne...
me regardez même pas.
Tout le monde mate son portable.
Parfait. Vous êtes sous mon contrôle.
Barman, je peux avoir
une bière, une grande ?
Et prenez le tire-bouchon
pour me poignarder.
Dure soirée ?
On peut dire ça. Je rencontre les amis
de ma copine pour la première fois.
Il vous manque plus que le dentiste
pour que votre journée se finisse bien.
- Vous êtes divorcé depuis quand ?
- 6 mois. Ça se voit tant que ça ?
Plutôt. Je suis passé par là.
Ça s'arrête un jour ?
Comment dire... ?
Vanessa dit qu'elle arrive bientôt.
Et elle dit de pas rajouter
"issime" à quoi que ce soit.
- Vous connaissez Vanessa ?
- Oui,
c'est ma nouvelle copine.
Vous êtes un de ses amis ?
- Je suis Mitch.
- Salut Mitch, moi c'est Gary.
J'ai rencontré Vanessa
en peignant un appart dans son immeuble
et ensuite j'ai peint le sien.
Voilà comment on s'est rencontré.
- C'est drôle.
- C'est vrai, hein ?
- Les premiers invités arrivent.
- OK, encore quelques secondes.
J'ai pas fini de griller le sésame,
et si tu les cuis ne serait-ce
qu'une seconde de trop... merde !
Tu n'as pas fini ta phrase. Qu'est-ce
qui se passe si ça cuit trop longtemps ?
Chéri, donne-moi juste 3 minutes, OK ?
Tu cuisines depuis tôt ce matin.
- Est-ce que ce sésame est nécessaire ?
- Tu sais quoi ? Non.
Des brochettes de poulet sésame
sans sésame ?
On a même pas besoin de brochettes.
Tu sais quoi ?
On devrait lancer le poulet
sur nos invités quand ils entrent.
Merde ! Walter !
Je suis ravi que tu sois si excitée,
mais je veux être sûr
que tu te relaxes et t'amuses.
Me relaxer et m'amuser ?
Pourquoi tu me dis ça ?
Désolé. Des fois, ça sort tout seul.
Je peux pas me détendre, là.
J'ai juste...
Tu sais depuis quand j'attends
de faire partie d'un groupe comme ça ?
Des gens éduqués, intelligents,
qui voyagent, qui lisent des livres
et qui ne cite pas
"Le Golf en folie"* tous les jours.
Je suis désolé. J'aurais dû comprendre
combien c'était important pour toi.
Mais je t'assure,
cette soirée va être magnifique.
Et qui est l'auteur du "Golf en folie" ?
Ça vaut le coup de le lire ?
Comme je t'aime.
Merde.
On dirait que t'es déjà
remonté en selle.
Tu rencontres déjà les amis de Vanessa.
J'ai pas grand-chose en commun avec eux.
Je veux dire, Dunker et Hammer
et Snoopy... Je sais pas.
Oui, c'est une équipe bizarre.
Tu penses quoi de Stéphanie ?
J'aime ses ongles. Mais je pourrais
me passer de son attitude.
- Stéphanie est un peu un cauchemar.
- Je suis assez d'accord avec toi.
- Alors quand as-tu rencontré Vanessa ?
- Un mois après mon divorce.
T'as pas perdu de temps.
Je suis sûrement allé trop vite.
Je devrais m'amuser, mais c'est Vanessa.
Elle est super sexy.
Oui.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
- Je parle à ton ami Mitch.
Ce mec est terrible.
Je croyais t'avoir dit
de me prévenir si tu venais ici.
Je peux venir ici quand je veux,
c'est un lieu public.
N'est-ce pas, Gary ?
- Je sais pas. Qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
- Qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
C'est mon ex-mari.
Quoi ?!
C'est Ronnie ?
Il m'a dit qu'il s'appelait Mitch.
Ronnie Mitchell.
Mas amis m'appellent Mitch.
C'est perturbant.
Pourquoi tu parles à mon ex-mari ?
Je savais pas que c'était Ronnie.
Il m'a dit s'appeler Mitch.
Je lui aurais pas parlé s'il m'avait dit
qu'il s'appelait Ronnie.
J'admets ne pas avoir été clair
là dessus.
Tu penses que c'est un mec bien ?
Non, mais c'est le premier ce soir
à me parler comme à un être humain.
- Gary déteste tes amis.
- Quoi ?
En particulier Stéphanie.
- Qui me déteste ?
- Gary.
Non.
- Il a dit que t'étais un cauchemar.
- T'as dit ça.
- T'étais d'accord.
- En quelque sorte.
Bon, Stéphanie, je suis sûre
qu'il n'a rien dit de tel.
- Qu'est ce qu'y a ?
- Il nous déteste.
- Il ne vous déteste pas.
- Il vous a appelé l'équipe bizarre.
Il se passe quoi ici ?
Je le dis en public.
Je ne l'aime pas.
- Moi non plus.
- Vous faites toujours ça, d'accord.
Gary est un mec bien. On peut pas faire
confiance à Ronnie, c'est un serpent.
Oui, merci, Vanessa.
Pourquoi tu demandes pas à ton mec bien
pourquoi il a dit qu'il s'était lancé
trop tôt dans cette relation.
Qu'il ferait mieux de s'amuser.
Embarrassant.
Très bien, il n'a pas dit ça.
Dis-leur.
Mec, c'est quoi ton problème ?
- T'as vraiment dit ça ?
- Sois honnête.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
- Ira, Dieu merci, tu es là.
- Je sais pas à quelle hauteur je suis.
- Je prendrais pas le risque.
- Je vais lâcher !
- J'arriverai jamais à temps.
Pourquoi t'as pas dit
qu'il y avait que 5 cm ?
Parce que j'ai pas souvent l'occasion
de rire quand je sors les poubelles.
Ils adorent les brochettes
de poulet au sésame.
Je sais. Tout se passe si bien,
On dirait que j'ai des rouges-gorges
et des écureuils qui chantent
et qui m'aident, tu vois ?
Tu sais, Cendrillon, engager des adultes
au smic est aussi une option.
Mon Dieu, ils boivent beaucoup.
C'est comme un "spring break"*
pour personnes âgées.
S'ils commencent à boire cul sec,
je démissionne.
Chéri.
Tu t'en sors si bien. Le Professeur
Meyers a besoin d'un autre Grasshopper*.
Je suis en plein rush, maman,
j'ai pas le temps pour les cocktails.
Allison, tout le monde passe
un merveilleux moment.
- Le repas est parfait.
- Je sais.
- La maison est magnifique.
- N'est-ce pas ?
Y a un petit truc, quand même.
Ça vaut pas trop la peine d'en parler.
C'est quoi ?
C'est Tom ?
Il n'a jamais fait le barman
pour tant de personnes.
Ce n'est pas ça.
Apparament, tu as dit à tout le monde
que mon livre est un pénultième livre
sur le divorce.
- Ça l'est.
- Je sais que tu
voulais être gentille, mais
pénultième ne veut pas dire meilleur.
- Ça veut dire avant avant-dernier.
- Quoi ?
- Oh non, ça peut pas vouloir dire ça.
- C'est une faute courante, vraiment.
Je l'entends tout le temps quand
je bosse dans les abris et les prisons.
Est-ce que ça va ?
J'ai dit "pénultième" toute la nuit.
Je l'ai dit pour Noël
et pour accoucher
et pour ma première année de lycée.
Maintenant ils pensent tous
que j'ai pas eu de diplôme !
- On fait tous des erreurs.
- Non, pas eux.
Les Drs et les avocats se trompent pas.
Juste ceux qui ont abandonné l'école.
Et moi.
Ceux qui ont abandonné et moi.
Ou je. Les deux sont acceptables.
Je sais pas pourquoi
j'ai pensé pouvoir faire ça.
Merci beaucoup, Allison. C'est de
ta faute et celle de son stupide livre,
vous avez tout détruit
entre moi et Vanessa !
Ah oui ? Eh bien, 15 ans passés
à vivre avec toi m'ont rendu débile.
Tout ça, c'est de ta faute !
- Il vient de se passer quoi ?
- J'espérais que vous pourriez le dire.
Je l'ai juste critiquée
sur un truc pas important.
Vous avez critiqué Allison
un soir comme ce soir ?
Hé, faites-vous une faveur.
Dormez que d'un œil.
Je le fais déjà, malheureusement.
C'est de famille.
Ouvre !
Je sais que t'es là !
Va-t-en !
Ne mets pas ta tête
dans le mini-four, OK ?
Je suis sérieuse. Si tu sais
ce qui est bon pour toi, reste pas là.
Si je le savais, je me serais pas
approché de ta culotte.
Ouvre, maintenant !
- Hors de question !
- D'accord, j'entre.
Hé ! Arrête ça !
Arrête de me jeter de la porcelaine !
Tu fais un mini bordel !
- Tu m'as rendu stupide, Gary !
- Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Toutes ces années passées avec toi
et les films de zombies et
les jeux vidéo et les films de zombie
basés sur des jeux vidéo.
Je ne t'ai pas rendu stupide,
mais tu m'as fait passer
pour un idiot
devant Vanessa et tous ses amis.
Son ex-mari m'a tendu un piège.
Attends. Pourquoi c'est de ma faute ça ?
Tu me fais toujours faire
des choses dont j'ai pas envie.
Que tu le saches ou pas,
tu me les fais faire.
T'es passé pour un idiot
devant ses amis, et alors ?
Je parie qu'aucun n'est un scientifique,
alors qu'il y en avait plusieurs
chez moi qui se moquaient de moi !
Pourquoi ?
J'ai mal employé le mot "pénultième"
toute la soirée.
Et pourquoi t'emploierais ce mot ?
Pourquoi t'as pas juste dit "meilleur"?
Tu vois, Gary ?
Tout est de ta faute !
Arrête de me frapper !
Qu'est-ce...
On vous entend de la maison.
J'entre par la fenêtre.
Je passe par la porte.
Vous devez arrêter de faire les enfants.
Elle m'a lancé des...
elle m'a lancé des assiettes !
Je lui avais dit de pas entrer !
Ça suffit ! Asseyez-vous !
Vous voyez pas ce qui passe, là ?
Dès que l'un d'entre vous a des soucis,
il va voir l'autre.
Non, c'est pas vrai.
Vous avez eu une soirée épouvantable,
et vous vous précipitez chez Allison.
Et tu cherches refuge à l'endroit
où tu sais qu'il viendra te chercher.
Ironiquement, la façon dont
vous vous soutenez maintenant
est la chose qui aurait pu
sauver votre mariage.
En tant que thérapiste,
j'aurais aimé le découvrir avant.
Mais en tant que fiancé d'Allison,
Gary, foutez le camp !
- J'en ai marre de tout ça !
- Du calme.
C'est comme si un de ces oiseaux géants
des marais nous hurlait dessus.
Je rentre à la maison.
Je veux que vous réfléchissiez
à ce que vous avez fait.
Et quand vous serez prêt à être
adulte, vous pourrez rentrer.
- Ton père a pété les plombs.
- Arrête.
Tu sais, faut que je te dise.
Dans cette petite maison,
tes seins ont l'air énorme.
Tu essayes de m'avoir.
Mais je t'en veux encore.
À l'intérieur, il y a une super fête.
T'as fait le repas.
Les gens sont contents.
La maison est superbe.
Personne ne se souviendra
que t'as mal employé le mot,
- je le sais.
- Comment ?
Comment je sais ? Ton barman se sert
de boîtes de Jelly pour faire des shots.
Ces gens sont bourrés.
Ils se souviendront de rien.
Mais moi... tu te rappelles
de tout ce que j'ai fait de mal.
Me dis pas que tu es
encore passé par la fenêtre.
Et si.
Tu crois que tu t'es engagé
trop tôt avec Krandall ?
Tu me demandes si je pense que
tu es allé trop vite avec Vanessa ?
Oui, mais je le fais de façon détournée
pour que tu croies que je parle de toi.
Eh bien, je ne crois pas
que ce soit le cas, mais
je savais ce que je cherchais.
Tu sais ce que tu cherches ?
C'est une grande question
pour une petite maison.
Quand tes amis ne m'ont pas aimé,
j'ai fait quoi pour arranger ça ?
Tu n'as rien eu à faire.
Je me moquais de ce que
mes amis pensaient de toi.
Merci.
Un toast pour toi...
La pénultième ex-femme.
Ça sonne comme si c'était bien, non ?
- Il y a "ième" dedans.
- Je sais.
Quelqu'un est allé te chercher
dans les toilettes, cabine par cabine.
Désolé, j'ai paniqué.
Je me suis senti pris au piège.
Je t'avais prévenu.
Mais si t'étais resté 5 minutes,
t'aurais vu tout le monde se mettre
contre Ronnie et demander après toi.
Vraiment ?
Je pensais bien que ça arriverait.
Je sentais que le courant passait
entre Dunker et moi.
Mais je t'ai posé une question au bar.
Tu crois qu'on est allé trop vite ?
Oui, je le crois.
Mais j'aurais pas voulu
que ça se passe autrement.
- Vraiment ?
- Vraiment.
- Tu veux pas aller t'amuser ?
- Pas sans toi.
Tu penses encore aux seins,
n'est-ce pas ?
J'ai pas à y penser.
Je les sens.

- What?
- Is it weird having boobs?
I figured. Do you use
your boobs for good or for evil?
- One for each.
- All right.
Did I tell you that my ex-husband
wants to buy our son a dirt bike?
Well, that's awesome.
... Ly bad. Awesomely bad idea.
Ronnie wants to have our son
do all of these dangerous things,
like take kickboxing
and get a BB gun
and go out for musical theater.
- Well, musical theater isn't dangerous.
- It still scares me.
Listen, I'm sorry your ex-husband
bothers you, OK? He upsets me, too.
You know what we should do?
Just to show him, we should watch
the rest of this game butt naked.
Come on,
let's take our clothes off,
and we'll show that guy.
All right, I gotta go.
My best friend Stephanie
is graduating from beauty school, so the
gang's getting together tonight my bar.
- Girl's night out?
- No, the guys will be there, too.
Snake and Dunker, and Hammer and Dave.
Dave?
What kind of a name is Dave?
I'd invite you to come along,
but I really kind of want you to meet
them one on one, 'cause they're
kind of tough in a crowd.
No worries.
And they're really protective of me
ever since Ronnie and I got a divorce.
Of course they are.
- And whenever anybody new wanders in...
- I don't want to go.
I mean, I would go, but there's
a lot of stuff for me to do here.
You're gonna sit around and think about
what it's like to have boobs.
Yes, I am.
I use mine for evil.

- Hey, here are the kids, right on time.
- Hey, guys! How was your dad's house?
Awful. Dad made us eat healthy.
- What?
- And he forced us to exercise.
And the only stuff he
let us watch on tv was violent.
Tommy, nonviolent.
What's the point of rehearsing
it on the whole drive over
here if you're gonna choke?
OK guys, go put your stuff away and wash
off the weekend you had with your dad.
What's going on here?
Tiny food. Flowers.
Oh my gosh, did Krandall die?
I'm alive and well, Gary.
Thanks to my Scandinavian genes
and a diet rich in omega 3S.
Omega 3S. Look at Krandall.
Seeing sority chicks on the side. Nice.
That's raw chicken, Gary.
So, what is going on here?
Walter and I are
having a little party tonight
to celebrate his brilliant new book.
It's called "round two of your life."
It's a how-to guide focusing
on new relationships after divorce.
Well, that sounds amazing.
I can't wait to not read it.
You know what, gary,
you actually should read it.
You can always take a couple of aspirins
afterwards for your thinkin'headache.
There a whole chapter on the importance
of being accepted into
your new partner's social circle.
So, tonight we're celebrating
my new book and introducing Allison
- to my oldest and dearest friends.
- Oldest and dear! That's great.
Sounds like a who's who of who's left.
Are you this funny when you're
making walls a different color?
My friends are gonna
adore you tonight, mango.
Thank you, cranberry.
So you're gonna meet all
of cranberry's posse tonight?
You know what, gary,
tonight meeting walter's friends
is a very important moment
in my relationship with walter.
I think you're just jealous
because your relationship
with Vanessa isn't as far along as mine.
Let me tell something. My relationship
kicks your relationship's ass.
Is that right?
You've already met Vanessa's friends?
- Yes I have. Of course I have.
- Really? I don't think so.
- I have. Really.
- Really?
- Fine what are their names?
- What her friends?
Her friends are Monica, Chandler...
- He's dim but likable.
- Poor Gary.
I'm so sorry that Vanessa hasn't
introduced you to any of her friends.
You know, maybe Vanessa's just
waiting for one of her girlfriends
to get a boyfriend who's worse than you.
For your information, she told me
that her friends are pretty protective
since her divorce,
so we're just taking it easy.
Yeah, that's exactly what I would say
if I didn't want my friends to meet you.
But then she went on to say,
"why you come hang
out with all my friends tonight?"
- Really?
- That's what I'm doing.
Where are you going? Central Perk?
No, it's at a bar, and all her friends
are gonna be there 'cause one of her
closest girlfriends graduated beauty
school. We're gonna have a big party.
I hope it goes better than
the first time you met my friends.
You remember that?
You completely embarrassed yourself.
You ran in the bathroom and climbed
out the window, and then you fled.
Yeah. I did not fled.
The door got stuck.
I had to go out the window. Right?
And then once I was outside,
I chose to go home.
Sure, Gary.
Hey, listen, have a ben gay
old time at your party tonight, OK.
If the conversation lags, just talk
about the last great tomato you had.
I love a good tomato.
Raw, cooked, grilled, sun-dried,
succulent, or stuffed with crabmeat.
I love crabmeat.
Here's to Stephanie
for finally making it through
all 6 months of beauty school.
Now none of us will ever
have to pay for highlights again.
Is there a barber in the house?
I got a hair emergency.
I need a perm.
What a surprise.
I wasn't expecting to see you.
Yeah, what's up? I was just in the'hood,
and I thought would holler "what's up"!
What is wrong with that man?
Everybody, this is the guy that
I've been seeing. Gary. Gary, this is...
No, hold on. Let me guess.
Let me guess. Hold on a second. That's,
Dunker.
That's Dave. That's Stephanie.
- Actually, I'm Dave. That's Dunker.
- And I'm Stephanie.
How about you guys all switch seats?
That way I'm still right.
I'll talk to you in a minute.
I thought that you didn't
want to meet my friends.
You said your friends were pretty rough.
I figured I'd come in,
just let'em get to know me.
Everybody likes me.
Relax. Everybody loves me!
I know. I just wish you would
have given me some warning
- so I could have put their muzzles on.
- I'll tell what. I'll be real still.
I'll let them sniff my hand first.
It'll be OK. I promise.
Vanessa, private party
upstairs wants to see a manager.
Yeah, but I'm not working tonight.
Can't ed take care of it?
Ed went to his girlfriend's
place of work to meet her friends.
It's a very important
step in a relationship.
This will only take a minute.
Do you want to come with me?
No, that's OK. I'll be down here,
and I'm gonna chill with your peeps.
Good luck,
but just don't say "chill" or "peeps".
All right.
She's pretty awesome.
But you guys already knew
that because you're the gang.
And you're the famous Gary
who painted Vanessa's condo.
That's right.
You know, this is a funny story.
I was painting a condo in her building.
She need a painter for her condo.
I was available. I wound up painting
her condo. That's how we met.
Why is that a funny story?
It's not, really.
You know what,
I probably should have said true story.
Yeah, but there's nothing
about it anyone would ever doubt.
I should have just said story.
So, Stephanie. Hey!
All right, the graduate.
Congrats! That's great. That's good.
You know, you don't look at all
like a stereotypical
- hair stylist at all.
- What does that mean?
You know,
the stereotypical hair stylist...
the gossiping, the gum chewing.
"Oh, my god! And then she totally,
like, slept with tucker."
You never heard them talk like that?
They got the crazy eye shadow,
- the big long nails.
- Like these?
Longer than that.
Like guinness book record long nails.
I'm gonna go into the bar.
Do you guys need anything while I'm up?
'cause I'm up,
and you guys are obviously not
even looking at me at all.
Everyone look down at their phones.
Perfect. You're all under my command.
Hey, Bartender,
can I get a beer, a tall one?
And then maybe take the corkscrew
and stab me in the face.
Rough night?
You could say that. Met my
girlfriend's friends for the first time.
Should do after this? Get a root canal
so you day ends on a positive note.
- How long you been divorced?
- 6 months. Is it that obvious?
Kind of. I was there a couple years ago.
Does it ever go away?
Well, here's the thing.
Vanessa said she's
gonna be a little while.
And said not to add the
word "Izzle" to anything.
- You know Vanessa?
- Yeah,
she's my new girlfriend.
Are you a friend of Vanessa's, too?
- I'm Mitch.
- Hey, Mitch. I'm Gary.
I met Vanessa. I was painting
her condo in her building,
and then she needed her condo painted,
so I did. That's how we met.
- That's a funny story.
- I know, right?
- The first guests have arrived.
- OK, I only need a couple more seconds.
I have to finish toasting
these sesame seeds,
and if you cook'em
for like a second too long. Crap!
You didn't finish sentence, dear. What
happens if you cook them for too long?
Walter, honey, I just need
3 more minutes, OK?
You've been working
since early this morning.
- Are these sesame seeds even necessary?
- You know what? No, Walter.
Sesame chicken skewers
don't need sesame.
In fact, why do we even need
the skewers? You know what we should do?
We should hurl a bunch of chicken at
our guests when they walk in the room.
Crap! Walter!
I'm thrilled that you're so excited
about this, but I want you to make sure
to relax and have fun.
Relax and have fun? Why the
hell would you say that to me?
I'm sorry. Sometimes I just spout off.
Walter, I can't relax now, OK? I just...
Do you know how long I've waited
to be part of a group like this?
I mean, educated, intelligent
people who travel and read books
and who don't quote
"caddyshack" on a daily basis.
I'm sorry. I should have understood
how important this is to you.
But I assure you,
the evening is gonna be beautiful.
And who's the author of this
"caddyshack"? Is it worth me reading?
God, do I love you.
Crap.
It looks like you're back on the horse?
I mean, you're already
meeting vanessa's friends.
I don't have a lot in common
with them, though. I mean,
Dunker and Hammer and Snoopy.
I don't know.
Yeah, they're kind of the odd squad.
What do you think of Stephanie?
I like her nails.
I could do without the attitude.
- Stephanie's kind of a nightmare.
- Yeah, I kind of agree with you.
- So when did you meet Vanessa?
- A month after my divorce.
You don't waste time.
No, you know,
I probably jumped in too fast.
I should be out there playing the field,
I mean it's Vanessa. She's super hot.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm talking to your friend Mitch.
This guy's awesome.
I thought I told you to let me know
if you were ever gonna be in here.
I can come in here anytime I want,
'cause it's open to the public.
Am I right, Gary?
- I yeah. I don't know. What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- This is my ex-husband.
- What?!
That's Ronnie?
He said his name was Mitch.
Ronnie Mitchell.
My friends call me Mitch.
Well, that's confusing.
Gary, why are you
talking to my ex-husband?
I didn't know that was Ronnie.
He told me his name was mitch.
I never would have talked to him if
he told me his name was really Ronnie.
I admit I was unclear on that point.
What, now you think
he's like a great guy?
No, but he's the first guy all night
to talk to me like I was a human being.
- Gary hates your friends.
- What?
Especially Stephanie.
- Who hates me?
- No, I don't.
- He said you were a nightmare.
- You said she was a nightmare.
- You agreed.
- I kind of agreed.
All right, Stephanie, I'm sure
that Gary didn't say anything like that.
- What's going on?
- Gary hates us.
- He does not hate you guys.
- He called you the odd squad.
- What's happening here?
- I'm going on record.
I don't like him. Me either.
- All right, you always do this.
Gary is a good guy. You can't
trust Ronnie. He's a total snake.
Yeah, thank you, Vanessa.
Why don't you ask your good
guy here why he said he rushed
into this relationship too soon.
He'd rather be playing the field.
Awkward.
All right, gary did not say that.
Gary, tell them.
Dude, what's your problem?
- Did you really say that?
- Did you, Be honest.
- What the hell you doing?
- Ira, thank god you're here.
- I can't tell how high up I am.
- I wouldn't risk it.
- I'm losing my grip!
- I'll never make it to you in time.
Why didn't you tell
me it was only 2 inches?
Because I rarely get to laugh
when I take out the trash.
They are loving the
sesame chicken skewers.
I know. Everything's going so well,
I feel like I should have bluebirds
and squirrels singing songs
and helping me out, you know?
You know, Cinderella, hiring adults
at a living wage is also an option.
God, they drink a lot.
It's like spring break
for all the old people out there.
If they start doing body shots, I quit.
Honey! You're doing such a great job.
Professor Meyers needs
another grasshopper.
I'm in the weeds here, mom.
I don't have time for blended drinks.
Allison, everyone is
having a wonderful time.
- The food is perfect.
- I know.
- The house is beautiful.
- Isn't it, though? Gosh.
There is one tiny thing, though.
It's barely worth mentioning.
What is it? Is it Tom?
Yeah, he's never bartended
for this many people before.
It's not that.
Apparently, you've been
telling everyone that
my book is a penultimate
book on divorce.
- It is.
- I know you mean
that in the nicest possibly way,
but penultimate doesn't mean best.
- It means second to last.
- What?
- God, no. It can't mean that.
- It's a common mistake, really.
I hear it all the time when I do
outreach work in shelters and jails.
Are you all right?
I've been using "penultimate" all night.
I said it about Christmas
and giving birth
and my freshman year of college. Now
they all think I didn't graduate! God!
- Allison, everyone makes mistakes.
- No, Walter, they don't.
Ph. D's and lawyers don't make mistakes.
Only high school dropouts and me.
And I. High school dropouts and I.
Or me. You know,
either is really acceptable.
I don't know why I thought
I could do this Walther.
Thanks a lot, Allison. It's all your
fault. And because of his stupid book,
you have wrecked everything
between me and Vanessa!
Yeah? Yeah? Well, 15 years
of living with you has made me dumb.
This whole thing is your fault!
- What the hell just happened?
- I was hoping you could tell me.
All I did was criticize
her on one minor thing.
You criticized Allison
on a night like tonight?
Hey, do yourself a favor, Pal.
Sleep with one eye open.
Sadly, I do. It's a family affliction.
- Open up! I know you're in there!
- Go away!
Look, don't stick your
head in the tiny oven, OK?
I'm serious Gary. If you know what's
good for you stay out of this house.
If I knew what was good for me,
I would have stayed out of your pants.
Now, open up!
- No way!
- All right, I'm coming in.
Hey! Quit it!
Stop throwing china at me!
You're making a tiny mess!
- You made me stupid, Gary!
- What does that even mean?
All those years of living
with you with the zombie movies
and the video games and the zombie
movies based on video games.
I did not make you stupid,
but you made me make a fool out
of myself in front of
vanessa and all her friends.
And her ex-husband ambushed me.
Hang on. Why is any of that my fault?
Because you always make me
do things I don't want to do.
Whether you know it or not,
you make me do it.
Big deal. You were an idiot
in front of Vanessa's friends.
I doubt any of them
were rocket scientists,
of which there are several
in my house right now laughing at me!
Why?
I used the word "penultimate"
wrong all night.
Why would you even use that word?
Why wouldn't you just say "best"?
Do you see, Gary?
This whole thing is your fault!
Gee, stop hitting me!
What is...
We can hear you inside the house.
I'm coming in the window.
I'm coming in the door.
You two have got to stop
acting like children.
She threw pla!
She threw plates at me, Krandall!
I told him not to come in!
Enough of this! Sit down!
Don't you see what's happening here?
Whenever either of you get into trouble,
you seek each other out.
No, we don't.
You had a disastrous evening,
and you raced to allison's house.
You sought refuge in the one place
you knew he would come and look for you.
Ironically,
the way you two lean on each other now
is the very thing
that would have saved your marriage.
As your therapist, I wish
I would have discovered it earlier.
But as Allison's fiance, Gary,
back the hell off!
- I'm getting kind of sick of this!
- Calm down, Krandall.
It's like being yelled at
by one of those giant dipping birds.
I'm going back in the house.
I want you two to sit here
and think about what you've done.
And when you're ready to start acting
like adults, you can come back inside.
- Your dad's really POD.
- Stop it.
You know, I gotta tell you.
In this tiny house,
your boobs look huge.
You're just trying to get on
my good side. I'm still mad at you.
Look, inside that house
there's a great party going on.
You made all the food. You made
people happy. The house looks fantastic.
Nobody's gonna rember
that you used a word wrong.
- I know.
- You know that?
How do I know that? Your bartender's
using Jelly Jars for shot glasses.
Those people are hammered. They're
not gonna remember anything. But me
you're gonna rember
everything I did wrong.
Don't tell me you
climbed out a window again.
Yes, I did.
Do you think you rushed into
things with krandall too soon?
Are you asking me if I think you
moved too quickly with Vanessa?
Yeah, but I'm doing it in a tricky way
where you think i'm talking about you.
Well, I don't think I did, but
I knew what I was looking for.
You know what you're looking for, Gary?
That's a big question
for a little house.
When your friends didn't like me,
what did I do to fix it?
You didn't have to do anything.
I didn't care what
my friends thought of you.
Thanks.
Here's a toast to you...
The penultimate ex-wife.
It sounds like it should be good, right?
- It's got "ultimate".
- Right in it.
We actually had somebody in the bathroom
searching for you stall to stall.
I'm sorry. I panicked. I felt like
I was being ambushed in there.
Well, I warned you.
But if you would have
stuck around for 5 minutes,
you would have seen everyone turn
on ronnie and ask what happened to you.
Really? You know,
I thought that might happen.
I thought dunker and
me kind of had a vibe going.
But I asked you a question in the bar.
Do you think that we jumped
into this too fast?
Yes, I do.
But hey,
I wouldn't want it any other way.
- Really?
- Really.
- Don't want to be playing the field?
- Not if you're not in it.
You're thinking about boobs again,
aren't you?
I don't have to think about'em.
I'm feeling'em.
Team Subs-Addicts"
OK, Walter.
Ton sac est prÍt pour la confťrence.
«a te dit d'ťcouter la blague d'intro
de mon discours sur la schizophrťnie ?
J'adorerais Áa ! Et puis non !
Et puis si ! Et puis non ! La ferme !
C'est mieux que ce que j'ai.
Salut. Je suis lŗ pour les enfants.
T'as fait ton sac. Il se passe quoi ?
Allison t'a virť pour quelqu'un
d'encore plus vieux ?
Je participe ŗ un sťminaire pour
les meilleurs thťrapeutes de couple.
Si vous Ítes tous lŗ-bas, qui sera ici
pour forcer les gens qui n'en ont
plus envie ŗ rester mariťs ?
Les enfants, papa est lŗ !
Mettez des mannequins dans vos lits
et la ventilation en marche.
Faudrait pas alerter le gardien.
Tu es sŻre que tu vas arriver
ŗ passer le week-end seul,
en particulier samedi ?
Bien sŻr, Walter.
Ne t'inquiŤte pas pour moi.
Le 17 n'est plus notre anniversaire
avec Gary. Juste un jour normal.
Ne t'inquiŤte pas si des sentiments
inattendus remontent ŗ la surface,
tu sais comme la colŤre,
la rancúur, la tristesse.
Je crois
que tu veux plutŰt dire la joie,
le soulagement, la libertť,
et un peu de Áa.
T'inquiŤte pas, Walter. Je vais rester ŗ
la maison, et oublier cet anniversaire.
Je vais me prťparer ŗ boire, et
ce petit roman trash
que je viens d'acheter,
Le secret de Nadia.
Tu devrais aussi allumer des bougies,
tu devrais
prendre un bain, et te faire du bien.
- Tu ne veux pas dire...
- Oh, si.
Il faut qu'Allison se rťapproprie le 17.
«a ne me surprendrait pas si Gary
ressentait certains
- de ces sentiments inattendus aussi.
- Tu plaisantes ?
Gary ne s'est pas souvenu une fois
de notre anniversaire en 15 ans.
Pourquoi il le ferait maintenant ?
Son subconscient pourrait le lui
rappeler. L'esprit humain est complexe.
L'esprit de Gary est alimentť
par un hamster dans une roue, alors...
Les enfants descendent dans une minute.
N'oublie pas qu'ils dorment
chez des amis le samedi 17.
Oui, je sais.
Tu me l'as dit samedi dernier, le 10.
Alors Gary, qu'est-ce que
tu vas faire ce samedi 17 ?
Pourquoi vous arrÍtez pas de parler de
ce samedi ? Vous voulez me cambrioler ?
Si c'est le cas, ce serait idiot
ťtant donnť tous les trucs bien
que je possťdais ici.
Louise, chťrie, si tu te sens pas bien
chez ton amie, appelle ton pŤre, OK ?
- OK, maman.
- Toi aussi, Tommy.
Vous savez, si vous Ítes saoul.
Je rigole. Appelez un taxi.

- Harris est dťmarquť !
- Ouais !
Tu le caches dans la poche,
et on fait sonner ta cloche, princesse.
J'ai vraiment de la chance.
J'ai une jolie petite amie qui m'amŤne
de la biŤre, et qui n'a pas peur
 de parler grossiŤrement de Brett Favre.
Je le dirais ŗ son visage mal rasť.
- Je suis fan des Dolphins, tu sais ?
- Je m'en souviens.
Tu sais, Allison et moi sommes allťs
ŗ un match des Dolphins en 1996.
Toi et Allison ?
On ťtait lŗ-bas parce que
sa grand-mŤre ťtait morte,
et Dieu merci,
le match s'est fini en mort subite.
Sinon on aurait
complŤtement oubliť l'enterrement.
Papa, on a faim.
Je vous ai pas dťjŗ nourri
deux fois aujourd'hui ?
Vous coŻtez cher
pour des animaux de compagnie.
Si personne n'a d'objections

Bonjour. Le palace Ming ?
Vous allez bien ? C'est Gary.
Oui. Merci beaucoup.
Nous sommes 4 ce soir.
Eh bien, ŗ tout ŗ l'heure.
- Tu vas devoir parler plus vite.
- Dťsolť, je me suis bloquť.
Et tu veux aller ŗ "Jeopardy"?
Comment est-ce que ce restaurant
sait exactement
quoi t'apporter, juste avec ton prťnom ?
Allison et moi commandions lŗ-bas
tout le temps.
J'ai un truc ŗ te dire.
C'est un petit truc, mais Áa
commence ŗ devenir un peu agaÁant.
Mon dieu. Pas une MST.
J'ai survťcu jusqu'ŗ presque 40 ans.
Tu dis tout le temps,
"Allison et moi".
Vraiment ?
Je devrais dire "Allison et je"?
Attention, attention !
Non. Tu parles constamment
de ton ex-femme.
C'est comme si elle faisait partie
de notre relation.
On ne fait que s'asseoir sur le canapť,
manger de la nourriture ŗ emporter,
et parler de chose
que toi et Allison faisiez.
C'est un gros manque de communication
parce que je croyais
que c'ťtait ce que tu voulais.
Je veux pas paraÓtre prťtentieuse,
mais regarde Áa, OK ?
Regarde Áa !
Des hommes se sont
littťralement battus pour Áa.
Des parfaits ťtrangers m'ont offert
ŗ boire, ŗ manger et des vÍtements.
Une fois un mec m'a offert une voiture
si j'arrosais son jardin
en maillot.
- Quel genre de voiture ?
- Ma jeep.
Allez, Gary ! Sors-moi.
Affiche-toi avec moi.
CommenÁons ŗ nous comporter
comme un vrai couple.
«a me dťrange de te le dire,
mais t'as g‚chť ma surprise.
- Quelle surprise ?
- La surprise du grand et beau dÓner
oý j'allais t'emmener demain soir.
Tu sais que t'as pas ŗ dire Áa
parce que j'en ai parlť.
Non, j'allais le faire.
Je te sors pour de vrai.
C'ťtait prťvu.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
OK. Donne-moi un indice ?
Non. J'arrive pas ŗ garder un secret,
mais j'espŤre que tu aimes manger.
Tu vois ? J'en ai dťjŗ trop dit.
C'est un endroit sympa ?
Un endroit nouveau ?
- Est-ce un endroit sympa et nouveau ?
- Oui, c'est sympa et nouveau,
et on ne dira pas le nom de la personne
qui se trouve Ítre mon ex-femme, OK ?
«a va Ítre vraiment gťnial !
Je sais dťjŗ ce que je vais me mettre.
Mais tu dois me promettre
que tu n'inventes pas tout Áa.
Je le jure sur la vie de mes enfants.
Les gars, faites vraiment attention
dans les prochains jours, OK ?
T'as encore jurť sur nos vies ?
J'en ai marre d'avancer dans la vie
sur la pointe des pieds !
Mon Dieu !
Fais comme chez toi, Dennis.
Dťsolť.
Y a rien ŗ manger chez moi.
- Ma femme a commencť un autre rťgime.
- Pourquoi t'as si faim alors ?
Eh bien hier soir ŗ 11 h 58,
elle s'est dťchainťe.
Elle a tout mangť dans la maison.
C'ťtait horrible ŗ voir.
Il y avait de la viande au plafond.
C'est horrible.
Le pire,
c'est que je ne retrouve pas mon chien.
Allo ? Bonjour, je suis bien au...
Comment on prononce le nom
de votre restaurant ? On dit Plah-tť?
Vraiment ?
C'est juste plate ?
Ce que avez trouvť de mieux,
c'est assiette ?
Eh bien, je voudrais faire
une rťservation pour 2 pour demain soir.
Vous Ítes complet ?
Je voulais dire que j'appelais
pour confirmer
une rťservation que j'ai dťjŗ faite
pour demain soir.
Oui, je pourrais vous dire mon nom
mais c'est plus marrant
si vous le devinez.
Oui. Allo ? Allo ?
«a fait 2H que je suis au tťlťphone.
Pas un restaurant de ce guide
n'a de la place pour samedi soir ?
- Pourquoi attendre le dernier moment ?
- J'ai oubliť comment faire Áa. Dennis.
Tu sais, je n'ai pas eu de rendez-vous
pendant 15 ans. J'ai plus l'habitude.
Le seul restaurant oý j'allais
ťtait chez Leo, avec Allison.
Hť. Je vais faire Áa. Je vais amener
Vanessa chez Leo. Ce sera super.
Ne l'amŤne pas chez Leo,
et c'est pas parce que
j'aime pas leurs restes.
Toi et Allison y avez mangť
au moins 100 fois.
C'est pour Áa que c'est parfait.
La nourriture est bonne, je les connais,
il n'y a pas de dame pipi,
on peut pisser gratuit. Ce sera super !
Et la derniŤre fois que j'y suis allť,
c'ťtait il y a longtemps.
C'ťtait la derniŤre fois qu'a eu lieu
notre anniversaire.
- Oh, mon Dieu !
- Quoi ?
J'avais complŤtement oubliť.
Je suis un imbťcile.
On doit aller chercher la peinture
pour ce boulot sur Arlington.
- T'as vraiment une bonne mťmoire.
- Merci, mon frŤre.
Allison n'a jamais pensť Áa.
Alors, ŗ toi. Le 17,
tu n'es plus un jour qui veut dire
quoi que ce soit pour moi.
ņ part en mars pour la Saint Patrick.
D'accord, c'est drŰle qu'avec des gens.
OK, Nadia.
Voyons voir quel est ton secret.
Allons-y.
"Au premier regard,
le manoir parut terne ŗ Nadia."
"Ce n'ťtait plus un garÁon d'ťcurie,
il ťtait devenu un bel homme fort."
"Des larmes ont ouvert son corsage."
"La virilitť vibrante."
"Tandis qu'il pleurait sur son corps."
Nom de Dieu !
Les problŤmes d'anxiťtť
peuvent se manifester diffťremment.
D'accord.
ņ qui est ce portable ?
Nous sommes trŤs clair.
Pas de portables ou de bipeurs.
On vous demande de les couper,
de ne pas les emmener...
Pardon. Je crois que c'est moi.
«a tombe bien.
J'allais justement parler
de l'anxiťtť post-divorce,
et ma fiancťe se bat contre
ces problŤmes au moment oý l'on parle.
Alors voyons voir
si elle veut participer
dans un but ťducatif.
- Comment Áa va ?
- Terriblement.
Avant de continuer,
il faut que je te dise...
J'ai allumť des bougies, pris un bain
me suis fait du bien.
Que tu es sur haut-parleur.
EnlŤve Áa !
Vous permettez ?
- Tu as l'air ťnervťe.
- Je sais pas quoi faire.
J'ai essayť d'enlever cet anniversaire
de ma tÍte et j'y arrive pas.
Si rester ŗ la maison te rend anxieuse,
sors de la maison,
fais-toi plaisir,
rťapproprie-toi cette date, Allison.
OK. Je pourrais sortir en ville ce soir.
Tu dois mettre le doigt
sur ton bouton du bonheur.
Bande d'animaux !
Je vais dire au maÓtre d'hŰtel
qu'on est lŗ.
Paulie.
Gary Brooks, oý ťtiez-vous passť ?
Comment va votre femme ?
C'est pas moi. Vous me connaissez pas.
Dťsolť, nous sommes complets.
Revenez un autre jour.
Non, faites juste semblant
de pas me connaitre,
faites semblant de m'avoir jamais vu,
vous comprenez ?
Je comprends.
Un petit extra.
Non, non. C'est pas un extra.
Qu'est-ce qui est pas un extra ?
Il n'y a pas de patates en extra,
d'accompagnement de patates.
On doit prendre du riz pilaf,
de la purťe,
des frites, trouvez-nous une place.
- Oui, votre table est juste lŗ.
- Merci, Paulie, Pally, Monsieur.
Ici.
Oý as-tu eu le verre de vin ?
Au bar, par le grand roi
de la TV de San Diego.
Le roi du grand ťcran,
et t'as eu qu'un verre de vin ?
"Cette carte est un bon
pour une grande tťlť"
Mon Dieu.
Cet endroit est si mignon.
Est-ce que Áa veut dire que Leo
sera "notre" restaurant ?
Oui, c'est le nŰtre.
Il nous reste plus qu'ŗ trouver
un oiseau, une fleur, et
un arbre et on pourra rťclamer
le statut d'ťtat.
Je peux Ítre ta premiŤre dame ?
Non, dťsolť,
mais tu seras toujours ma quatriŤme.
- Vraiment ?
- Quat... Eh bien, je suis un mec.
Je m'attends pas ŗ ce que tu comprennes
ce genre de nombre, mais oui.
Jusqu'ŗ prťsent notre premier
rendez-vous d'adulte se passe bien.
Oui, et comme promis je ne mentionnerais
pas Allison, ŗ part cette fois,
oý je l'ai mentionnť pour illustrer
le fait que je ne vais pas
dire Allison. «a fait deux. Dťsolť,
j'en ai fini avec les Allison.
3. Reprise. Allison. Voilŗ. 4. Dťsolť.
Quand je deviens nerveux, j'ai ce truc
qui me fait tout finir par des nombres
pairs. «a rendait Allison folle.
Punaise ! Allison.
6. C'est fini.
Bien.
Bien. Parce que ce soir,
il s'agit de Gary et de Vanessa.
Et de mon fils.
Pardon. Je lui avais dit que
je lui parlerais avant qu'il se couche.
- Tu m'excuses ?
- Bien sŻr.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
- Je suis ici avec Vanessa.
T'as amenť ta petite amie ici ?
ņ notre restaurant ?
- Pour notre anniversaire ?
- Pour notre quoi ?
On est le 17.
- C'est notre anniversaire.
- Oui, c'est notre anniv.
Je sais, car je t'ai achetť un cadeau
sur internet, et qu'il a pas encore
ťtť livrť, mais j'ai le numťro de suivi.
C'est 11.
On est pas mariť. T'as plus ŗ me mentir.
Je peux pas m'en empÍcher.
C'est comme un gag rťflexe.
Il faut que tu partes.
Il faut que tu partes, OK ?
Je ne vais pas partir. Tu pars.
Je peux pas partir. Je suis
avec Vanessa. Tu dois partir.
J'ai promis ŗ Vanessa qu'on aurait
une belle soirťe romantique ensemble
et que je ne parle pas de toi,
et Áa va Ítre difficile
avec un gros toi, assis juste lŗ.
Non, Gary. Je me rťapproprie
cette date dans notre restaurant,
- qui ťtait le mien d'ailleurs.
- Et si Vanessa te voit ?
Je lui ferais signe. Je l'aime bien.
Voilŗ le plan.
Il faut empÍcher celle qui est jolie
de voir celle en colŤre, vous suivez ?
- Emmenez-la par ici.
- OK.
- Salut. «a va ? Allons-y !
- Pourquoi ?
C'est juste que j'aimais pas la table,
et une autre s'est libťrťe.
Regarde celle-lŗ.
C'est encore mieux.
- C'est la table que tu voulais ?
- Oui.
- Elle est plutŰt grande.
- Je pensais qu'on
pourrait jouer au ping-pong,
si on s'ennuie. Assieds-toi.
Tu ne veux pas t'asseoir ici
pour pouvoir voir ce magnifique
tableau de Ralph Macchio ?
Je peux pas. Tu vois ton truc
avec les nombres pairs ?
Je peux pas m'asseoir dos ŗ une porte.
Pourquoi, ta famille est dans la mafia ?
Ne me pose jamais de questions
sur mes affaires.
Hť, regarde ! Ils ont du papier, et
dessus est ťcrit le menu.
Je suis dťjŗ allť au restaurant,
pas avec toi c'est tout.
Tu sais quoi ? Pour ne pas prendre...
une salade Cťsar ?
- Tu veux une salade Cťsar ?
- Je sais pas.
Moi aussi. Moi aussi. D'accord
ņ droite. Votre droite. Et voilŗ.
- Perfecto.
- Salade Cťsar pour deux ?
Ce serait charmant, et prenez votre
temps. On adore les grandes pompes.
Oý tu vas ?
Tu vas rater les grandes pompes.
Oui, je sais, mais j'ai laissť mon eau
sur l'autre table et j'ai dťjŗ pressť
le citron dedans,
et qui veut devoir se retaper Áa ?
Allison, s'il te plaÓt.
Il faut que tu partes.
Tu peux avoir les enfants un week-end.
Je les prendrais un week-end de plus.
Les enfants peuvent Ítre une monnaie
d'ťchange, si tu veux. Mais va-t-en !
Non. Je rťcupŤre mon restaurant.
C'est pas ton restaurant,
J'en ai marre que tu dises...
- Si Áa l'est !
- C'est ton restaurant. Non !
Le 31 mai 1992,
j'ťtais ici, je t'ai commandť un verre
et ma vie d'avant s'est terminťe, OK ?
Tu sais quoi ?
Je suis lŗ maintenant, et je vais
- aller regarder le charriot ŗ desserts.
- Non. Tu peux pas y aller, assis
s'il te plaÓt.
Quelqu'un va se marier ?
Pas nous. Non. «a non.
Hť, je viens. Oý est-elle ?
- Elle est allťe aux toilettes.
- Et vous l'avez laissťe ?
«a fait partie de notre politique.
Vous savez quoi ? «a va.
«a va me laisser du temps pour voir
ce que je vais faire d'Allison.
Est-elle allergique ŗ quelque chose,
fruits de mer, cacahuŤtes ?
- Le deuxiŤme, oui.
- CacahuŤtes ?
CacahuŤtes ? Non.
- Allison se dirige vers les toilettes.
- C'est bien.
«a me laisse du temps pour rťflťchir.
Qu'est-ce que vous venez de dire ?
- Vos deux rencarts sont aux toilettes.
- Doux Jťsus !
Par ici.
Pourquoi vous me lancez ce regard ?
Je vous ai tenu la porte.
Vous allez bien ?
Vous Ítes le numťro 34. 35 ?
Y a de la place pour une de plus.
- 35 ?
- Asseyez-vous.
«a y est.
Je suis fini. C'est terminť.
Alors, vous pensez
que la demoiselle va divorcer ?
Non, je suis divorcť, Paulie.
J'ai divorcť,
j'ťtais ici avec ma nouvelle petite
amie. Elle l'ťtait, il y a 2 minutes.
C'est votre petite amie ?
Pourquoi l'avez-vous amenťe ici ?
J'aurais pu vous envoyer chez Plate.
- Mon frŤre est le maÓtre d'hŰtel.
- Allons !
Hť ! Je...
- Je te dois des excuses.
- Pourquoi ?
Rien de bizarre
ne s'est passť aux toilettes ?
Rien d'inattendu.
Rien d'inhabituel
pendant que tu y ťtais ?
On devrait garder
un peu de romantisme, non ?
- Allons-nous-en d'ici, OK ?
- Quoi ?
Allons ailleurs.
C'est pas bien, j'aimerais t'emmener
dans un endroit
vraiment spťcial pour moi, OK ?
Le maÓtre d'hŰtel transpirait
devant la salade Cťsar.
J'ai complŤtement oubliť l'addition.
Je vais la payer, OK ?
- Besoin de monnaie pour le valet ?
- Tu es adorable.
C'est vrai. J'oubliais.
Les jolies filles ne payent pour rien.
Y a pas de quoi.
Tu lui as dit quelque chose ?
Je lui ai rien dit. J'ai vu ses pieds.
Pourquoi tu lui as rien dit ?
Je pensais que le but de ta vie
ťtait de me dťtruire.
C'est dťjŗ assez dur pour elle
en sortant avec toi, d'accord ?
Elle a pas besoin que j'en rajoute.
Et puis, j'ťtais...
un peu touchť que
tu te rappelles le 31 mai 1992.
Je n'oublierai jamais le 31 Mai 1992,
parce que j'ťtais lŗ,
et j'ai vu la plus belle femme
que j'ai jamais vue, passer ces portes.
Et tu es entrťe juste aprŤs elle.
- Bien sŻr.
- Non, Allison.
Tu ťtais pas mal, non plus.
Tes cheveux ŗ la Julia Roberts et
tes ťpaulettes ŗ la Demi Moore.
On jouait pas dans la mÍme catťgorie.
Peut-Ítre, mais je t'ai
complŤtement enlevť ton uniforme.
Merci de te rappeler de ce jour.
- C'est vraiment gentil.
- Bien sŻr. Le 31 mai.
- Comment pourrais-je oublier ?
- C'est quoi le lien avec le sport ?
L'anniversaire de Joe Namath.
J'ai essayť de rťserver
ŗ d'autres endroits, Plate,
Saucer, Bowl.
Ils ťtaient tous pleins.
Tu m'en veux ?
Que tu m'aies emmenť dans le restaurant
oý tu allais avec ton ex-femme
et qu'elle soit lŗ
et que ce soit votre anniversaire ?
C'est bon, alors ?
Je t'aime beaucoup,
mais tu n'es pas encore divorcť.
Oh que si.
La moitiť de mes affaires le prouve.
Non. Tu divorces.
Il y a une grosse diffťrence.
Tu es toujours liť ŗ Allison,
et tu ne seras pas prÍt
tant que tu y seras toujours liť.
Tu me jettes ?
Te jeter est une maniŤre dure
et dťsagrťable pour le dire,
mais peut-Ítre qu'on devrait ralentir,
voir d'autres gens.
- Tu dois aller explorer, mec.
- On peut rester amis ?
- Bien sŻr.
- Avec les avantages ?
Genre ? Mutuelle dentaire ?
On pourrait...
Prends ton taco, on s'en va.
- Partons.
- Nom de Dieu.
- C'est pas ce que tu crois. Dťsoler.
- T'as dis que c'ťtait notre endroit.
- Pas de filles.
- Je sais.
Je peux pas manger ici, ni chez moi,
je trouve pas mon chien...
Team Subs-Addicts"
All right, Walter.
You are all packed for your conference.
Care to hear my opening
joke for my talk on schizophrenia?
I would love to! No, I wouldn't! Yes,
I would! No, I wouldn't! Shut up!
That's better than what I have.
Hi, Allison. I'm here for the kids.
You packed a bag! What's the matter?
Allison dumped you
for someone even older?
I'm attending a seminar for
the top mariage therapists in the state.
Well, if you guys are all there,
who is gonna stay behind
and pump force people
that have no business staying married?
OK, kids! Your dad's here!
Put the wooden dummies of yourselves in
your bed and shimmy down the air ducts.
We don't want to alert the warden.
Allison, are you sure you're gonna be
all right spending this weekend alone,
specifically saturday?
Well, of course, Walter.
Don't, don't worry about me.
The 17th is no longer Gary's
and my anniversary. Just another day.
Don't be surprised if some unexpected
feelings bubble to the surface,
you know, Anger, resentment, sadness.
Yeah. I think you mean more like Joy,
relief, freedom,
and a little bit of this.
Don't worry, Walter.
I am going to stay home. I'm gonna
put this anniversary behind me.
I'm gonna fix myself a little drink, and
read this trashy little novel
I just bought, Nadia's secret."
You should also light some candles,
you should
Draw a Bath,
you should pleasure yourself.
- By that, you don't mean.
- Yes, I do.
The point is, you have
to reclaim the 17th for Allison.
I wouldn't be surprised
if Gary wasn't experiencing some
- of these unexpected feelings himself.
- What, are you kidding me? I mean,
Gary hasn't remembered
our anniversary once in 15 years.
Why, why the hell
would he rember it now?
His subconscious may remind him.
The human mind is complex.
Yeah? Well, the Gary mind is
powered by a hamster on a wheel, so...
All right.
The kids will be down in a minute.
Don't forget the kids each
have sleepovers on saturday, the 17th.
Yeah, I know.
You told me last saturday, the tenth.
So, Gary, what exactly are
you doing this saturday, the 17th?
Why do you guys keep asking me about
saturday? What, are you gonna Rob me?
If you are, it would be kind of silly
considering all the good stuff
I used to own is here.
Louise, honey, if you get homesick
at your sleepover, call your dad, OK?
- OK, mom.
- You, too, Tommy. Call me.
And, you know, if you get drunk.
Kidding. Call a cab. Let's go.

- Harris is open. Harris is open!
- Yeah! Yes!
You hide in the pocket,
you get your bell rung, princess.
I'm a pretty Lucky guy. I got beautiful
girlfriend that brings me cold beer,
and she isn't afraid to
talk smack about brett favre.
I'd say it to his unshaven face.
- I'm a dolphins girl, remember?
- I remember.
You know, once, Allison and I went
to a dolphins game in Miami in 1996.
You and Allison?
We were down there because
her grandmother passed away,
and thank god the game
went into sudden death.
Otherwise, we would have completely
forgotten about the funeral.
Hey, dad. We're hungry.
Didn't I feed you
guys twice already today?
You guys are expensive pets,
i'll tell you that.
Well, if anyone has any objections
to Chinese food,
is suggest you try to beat
the speed dial.
How about something healthy,
something like salad or fish or.
Hi. Ming Palace?
Hi. How are you? It's Gary.
Yes. Well, thank you very much.
There's 4 of us tonight.
Well, I'll see you when you get here.
- You got to learn to talk fasterlouise.
- Sorry. I froze.
And you want to be on "jeopardy"?
How does that restaurant
know exactly what
to bring you just by
hearing your first name?
Allison and I used to order
from here all the time.
OK. I have something to say.
It's a small thing, but it's
starting to get a little irritating.
Oh, my god. Please don't be an STD.
I've made it to almost 40.
You say, "Allison and i," all the time.
Really? Should it be "Allison and me"?
Look out, look out!
No. Gary, you talk about
your ex-wife constantly.
It's kind of like she's
a part of our relationship.
I mean, all we do, we sit on the couch,
and we eat takeout food,
and we talk about stuff
that you and Allison used to do.
Then this is a big miscommunication
because I kind of thought
that's what you wanted to do.
OK. I don't mean to sound conceited,
but look at this, OK?
Look at this!
All right. Men have literally
beaten up other men for this.
Complete strangers have bought
me food and clothes and drinks.
A guy once offered me a car
if I would run through his sprinklers
in my sundress.
- What kind of car?
- My jeep.
Come on, Gary! Take me out.
You know, just show me off.
Let's just start acting
like a real couple.
I hate to break it to you.
You kind of ruined the surprise.
- What surprise?
- The surprise of the big, fancy dinner
I was gonna take you to tomorrow night.
All right. You know, you don't have to
say that just because I brought it up.
No. I was going to.
I'm really taking you out to a place.
It's I've been planning on it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
OK. Can you give me a hint?
Well, I can't I'm terrible at keeping
secrets, but I hope you like food.
See? Look. I already said too much.
Is it a cool place?
Is it a new place?
- Is it a cool, new pace?
- It is both a cool and a new place, OK,
and we will not mention anyone's name
who happens to be my ex-wife, all right?
This is gonna be so great!
I already know what i'm gonna wear, OK?
You better promise me you're
not making this up, though.
I swear on my kids'lives.
Hey, guys. Be real careful
the next couple of days, OK?
Did you swear on our lives again?
I am tired of tiptoeing
through life, dad!
Gee whiz! Help yourself, Dennis.
I'm sorry.
There's no food at my house.
- My wife started another diet today.
- Then why are you so hungry?
Well, last night at 11:58,
she went on a rampage.
She ate everything in the house.
It was horrible to watch.
There was meat on the ceiling fan.
That's awful.
The worst part is, I can't find my dog.
Hello? Hi. Is this...
How do you pronounce the name
of your restaurant? Is it plah-tay?
Really?
It's just plate?
That's the best you guys
could come up with was plate?
Well, I would like a reservation
for two for tomorrow night.
You're all booked up?
OK. What I meant to say
was i'm calling to confirm
a reservation that I already
made for tomorrow night.
Yeah. Well, I could tell you my name,
but it's probably more
fun if you guess my name.
Yeah. Hello? Hello?
I've been on the phone for two hours.
Not one restaurant in this guide
can fit me in on a saturday night?
Why did you wait until the last minute?
I've forgotten how to do this, Dennis.
You know, I haven't
gone out on a date in 15 years.
I'm out of practice.
The only restaurant I ever
used to go to was leo's with Allison.
Hey. That's what i'll do. I'll bring
Vanessa to leo's. That will be great.
No. Don't take her to leo's,
man, and don't get me wrong.
I enjoyed their left overs.
You and Allison ate there,
like, 100 times.
I know. That's why it's perfect.
The food's good, I know the maitre D',
there's no bathroom attendant
so it's free to pee. It'll be great!
And the last time I was
at leo's was a long time ago.
It was, last time I was there
was mine and Allison's anniversary.
- Oh, my gosh!
- What?
I totally forgot.
I'm an idiot.
We got to pick up the paint
for that job on arlington.
- Man, you have a great memory.
- Thank you, brother.
You know, Allison never thought so.
OK. Here's to you. The 17th,
you are no longer a day
of any significance to me whatsoever.
Except in march when you're st.
Paddy's day, OK?
OK. That's only fun with other people.
All right, Nadia.
Let's see what your big
damn secret is all about.
Here we go.
"At first glance,
the manor house appeared drab to Nadia."
"No longer a stable boy, he
had grown into a strong, handsome man."
"Tears open her bodice."
"Pulsating manhood."
"As he wept over her dying body."
For god sakes!
Now anxiety issues come in many flavors.
All right.
Whose cell phone is that?
We're very clear.
No cell phones or pagers at all.
You're asked to mute them,
to not bring them int...
Sorry. I think that's me.
This is fortuitous.
I was just about to talk
about postdivorce anxiety,
and my fiancÉe is grappling
with these issues as we speak.
So let's see if she's up
for participating
for an educational purpose.
- Allison, how are you?
- I am horrible, Walter.
Before we carry on, I need to disclose.
I lit candles,
I ran a bath, I pleasured myself.
That you are on the speakerphone.
Walter, get me off.
Do you mind?
- Allison you sound troubled.
- Walter, I don't know what to do.
I've tried to put this anniversary
thing out of my head, and I can't.
If staying at home is causing you
anxiety, leave the house,
treat yourself,
reclaim this date for yourself, Allison.
OK. I guess I could take
myself out for a night on the town.
Yes. You've got the finger
on the button of your own happiness.
Pipe down, you animals!
I'm gonna tell the
maitre d'we're here, OK?
Paulie.
Gary brooks, where the hell
have you been? How's the wife?
No, it's not me. You don't know me.
Then I'm sorry. Were full.
Please try another night.
No, Paulie.
I mean, pretend you don't know me,
pretend I've never been here before,
you know what I mean?
I understand, Gary.
Getting a little something on the side.
No, no, no.
There's nothing on the side.
What's nothing on the side?
There's no baked potatoes on
the side, side orders of baked potato.
You have to get rice pilaf, mashed,
French fries, please seat us.
- Yes. Your table's right here.
- Thank you, Paulie. Pally, pal, sir.
Here. Have.
Where'd you get the glass of wine?
At the bar from the big
screen tv king of San Diego.
King of big screen,
and all you got was a glass of wine?
"This card good for one big screen Tv."
Oh, my god. This place is so sweet.
Does this mean that leo's
is gonna be our restaurant?
Yes, this is ours, OK?
Now all we have to do is get a bird,
a flower, and
a tree and we can apply for statehood.
Can I be your first lady?
No. I'm sorry,
but you'll always be my fourth.
- Really?
- Four well, I'm a guy.
I don't expect you to rack
up those kind of numbers, but, yeah.
So far, our first grownup
date is going very beautifully.
Yes, it is,
and as promised, not one mention
of Allison, except for that one,
which I mentioned only to illustrate
the point that I'm not gonna
say Allison. That's twice. I'm sorry,
but I'm done with the Allisons.
3. Darn. Allison. There. 4. I'm sorry.
When I get nervous, I have this thing
where I have to end everything with even
numbers. Used to make Allison crazy.
Damn it! Allison.
6. I'm done.
Good.
Good. Because tonight
is about Gary and Vanessa.
And my son.
I'm sorry. I told him that I would
talk to him before bed.
- Would you excuse me?
- Of course.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here with Vanessa on a date.
You brought your girlfriend here?
To our restaurant?
- On our anniversary?
- On our what now?
Gary, it's the 17th.
- It's our anniversary.
- Yes, it is. It's our anniversary.
I know because I got you a gift online,
and it's still being shipped,
but I have a tracking number. It's 11.
Gary, we're not married.
You don't have to lie anymore.
Sorry. I can't help it.
It's like a gag reflex. Listen.
You have to get out of here.
You have to go, OK?
- I am not gonna leave. You leave.
- No. I can't leave.
I'm here with Vanessa.
You have to leave.
I promised Vanessa we would have a nice,
romantic evening together
and I wouldn't mention you once,
and that's gonna be hard to do
to do with a big, fat you sitting here.
No, Gary. I am reclaiming this
date for myself in our restaurant,
- which used to be mine by the way.
- What if Vanessa sees you?
I'll wave. I like her.
Here's the plan.
We have to keep the pretty one
from seeing the angry one, you follow?
- Take her that way.
- I will.
- Hi. How are you? Let's go!
- What's wrong?
Nothing. I just didn't like our table,
and the one I wanted finally opened up.
Look at this one. This is even better.
- This is the table that you wanted?
- Yes, it is.
- It's kind of big.
- I thought maybe we could
play ping-pong later if things got dull.
Here. Have a seat.
Don't you want to sit here so you
can see this wonderful original
art by Ralph Macchio?
I can't. You know how you
have your thing with even numbers?
I can't sit with my back
facing towards the door.
Why not? What,
is your family in the Mafia?
Don't ever ask me about my business.
Hey, look! They have paper,
and on it they write what the food is.
I have been to a restaurant,
just not one with you.
You know what? Why don't we have a.
Why don't we have a caesar salad?
- You want a caesar salad?
- I don't know.
Me, too. Me, too. Right.
To your right. Your right. There you go.
- Perfecto.
- Caesar salad for two?
Yes. That would be delightful, and
take your time. We love the pageantry.
Where are you gonna go?
You're gonna miss the pageantry.
Yeah, I know, but I left my water on
that other table, and I already squeezed
Lemon into it, and who wants
to go through that drama again?
Allison, please.
You've got to get out of here.
You can keep kids for an extra weekend.
I'll keep the kids for an extra weekend.
We can use the kids as currency
in any way you see fit. Just go, OK?
Gary, no. No.
I am. I am taking back my restaurant.
It's not your restaurant,
I'm tired of you saying
- Yes, it is!
- your restaurant. No, it's not!
May 31, 1992,
I was in here, and I bought you a drink,
and life as I knew it ended, OK?
You know what?
I'm here now, and I'm just
- gonna go look at the dessert cart.
- No. You can't go over there. Sit,
please.
Who's somebody's getting married?
Not us. No. That no.
Hey. I just. Where is she?
- She went to the ladies'room.
- And you let her?
It's kind of our policy.
You know what? That's OK.
That's good. That will give me some time
to think about what to do about Allison.
She allergic to anything,
shellfish, peanuts?
- The second one, yes.
- Peanuts?
Peanuts. No.
- Allison's heading to the ladies'room.
- That's good.
That will give me some time think about
what to do about. That did you just say?
- Both your dates are in the restroom.
- Holy moly!
Hi. Right this way.
Why are you giving me a dirty look?
I held the door for you.
Hi. How are you? You're number 34.
35? I got room for one more.
- 35?
- Sit, sit down.
That's it.
I'm finished. It's over.
So you think the missus
is gonna give you a divorce?
No. I am divorced, Paulie. I've been
divorced. I was here with
my new girlfriend. Well, she was my
girlfriend up until about a minute ago.
That's your girlfriend?
What did you take her here for?
I could have gotten you into plate.
My brother's the maitre D'.
Come on!
Hey! I.
- I owe you an apology.
- Why?
Didn't anything weird
happen in the bathroom?
Nothing I wasn't expecting.
Nothing unusual went
down while you were in there?
I feel like we should preserve
some of the romance, don't you?
Yes, yes.
Let's get out of here, OK? What?
Let's, let's go somewhere else.
This isn't right. I would like to take
you someplace
that really is special to me, OK?
The maitre D'was sweating
in the caesar salad.
You know what? I totally flaked
on the Bill. I'm gonna go pay it, OK?
- Do you need money for the valet?
- You're adorable.
That's right. I forgot. Hot chicks
don't have to pay for anything.
You're welcome.
Did you say anything to her in there?
I didn't say anything. I saw her fe.
Why didn't you say anything to her?
I thought your mission in life
was to destroy me.
Look, Gary. She has a hard enough
time as it is dating you, all right?
She doesn't need me to pile on.
Besides, I was.
I was kind of touched
you remembered may 31, 1992.
I'll never forget may 31,
1992, because I was in here,
and I saw the most beautiful woman I
had ever seen walk through those doors.
And then you came in right behind her.
- Of course.
- No, Allison.
You had some great points,
too, you know?
You had your Julia Roberts
hair and those
big, Puffy Demi Moore shoulder pads.
I was way out of your league, you know?
You may have been out of my league,
but I totally got inside your uniform.
Thanks for rembering the day at least.
- That's really sweet.
- Of course. May 31.
- How could I forget?
- So how is it related to sports?
Joe Namath's birthday.
Yeah. I tried making reservations
at other places like plate,
saucer, bowl.
They were all booked up.
You mad?
That you took me to a restaurant
that you and your ex-wife used to go to
and that she was there
and it was your anniversary?
So we're OK then?
Gary, I really like you,
but you're not divorced yet.
Oh, yes, I am.
I have half my stuff to prove it.
No. You're divorcing.
There's a big difference.
You know, you still haven't
disconnected from Allison,
and you're not gonna be ready
for a real relationship until you do.
Are you giving me the heave-ho?
Heave-ho is such an ugly
and nautical way to put it,
but maybe we should slow things down,
you know, see other people.
- You need to go exploring, man.
- Can we can we stay friends?
- Of course.
- With benefits?
Like what? Dental?
We could start. You know what?
Get your taco. Let's get out of here.
- Let's, let's leave.
- What the hell?
- It's not what you think, Dennis.
- You said this was our place.
- Sorry.
- No chicks.
- I know.
- I can't here,
I can't eat at home,
I can't find my dog.

Merci d'avoir retrouvé mon portable.
Je le cherchais partout.
Je t'ai appelé pour te le dire,
mais t'as pas répondu.
19 messages ?
Je pensais qu'il y aurait peut-être
une récompense,
alors, j'ai pas arrêté.
Écoute.
Maintenant qu'on s'est mis d'accord pour
voir d'autres gens, tu le fais ?
- Tu veux vraiment le savoir ?
- Oui, je veux le savoir.
Je veux pas le savoir.
Il y a pire, tu sais.
Tu sais cette fête qu'on devait faire
à mon bar dimanche ?
Oui, la fête annuelle de Gary peinture.
C'est là où je fais marcher mon affaire,
en léchant le cul de mes clients,
alors pourquoi tu laisses entendre
qu'elle aura pas lieu ?
- Parce qu'elle aura pas lieu.
- De quoi tu parles ? C'est dimanche !
Quelqu'un est venu réserver
tout le bar pour une fête privée.
J'ai réservé tout le bar
pour une fête privée.
Oui, mais il a sorti
une carte de crédit.
T'avais sorti un billet de 5$.
Salut, les enfants.
Qui est prêt pour 2 jours non-stop,
de glande totale à ne rien faire
avec sûrement beaucoup de maths ?
Louise, chérie,
fais en sorte que quelque chose
d'intelligent se passe ici
ce week-end, OK ?
Je suis comme Jane Goodall. Je ne suis
ici que pour observer les singes.
Hé, Vanessa.
Je m'attendais pas à te voir ici.
Vous vous êtes remis ensemble ?
Pourquoi tu dis ça ?
Tu vas rompre avec moi ?
- Merci bien, Allison.
- Quoi ? Quoi ? Attends.
Vous vous moquez de moi. Super.
OK. Bien. Très bien.
- Très bien. Merci.
- Pardon. J'ai pas pu résister.
Au revoir, Gary.
Je suis désolé pour ta fête.
Oui. Toi aussi.
Quelle fête ?
Quelle fête ? La fête annuelle
de Gary Peintures. Tu t'en souviens ?
Je suis si contente de pas avoir
cette fête chez moi, cette année.
Je peux faire
cette fête chez toi, cette année ?
- Quoi ? Non.
- S'il te plaît. Allez.
Tous les entrepreneurs te trouvent sexy,
et tous les décorateurs
te trouvent... fabuleuse !
- S'il te plaît.
- D'accord, à une condition.
Je déteste les conditions.
Tu viens avec moi à Big Bear
le week-end prochain.
Beth et Jim renouvellent
leurs vœux de mariage.
Non. Tu as gardé Beth et Jim
dans le divorce,
j'ai eu les trucs pour le maïs.
Tu veux dire Donna et PJ.?
Non, les vrai trucs pour le maïs.
Ce que tu plantes dans le maïs
pour pas te salir les mains.
- Corn holders.
- J'ai compris.
Tu dois y aller. Beth est une
de nos amies les plus anciennes.
Plus vieilles amies ?
De quoi tu parles ? Chaque fois que vous
êtes ensemble, vous vous poignardez
dans le dos et vous disputez.
C'est ce que font les filles.
Tu connais vraiment rien aux femmes.
On était à leur mariage d'origine.
Si on y va pas,
on va leur lancer un message
comme quoi leur bonheur
ne nous intéresse plus.
Je suis Gary Brooks,
et j'approuve ce message.
D'accord. Bonne chance
pour faire ta fête ici.
J'espère que tes invités aimeront
tes beignets et tes corn flakes.
D'accord. T'as gagné.
Je viendrais avec toi.
Super. Je viendrais te chercher
à 5h, ne sois pas en retard.
Prépare tes affaires.
Et je t'en prie, ne mets pas de short.
Je déteste que tes jambes transpirent
sur les sièges de ma voiture.
- On a pas déjà fait ça ?
- Quoi ?
Genre, pendant, 15 ans ?

Belle chambre. Si la mienne est pas
aussi bien, on échange.
- À ce sujet...
- Hé, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Ils savent que je suis ici et l'ex-femme
est toujours la première suspecte.
Je veux pas que tu le prennes mal,
mais j'ai besoin que tu fasses quelque
chose pour moi et tu vas pas aimer.
D'accord, mais faut faire vraiment vite
parce que je veux aller à la piscine.
Tu dis "vraiment vite", comme
si tu le faisais différemment.
Non, nous...
nous devons partager la chambre.
Vraiment ? Pourquoi ?
Ils sont complets ?
Beth et Jim et tout le monde ici
pensent qu'on est encore marié.
- Au revoir.
- Non, allez. Allez Gary.
- Quoi ?
- Tu connais mes rapports avec Beth.
Je peux pas la laisser se réjouir
d'être encore mariée et moi non.
OK. Elle est toujours mariée,
et toi non.
Je pars.
Alli, t'es là ? C'est Beth.
Attends, Beth !
Hé, Gary, chéri, laisse-m'y aller !
J'essaie d'aller ouvrir la porte !
Gary, s'il te plaît.
Écoute, si tu fais ça, non seulement
tu peux faire ta fête chez moi, mais
je cuisinerais, et je flirterais,
et je te garantis 6 nouveaux boulots.
- 8. 8. 8.
- 6. 6. 7.
- 50.
- Quoi ? Non. D'accord.
D'accord. D'accord. 8. Mais...
Mais souviens-toi,
on est follement amoureux, OK ?
Et on est vraiment
bien ensemble et on ne peut s'empêcher
de se tenir la main, OK ?
Je croyais qu'on devait faire
comme si on était marié ?
Qu'est-ce que vous faites là-dedans ?
On arrive. Attends.
Est-ce que...
tu promets de faire semblant
- d'être mon mari ?
- Oui.
C'est sympa
quand des dauphins se rencontrent.
Regardez-vous, magnifique femme.
Moi, magnifique ?
Regarde-toi. T'as l'air superbe.
T'as presque perdu tous
les kilos de tes grossesses.
Merci. Louise a 11 ans.
T'as l'air superbe aussi.
On dirait que t'as bien profité
de la vie, tu vois, en extérieur,
du vent, et du soleil.
- Gary, comment vont les affaires ?
- Ça va bien.
En fait, je viens de signer un contrat
pour 8 nouveaux boulots.
Tu pourrais arrêter ?
Juste arrêter de faire ça...
parce que ça m'excite tellement,
et je...
je veux pas être fatigué à la fête
à cause de tout le sexe qu'on va avoir.
D'accord,
tout le monde est au bar.
Alors, vous pourriez
nous rejoindre après
- vous être... installé.
- C'est ça.
- T'as compris ?
- Oui, chérie.
Notre Molly est dans
tous les cours de l'école.
Nous sommes si fiers.
C'est super. Notre Louise est aussi
dans tous les cours.
Je vous ai pas dit qu'elle avait été
contactée par la NASA ?
Tu parles de l'autocollant
qu'elle a eu à son camp ?
Ils ne le donnent pas à tout le monde.
Je croyais. C'était sur notre pare-brise
après un match des Dodgers.
Hé, toi mon bel homme, t'irais pas
nous chercher à boire ?
- Mon Dieu, oui. C'est une bonne idée.
- Merci, Gar-Ours.
De rien, All batros.
Je vais venir avec toi.
Je reviens vite chérie.
Non, je crois pas...
Dac-o-dac.
Stuart, vous avez pas pu
y échapper non plus ?
Non, mais ma femme a accepté
de me laisser un week-end
à Vegas, seul,
sans poser de questions.
D'accord.
J'ai une conférence qui montre
la chance que j'ai, de rien avoir.
Hé, les mecs, regardez qui est venu.
Leslie Martin.
Elle est superbe.
Sûrement parce qu'elle a divorcé. Elle
et Glenn se sont séparés l'an dernier.
Elle est encore mieux que quand je pense
à elle quand je fais l'amour à ma femme.
Vous savez ce que je vais faire ?
Une chose que j'avais pas
le courage de faire il y a 15 ans.
Je vais aller là-bas,
et rester sans rien dire
jusqu'à ce que ça devienne gênant.
Et qu'elle me dise enfin bonjour.
Gary Brooks.
Salut, Leslie. Je t'avais même pas vu.
C'est fou.
- Ça fait si longtemps.
- Désolé, j'ai appris pour toi et Glenn.
Tu sais ce qui me manque le plus ?
- Quoi ?
- Rien du tout. Le divorce est super !
- C'est super.
- Comment va Allison ?
- Qui ?
- Ta femme, Allison.
On s'est séparé...
la route. On s'est séparé.
Elle a conduit jusqu'à Riverside,
et j'ai pris le relais.
Je suis content que tu sois là.
Tu m'offres un verre ?
- C'est libre.
- Comme moi.
Pauvre Gary. C'est gentil
de parler à Leslie comme ça.
J'imagine qu'il n'y a rien
de plus triste que d'être divorcé.
Je sais pas. Peut-être, faire une fête
en son propre honneur ?
Regarde-le,
il fixe ses yeux
et s'accroche à tout ce qu'elle dit.
Oui. C'est mon Gary.
Il sait bien écouter.
C'est comme s'il voulait
rentrer dans son cerveau.
C'est ridicule.
Tu me fais porter un pyjama ?
Ça va si je pars en commando,
ou je devrais y retourner
pour mettre des couches ?
Je vais regarder la télé.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a Allison ?
- Rien.
Vraiment ? Alors pourquoi tu tournes
les pages comme ça ?
Je vois pas de quoi tu parles.
- Et c'était quoi ça ?
- Un coupon.
Tant que tout va bien, je retire.
- Tout va bien.
- OK. Super.
C'était quoi entre toi et Leslie ?
- Je le savais.
- Tout le monde le savait.
T'as flirté avec elle, toute la soirée.
T'es censé être marié.
- T'es jalouse ?
- Bien sûr que non.
Je veux juste
que tu ne gâches pas ma couverture.
Mais admets-le,
t'était passé en mode flirt,
avec la danse, les blagues
et quand tu mâchais la bouche fermée.
C'est quand la dernière fois
que t'as fait ça ?
Je suis surpris que t'aies remarqué
tout ça.
Tu as passé tout ce temps à essayer
de battre Beth. C'était embarrassant.
T'as même dit que Tommy
n'avait pas de caries.
Eh bien, c'est vrai.
Et leur fils, Joey, a un appareil.
S'il te plaît, peux-tu rester
loin de Leslie ?
- T'as promis.
- J'ai pas promis. J'ai passé un accord.
Tu sais quoi ? Si tu veux encore faire
ta fête, chez moi,
tu dois te rappeler qu'on est marié.
Je sais pas comment tu te débrouilles,
mais être marié avec toi, là,
c'est pire qu'avant.
Je vais au distributeur
pour chercher des glaçons.
Je ferai un voyage.
Alors, si tu veux quelque chose,
dis-le-moi maintenant.
Tu veux quelque chose ?
Tu veux des bretzels ?
Tu veux...
du beurre de cacahuètes ?
Des biscuits au fromage ?
Des biscuits au beurre de cacahuètes ?
Un Kit-kat,
Snickers, chewing-gum ?
Bon... d'accord.
- Ramène-moi un truc à la noix de coco.
- Trop tard.
Leslie. Salut.
J'allais chercher des glaçons.
Une personne inconsidérée
vient de prendre les derniers.
- Ton seau est plein.
- Je sais. C'était moi.
J'ai entendu de bonnes choses
sur les dents de ton fils.
Allison me croit à la machine à glaçons.
La machine est vide.
On a 20 voire 30 min au max.
C'est super.
Je peux le faire au moins 5 fois.
- Attends, une seconde. C'est fou.
- Je sais, c'est si mal. J'adore ça !
Non. J'ai promis à Allison
que je serai fidèle ce week-end.
Juste ce week-end ?
Oui, c'est ridicule, parce que je viens
de rompre avec ma petite amie,
- alors ce week-end aurait été parfait.
- T'as une petite amie ?
Avais. J'avais une petite amie.
J'en ai plus.
Donc je trompe vraiment personne,
à part ma femme.
- Va sur le lit.
- OK. Je vais sur le...
C'est bon.
Ce lit devrait avoir une barrière.
Pourquoi t'oublies toujours ta clé,
pour...
- Salut. Je croyais que t'étais...
- Gary ?
- Oui.
- Eh bien, non.
Eh bien, oui. Je vois.
Où est-il ?
Il est allé me chercher
quelque chose au distributeur.
C'est gentil. Je parie qu'il prend
quelque chose pour lui aussi.
Allons voir Leslie. Ce sera amusant.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ici ?
On dirait que 2 personnes avec des seaux
à glace se sont rentrées dedans.
Je me demande où sont les corps.
Je peux pas faire ça.
Si, tu peux.
T'es doué. Fais-moi confiance.
Non, je peux pas. Je mets en jeu ce qui
est le plus important pour moi.
Bien sûr.
Ton mariage.
Non. Cette fête que j'organise dimanche.
Leslie, yoo-hoo. C'est Beth et Allison.
- Hé, salut.
- Faut que je sorte d'ici.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais là dedans ?
- Rien.
J'essaie juste de faire filer
un mec de ma chambre.
Pourquoi avoir dit ça ? C'est f...
Oh, t'es sarcastique, c'est bien.
Je dois y aller.
Tu sais quoi ?
On devrait peut-être la laisser seule.
On dirait qu'elle est avec quelqu'un.
T'as pas entendu une voix d'homme ?
Hé, quoi de neuf ?
On voulait juste voir ce que tu faisais.
Surtout Beth. J'étais au lit quand Gary
s'est levé pour chercher de la glace...
Cream sandwiche.
Tu ne l'as pas vu, n'est-ce pas ?
Le voilà.
- Je croyais que t'étais...
- Parti chercher à manger pour Allison ?
T'es couvert de feuilles.
Sacré combat de feuille avec le meilleur
de la rue. On leur a botté le cul.
- Eh bien, bonne nuit.
- On va faire l'amour !
- Étais-tu dans la chambre de Leslie ?
- J'attendais que la glace se fasse.
- T'as sauté par la fenêtre ?
- J'ai dû sauter par la fenêtre.
J'ai failli être pris la main
dans le sac, par ma fausse femme.
Beth pense que quelque chose
ne va pas dans notre mariage.
Quelque chose ne va pas dans
notre mariage ? On me dit jamais rien.
Pourquoi tu t'occupes de ce
qu'elle pense ? C'est une vermine.
- Elle est comme un méchant de BD.
- Beth est LA personne
qui depuis le début,
disait qu'on y arriverait pas,
et on a pas réussi. Je voulais pas lui
donner la satisfaction d'avoir raison.
- Tu me vires ?
- Oui, Gary
et comme la dernière fois,
tu me demandes si je te vire.
Mon Dieu. Doucement.
Je peux pas te faire confiance.
Je t'ai demandé de faire
une toute petite chose ce week-end.
Et t'as pas pu. Je savais
que je pouvais pas compter sur toi.
Et comme je l'ai fait il y a 15 ans,
je voudrais re-déclarer Beth et Jim,
mari et femme.
Où est Gary ?
Il a dû partir hier soir.
Un de ses camions de peinture a explosé.
C'était horrible, mais beau...
Mais horrible.
Merci à tous d'être venu.
Nous sommes si heureux d'avoir pu
partager ça avec vous.
Et je sais que certains
se le demandent...
Oui, c'est la même robe
qu'il y a 15 ans.
Mon Dieu.
- Désolé d'être en retard.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je suis là pour te dire
que je te laisserai pas tomber.
Laisse tomber. Rien de ce que tu diras
ne rattrapera ce que tu as fait.
Vraiment ?
Je peux avoir votre attention ?
- Que fais-tu ?
- T'es rentré en douce ?
T'es doué pour rentrer en douce.
Tu te rappelles quand
tu étais pom-pom girl à la fac,
tu as toujours voulu savoir qui t'avait
lancé cette pêche au visage ?
Je voudrais me faire pardonner.
C'était une nectarine.
Mais voir Beth et Jim
renouveler leurs vœux
m'a vraiment inspiré
et j'aimerais renouveler mes vœux
- avec Allison, tout de suite.
- Non, ça va, on est bien.
On est vraiment bien.
- Tu peux pas faire ça.
- Je peux pas faire...
comme si
les moments passés ensemble
n'ont pas été les meilleurs,
- ils le furent.
- Je te tuerai.
Et Allison me tuerait
si je disais pas que notre maison est
magnifique. Elle la garde impeccable.
Et nous avons 2 magnifiques enfants.
Tommy, bien sûr,
à la dentition parfaite,
et
le capitaine Louise H. Brooks.
- Tu vas la fermer, oui ?
- Le poète russe
tuvaslafermeroui,
il,
il a dit l'amour, comme la vodka,
devrait couler librement entre
2 amants. Et c'est comme ça
avec Allison.
Et je sais qu'au début,
certains en doutaient, Beth,
et... mais nous voilà.
Toujours là.
On est toujours marié,
toujours très amoureux. Et Allison,
si j'ai fait quoi que ce soit
pour t'énerver, même
quelque chose récemment,
je suis désolé et...
Je te laisserai pas tomber.
C'est tout ce que j'ai.
- Ils veulent un baiser.
- Oui, j'aurais dû y penser plus tôt.
Très bien. Laisse-moi régler ça.
Tout le monde.
On est divorcé.
Quoi ?
Ça fait 7 magnifiques mois.
En fait, je suis déjà fiancé
à un docteur.
Alors... désolé.
Je voulais que personne ne sache
pour moi et Gary.
Maintenant que vous le savez,
- la vérité fait du bien.
- Tu es divorcé ?
Je suis tellement désolée.
- On est divorcé aussi.
- Oh mon Dieu !
J'étais pas censé le dire.
On couche toujours ensemble,
à l'occasion.
J'étais pas censé dire ça, non plus.
Bref, merci, Allison.
On suit une thérapie.
On est pas divorcé,
mais c'est pas terrible en ce moment.
Merci, Allison.
Tout le monde voudrait bien arrêter
de remercier Allison d'être divorcé.
Je pensais qu'on se connaissait
suffisamment pour pas se mentir
- sur ce que nous sommes.
- Je suis gay.
Désolé. J'en ai parlé à Beth
il y a 6 semaines, mais,
on s'aime toujours et
on avait déjà payé
pour l'arrangement des fleurs...
Que j'ai dessiné.
Et
Beth gère ce nouveau et
excitant chapitre de nos vies...
allez. Combien d'entre vous
ne sont pas surpris ?
Jim, tu veux bien venir
prendre l'air avec moi ?
Oui. Le bar est ouvert, OK ?
On revient tout de suite.
Et aussi... je sors avec un docteur.
- Hé bien...
- Tant mieux pour lui.
Tu n'avais pas à venir me sauver.
Je te sauvais pas.
Je remplissais mon devoir conjugal.
En plus...
j'aime pas quand on s'en prend à toi.
Comme toujours.
De quoi tu parles ?
Tu l'as fait pendant 15 ans.
Oui, mais je suis vraiment bon.
Allons prendre un verre.
Alors...
Le poète russe tuvaslafermeroui ?
Oui, tu sais,
sa muse était sa femme,
quellesalopovitch.
- On a 3 heures de route.
- Très bien.
On part.
Moi aussi. J'ai envie de rentrer
et d'oublier tout ça.
Quel week-end.
Alors, il paraît que ta fille est
dans le programme spatial ?
Oui. On est très fier d'elle.
Je suis dans la voiture.
Je te vois dans 5 minutes, hein ?
Team Subs-Addicts"
Thank you for finding my cell phone.
I was looking every where for it.
Yeah. I called you to tell you,
but you didn't pick up.
19 messages?
Yeah. I thought maybe there'd be,
like, a reward involved,
so I just kept hammering away at it.
Listen.
Now that we agreed to start seeing other
people, are you seeing other people?
- Do you really want to know that?
- Yeah, I want to know that.
I don't want to know that.
You know, I've got some worse news.
You know that party you were
going to have at my bar on sunday?
Yeah, the annual Gary's
housepainting party.
That's where I drum up all my business
by kissing all my clients'butts,
So why did you say
like it's not happening?
- Because it's not happening.
- What talking about? It's next sunday.
Somebody came in, and he reserved
the whole bar for a private party.
I reserved the whole
bar for a private party.
Yeah, but he put down a credit card.
You put down a fiver.
Hey, kids. All right.
Who's ready for 2
straight days of nonstop,
in-your-face laying around and
doing nothing and probably lots of math?
Louise, honey,
please make sure something
intelligent happens
here this weekend, OK?
I'm like Jane goodall, mom.
I'm only here to observe the apes.
Hey, Vanessa.
I didn't expect to see you here.
You guys... you back on?
Why would you say that?
Are you breaking up with me?
- Thanks a lot, Allison.
- What? What? Wait. Wait. Wait.
You guys are teasing me. Great.
OK. Good. Very nice.
Very nice. Thank you. I'm sorry.
I couldn't resist.
Bye, Gary.
I'm sorry about your party.
Yeah. You, too.
What party?
What party? The annual Gary's
housepainting party. Remember?
God, I am so glad I don't have to
have that party at my house this year.
Can I have that party
at your house this year?
- What? No.
- Please. Please, come on.
All the contractors think you're hot,
and all the interior decorators
think you're... fabulous!
- Please.
- OK, under one condition.
No. I hate "one condition."
Look, you have to go with
me up to big bear next weekend.
Beth and Jim are renewing
their wedding vows.
No, I don't. Because you got Beth
and Jim in the divorce.
I got the corn holders.
You mean donna and PJ.?
No, not the kornholters.
The actual corn holders, the little
mini corn that you plug
into the regular big corn...
- Corn holders.
- Gary, yeah, I got it. Look.
You have to go. I mean, Beth is one
of our oldest and dearest friends.
Oldest and dearest friend? What are
you talking about? Every time you guys
are together, you just backstab
each other and bicker and fight.
That's what girlfriends do, Gary. Jeez.
You don't know women at all, do you?
Look, Gary,
we were in their original wedding party.
I mean, if we don't go,
it's gonna send a message
we no longer are interested
in their happiness.
I'm Gary Brooks,
and I approved that message.
All right. Well, good luck having
your party here.
I hope your guests enjoy their
hot pockets and frosted flakes.
All right. You know what?
You win. OK. I'll go with you.
OK. Good. Good. I will pick
you up at 5:00. Don't be late.
Have your bag packed.
And for god's sakes, don't wear shorts.
I hate when your legs
sweat all over my car seat.
- Didn't we already take this drive?

This is a nice room. You know, if mine's
not this nice, we're gonna switch.
- About that.
- Hey, what are you doing?
I told people. They know I'm here, and
the ex-wife is always the first suspect.
Gary, I don't want you to overreact,
but I need you to do something for me,
and you're not going to like it.
All right, but we got to go really
fast because I want to get in the pool.
You say "really fast" like you
do it any other way. So, I mean...
No, we...
we have to share a room.
Really? Why?
Are they all sold out?
Beth and Jim and everyone
here still think we're married.
- Good-bye.
- No, come on. Come on, Gary.
- What?
- You know my relationship with Beth.
I can't have her gloat all weekend about
how she's still married and I'm not.
OK. Hi. She is still married,
and you're not.
I'm leaving.
Alli, are you in there? It's Beth.
Hang on, Beth!
Hey, Gary, honey, let go of me!
I'm trying to answer the door!
Please, Gary.
Look, if you do this, not only can
you have your party at my house, but
I will cook, and I will flirt,
and I will guarantee you 6 new jobs.
- 8. 8. 8.
- 6. 6. 7.
- 50.
- What? No. Fine.
Fine. Fine. 8. Fine. 8. But...
But remember,
we're madly in love, OK?
And we're
totally into each other and we can't
keep our hands off each other, OK?
I thought we were supposed
to act like we're married.
You guys,
what are you doing in there?
Just coming. Hang on.
OK, here. Do you...
Promise to pretend
- to be my husband?
- I do.
It's so nice when dolphins meet.
Look at you, gorgeous lady.
Me gorgeous?
Look at you. You look great.
You have lost almost
all your baby weight.
Thanks. Louise is 11.
Yeah, you look fabulous, too.
Looks like you've really been enjoying
life, you know, out there in the
wind and the sun.
- So, Gary, how's the painting business?
- It's going good.
Actually, I just signed
a contract to get 8 new jobs.
Could you stop?
Just stop doing that...
Because it's turning me on so much,
and I don't...
I don't want be tired at the party from
all the sex we're going to be having.
Right. Well, listen,
everybody's down at the bar.
So why don't you two
come join us down there after
- you've had a chance to... settle in.
- Way in.
- You reckon?
- Yeah. You got it, sweetie.
Our Molly is in every gifted
class the school has to offer.
We are so proud.
That is great. You know, our Louise
is in every gifted class, too.
Did I tell you she was
contacted by NASA?
You mean that flyer
she got from space camp?
They don't just give them to anybody.
I thought they did. It was on our
windshield after a dodgers game.
Hey, you sexy man, would you
go get us another round of drinks?
- God, yes. That's a good idea.
- Thank you, gar bear.
You're welcome, all-batross.
You know, I'll go with you.
I'll be right back honey.
No, I don't think...
Okey-dokey.
Stuart, you guys couldn't
get out of this thing either?
No, but my wife had to agree
to let me have a weekend
in Vegas by myself,
no questions asked.
All right.
I got a lecture about how
I'm Lucky to have anything at all.
Hey, guys, look who showed up.
Boy. Leslie Martin.
She looks great.
Probably because she's divorced.
She and glen split up last year.
She looks even better than imagine
her when I'm having sex with my wife.
You know what I'm going to do, guys?
I'm going to do something I did
not have the nerve to do 15 years ago.
I'm going to go over just,
there and stand there and not say
anything until it becomes so awkward
that she finally says hi to me.
Gary Brooks.
Hey, Leslie. I didn't even see you here.
That's crazy.
- It's been forever.
- Hey, sorry to hear about you and glen.
You know what I miss
most about being married?
- What?
- Absolutely nothing. Divorce awesome!
- That's great.
- How's Allison?
- Who?
- Your wife, Allison.
We split up...
the driving
on the way here. We split it up.
She... she drove to riverside,
and then I took over.
I'm glad you're here.
You want to buy me a drink?
- They're free.
- Just like me.
Poor Gary. So nice of him
to talk to Leslie like that.
Can't imagine anything
more sad than being divorced.
I don't know. What about throwing
a party in honor of yourself maybe?
Look at him,
staring into her eyes and hanging
on every little word she says.
Yeah. Well, that's my Gary.
He's a great listener.
Looks like he'd like
to listen her brains out.
This is ridiculous.
You're making me wear pajamas?
Is it OK that I'm going commando,
or should I go back
and put on some pull-ups?
I'm going to watch some Tv.
What's the matter, Allison?
- Nothing.
- Really?
Then why are you doing
that angry page-turn?
I don't know what you're
talking about, Gary.
- Then what was that?
- Coupon.
OK. As long as nothing's wrong,
I'll drop it.
- Nothing's wrong.
- OK. Great.
What the hell was with you and Leslie?
- I knew it.
- Everybody knew it, Gary.
You were flirting with her all night.
You're supposed to be married.
- Are you jealous?
- Of course not, Gary.
I just don't want
you to blow my cover.
I mean, admit it, you were, like,
in full-on flirt mode, with the
dancing and joking
and chewing with your mouth closed.
I mean, when was the
last time you did that?
I'm surprised you even noticed
any of that. I mean, were
spending the whole time trying
to one-up Beth. It was embarrassing.
One time you told her
tommy has no cavities.
Well, he doesn't.
And their son, Joey, Braces. Yeah.
Look, Gary, the point is,
please, would you stay away from Leslie?
- You took a vow.
- I didn't take a vow. I took a deal.
Look. You know what? If you still
want to have your party at my house,
you have to remember
you and I are married.
You know what? I don't know
how you managed this, Allison,
but somehow being married to you this
time is worse than it was the last time.
I'm going to the vending machine,
and I'm going to get ice.
And I'm only making one trip.
So if you want anything,
you got to tell me now.
Do you want anything?
You want some pretzels?
You want, like...
A nutter butter or something?
Some cheese crackers?
Peanut butter crackers?
You want, like, a Kit-kat,
Snickers, Beechnut gum?
Maybe... All right.
- Bring me something with coconut.
- Too late.
Hey, Leslie. Hi.
I'm just going to get ice.
Some inconsiderate person
just took the last of it.
- Your bucket's all full.
- I know. It was me.
I hear good things
about your son's teeth.
Allison thinks i'm at the ice machine.
The machine's empty.
We've got 20 min, a half-hour tops.
That's great.
I can do it, like, 5 times.
- Wait. Hold on a second. This is crazy.
- I know. It's so wrong. I love it!
No. I promised Allison
I would be faithful this weekend.
Just this weekend?
Yes, which is ridiculous, because
I just broke up with my girlfriend, so
- this weekend would have been perfect.
- You have a girlfriend?
Had. I had a girlfriend.
Now I don't have a girlfriend.
So I'm not really cheating on anyone,
except my wife.
- Get on the bed.
- OK. I'll get on the!
It's OK.
This bed should have a warning track.
Why can't you ever
remember your key, for...
- Hey, Beth. I thought you were.
- Gary?
- Yeah.
- I'm not.
Well, yeah. I see.
Where is Gary?
He went to get me something
out of the vending machine.
That's nice. I bet he's getting
a little something for himself, too.
Hey, let's go see Leslie. It'll be fun.
What happened here?
It looks like 2 people with
ice buckets crashed into each other.
I wonder where the bodies are.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
You're good at it. Trust me.
No, I can't. I'm jeopardizing the thing
that's the most important to me.
Of course.
Your marriage.
No. This party I'm having sunday night.
Leslie, yoo-hoo. It's Beth and Allison.
- Hey, you guys.
- I've got to get out of here.
- What are you doing in there?
- Nothing.
Just trying to sneak some guy
out of my room.
Why would you say that? That's cra...
you're being sarcastic. That's good.
OK. I have to go.
You know what?
Maybe we should just leave her alone.
It sounds like she's with someone.
Did you hear a man's voice?
Hey, you guys. What's up?
We just wanted to
see what you were up to.
Well, Beth did mostly. I was in bed
when Gary got up to get some ice...
Cream sandwiches.
You haven't seen him, have you, Leslie?
There he is.
- Gary, I thought you were...
- Getting snacks for Allison? I was.
You're covered in leaves.
Wicked leaf fight with the best western
across the street. We kicked their ass.
- Well, good night, you guys.
- We're going to go make some love!
- Were you over in Leslie's room?
- Yes. I was waiting for ice to be made.
- What did you do, just out her window?
- I had to jump out a window.
I almost got caught red-handed
doing nothing wrong by my pretend wife.
Gary. Now Beth thinks there's
something wrong with our marriage.
Something's wrong with our marriage?
I'm always the last to know.
What do you care what Beth thinks?
She's a creep, that lady.
- She's like a comic-book villain.
- Beth is the one person
who, from the beginning,
said that we wouldn't make it,
and we didn't. OK? I didn't want to give
her the satisfaction of being right.
- You're kicking me out?
- Yeah, Gary,
and just like the last time,
you're asking me if I'm kicking you out.
My gosh. Easy.
I can't believe you, Gary.
I asked you to do one
tiny thing this weekend.
You couldn't do it.
I knew I couldn't count on you.
And just as I did 15 years ago,
i'd like to repronounce
Beth and Jim husband and wife.
Where's Gary?
He had to leave late last night.
One of his paint trucks exploded.
It was horrible, but beautiful...
But horrible.
Thank you for coming, everybody.
We're so happy you were
able to share this with us.
And I know some of
you have been asking.
Yes, this is the same
dress I wore 15 years ago.
For god's sakes.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- What are you doing here?
I'm here to let you know
I'm not going to let you down.
You know what? Forget it, Gary. There's
nothing you can say to make up to me.
Really? Could I have
everybody's attention, please?
- What are you doing?
- Gary, you snuck in.
You're pretty good at sneaking around.
Beth, remember when you
were cheerleading in college and
you always wanted to know who was that
hit you in the face with that peach?
Well, I'd like to come clean.
It was a nectarine.
But watching Beth and Jim Renew
their vows has really
inspired me, and I would like
to Renew my vows
- with Allison right now.
- No, no, we wouldn't.
We're real good. Allison.
- Look, I can't stand you.
- I can't stand...
Here and act like
the times that we've spent together
haven't been the best, because
- they have.
- I will kill you.
And Allison would kill me if
I didn't mention the fact that our house
is amazing. She keeps it immaculate.
And we have our 2 beautiful children.
Tommy, of course,
with his mouthful of flawless teeth,
and
flight commander Louise H. Brooks.
- Shove a sock in it.
- You know, the Russian poet
shovasockinit,
he,
he said love, like vodka,
should flow freely between
2 lovers. And that's what it's
like with me and Allison.
And I know when we first got together,
some of you were doubters, Beth,
and... but here we are.
We're still here.
We're still married. We're still
very much in love. And Allison,
if I've done anything
to disappoint you, even
something recently,
i'm sorry, and I just...
I won't let you down.
That's all I got.
They want us to kiss.
Yeah, I should have
thought this through more.
All right. Let me handle it.
Everybody.
We're divorced.
What?
It has been 7 wonderful months.
In fact,
I am already engaged to a doctor.
So... i'm sorry.
I didn't want everyone
to know about me and Gary.
But now that you do,
- the truth feels good.
- Allison, you're divorced?
I'm so sorry.
- We're divorced, too.
- Oh my god!
I wasn't supposed to say that.
We still sleep together
on occasion, though. You know...
I probably wasn't supposed
to say that either.
Anyway, thanks, Allison.
We're in therapy.
We're not divorced, but things
are looking pretty bad right now.
Thank you, Allison.
Would everyone please stop
thanking Allison for being divorced.
I thought we all knew each other
enough that we didn't have
- to lie about who we are.
- I'm gay.
I'm sorry. I came out
to Beth about 6 weeks ago, but,
we still love each other, aénd
we had already paid
for all the floral arrangements...
Which I designed.
And
Beth is dealing with this new and
exciting chapter of our lives. And...
come on.
How many of you aren't surprised?
Jim, would you help me
outside for some air, please?
Honey. Listen, everybody the bar's open,
OK? And we'll be right back.
And also... i am dating a doctor.
- Well...
- Well, good for him.
Hey, you didn't have to come here
and rescue me, you know.
I wasn't here to rescue you.
I was here to fulfill my marital duties.
Plus...
i hate when people pick on you.
I always have.
What are you talking about?
You did for 15 years.
Yeah, but I'm, like, really good at it.
Let's get a drink.
So...
The Russian poet Shovasockinit?
Yeah. You know,
his muse was his wife, Oftenisabitch.
- Gary, we got a 3-hour drive.
- All right.
We're leaving.
Yeah. Me, too. I just want to get back
home and put this all behind me.
Pretty crazy weekend.
So, I hear your daughter
is in the space program.
Yeah. We're very proud of her.
Hey, Gar. I'm gonna be in the car.
I'll see you in 5 minutes?
Team Subs-Addicts"
Brooke est à 20 yards.
Il est à 15 yards.
Il n'a plus qu'un homme à dépasser.
Tu t'amuses bien ?
Au début oui, puis j'ai réalisé
que l'homme à qui j'ai été marié
pendant 15 ans essayait de marquer
avec un animal mort, congelé.
Et tu crois que ça m'a fait quoi de
coucher avec cet animal pendant 15 ans ?
Joli. Joli.
OK, je vais laisser passer ça,
mais je veux te demander un truc.
Pourquoi es-tu si têtu ?
Viens chez moi avec les enfants
pour Thanksgiving.
Non. Cette année, Thanksgiving a lieu
chez moi. Tu étais d'accord.
Je sais, mais sérieusement,
tu vas essayer de rôtir une dinde ?
On sait tous les deux que t'es incapable
de préparer un repas de Thanksgiving.
Je pense que j'en suis capable,
et que c'est ça qui te fout la trouille.
Je parie que tu sais même pas
ce qu'il y a dans la farce.
Toute cette boîte...
Avec soit de l'eau, soit un truc qui
s'appelle bouillon-cube. Comme je veux.
- Y a quelqu'un ?
- C'est mon père !
Ça veut dire qu'il a passé les chiens
à l'aéroport.
- Salut, Papa !
- Salut, Gary.
Vous grandissez si vite les enfants.
Ils sont vraiment étonnants. Tu devrais
les voir ranger les provisions.
- On dirait des artistes, vraiment.
- Merci, Papa.
Content que tu apprécies.
Allez, Louise.
Allons ranger des provisions.
C'était une arnaque, débile !
- Toi...
- Bonjour.
Comment ça va ?
Je déteste le dire devant mon fils,
mais le divorce te va bien.
Je déteste le dire devant ton fils,
mais j'ai jamais été aussi heureuse.
C'est bien, une petite blague
entre l'homme qui m'a donné la vie
et la femme qui l'a détruite.
Allez, Jack.
Qu'est ce que tu as fait ?
Eh, bien, j'... j'ai voyagé.
J'ai habité avec une femme esquimau
pendant un moment.
Vous saviez que les esquimaux ont
plus de 100 mots pour dire "dégage".
- Tu veux me montrer ma chambre ?
- OK.
Voilà.
- Je dors sur le canapé ?
- Non. Tu dors pas sur le canapé.
Je t'ai acheté un lit.
Papa, regarde ça ?
Un matelas gonflable. Super.
Où est-ce que je creuse mes chiottes ?
Tu sais, ta chambre
est toujours libre chez moi.
- Vraiment ?
- Non, non. Peut-être, mais non.
Mon père reste ici
avec moi et les enfants.
T'as toujours cette douche
qui va dans tous les coins ?
Oui.
Parce qu'après 2 semaines à Baja,
j'ai encore du sable sur moi.
Il y a aussi une douche ici.
Tu sais quoi ?
J'ai aussi dû remplacer ce vieux lit
par un bon matelas
et je promets de ne rien dire
si vous brûlez de l'encens.
C'est bon.
Mon père reste ici pour Thanksgiving.
Les enfants restent ici pour
Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving
a lieu ici, pour Thanksgiving.
La seule chose qui reste pas ici
pour Thanksgiving, c'est toi. Au revoir.
OK. Mais la proposition tient, Jack,
et je sais que ma mère
adorerait te voir.
Attends une seconde.
L'exquise Connie est là ?
J'aurais du laisser Mano
me raser le dos.
Vanessa vient de se garer, Papa.
C'est mon amie. Elle est sexy.
Et je lui ai dit t'étais pas aveugle,
alors fait pas ton gag
"oh, je vous sers juste la main".
- Non, y a Parker.
- T'as pas à jouer avec Parker,
mais tu dois être gentil
avec le fils de Vanessa.
Je sais, mais il me tape toujours.
- C'est de son âge.
- Dans les testicules.
Mon père est là.
Tu veux le rencontrer ?
Ouais. Super.
Comment tu vas nous présenter ?
Je vais lui dire que t'es une amie,
qu'on sortait ensemble,
et que de temps en temps,
tu m'appelles pour du sexe.
Je fais pas ça !
Je sais, je te dis juste
que c'est une option.
Louise, où est Papy ?
Parti avec Maman. Il a dit que
la pression de notre eau est trop faible
pour faire partir le sable
de la baie des pirates.
Mon Dieu.
Elle a volé mon père.
Elle l'a appâté avec une promesse
de matelas et un truc contre le sable.

- Chérie.
- Quoi ?
Ta tarte semble un peu sèche.
Gary aimait les tartes sèches ?
Maman, j'en sais rien.
Demande à Gary ?
Je peux pas. Tu l'a chassé.
Je l'ai pas chassé, OK ?
Pourquoi tu peux pas être heureuse
pour moi d'avoir trouvé Walter ?
Je le suis,
mais ton fiancé a l'air un peu...
comment le dire poliment...
antique.
C'est un brillant thérapeute,
il est beau et affectueux,
et il n'a que 15 ans de plus que moi.
J'ai dit à ton père qu'il aurait dû plus
te câliner quand t'étais ado, mais...
ta petite poitrine lui faisait peur.
- J'ai fait quoi, encore ?
- Refuser l'affection de ta fille,
mais tu es un excellent golfeur
maintenant, alors ça valait la peine.
Allie sais que je l'aime ?
Pas vrai, Alligator ?
Bien sûr. Voilà, OK.
Walter, c'est un sacré aquarium.
Merci. J'ai caressé l'idée de devenir
biologiste marin,
mais nous les Krandall ne sommes pas
très allègres.
Il y a une expression en Suédois.
Qui veut dire
"couler comme un Krandall".
Charlie, vous êtes passé à côté.
Venez voir mes crabes siffleurs.
Il y a un traitement pour ça.
Tu as de la bière ?
T'as pas besoin d'une bière.
Ça émousse tes sens.
Tu as raison. Je vais manger
de la dinde et faire une sieste.
Je serai vigilant.
- J'ai vu la bière.
- Comme un Superman ménopausé.
Est-il possible que vous rajeunissiez
chaque fois que je vous vois ?
Je sais pas. Est-ce possible
que vous soyez défoncé ?
C'est toujours possible.
Un des plus grands jours
de football de l'année
et vous avez remplacé
la télé par un aquarium.
C'est presque autant divertissant
que le football.
Regardez ! Un poisson-cube nage
à travers le corail "doigt de Fiji".
C'est l'équivalent marin d'un essai.
Lequel de ces poissons me tuerait
si je le mangeais ?
Vous regardez le match de Dallas ?
Non mais on vient de voir
une carpe chier sous l'eau.
Premièrement, la carpe est
un poisson d'eau douce. Deuxièmement,
tous les poissons défèquent sous l'eau,
donc c'est drôle sur deux points.
- Pas besoin d'essayer si fort.
- Désolé. Papa ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
- Je veux mon père.
Quoi ? Il a sauté dans la voiture
tout excité,
comme si on allait au parc à chiens.
Allez, avec la douche chaude,
le lit rembourré
et l'encens libre t'a vendu cet endroit
comme si c'était le bed and breakfast
de Woody Harrelson.
Si tu veux être avec ton père,
amène les enfants et on fera le dîner
de Thanksgiving ici.
Non, tu ne me voleras pas
mon Thanksgiving.
Je ne vais pas dans le jacuzzi
avec vous, Jack.
C'est qu'une baignade,
pas une invitation à une croisière.
- C'est bon de vous voir.
- On va se faire un jacuzzi.
Non, je ne vais pas !
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Monte dans la voiture. Allons chez moi.
C'est là qu'est Thanksgiving
cette année.
Allez, pourquoi tu n'amènes pas
les enfants ici ?
- Tu mets ton maillot de bain ?
- Non !
Tant mieux.
T'as gagné.
On va faire Thanksgiving ici.
Je vais chercher les enfants,
et je les amène, OK ?
Tu vois ? C'était si dur ?
T'as essayé,
mais Thanksgiving, c'est mon truc.
On peut faire notre partie de foot
chez moi avec les enfants ?
Bien sûr.
Tu peux me faire une faveur ?
Chercher les baskets de Louise ?
- J'arrive.
- Merci.
C'est bon.
Je regarde les bières.
Comme des chiots derrière une vitrine.
La petite triste est ma préférée.
Je vais pas te mentir.
J'ai tant de bières importées
dans mon frigo,
que j'ai presque plus de place pour
les bières locales.
J'aurais vraiment besoin d'un buveur.
C'est tentant, mais si je partais,
Connie m'arracherait les entrailles.
Viens chez moi, Charlie.
La deuxième mi-temps du match
va commencer.
J'ai un oiseau dans le four,
un grand écran plat, pas de poisson.
- J'attends dans la voiture.
- Voilà !
- Cet endroit est super.
- C'est petit, mais minable.
Et ça sent comme dans un bar.
C'était pas comme ça.
J'ai dû tout faire moi-même.
Chez moi, c'est comme dans
un Indiana Jones.
Tu touches le mauvais truc et
la grosse boule vient te faire chier.
Alors, tu manges ici ?
Presque tous les jours, devant la télé.
Une fois, j'avais cette grosse glace,
et j'ai été au lit en l'oubliant.
Le matin,
je l'ai bu comme un whisky.
Je vais me rappeler de ça
le restant de ma vie.
Vanessa et moi avons battu
les mecs au foot.
Parker était mon coéquipier, il a pas
arrêté de m'attaquer, il comprends pas.
Tu m'as dit d'attaquer le gars avec
la balle. T'avais la balle.
Mes excuses.
J'aurai jamais d'enfants.
Oh, mon Dieu.
- Salut, chérie.
- Tu vas l'effrayer.
- Charlie, voici mon amie Vanessa.
- Vous devez être le père.
- Oui, c'est moi.
- Non, t'es le père d'Allison.
Peu importe.
- Allez-vous pouvoir nous rejoindre ?
- J'ai transpiré au football.
Je vais monter prendre une douche,
mais gardez-moi une bière,
je reviens regarder le match.
Tu es le plus grand homme qui a existé.
Je boirais à ça.
Allons rafraichir nos bières. Où...
est-ce l'heure
de se servir une pression ?
Je ne pleure pas. J'ai juste eu
du sel de bretzel dans les yeux.
- Papa, tu fais quoi, bon sang ?
- Je passe le plus beau jour de ma vie.
Monte en voiture.
Je te ramène. Allez.
Hé, Charlie, j'ai trouvé
ces 2 bières belges en route.
Elles sont assez fraîches.
Désolé pour la glace collée au verre.
Papa, on y va.
- Je ne crois pas.
- Il ne croit pas.
Papa, maman te cherche,
Walter a peur de t'avoir vexé,
et je n'ai pas vu Jack depuis
qu'il a touché au robinet de la cuisine
pris une pomme et
c'est échappé par-derrière.
On dirait que tout va mal chez toi.
Ce ne serait pas plus simple
si tout le monde venait ici ?
Gary a une magnifique dinde
dans le four. Tu devrais la voir.
Ça me rappelle
que je dois aller arroser mon oiseau.
Et vérifier la dinde.
Elle est bonne. J'aime ça.
Tu sais qu'avec Gary en cuisine,
il ne va pas y avoir de dîner.
Tant qu'il lui reste du
jus de "je m'en fiche", je m'en fiche.
Ne t'inquiète pas si c'est pas mange...
- Qui a fait ça pour toi ?
- Moi.
Elle est magnifique.
Elle devrait être en couverture
du magazine "Mieux que chez Allison".
Quoi ? Oh, mon Dieu.
On peut entendre son parfum.
Écoute. "Je suis délicieuse."
- "Dans ta face." "Je suis délicieuse."
- Arrête de jouer
avec ton stupide oiseau
et dit à mon père de rentrer chez moi.
Tu sais quoi ? Ton père est un adulte.
Il peut faire ce qu'il veut.
Mais quand tu voudras échanger ton otage
contre mon invité, appelle-moi.
Pourquoi t'étends pas tes jambes ?
Vraiment ?
Ça a vraiment l'air confortable.
Tu veux vraiment te lâcher ?
Enlève tes chaussures d'abord.
Bien. Bien.
C'est tellement mal.
C'est tellement mal.
Hé, ça fait 20 minutes.
Je dois aller arroser Lucille.
Et vérifier ta dinde.
OK.
Lucille !? Oh, mon Dieu.
OK. Chérie ? Lucille ?
Allison était là,
mais je ne l'ai pas vu partir.
Allison a mangé ma dinde.
Non, non. Elle a volé ma dinde.
Qu'as-tu fait de mon oiseau ?!
Où est ma dinde ? Où est Lucille ?
Qui est-ce ?
Joue pas à ça avec moi.
Tu sais qui c'est. Je veux ma dinde !
Ta dinde est en sécurité,
pour l'instant.
Elle cuit dans un lieu secret.
Tu veux la jouer comme ça ?
Ramène mon père chez moi
dans une demie-heure,
ou la température du four augmentera de
15 degrés par minute de retard.
T'oserais pas.
T'as pas idée
de ce dont je suis capable, Gary.
Ramène-le,
et personne ne sera trop cuit.
Je fouillais pas, mais en regardant dans
ton tiroir à sous-vêtements...
Maman !
Il faut bien que quelqu'un te le dise.
Les hommes n'aiment pas
les culottes de grand-mères.
- Ils aiment les strings, comme ça.
- Comme ça.
Jack, vous n'étiez pas censé voir ça.
Eh bien, c'est fait.
Je le télécharge dans mon disque dur.
Avant que je vomisse dans mes ignames,
pourrais-tu finir de mettre la table ?
Ton père est dans ma voiture.
Tu sais, j'ai dû lui dire que
nous allions dans un club de striptease
pour le faire sortir de chez moi.
- Il doit être à l'intérieur.
- Comment savoir si l'oiseau va bien ?
- Grandis un peu.
- Grandir ? T'as volé ma dinde.
- T'as volé mon père.
- Parce que t'as volé le mien.
Mais t'amèneras pas les enfants ici.
Dois-je les rincer,
ou on se la joue camp de vacances ?
T'avais dit que tu faisais
que passer pour récupérer ta carte VIP.
- Où étais-tu ?
- Avec Gary,
à boire de la bière,
manger des trucs salés,
et à mettre mes pieds sur les meubles.
Connie, j'ai mis nos noms sur la table,
et maintenant ma cuillère
touche votre fourchette.
- Salut, fils.
- Salut, traître.
Arrêtez tout.
T'as mis tes pieds sur un meuble ?!
Oui, et à partir de maintenant,
je vais me la jouer comme ça.
- Pas chez moi.
- T'as sacrément raison.
Je déménage.
Je veux un endroit comme chez Gary.
- Quoi ?
- Quoi ?
But !
Tu vois ce que t'as fait ?
T'es content ?
- Il se passe quoi ?
- Aujourd'hui
est le jour de l'indépendance
de Charlie Carswell.
Et je le fêterai tous les ans !
Mon père veut divorcer.
C'est une urgence
de conseiller conjugal.
Maman, papa, j'ai de la place
pour mardi prochain !
Bon Dieu.
C'est de ta faute. Pourquoi t'as pas
ramené les enfants dès le début ?
- Qu'est-ce que ça a à voir là-dedans ?
- T'aurais été ici.
T'aurais tenu ma mère loin de moi
et aurais diverti mon père,
tu l'aurais emmené voir un match.
Attends une minute.
Je comprends maintenant.
Ce n'est pas que tu penses que
je peux pas gérer Thanksgiving.
Le truc, c'est que tu peux pas
gérer Thanksgiving sans moi.
C'est ridicule. S'il y a une chose,
dont je n'ai pas besoin, c'est toi.
Qu'est-ce que...
Oh, mon Dieu ! Au feu !
Papa ?
Combien de fois dois-je te dire
- de pas mettre de tissu près du feu.
- Tu sais quoi ?
- Je m'en occupe.
- Tu peux vraiment pas t'en occuper.
Comme si je devais
plus jamais compter sur toi.
Gary ! Je me suis coupé le pied.
Aide-moi !
C'est une coupure géante, mon enfant.
Tu vas avoir besoin de points.
- Ton dîner.
- Merci, maman.
Beaucoup de sang par ici.
J'ai des vertiges.
- Tu es pâle comme un fantôme.
- Il est toujours comme ça, en fait.
Krandall, mets ta tête entre tes jambes.
- C'est pas le moment de m'insulter !
- Ça t'empêchera de t'évanouir.
Désolé, avec le contexte, je croyais
que tu voulais dire autre chose.
Charlie, amène la voiture.
Il faut l'emmener à l'hôpital.
D'accord.
- Bière ?
- Bien sûr.
Vous voulez voir mes sous-vêtements ?
Ils la recousent en ce moment.
Ils disent que c'est leur 4e
accidents dû aux ignames ce soir.
- Thanksgiving. Qui l'eut cru ?
- Oui. Les vacances sont folles.
Ne divorce pas.
Tu vas perdre la moitié de tes affaires,
la moitié de ton argent
et quoi qu'il arrive, ta femme trouvera
toujours un moyen de te crier dessus.
Tu as l'air de bien t'en sortir.
Oui, en apparence, mais quand
je suis seul chez moi, à l'intérieur,
je suis assez triste,
et je pleure beaucoup.
- Vraiment ?
- Non. C'est formidable.
Merci.
Hé, alligator, comment ça va ?
Super. On a fait deux points à mon pied,
mon diner est gâché,
mes parents vont divorcer,
et j'ai dû écouter une femme blessée
par balle rompre avec son petit-ami,
mais pas à cause
de la blessure par balle.
Je ne vais pas quitter ta mère.
Je relâchais juste un peu la pression.
Merci, papa.
- Et voilà.
- Je vais aller chercher la voiture.
Comment va la dame de fer ?
Je m'en veux de t'avoir appelé
quand je me suis coupée.
Mon fiancé est médecin,
mon père est médecin, et je fais quoi ?
J'appelle un peintre
que j'aime même pas.
Ne sois pas trop dure avec toi.
Tu m'as appelé par défaut, tu sais ?
Ta mère était ivre, mon père était
défoncé, Krandall avait des vertiges,
et soyons honnêtes, ton père est
chiropracteur ça ne compte pas vraiment.
C'est juste...
J'étais pas préparée à la difficulté
que seraient ces premières vacances.
Oui.
Toute la journée a été assez bizarre.
Bizarre ? J'ai volé une dinde, Gary.
Je suis pas fière de ça.
J'étais pas vraiment prêt
à le faire sans toi non plus,
parce que tu es la seule à savoir
comment j'aime ma tarte à la citrouille.
Sèche.
Je crois qu'on a pas été séparé
assez longtemps
pour que je puisse passer ces fêtes,
sans qu'on soit tous ensemble.
T'as les enfants pour Noël.
Je pourrais venir avec eux.
Non. Je serais surement prête d'ici là.
OK, c'est bon alors, non ?
C'était un sacré bon repas.
Un frère peut-il faire
un glou-glou pour la dinde ?
Glou-glou !
Glou-glou !
Je voudrais tous vous remercier
d'avoir sauvé ce que vous pouviez
de ma cuisine et de l'avoir ramené ici.
Et je voudrais remercier Connie
d'être ma femme.
Eh bien, merci.
Remets tes chaussures.
Nous ne sommes pas des bohémiens.
Pourquoi papy Jack mange tout le temps ?
Il a juste un bon appétit, OK ?
Et pourquoi sa chemise sent
comme mon professeur d'art ?
- C'est l'encens, Tom.
- L'encens qui tue.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Brooks is at the 20.
He's at the 15.
There's only one more man to beat.
Hi. Are you enjoying yourself?
Well, I was at first, and
then I realized the man I was married
to for 15 years was trying
to score with a dead, frozen animal.
How do you think I feel 15 years having
to sleep with a dead, frozen animal?
Very nice. Very nice.
All right, Gary, i'm gonna let that go,
but I do want to ask you one thing.
Please. Why are you being so stubborn?
Just come to my house
for Thanksgiving with the kids.
No. Thanksgiving is at my house this
year. You agreed to it Allison. Come on.
Yes, I know, but seriously, Gary,
are you going to attempt
to roast a turkey?
I mean, we both know you're not capable
of putting together a thanksging dinner.
OK, I think I am capable, and that's
what scares the stuffing out of you.
Yeah. I bet you can't even tell me
what goes in stuffing.
Everything in this box...
With either water or something
called chicken stock. It's my choice.
- Anybody home?
- It's my dad!
That means he got past
the dogs at the airport.
- Hey, dad!
- Hey, Gary.
Your kids are just growing up so fast.
Yeah. They're amazing, man.
You should see them put away groceries.
- They're like artists, really.
- Thanks, dad.
I'm glad you appreciate the effort.
Come on, Louise.
Let's go put away groceries.
That was a con, you Dummy.
- And you.
- Hi, Jack.
How you doing?
Boy.
I hate to say it in front of my son,
but divorce suits you.
Well, I hate to say it in front of your
son, too, but I've never been happier.
This is nice, a little laugh
between the man who gave me life
and the woman who destroyed it.
Come on, Jack.
What have you been doing?
Well, I...
I've been traveling. Yeah?
I was shacked up with
an eskimo woman for a while.
You know, the eskimo people, they
have 100 different words for "get out."
- You want to show me to my room?
- OK.
Here we are.
- I'm sleeping on the couch?
- No. You're not sleeping on the couch.
I bought you a bed, my man.
Daddy, look at this?
An air mattress. Great.
Where do I dig my latrine?
You know, Jack, your room
is still available over at my house.
- Really?
- No, no. Maybe, but no.
My dad's staying here
with me and the kids.
You still got that shower
that gets you everywhere at once?
Yeah, I do.
'Cause two weeks in Baja, and
I'm still carrying a lot of beach on me.
I have a shower here, too, dad.
You know what?
I also had to replace that old bed with
a nice pillow-top mattress, and
I promise not to say a word if you want
to burn your incense.
That's OK, Allison. Look, my father
is staying here for Thanksgiving.
The kids are staying
here for Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving
is staying here for Thanksgiving.
The only thing that's not staying
here for Thanksgiving is you. Bye.
OK. OK, Gary.
But the offer stands, Jack,
and I know that my mom
would love to see you.
Wait a minute.
The exquisite Connie is there?
I should have let mano shave my back.
Vanessa pulled up out back, dad.
Hey, that's my friend. She's super hot.
And I told her you're not blind,
so don't do the
"I'm just shaking your hands" gag.
No. It's Parker.
You don't have to play
with Parker, Tommy,
but you do have to be
nice to Vanessa's son, OK?
I know that, but he always hits me.
- That's his age.
- In the testicles.
Hey, my dad's here.
You want to meet him?
Yeah. Great.
How are you going to introduce us?
I'll tell him you're a friend of mine,
we used to date,
and every once in a while,
you call me just to have sex.
I do not!
I know, but I'm just letting you know,
that is on the table.
Louise, where's grandpa?
He left with mom.
He said our water pressure was too low
to get all the sand
out of pirate's cove.
Oh, my gosh. She stole my dad.
She lured him away with the promise
of a mattress and a sandless crack.

- Honey.
- What?
Your pie seems a little dry.
Did Gary like dry pie?
Mom, I don't know.
You're gonna have to ask Gary, OK?
I can't. You drove him away.
I did not drive him away, OK?
I mean, why can't you just be happy
for me now that I've found Walter?
I am,
but your fiance seems a little.
Now, how do I say this politely.
Antiquey.
Mom, he is a brilliant therapist,
and he is handsome and caring,
and he's only 15 years older than me.
I told your father he should have
hugged you more as a teenager, but...
Your little breasts frightened him.
- What did I do now?
- Withheld affection from your daughter,
darling, but you're a scratch
golfer now, so it was worth it.
Now, Allie knows I love her?
Don't you, alligator?
Of course. Of course I do.
There it is. OK. There it is. OK.
Yes, Walter, it's a hell of a fish tank.
Thank you. I toyed with the
idea of becoming a marine biologist,
but we Krandalls are
not a buoyant people.
There's a common expression in sweden.
**(Suedois)**
Which means
"to sink like a Krandall."
Charlie, you rushed right past us. Come
back in. I just got some whistler crabs.
You know, they have a cream for that.
Do we have any beer?
Charlie, you do not need a beer.
It dulls your senses.
You're right. I'm gonna
eat turkey and take a nap later.
I better be on my toes.
- I see the beer.
- Like a menopausal Superman.
Connie, is it possible you
get younger every time I see you?
I don't know, Jack.
Is it possible you're stoned?
It's always possible.
One of the biggest
football days of the year,
and you replaced
the television with an aquarium.
This is every bit
as entertaing as football.
Look! A box fish just swam
through the Fiji finger coral.
That's the Marine equivalent
of a touchdown right there.
Which one of those fish
would kill me if I ate it?
All right!
You watching the Dallas game?
No, no, no, but we just watched
a carp take a dump underwater.
First of all, a carp
is a freshwater fish. Second of all,
all fish eliminate waste underwater,
so it's funny on two levels.
- You really don't have to try so hard.
- Sorry. Dad?
- So, Gary, what do you want?
- I want my dad back, Allison.
What? I got in the car to come back
here, and he jumped in all excited,
like we were going to the dog park.
Come on, Allison. With all the
hot shower talk and the pillow-top
bed and the liberal incense policy,
you sold this place
like it was Woody Harrelson's
bed and breakfast.
Gary, if you want to be with your dad,
then just bring the kids over,
and we'll have Thanksgiving dinner here.
No, Allison,
you're not stealing my Thanksgiving. No.
I am not taking a jacuzzi
with you, Jack.
Connie, it's a soak in a hot tub,
not an invite to burning man.
- Hi Gary.
- Hi honey, good to see you.
Connie and I are about to take a jacuz.
I am not taking a jacuzzi!
Dad, what are you doing? Get in the car.
Let's go back my house.
That's where Thanksgiving is this year.
Come on, Gar. Why don't
you just bring the kids over here?
- You putting on your bathing suit?
- I am not putting on a bathing suit!
Far out!
All right. You win, Allison.
We should have
Thanksgiving here. I'll go get the kids,
and I'll bring them over, all right?
You see? Was that so hard?
I mean, look. I mean, you try,
but Thanksgiving is what I do.
Can we still have our touch football
game at my house with the kids?
Of course.
Would you do me a favor?
Would you get Louise's sneakers for me?
- Yeah. I'll be right back.
- OK. Thank you.
Sure.
I'm just looking at the beers.
Like little puppies in a window.
I think the little sad
one is my favorite.
Charlie, I'm not gonna lie to you.
I have so much imported
beer in my refrigerator,
I barely have any room
for all the domestic beer I just bought.
I could really use a drinker.
Well, that's tempting, but if I left,
Connie would cut off my giblet bag.
Come to my house.
Come to my house, Charlie.
The second half of the Dallas game
is about to start.
I have a bird in the oven,
a 42-inch flat screen, no fish.
- I'll be in the car.
- Atta boy!
- Gary, this place is great.
- Yeah. It's small, but it's crappy.
And it smells like a bar.
You know, it didn't come that way.
I had to do that all by myself.
My place is like an Indiana Jones movie.
You touch the wrong thing, and you got
this great big boulder bitching at you.
So you eat in here?
Yeah, almost every day,
right in front of the Tv.
Hey, one time,
I had this big thing of ice cream,
and I went up to bed and I forgot about
it, then came down the next morning,
I picked up that sucker,
and I drank it like a giant Malt.
I will rember that story
for the rest of my life.
Vanessa and I beat the boys at football.
Parker was my teammate. He kept trying
to attack him, dad. He doesn't get it.
You told me to attack the guy
with the ball. You had the ball.
My bad.
I'm never having kids!
Oh, my god.
- Hey, sweetie.
- You'll scare it away.
- Charlie, this is my friend Vanessa.
- Hi. You must be Gary dad.
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not. You're Allison's.
Whatever.
- Are you gonna be able to join us?
- I'm all sweaty from football.
I'm gonna go upstairs and
hit the showers, but
save me a beer, and I'll be back
down to watch the game.
You are the greatest man who ever lived.
I'll drink to that.
Let's freshen up our beers. Or
is it time to tap the Pony Keg?
I'm not crying.
I just got some pretzel salt in my eyes.
- Dad, what the hell are you doing?
- Having the best day of my life.
Get in the car.
I'm taking you back. Come on.
Hey, Charlie, I found these two
20-ounce belgian beers way in the back.
They're pretty cold. Sorry about
all the frost clinging to the glass.
Dad, we're going.
- I don't think so, alligator.
- Yeah. He doesn't think so, alligator.
Dad, mom has been looking for you,
Walter is afraid he offended you,
and I haven't seen Jack since he took
the screen out of the kitchen faucet,
grabbed an apple,
and ran out the back door.
Sounds like things are really
falling apart at your house, Allison.
Wouldn't it be so much easier
if everyone just came over here?
Gary's got a beautiful turkey
in the oven. You should see it.
Hey, that reminds me.
I got to go baste my bird.
And check the turkey.
That's a good one. I like that.
You know, dad, with Gary cooking,
there's not gonna be any dinner.
Hey, if he doesn't run out of
"i don't care" juice, I don't care.
Look, Gary, don't worry. It's not ea...
- Who made that for you?
- I made it.
Look at this. It is beautiful.
It should be on the cover
of "better homes than Allison" magazine.
What? Oh, my gosh.
You can actually hear the flavor.
Listen. "I'm delicious."
"In your face."
"I'm delicious."
Stop playing with your stupid bird and
tell my dad he's coming back with me.
Look, you know what? Your dad's a grown
man. He can do whatever he wants.
But whenever you want to exchange
your hostage for my guest, call me.
A Charlie,
why don't you put your feet up? Relax.
Really?
It does look comfortable.
You want to go really crazy?
Take your shoes off first.
Nice. Nice.
This is so wrong.
This is so wrong.
Hey, it's been 20 minutes.
I have to go baste Lucille.
And check your turkey.
All right.
Lucille! Oh, my gosh.
OK. Honey? Lucille?
Allison was in here,
but I didn't see Allison leave.
Allison ate my turkey.
No, no. Allison stole my turkey.
What have you done with my bird?!
Where's my turkey? Where's Lucille?
Who is this?
Don't you play games with me.
You know who this is. I want my turkey!
Your turkey is safe, for now.
It's cooking at an undisclosed location.
Is that how you're
gonna play this, Allison?
Have my dad back at my house
in a half an hour,
or the temperature in the oven goes up
15 degrees for every minute he's late.
You wouldn't dare.
You have no idea what
i'm capable of, Gary.
Bring hiback,
and no one gets overcooked.
Honey, I wasn't snooping, but I was
looking through your underwear drawer.
Mom!
Well, somebody's got to tell you this.
Men don't like granny panties.
- They like the t-back thong, like this.
- like this.
Jack, you weren't supposed to see that.
Well, I did.
I'm downloading it to my hard drive.
OK, before I vomit into my yams, could
you please finish setting the table?
Allison, I got your father in my car.
You know, I had to tell the guy
we were going to a strip club
just to get him out of the house.
- He has to be inside the house, Gary.
- How do I know my bird's OK?
- Please, Gary. Grow up.
- Grow up? You stole my turkey.
- You stole my dad.
- That's because you stole my dad.
But you wouldn't
bring the kids over here.
Should I rinse these, or are we going
for a summer camp vibe?
Gary, you said you were just
popping in to get your VIP Card.
- Charlie, where have you been?
- With Gary,
drinking bear, eating salty snacks,
and putting my feet on furniture.
Hey, Connie,
I put our place cards together,
so right now my spoon
is touching your fork.
- Hi, son.
- Hi, Traitor.
Hold everything.
You put your feet on the furniture?!
Yes, and from now on,
that's how i'm gonna roll.
- Not in my house.
- You're damned right.
I'm moving out.
I want to get a place like Gary's.
- What?
- What?
Score!
You see what you did, Gary?
You happy now?
- What's going on here?
- Today
is Charlie Carswell's Independence Day.
And I will celebrate it every year!
My dad wants a divorce.
This is a marriage counseling emergency.
Mom, dad, I have an opening
a week from tuesday!
Damn it, Gary.
This all your fault. Why couldn't just
bring the kids over the first place?
- What it has to do with anything?
- You would have been here.
You would have gotten my mom off my back
and kept my dad entertained,
You would have taken him to football.
Hold on a second.
This is makes sense to me now.
This isn't about you thinking
I can't handle Thanksgiving.
The real fact of the matter is, you
can't handle Thanksgiving without me.
- That is ridiculous. There's one thing
If there's one thing I don't need,
it's you.
What is that?
Oh, god, Gary! The fire!
All right. Dad, come in here!
How many times do I have to tell you.
- Don't put towels next to the flame.
- You know what? Thanks a lot.
- I can handle it.
- No really, you can't handle it.
Like I would ever depend on your
for anything, like, ever again, Gary.
Gary! I cut my foot. Please help me!
- This is a giant cut here, kiddo.
- You're gonna need some stitches.
- Your dinner.
- Thanks, mom.
A lot of blood down there.
Feeling woozy.
- Walter, you're pale as a ghost.
- Actually, he's always that way.
Krandall,
put your head between your legs.
- This is not a time for insults, Gary!
- It'll keep you from passing out.
Sorry. With our history, I thought
you meant something else entirely.
Hey, Charlie, pull the car around, OK?
We got to take her to the hospital.
All right.
- Beer?
- Sure.
You want to see my underwear?
They're stitching her up now.
You know, they said that's their fourth
yam-related accident tonight.
- Thanksgiving. Who knew?
- Yeah. The holidays are nuts.
Don't get divorced, Charlie.
I mean, you're gonna lost
half your stuff, half your money,
and no matter what, your wife is
still gonna find a way to yell at you.
You seem to be managing just fine.
Yeah, that's on the outside,
but when I'm home alone, on the inside,
I get pretty sad, and I cry a lot.
- Really?
- No. It's awesome.
Thank you.
Hey, alligator, how you doing?
Great. I got a couple of stitches
in my foot,
my dinner is ruined,
my parents are getting divorced,
and I got to hear a woman with a gunshot
wound break up with her boyfriend, but
not because of the gunshot wound.
Well, I'm not leaving your mother.
I was just blowing off steam.
Thanks, dad.
- There we go. There it is.
- I'll go get the car.
How you doing there, hot wheels?
I'm so mad at myself for calling
out your stupid name when I cut my foot.
My fiance's a doctor,
my dad's a doctor, and I what do I do?
I call for a painter I don't even like.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You called for me by default, you know?
Your mom was drunk,
my dad was high, Krandall was Woozy,
and let's be honest, your dad's a
chiropractor. That doesn't really count.
I just...
I wasn't prepared for how hard this
first holiday was gonna be, you know?
Yeah. The whole day was kind of weird.
Weird? I stole a turkey, Gary.
I'm not proud of that.
Look, I wasn't really
ready to do without you either,
because you're the only one that
knows the way I like my pumpkin pie.
Dry.
I just, I just don't think
we've been apart long enough
for me to get through the holidays,
you know, without us all being together.
You have the kids for Christmas.
I could come by with them.
No. I'll probably be ready by then.
OK, that's fine, then, isn't it?
This was a darn good dinner, everybody.
Can a brother get
a gobble-gobble for the turkey?
Gobble-gobble!
Gobble-gobble!
Well, I would like to thank
everybody for salvaging what they could
from my kitchen and
bringing it over here.
And I would like to thank Connie
for being my wife.
Well, thanks, chuckles.
Put your shoes on.
We're not hillbillies.
Why is grandpa Jack always eating?
He just has a good appetite, Tom, OK?
Then why does his shirt
smell like my art teacher?
- That's incense, Tom.
- Killer incense.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Salut, Allison.
Je viens chercher les enfants.
- C'est quoi ça ?
- 24 000 pièces de 5 cents.
Quoi ?
Je me suis arrêté dans un casino indien,
hier en rentrant du travail.
- Et j'ai gagné le jackpot.
- Eh bien...
Félicitations.
Enlève-les de mon évier.
Non. C'est ta pension alimentaire.
En pièces de 5 cents et en avance.
Y a pas de quoi.
- Les enfants, papa est là ! Allons-y !
- Attends.
Tu veux que j'accepte ma pension
alimentaire en pièces de 5 cents ?
Oui. Tu pourrais aussi les ramener
au casino et leur demander des billets.
Pourquoi tu ne l'as pas fait
quand tu y étais ?
Les billets sont légers et se plient.
Les pièces sont lourdes et hilarantes.
- Salut, papa.
- Salut, chérie. Tout ça !
Je suis contente que tu m'aies dissuadé
de jouer de la flûte, maman.
Chérie, tu me remercieras de t'avoir
fait découvrir le violoncelle.
Voilà.
Si jamais j'ai besoin de me débarasser
d'un corps, je serai équipée.
J'arrive dans une minute.
Tu crois que je pourrais conduire
jusqu'à l'école ?
Je t'ai vu jouer à GTA.
Et tant que tu conduiras pas
sans monter sur un trottoir ou
tuer un proxénète, je dois dire "non".
Je peux avoir les enfants, jeudi ?
Je dois le savoir tout de suite. 12 sec.
10, 10 secs. Réponds-moi !
Je te les laisserai mercredi.
- Y a quoi mercredi ?
- 5 secs !
Tu me fais peur !
Quoi ?! Oui !
OK. OK. Allez.
- Qu'est qui se passe ?
- Allez. C'est bon. Allison, du calme.
J'ai réussi, ouais ! J'ai réussi !
Je comprends pourquoi j'ai jamais
trouvé ton point G. Il est dans ta main.
- C'était quoi tout ça ?
- J'enchérissais en ligne
sur des places de concert
pour les enfants et moi. Et j'ai gagné.
- Tu les emmènes à un concert ?
- Oui. Michael Bolton.
Michael Bolton ?!
Je le savais. Tu détestes les enfants.
Ils ont ruiné ton corps, n'est-ce pas ?
Je savais que ça allait
te poser un problème.
Bien sûr. Leur premier concert
ne devrait pas être Michael Bolton.
Je suis sûr
que c'est un type bien
et que depuis l'espace,
il ressemble à une sorte d'humain.
Mais, si j'avais su
que tu voulais échanger pour ça,
j'aurais pas accepté.
Pourquoi ça ne serait pas leur premier
concert ? J'adore Michael Bolton.
Tu te souviens ? J'avais mis son CD
en salle d'accouchement, pour Louise.
Et ils ont dû mettre une ventouse
sur sa tête pour la faire sortir.
Eh bien, c'est trop tard.
Le contrat de divorce stipule qu'un
accord pour échanger est définitif.
N'y a-t'il pas aussi
une clause qui stipule
que l'on peut échanger à nouveau
pour un concert de Michael Bolton ?
Je peux pas gérer ça. Tu m'as dit que
je pouvais avoir les enfants, point.
Je les emmène au concert.
Fin de la discussion.
Regardez qui est là. L'arrière-arrière
grand-père de Lance Armstrong.
Prête pour notre ballade ?
Oui. Dès que j'ai mis Gary dehors.
Allez.
Dois-je lancer sa balle préférée dehors
et fermer dès qu'il part la chercher ?
Tu sais quoi, Krandall ?
Voilà des pièces de 5 cents.
Je suis sûr que c'était à la mode
quand t'étais jeune. Tu peux aller...
voir un film,
t'acheter du pain.
Peut-être, acheter des bons
pour nos soldats à l'étranger.
Là-bas, là-bas...
C'est vraiment trop serré.

Michael Bolton ?! Ça aura l'odeur

Ça ressemblera à un concert de rock.
Mais pour ceux qui y seront,
ça sera comme s'ils étaient coincés

Tu peux arrêter de parler

Faire ta pizza.
C'est assez explicite.

Quel a été ton premier concert ?

Tu vois ! Ça, c'est un concert.
C'est un grand moment de sa vie.
- Quel a été ton premier concert ?
- Van Halen.
- Roth ou Hagar ?
- David Lee, mon pote.
Au premier rang.
Diamond Dave a sauté dans la foule
et a cassé mon bras droit.
Hé. Regarde.
Il est toujours plus petit que l'autre.
Tu vois, c'est ça qui est important
pour un 1er concert.
Ça doit être un gros, un grand souvenir.
Demande-moi
quel a été mon premier concert ?
- Quel a été...
- Scott Baio.
- Qui ?
- Scott Baio.
- D'Happy Days ?
- Scott Baio d'Happy Days.
C'est pas très connu, mais
le petit cousin de Fonzy a fait
deux albums en 1982.
Et ma cousine Gwen m'a trainé
à un de ses concerts.
Et elle m'a acheté un T-shirt
avec la tête de Scott Baio dessus.
Ma mère me l'a fait porter
à l'école le lendemain,
pour pas blesser Gwen.
- C'est terrible.
- Le jour de la photo de classe.
J'arrive pas à croire
que je sois ami avec toi.
J'arrive pas à croire
que j'ai couché avec toi.
Pourquoi Allison les emmènerait
à leur 1er concert ?
Pourquoi tu trouverais pas un autre
concert auquel les emmener avant ?
Bruce Springsteen passe
la semaine prochaine.
Vraiment ? C'est une super idée que
30 000 autres personnes ont eu
à la minute où ils l'ont annoncé.
Eh bien, gros malin, ils vendent
des places avant le concert aussi.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui. Il y a des annulations
ou des places supplémentaires.
Ça arrive tout le temps.
Faut juste faire la queue tôt
parce qu'il y aura du monde.
Mon Dieu !
C'est fantastique.
T'imagines que le premier concert de Tom
et Louise sera Bruce Springsteen ?
Ce serait super. Pas aussi cool
que David Lee t'écrasant le bras.
Mais bien quand même.
Ça fait bien 10 cm.
Tu sais que quand je nage,
je tourne en rond ?
Chérie, allez.
J'ai promis à ta mère que
tu t'entraînerais au violoncelle.
Tu dois t'entraîner.
Mais c'est embarrassant. Les gens
vont me prendre pour une artiste de rue.
Ils veulent me donner de l'argent.
C'est bien. Si on a assez d'argent,
on pourra sûrement se garer
dans le jardin de quelqu'un,
devant le stade. Allez.
Hé, je fais des divisions difficiles.
J'ai besoin d'un peu d'amour aussi !
Emmène ta sœur acheter
un soda. D'accord ?
- Bonsoir.
- Comment ça va ?
- Grande fan de Springsteen ?
- Oui.
J'espère que vous ne faites pas la queue
pour un billet à la sauvette.
Parce que c'est illégal.
Non.
Je suis juste une fan de Springsteen.
Bien sûr.
Quelle est la 5e chanson
du CD 1 de Born to Run ?
Il n'y a pas de chanson 5.
C'est une supposition exceptionnelle.
Excusez-moi. Gary !
Qu'est-ce qu'il te prend ?!
Je viens donner 1$ à un gamin des rues
parce qu'il ressemblait à Tom,
puis j'ai réalisé que c'était Tom !
Pourquoi je viens chercher mes enfants
sur Hollywood Boulevard ?
C'est une sorte d'urgence.
Tu vois, ce guichet va ouvrir
dans deux heures.
Et je vais avoir des places
pour Springsteen.
Et alors, tu les emmènes, à 8h,
un jour d'école, à rester assis
sur un trottoir dégueulasse comme
des enfants SDF, pour avoir des places ?
Oui. Ils vont se souvenir
de cette soirée toute leur vie.
J'espère que ce concert n'est pas
le même soir que Michael Bolton.
- Non, C'est le soir d'avant.
- Gary, j'arrive pas à y croire.
T'arrives pas à supporter que
je les emmène à leur premier concert.
Faut que tu trouves un concert
le jour d'avant, juste pour m'embêter ?
Non. Je veux pas t'embêter.
Je veux pas que leur 1er concert
soit un désastre.
Je veux que ce soit un bon souvenir. Il
s'agit juste d'offrir de bons souvenirs.
Je voulais que notre nuit de noce
soit un bon souvenir
et puis j'ai découvert ta politique
"s'il y a Die Hard, je dois le regarder".
On a parlé de ça combien de fois ?
MCclane
veut être avec sa famille pour Noël.
Mais il peut pas
être avec sa famille pour Noël parce
qu'il doit sauver le Nakatomi Plaza.
Écoute-moi. Nous allons passer
un super moment avec Michael Bolton.
Et tu ne les auras pas mercredi soir,
juste pour pouvoir
gêner mon concert, OK ?
Même si c'est pour Bruce.
- Mon Dieu, fermez-la !
- D'accord, écoute.
Juste entre toi et moi. Écoute.
Tu dois me laisser les enfants
parce que t'as accepté d'échanger. Non ?
Notre divorce stipule qu'une fois
qu'on a échangé les nuits,
- on ne peut pas faire machine arrière.
- Très bien.
Mais on en a pas fini. OK ?
Allez les enfants.
Rassemblez vos affaires, on y va.
Je pense que c'est méprisable.
Même pour toi.
J'ai dit "toi" !
Je crois que je vais être malade.
Chérie, t'as vu ce qui est arrivé
au chat des voisins ?
Non. Il s'est passé quoi ?
Il fait une sieste sur la route.
Il est adorable. Il a l'air en paix.
Et il a ce sourire sur son visage
"Les lundis, c'est chiant."
Pourquoi es-tu malade, chérie ?
Parce que maman a laissé Tom
conduire dans le parking de l'église.
Ta mère a laissé Tom
conduire la voiture ?
Si on appelle ça conduire.
Arrêt, marche. Arrêt, marche.
Arrêt, marche. Barf !
- Hé, papa. Maman m'a laissé conduire.
- Oui, j'ai entendu. C'est formidable.
Regarde ça.
J'ai fait un virage à droite si parfait,
que le clignotant
s'est arrêté tout seul.
Tu l'as laissé conduire. Je suis
son père. C'est le boulot du père.
Les pères apprennent à leur fils
à conduire depuis des milliers d'années.
Désolé, Tom m'a demandé
s'il pouvait essayer.
Je savais que tu voulais le faire.
Et puis je me suis souvenu que
tu m'avais volé leur premier concert.
Et ensuite, nous nous sommes retrouvés
à rouler entre les haies
à nous faire insulter par les nonnes.
Alors...
Si tu es sûre de vouloir
la jouer comme ça,
fais attention et attache ta ceinture.
Parce que je peux faire pareil.
Ça me rappelle que j'ai emmené Louise
faire son premier tour de grand huit.
- T'as pas fait ça.
- Si. Elle est enfin assez grande.
- Tom, je peux te voir une seconde ?
- Oui, bien sûr.
Louise, j'ai un cadeau pour toi.
Il est sur ton lit.
- Merci, papa.
- De rien.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Eh bien, ton papa va t'apprendre
à te raser.
Et voilà.
- Raser quoi ?
- Raser ta...
Ta barbe, toi le gros poilu.
Allons !
- À quoi sert la trousse de secours ?
- Et si on répondait à cette question
si et quand on en a besoin ?
Voilà la crème à raser.
- Je sais ce qu'est de la crème à raser.
- OK. Bien. Fais-en mousser ici.
Très bien.
Et voilà.
Vas-y.
Sers-toi du miroir, fils.
Ça te dérange pas
que j'ai pas de poils sur le visage ?
Non, tu es un Brooks.
Tu descends d'une lignée de gens
incroyablement poilus.
Tu te souviens de tante Rose ?
Qui m'a appris à me raser, à ton avis ?
Et fils, ce sont ses outils
qui font un homme.
Assure-toi d'utiliser un rasoir
fait par une entreprise
qui fait aussi des stylos à bille.
Ils sont excellents parce que
creux à l'intérieur.
Et si tu te coupes et saignes à mort,
tu peux appeler au secours.
Essaie.
Essaie. Vas-y. Vas-y.
Et voilà. Tu t'amuses ?
- Oui.
- Bien. C'est bien.
Parce qu'à partir de maintenant,
ça va vraiment te faire suer.
- Alors, pourquoi le faire aujourd'hui ?
- Parce que c'est une étape importante.
Père et fils faisant des choses
pour la première fois.
Mon père ne me l'a pas appris.
Il en veut toujours à ma tante Rose.
Tu te fiches de moi ?
C'est ta première brassière, chérie.
Félicitations.
Merci, mais j'ai vraiment
pas besoin de ce genre de pression.
J'ai une surprise. Si on allait
chez Burgeroo pour le dîner ?
J'ai appelé ta mère,
elle est d'accord.
- D'accord.
- Et voilà. Et voilà.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Je prends des photos de vous.
Regardez. Vous êtes si mignons.
Scotty, rapproche-toi.
Sois pas timide.
Ton père devrait voir ça.
Vous faites toujours ça
avant d'aller chez Burgeroo ?
On va chez Burgeroo ?
Pas toi, Tom.
Louise et Scotty vont
à leur premier rencart.
Quoi ?!
C'est pas vraiment un rencart.
Allez attendre à la voiture.
J'arrive dans une minute.
Il faut que je dise
quelque chose à Tommy.
Pourquoi je peux pas
aller chez Burgeroo ?
Eh bien, ta sœur a un rencart.
Ce qui m'amène à quelque chose
de très important dont on devrait parler,
mais j'ai pas beaucoup de temps,
alors, écoute bien. Voilà.
Quand un homme et une femme
s'aiment beaucoup...
J'ai déjà parlé de ça avec papa.
Les drogues.
- Quelqu'un te donne de la drogue...
- Ça aussi.
Très bien.
Le jeu s'appelle le Black Jack.
Guéri.
Guéri.
Désolé de vous interrompre,
Dr. Krandall,
mais il y a un Lewis et Tom
qui veut vous voir.
- Lewis et Tom ?
- Louise. Je m'appelle Louise.
- Est-ce que je ressemble à un Lewis ?
- Ça va. Laissez-les entrer, Ellen.
C'est une surprise.
- Hé, Dr. K.
- Tout va bien ?
Pas vraiment.
Il faut qu'on te parle.
Veuillez vous asseoir.
Comment êtes-vous venu ?
Nous avons pris les transports publics.
Et si le reste du monde le faisait...
Un problème à la fois, OK ?
Les choses deviennent incontrôlables
entre maman et papa.
Dites-moi ce qu'il se passe.
Eh bien, papa nous a emmenés
au Mexique l'autre jour.
- Ça a l'air sympa.
- Pour dîner.
On a fait 6 heures de route pour
passer 10 minutes à un stand de tacos.
Pourquoi ferait-il ça ?
Pour qu'il soit avec nous
la première fois où on sortait du pays.
Ça a l'air plutôt extrême.
Non, ça c'est quand maman
m'a emmené visiter la fac d'état.
OK, c'est dingue.
Bien sûr.
Moi dans une école d'état ? Voyons...
Tu fais quoi ici ?
Les enfants m'ont appelé
pour me dire de venir.
Moi aussi.
Pourquoi es-tu dehors ?
La porte est fermée.
Comme verrouillée de l'intérieur.
C'est ton avis de scientifique ?
Intérieur ? Le contraire d'extérieur ?
J'avais un verrou à l'extérieur,
mais j'en ai eu marre
qu'on m'enferme chez moi !
- C'est important ?
- D'accord. Allons-y.
Tommy ? Louise ?
Il se passe quoi ici ?
Walter, que fais-tu ici ?
Tom et Louise sont
venus à mon bureau,
me parler de la petite compétition
dans laquelle vous vous êtes engagés.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils font là-bas ?
C'est un broyeur à papier ?
- Et ce sont mes places ?
- Exact.
3 places pour Springsteen,
3 places pour Michael Bolton.
Louise, chérie, je t'aime tellement.
Chérie,
ne laisse pas les places de Bolton
toucher celles de Springsteen. OK ?
Tu as de plus gros problèmes.
Tes enfants sont pas heureux avec toi.
Tu veux nous laisser entrer ?
C'était juste le reçu.
Ai-je toute votre attention là ?
Oui. Oui, tu l'as.
Si je vous laisse entrer, allez-vous
écouter ce qu'ils ont à dire ?
Et ne pas essayer
d'attraper les places ?
- Oui.
- Je le promets. Oui
- D'accord.
- D'accord.
OK. On est là.
C'est cool. Ça va, ça va.
Pourquoi t'as les mains en l'air ?
C'est pas un braquage.
- Désolé, je savais pas.
- Non. Non. Garde-les en l'air.
D'accord, d'accord Tommy.
C'est toi le chef.
Très bien, ne faisons rien d'insensé.
Tom, Louise. Rien d'insensé.
Insensé ? Comme acheter à ta fille
de 11 ans un soutien-gorge géant ?
- Sérieux ? T'as fait ça ?
- Je pensais qu'elle grandirait avec.
Qu'est-ce qui te fait penser...
Non. Non. En arrière !
Pardon. Ma faute.
C'était Springsteen ou Bolton ?
Qu'est-ce que tu comprends pas
dans "les places et la broyeuse" ?
- Oh, mon Dieu.
- Je m'excuse, Louise. On s'assied,
et on vous écoute, allez-y.
À toi de commencer.
On veut que vous arrêtiez
de nous forcer à faire
ce pour quoi on est pas encore prêt.
- Comme se raser, avoir des rencarts.
- Et conduire.
En fait, conduire j'ai aimé.
J'en voudrais plus.
- Mais le reste doit cesser.
- Gary, Allison.
Je crois que vos enfants méritent
une explication pour votre comportement.
Quand votre père
et moi étions mariés,
on était ensemble et on voyait
toutes ces premières fois,
ensemble.
Marcher, parler...
Faire du vélo, perdre une dent,
faire un tour en ambulance.
Tout ça est arrivé
en un après-midi pour toi, Tommy.
Je crois qu'on a simplement peur de
- rater toutes ces choses, vous voyez ?
- Mais ça va se passer.
Et on a besoin de savoir comment vous
allez gérer ça en tant que divorcés.
Question : mon premier bal
de fin d'année, qu'allez-vous faire ?
Hé, c'est pour moi.
Hé! Attends ! Attends ! Non !
Je vais appeler ton père.
L'inviter et l'inclure.
Et on lui montrera la robe.
Je prendrai des photos.
Et je ferai
des doubles pour ta mère.
Et j'emmènerai ton cavalier
dans le jardin,
et lui montrerai à quelle vitesse
je peux creuser une tombe.
Bonne réponse.
Même si je ne participerai jamais
à un tel rituel sexiste et dépassé.
Mais si je le fais,
je veux être vraiment jolie.
Nous voulons faire les choses ensemble,
avec vous. Et nous allons essayer.
Et si quelqu'un n'est pas là, on fera
en sorte que son esprit soit avec nous.
- Quoi ?!
- Quoi ? C'était quoi ?
Je sais pas.
Je suis ivre de pouvoir.
Donne-m'en un peu.
Tu te les gardes tous.
Hé ! Tommy, arrête !
Ça suffit. Je suis votre père.
Je dis que ça doit se terminer.
Donnez-moi les places.
C'est quoi ces trucs ?
Les ratés freudiens ?
Ce sont les restes d'un petit truc qu'on
avait faits avec 3 amis psychiatres.
On était en quelque sorte là
pour les gens cliniquement dépressifs.
T'es un homme étrange, Krandall.
Donne-moi mes places.
D'accord.
Désolé d'avoir dû vous faire subir ça.
- Mais ça a été efficace.
- Oui. OK. Voilà.
Salut, les places
pour Bruce Springsteen.
C'est fantastique.
C'est vraiment super.
Vous allez vivre le meilleur moment
de votre vie en allant à ce concert.
Avec votre maman.
Quoi ?
Je croyais que tu nous y emmenais.
J'allais le faire. Mais elle a raison.
C'était son idée de vous emmener
à votre premier concert.
Et je voulais juste lui voler ça.
Et ce n'est pas bien.
Votre mère devrait vous y emmener.
Si tu veux aller voir Bruce.
Tu te moques de moi ? Bruce !
Allez les enfants, ça va swinguer !
Les enfants, vous pensez pas
qu'on pourrait acheter
à votre père
une place pour Springsteen ?
Temps mort.
C'est assez cher, Allison.
Je sais pas si on peut se le permettre.
Tu sais ce qu'on pourrait faire.
On pourrait vendre
les places pour Bolton.
Et avec cet argent
on pourrait acheter un café.
Et on pourrait le boire
en pensant à comment
acheter une place pour Springsteen.
Je crois que j'ai assez
de pièces de 5 cents
dans ma cuisine pour t'en acheter une.
D'accord.
Et avec l'argent restant, on pourra
t'acheter une place pour Michael Bolton.
Tu vois quelque chose ?
Et combien de fois ce type va nous
demander si on est prêt pour du rock ?
On a tous clairement dit qu'on était
prêt. Qu'est-ce qu'il veut de plus ?
J'arrive pas à croire qu'on doive aller
à un autre truc comme ça demain.
On est tourné du bon côté au moins ?
- Je voudrais rentrer.
- Ne leur gâche pas ça.
Ces souvenirs resteront
toute leur vie.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Hey. Hi, Allison. I'm here for the kids.
- What. What is that?
- 24,000 nickels.
What?
I stopped at an Indian casino
on the way home from work last night.
- And I hit a jackpot.
- Well...
Congratulations.
Now get them out of my sink.
No. This is your alimony payment.
To the nickel, and it's early.
You're welcome.
- Kids, daddy's here! Let's go!
- Wait a minute.
You expect me to accept
my spousal support in nickels?
Yeah. I mean, you could take
it back to the casino and ask for Bills.
Why wouldn't you do
that when you were there?
Cause Bills are light and they bend.
And nickels are heavy and hilarious.
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, sweetie. Wide load.
I'm so glad you talked
me out of playing the flute, mom.
Louise, honey, you will thank
me for introducing you to the cello.
Here you go.
Well, if I ever need to
dispose of a body, I'll be ready.
I'll be out in a minute, guys.
You think maybe I can
drive the car to school?
I've seen you play Grand Theft Auto.
And until you can operate a vehicle
without jumping the curb and killing
a pimp, I have to say "no."
Can I have the kids next thursday?
I need to know right now. 12 seconds.
Thurs... well thursday...
10 seconds, tell me now.
I'll let you have them on wednesday.
- You're freaking me out, i'm scared!
- What?! Yes! Yes!
OK. OK. Come on.
- What happened?
- Come on. OK. Allison, steady. Steady.
I did it, yeah! I did it!
No wonder I could never find your
G-spot. It's in the Palm of your hand.
- What was that all about?
- I was bidding online
for concert tickets for me and the kids.
And I scored.
- You're taking them to a concert?
- Yeah. Michael Bolton.
Michael Bolton?!
I knew it. I knew it. You hate the kids.
It's 'cause they ruined your body,
isn't it?
I knew you were going to have
a problem with this.
I have a problem with it. Their first
concert shouldn't be Michael Bolton.
I'm sure Michael Bolton's a nice guy
and from outerspace looks like
a human being of sorts.
But come on, I mean, if I knew
that's why you wanted to switch days,
I wouldn't have agreed to it.
Why shouldn't this be their first
concert? I mean, I love Michael Bolton.
Remember? I played a CD in the delivery
room when I gave Birth to Louise.
That's why they had to put a suction cup
on her head and pull her out of you.
Well, Gary, it's too late.
Our divorce agreement states that once
we agree to switch nights, it's final.
Isn't there also a stipulation
in the divorce agreement
that we can switch back in the event
of a Michael Bolton concert?
I can't deal with this. OK? You told me
I could have the kids. That's it.
I'm taking them to the concert.
Discussion over.
Look who it is. It's Lance Armstrong's
great-great-grand father.
You ready for our bike ride?
Yeah. As soon as I get
Gary out of here. Come on.
Shall I throw his favorite ball
out the door
and close it after he gives chase?
You know what Krandall?
Here. Have some nickels.
I bet nickels were popular
when you were a lad. You can go...
Go to a picture show.
Get yourself some bread.
Maybe buy war bonds
for the boys overseas.
Over there, over there
those are way too tight, Krandall.

Michael Bolton? I mean, come on.
Michael Bolton?!
It's gonna smell like a rock concert.
It'll look like a rock concert. But
to the people that are actually there,
it's gonna be like they're
all stuck in an elevator!
Can you please stop gripping
about your concert issues long enough
- to make your own pizza.
- All right. What am I supposed to do?
Make your own pizza.
It's Kinda self-explanatory.
So, what's the big deal with
the Michael Bolton thing anyway?
I'll tell you what the big deal is.
It's a big moment your first concert.
Tell me what your first concert was.
Don't even think about it. Just say it.
OK. 1995. Willtern Theater.
I saw REM, radio head, and a very
angry look on my mother's face
when I snuck into the house
at 4:00 morning.
See that. Yeah! Now, that's a concert.
That's a big moment in her life.
- What was your first concert, Dennis?
- Van Halen.
- Roth or Hagar?
- David Lee, man.
Front row.
Diamond Dave jumped into the crowd
and Broke my right arm.
Heh. Look.
It's still shorter than the other one.
See that's what's important
about a first concert.
It's gotta be a big, great memory.
You know?
Ask me what my first concert was?
- OK. What was your.
- Scott Baio.
- Who?
- Scott Baio.
- From Happy Days?
- Scott Baio from Happy Days.
It's a little known fact.
Fonzy's little cousin cut
a couple of albums back in 1982.
And my cousin Gwen dragged
me to his boys night out concert.
And she bought me a Tank top
with Scott Baio's face on it.
And my mother made me wear
it to school the next day
so I wouldn't hurt Gwen's Feelings.
- That is awful.
- On picture day.
I can't believe i'm even
friends with you, man.
Dude, I can't believe I slept with you.
Why does Allison get to
take them to their first concert?
Well, why don't you just find
another concert to take them to first?
Bruce Springsteen's playing
at the forum next week.
Really? That's great idea that
30,000 other people
had the minute they announced it.
Well, smarty pants, they always release
a handful of tickets before the show.
- Really?
- Yeah. Comps that cancel or
extra seats that open up.
It happens all the time.
You just gotta get in line early because
every scalper in town will be there.
Oh, my gosh!
That's fantastic.
Can you imagine Tom and Louise's
first concert Being Springsteen?
That be amazing. I mean it's not as cool
as David Lee roth smashing your arm.
But it's still pretty good.
It's a good 4 inches.
You know when I swim,
I just go in circles.
Louise, sweetheart, come on.
I promised your mom that you would
practice your cello tonight.
You have to practice.
But dad it's embarrassing.
People think i'm a street performer.
They keep trying to hand me money.
That's good. If we get enough money,
we can probably park
on someone's Lawn outside
the stadium. Come on.
Hey, I'm doing long division.
How about a little love for me!
Hey, Tommy, why don't you take
your sister to go get a soda. OK?
- Good evening.
- Howdy do.
- Big Springsteen fan?
- Yes, I am.
You know I hope you're not standing
in line for a ticket scalper, ma'am.
Because that is illegal.
No. I'm just a Springsteen fan like you.
Sure.
What's track 5 on side 1 of born to run?
There is no track 5.
That's an exceptional guess.
Excuse me. Gary! Gary!
What the hell?!
I just gave a street kid a dollar
because he looked like Tom,
and then I realized he was Tom!
Why am I picking up
my kids on Hollywood Boulevard?
It's kind of an emergency Allison.
See, that ticket window
is gonna open in 2 hours.
And I'm getting tickets
to see Springsteen.
So what, you have them here at 8:00
on a school night sitting on a filthy
sidewalk like homeless
bum children so you can get tickets?
Yeah. They're gonna remember
this night the rest of their lives.
This concert better not be on
the Same night as Michael Bolton.
- No. It's the night before.
- Gary, I can't believe you.
You just, can't stand it that i'm gonna
take them to their first concert.
So you have to jump in
and take them to a concert
- the day before just to tick me off?
- No. I don't want to tick you off.
I don't want their first
concert to be a disaster.
I want it to be a good memory.
It's all about just
giving the kids good memories.
I wanted a good memory on our
wedding night, but then I
found out about your "if diehard is on,
I have to watch it" policy.
How many times have
we been through this? Mclane
wants to be with his family
on Christmas. But can't
be with his family on Christmas because
he has to save Nakatomi Plaza.
Gary, listen to me.
We are going to have
a great time at Michael Bolton.
And you not gonna get them on
wednesday night just so you can
concert block me, OK?
Even if it is for Bruce.
- God, would you shut up?
- All right, look.
This is me and you here. Listen.
You have to give me the kids because
you agreed to switch nights. Right?
Our divorce stipulates that once
you agree to switch nights,
- you can't switch back.
- All right, fine, Gary.
But this isn't over. OK?
Kids, come on. Let's get your stuff.
Pack it up. We're leaving.
I think this is a new low.
Even for you.
I said "you."
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Sweetie, you saw what
happened to the neighbor's cat?
No. What happened?
He's taking a nap in the road.
He's adorable. He looks very peaceful.
And he's got a look on his
face like "mondays are a bummer."
Why are you sick, sweetie?
Because mom like Tom drive
the car in the church parking lot.
Wait. Your mother
let Tommy drive the car?
Well, if you call it driving.
Stop, start. Stop, start.
Stop, start. Barf!
- Hey, dad. Mom let me drive the car.
- Yeah, I heard. That's fantastic, man.
Check it out.
I made a right turn so perfectly,
the blinker turned off by itself.
You let Tommy drive the car.
I'm his father. That's a father's job.
Fathers have been teaching their
sons to drive for thousands of years.
I'm sorry, Gary.
Tom asked if he could give it a shot.
And I knew it was
something you'd want to do.
But then I rembered,
you stole the first concert from me.
And then the next thing I know,
we're driving through hedges
and nuns are giving us the finger. So...
Well, if you're sure
you want to play it that way, Allison,
be careful and buckle your seatbelt.
Because I can play that way, too.
That reminds me. I took Louise on her
first roller coaster ride yesterday.
- You didn't.
- Yeah. She's finally this tall.
- Tom, could I see you for a second?
- Yeah, sure.
Louise, I got you a present.
It's on your bed. I got it at the store.
- Thanks, dad.
- You got it.
What's going on?
Well, Tommy,
your dad's gonna teach you how to shave.
There were are.
- Shave what?
- Shave your.
Your beard you big
hairy lumber Jack. Come on!
- What's with the first aid kit?
- Why don't we answer that question
if and when we need it? OK, son.
This is shaving cream.
I know what shaving cream is, dad.
OK. Good. There you go.
Lather some of that on there.
All right.
There you go.
Go ahead.
Use the mirror, son. Use the mirror.
It doesn't bother you that
I don't have any hair on my face?
No, listen, you're a brooks.
You come from a long line
of incredibly hairy people.
All right?
Remember your aunt rose?
Who do you think taught me how to shave?
Now, son, a man
is only as good as his tools.
Make sure you use a razor
made by a company that also
makes ball-point pens.
These are excellent because
they're hollow inside.
And if you cut yourself and
bleed to death, you can call for help.
Have at it.
Have at it. Go ahead. Go ahead.
There you go. You having fun?
- Yeah.
- Good. That's good.
Because from here on out,
it's a giant pain in the ass.
- So why did we have to do this today?
- It's all about milestones, son.
Fathers and sons doing
things for the first time.
My father didn't get to teach me.
He's still mad at my aunt Rose.
You've got to be kidding me.
It's your first brassiere, honey.
Congratulations.
Thanks, dad. But I really
don't need this kind of pressure.
I have surprise for you guys. How would
you like to go to burgeroo's for dinner?
I called your mom, she said it was fine.
- All right.
- Here we go. Here we go.
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking pictures of you guys.
Look. You are so adorable.
Scotty, move closer. Don't be shy.
Your dad, he should be seeing this?
Do you guys always do this
before you go to Burgeroo's?
We going to Burgeroo's?
Not you, Tom.
Louise and Scotty are
going on their first date.
What?!
It's not really a date.
But you guys go wait in the car, OK.
I will be out in a minute.
I have to talk to Tommy about something.
What's going on here?
Why can't I go to Burgeroo's?
Well, your sister is going on a date.
Which brings me to something very
important that I'd like to discuss with
you. But I don't have a lot of time, so
listen carefully. OK. Here we go.
Tommy, when a man and
a women love each other very much.
I've already had this talk with dad.
Drugs.
- Someone offers you drugs...
- I've had this one, too.
Fine.
The game is called Blackjack.
Cured.
Cured.
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Krandall. But
there's a Lewis and Tom here to see you.
- Lewis and Tom?
- Louise. My name is Louise.
- Do I even look like a Lewis?
- Yeah. That's fine. Let them in, ellen.
This is a surprise.
- Hey, Dr. K.
- Is everything all right?
Not really. We need to talk to you.
Please, sit down. How did you get here?
We took public transportation.
And if the rest of the world did too.
Louise, one problem at a time. OK?
Things are getting a little
out of hand with mom and dad.
Why don't you tell me what's going on.
Well, dad took us
to Mexico the other day.
- That sounds nice.
- For dinner.
It was 6 hours in the car
and 10 minutes at a Taco stand.
Why would he do that?
So he could be with us
our first time out of the country.
OK. That sounds a bit extreme.
No. Extreme was mom taking
me on a college tour to cal State.
OK, that's crazy.
Of course it is.
Me, at a state school? Please...
What are you doing here?
The kids called and they told me
to come over.
They called me too.
Why are you on the porch?
The door's locked.
It's, like, bolted from the inside.
That's what you think scientist?
From the inside? As opposed to outside?
I used to have deadbolt on the outside,
but I got tired of my neighbors
locking me in my house!
- Is this important?
- Hey, all right. Let's go.
Tommy? Louise? Let's go!
What's going on in there, you guys?
Walter, what are you doing here?
Tom and Louise came by my office today,
told me about the little competion
you two have been engaged in.
Hey, what are they doing over there?
Is that a paper shredder?
- Are those my tickets?
- That's right, Gary.
3 Springsteen tickets,
3 Michael Bolton tickets.
Louise, honey, I love you so much.
Sweetie, don't let the bolton tickets
touch the Springsteen tickets. OK?
You have bigger issues, Gary.
Your children are very unhappy with you.
Walter, would you please let us in?
That was just the receipt.
Now do I have your undivided attention?
Yeah. Yes, you do.
If I let you in, will you
listen to what your kids have to say
and not make a grab
for the remaing tickets?
- Yes. We will.
- I promise. Yes.
- All right. All right.
- All right.
OK. We're good.
It's cool. It's OK. It's OK.
Why are you hands in the air?
It's not a stick-up.
- Sorry. I don't know.
- No. No. Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up.
You got it. You got it, Tommy.
You're the man. You're the man.
All right guys, let's not do anything
crazy. OK? Tom, Louise. Nothing crazy.
Crazy? Like buying your 11-year-old
a giant cafeteria Lady Bra?
- Seriously? You did that?
- I figured she'd grow into it.
What makes you think...
No. No. Back! Back!
Sorry. My mistake.
Was that Springsteen or Bolton?
What part of tickets
and shredder don't understand?
- Oh, my god.
- I'm sorry, Louise. We're sitting down,
we're listening to you now.
OK. Go ahead.
Why don't you begin.
Well, we want you to stop forcing us to
do stuff that we're not ready to do yet.
- Like shaving and dating.
- And driving.
Actually the driving I liked.
I'd like to see more of that.
- But everything else has to stop.
- Gary, Allison.
I think your children deserve
an explanation for your behavior.
Look, when your dad and I were married,
we were together and we saw all
those first things,
you know, together.
The walking and then the talking.
Riding your bike. Losing a tooth.
Getting a ride in an ambulance.
Tommy, that all happened
for you in one afternoon.
I guess we're just afraid
that we're gonna
- Miss out on those things, you know?
- But they are going to happen.
And we need to know how you plan
to handle them now that you're divorced.
Pop quiz my first homecoming
dance what are you going to do?
Hey, that's mine.
Hey! Wait! Wait! No!
I'm gonna call your father.
Invite him over and include him.
And we'll show him the dress.
- Good?
- I'll take pictures.
And I'll give your mom
doubles of those pictures.
And I'll take your date in the backyard,
and I'll show him how quickly
I can dig a shallow grave.
Good answer.
But of course, I'll never participate
in such an outdated sexist ritual.
Though, if I do,
I want to look really pretty.
We want to do things together with
you guys. We do. And we're gonna try.
And whoever isn't there, we'll make
sure that person is there in spirit. OK?
- What?!
- What? What was that?
I don't know.
I'm drunk with power.
Give me some of these.
You're hogging them all. Let me do some.
Hey! Tommy, stop!
Enough. I'm your father.
I'm saying this has to end.
Give me the tickets.
What the heck are these?
The freudian pips?
They're left over from a little gig
I had with 3 of my psychiatrist friends.
We were sort of an up with
people for the clinically depressed.
You're a strange man, Krandall.
Give me my tickets.
All right.
Sorry I had to put you through that.
- But it certainly was effective.
- Yeah. OK. Here.
Hi, Bruce Springsteen tickets.
This is fantastic. This is really great.
You guys gonna have the greatest time
of you life when you go to this concert.
With your mom.
What? I thought you were taking us.
I was gonna. But she's right, Tommy.
It was her idea to take
you guys to your first concert.
And I just wanted to steal it from her.
And that's not right.
So your mom should take you.
That is, if you do want to go see Bruce.
What? Are you kidding me? Bruce!
Come on guys, we're gonna rock?
Kids, you think we could, I don't know,
buy your dad a Springsteen ticket?
Time out.
That's pretty expensive, Allison.
I don't know if we can afford it.
You know what we could do.
We could sell those
Michael Bolton tickets.
And with the money we make
we could buy cup of coffee.
And then we could drink it
while we're thinking of way
to buy a Springsteen ticket.
You know, I think I have enough nickels
in my kitchen to buy you a ticket.
All right.
And with the money left over
we can get you a Michael Bolton ticket.
Can you see anything?
And how many times is this guy
going to ask us if we're ready to rock?
Everyone has clearly said that they're
ready to rock. What more does he want?
I can't believe we have to
go to another one of these tomorrow.
Are we even facing the right way?
- I wish we could go home.
- Don't ruin it for them.
These memories will last
them the rest of their lives.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Salut.
Des factures, que des factures.
Facture, fact... un bulletin
d'abonnement au magazine "High Times" ?
T'es ici depuis 2 jours, papa.
Comment ils t'ont trouvé ?
C'est un truc cosmique.
Mon père t'a dit que je l'avais
pris pour bosser avec moi ?
Oui, c'est super.
Je vais juste faire ça jusqu'à ce que
j'ai assez de fric pour réparer mon van.
Tu dois faire quoi à ton van ?
La maintenance habituelle...
Recâbler la lampe noire,
arranger le miroir,
nettoyer la moquette du plafond.
C'est pas pour faire le vendeur,
mais tu pourrais prendre un van
dont les 4 pneus sont de la même taille.
Hé, c'est l'heure du bulletin de notes
des enfants Brook. Voyons voir.
Louise Brooks, que des A.
C'est ma fille.
Jusqu'à ce qu'un test sanguin
prouve le contraire.
Regarde ça.
Tommy Brooks. A. B+. A.
C-.
C- en EPS ?
Comment avoir un C en gym ?
Tu portes tes chaussures
du dimanche sur un parquet ?
As-tu vérifié qu'il y avait pas
de drogues dans son sac à dos ?
Tommy n'a pas de drogues
dans son sac à dos, OK ?
Où est-ce que tu crois
qu'il en garderait ?
Je comprends pas.
C'est mon fils.
C'est un Brooks.
On descend d'une lignée d'athlètes.
Qui a commencé à ma génération.
Je jouais au football,
je faisais de la lutte,
sans oublier
que j'ai fait un essai chez les Dodgers.
Il est 3h00. L'heure pour Gary
de parler de son essai chez les Dodgers.
Et voilà, c'est fini.
Merci. Ça fait du bien.
C'est comment ?
Comme tu aimes. À la Rickles
devant, et à la Kenny G derrière.
Je dois y aller.
Mon ami vient me chercher.
Ton ami ?
Tu vois quelqu'un de nouveau ?
N'essaie même pas de
lui demander des trucs sur le mec.
Elle ne donnera aucune information.
On est pas dans la même catégorie,
la mienne c'est celle des Dodgers
où il se trouve que j'ai fait un essai.
Dis-nous juste, d'où il vient ?
Il est né au Canada.
Regardez-moi !
Je suis le Canada !
Mon bacon est rond. En fait, c'est
du jambon, mais on appelle ça du bacon.
Et c'était un athlète professionnel.
Regardez-moi ! C'est ce que je suis.
Je suis un prof... temps mort !
Tu sors avec un sportif professionnel ?
Quel sport ? Donne-moi un indice.
Il est gay ?
C'est un joueur de basket.
Au revoir, Jack.
Au revoir.
Elle sort avec
un joueur de basket canadien gay ?
Tu sais, j'ai aucun souvenir de toi
faisant un essai chez les Dodgers.
C'est surement parce que c'était l'année
où t'avais décidé de trouver le Yéti.
Non, c'est l'année où
c'est devenu personnel entre lui et moi.

Louise, chérie,
tu sais où est la tapette à mouche ?
Non, et maman ? Une mouche
est une créature vivante qui respire.
Voilà pourquoi je cherche la tapette.
Morte, un mouchoir suffirait.
- Je l'ai.
- Louise, tu es prête ?
C'est ça où être témoin d'un meurtre.
As-tu idée de combien de mouches
meurent sur mon pare-brise chaque fois
que je t'emmène au centre de recyclage ?
- C'est le choix d'Hobson classique.
- Tu veux la jouer comme ça ?
Je dis une chose d'intelligente et toi,
une chose que je comprends pas.
Va attendre à la voiture, futée ?
Où est Tom ?
Il est avec Walter,
il revient dans une minute.
Cette mouche me rend folle.
J'arrive pas à l'avoir.
Pourquoi tu fais pas comme d'habitude ?
Arrêtez de la considérer,
ne la laisse pas te toucher,
puis enlève
son âme jusqu'à perdre l'envie de vivre.
Alors, as-tu vu
le bulletin de notes de Tommy ?
Oui. Je suis si fière de lui
pour cette note en science.
Merci de pas l'avoir
trop aidé ce trimestre.
Il est bon partout, à part en sport.
Comment il a fait pour avoir
un C- en EPS ? Je connaissais un gamin
quand j'étais au lycée qui fumait
en sport. Il a eu un B+.
Je sais, c'est inacceptable,
mais, franchement...
de toutes ses matières,
l'EPS est le dernier de mes soucis.
- Hé, comment était votre balade ?
- Fabuleuse.
- Attendez.
- Vous êtes allés faire une balade ?
J'emmène Tommy se balader
dans la nature urbaine du quartier.
Fascinant. Je parie qu'en
se levant tôt et sans faire de bruit,
vous pouvez voir l'homme
insaisissable qui laisse
des coupons de pizza sur les portes.
En fait, c'était assez cool.
Dr. K connaît toutes sortes de choses.
Tu sais qu'on trouve des plantes et des
animaux comestibles dans le quartier ?
Oui, ça s'appelle
les restaurants et les bars à salade.
- J'ai raison, non ?
- Je suppose, mais tu sais
tu peux aussi trouver des nutriments
dans les épines de pins, les glands.
Mais bonne blague pour le bar à salade.
Bar à salade !
OK. Ne compatis pas.
Va attendre à la voiture.
- Merci, Dr. K.
- Ça m'a fait plaisir aussi, Tom.
Je devrais y aller.
On me met un nouveau téléphone.
Ça doit être excitant. Tu dois
pouvoir garder le numéro d'origine.
Le 1.
Encore sur mon âge. Dis-moi Gary,
quand tu t'es inscrit à la fac,
que t'as dit la standardiste ?
Maintenenant je sais pourquoi
Tommy à un C- en gym.
- À cause de Krandall.
- De quoi tu parles ?
Réfléchis. Quand il est chez moi,
on est 2 mecs ensemble, non ?
Mais quand il vient ici, il est
avec 3 femmes, Louise, toi et Krandall.
Est-ce que tu veux dire que Walter
n'est pas un modèle masculin adéquat ?
Non, je veux dire que Walter
n'est pas un homme adéquat.
Eh bien, il est suffisamment homme pour
me laisser un sourire sur le visage.
C'est dégoûtant.
Et pendant le sexe,
il n'a jamais dit, "hé,
ça te dérange pas de continuer seule
que j'aille chercher une bière ?"
Pour être juste, quand je suis revenu,
tu avais perdu tout intérêt.
J'ai le syndrome du tunnel carpien,
tu le sais.
Quoi que tu penses de lui,
il est super avec Tom.
Il est super avec Tom ?
De quoi tu parles ?
Il y a un garçon de 14 ans
qui erre dans le voisinage
et mange les herbes des jardins voisins.
- Tu l'as eu ?
- Bien sûr que oui.
Grâce à des aptitudes
acquises en cours de gym, OK ?
- Ils t'ont appris à tuer les mouches ?
- Non, mais ils nous ont appris
à coordonner nos mouvements,
la dextérité et voilà le résultat.
Quand Tom est avec moi, je lui apporte
un peu plus "d'homminfluence"
et j'enlève toute la "kranfluence."
Donne-moi la tapette à mouche.
Voilà, mon pote.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- C'était amusant. Comment ça va ?
- Je suis mort.
3 heures à courir, sauter
et attraper des frisbees ?
Ne le prends pas mal, papa,
mais tu devrais prendre un chiot.
On a appris une leçon importante,
aujourd'hui, fils.
Tu peux aller au parc, jouer au football
et au baseball, tirer des paniers,
jouer au foot. Mais quand un homme
et son fils luttent dans l'herbe,
les gens appellent les flics.
Je crois qu'on était au mauvais endroit
du parc.
J'ai prévu quelque chose
de très masculin pour nous demain.
Plus masculin que ma tête écrasée
par une prise en ciseau ?
Je t'ai dit que si ça t'arrivait,
fallait crier à l'aide.
Je pouvais pas t'entendre. Tes cuisses
étaient serrées contre mes oreilles.
Demain, paintball.
On va faire ça, ce sera super.
Y aura toi, moi, grand-père,
Jack et Dennis.
Tu peux amener un ami si tu veux.
Je sais pas.
On peut pas juste aller se balader ?
C'est la saison des plantes sauvages.
Écoute, faut que je te parle
de tes notes.
T'as vraiment bien assuré,
mais un C- en gym, c'est pas cool.
On est des Brooks.
On a une réputation à tenir.
Je sais, j'arrête pas d'oublier mon sac.
C'est pas grave.
Eh bien, tu sais que tu peux me parler
si tu as besoin ?
- Oui, bien sûr.
- Tu veux parler de quelque chose ?
T'es sûr ? Je peux vraiment t'aider avec
l'école, les filles, les cours de gym.
Je suis expert en tout,
à part l'école et les filles.
Il n'y a rien dont j'ai besoin
de parler, papa, OK ?
- Je vais me prendre une douche.
- OK, je t'aime.
J'adorais la gym à l'école.
C'était mon cour préféré.
C'était fun. La pause pendant laquelle
tu pouvais te défouler.
Courir tant que tu veux.
Tirer des paniers. Te chamailler.
Le mieux c'était après,
dans les vestiaires.
On s'amusait toujours, tu sais ?
Hé, Tommy. Attention !
Oh, mon Dieu !
- Tommy ! Ça va ?
- Non, ça va pas !
C'était pourquoi ça, putain ?
Oui, j'ai dit putain !
- Fils, je suis désolé. Je voulais pas.
- Tu voulais pas quoi ?
Enrouler la serviette,
attendre que j'ai baissé mon pantalon,
et me claquer les burnes ?!
- Tommy, j'ai dit "attention."
- Oui, et après je me suis retourné !
Attention ne veut pas dire "tourne-toi".
Ça veut dire évite.
- Tout le monde le sait !
- Eh bien, moi non !
Le paintball commence dans une heure.
Où est le soldat Tom ?
Le soldat Tom refroidit ses parties.
Le frapper avec une serviette ?
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire après ça ?
Mettre des savons dans son oreiller
et le frapper dans son lit ?
Je me sens suffisamment mal
sans que tu en rajoutes.
C'était juste un petit jeu de vestiaire,
et il s'est retourné sur un "Attention",
- c'est tout.
- Alors, tu dis que c'est de sa faute.
Ses testicules ont sauté
dans la trajectoire de ta serviette.
En quelque sorte. Tout le monde sait
qu'il faut se retourner.
Tu te mets pas de face.
Ça veut dire qu'un ballon,
un palet ou une serviette
t'arrive dessus.
Je croyais qu'on élevait
un gentleman, non ?
Pas Delushi dans "Animal House."
- Belushi.
- Si tu veux.
Non ! C'est Belushi ! C'est le genre
de trucs qu'il apprendra pas ici !
Ou dans ces balades dans la nature
avec "Crocodile Krandall."
C'est une bonne chose qu'il soit là.
Quand Tom est rentré,
il était gêné et ne voulait pas
me parler. Il voulait un autre homme.
Attends. Mon fils parle
à Krandall de ces trucs ?
Pourquoi il me parle pas à moi ?
Je suis son père. Je suis l'homme.
Oui, eh bien, en ce moment
grâce à l'homme,
Tom est en haut avec un sac de pois
congelés sur son scrotum.
Ton père est là ! Ramène le sac
de pois ! Je fais une tarte aux pois !
Comment vont-ils ?
Ils ont mal, sont en colère
et ont moins confiance qu'avant.
Je suis désolé, vraiment désolé, mais
faut se conduire en homme aujourd'hui.
T'as amené un ami pour jouer avec nous ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais, Krandall ?
- Tom m'a invité à me joindre à vous.
Non. Non, j'ai dit
que tu pourrais amener un ami.
Eh bien, Dr K est mon ami.
Non, je voulais dire un ami de l'école.
Comme Brian, ou Glenn.
Pas un ami qui a besoin d'une chaise
dans sa douche.
Dr K connaît tout sur les guerres
et les batailles historiques.
Mais c'est du paintball.
T'as un drapeau à défendre, et
tu dois essayer de prendre
celui des autres.
Pas besoin
de s'y connaître en batailles.
Hé, Dr. K, on dirait un français
lors de la bataille d'Azincourt.
Alors, Tom, qu'est-ce que tu veux
pour la Saint Crispin ?
Ce que je veux pas. C'est une lourde
armure française dans la boue.
En voiture.
Allez, allez, on y va !
Attirez-les par ici !
Dépêchez-vous ! On a quelques
minutes, le temps qu'ils rechargent,
et ils vont venir ici
avec tout ce qu'ils ont, OK ?
OK, on a "boo goo" les méchants
derrières les arbres !
Papa, arrête de parler comme ça ?
Tu fais peur à tout le monde !
- Dennis est mal en point, papa.
- Allez, Dennis, lève-toi.
- Je souffre.
- Bien sûr que oui.
T'as mangé 3 sandwichs à la
station-service. Tu t'attendais à quoi ?
Si quelque chose s'échappe
de mon estomac, tuez-le.
Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive ?
T'es notre sentinelle.
Tu devrais être en train de tirer.
T'as pas tiré une seule fois.
Je sais.
J'essaie de m'habituer à mon arme.
Eh bien faut que tu t'y habitues
et vite, OK ? Alors, pourquoi tu ne,
tirerais pas sur Dennis.
C'est comme dans un film de guerre.
Les minorités meurent en premier.
Si Tom est vraiment pacifiste,
l'intimidation n'est pas conseillée.
Tu veux prendre le relais ?
Tu veux être responsable
de 4 âmes, qui marchent sur un fil ?
C'est ce que tu veux ?
- J'en serais content.
- Je ne le pensais pas, écoutez,
Dennis, Tom, formez
un périmètre et on s'y retrouve à 03
30, attendez, 03, fais chier !
3 h 30, revenez à 3 h 30...
Vite, avant qu'ils nous encerclent, où
on va finir dans un monde de blessures.
Papa, arrête de parler
comme si t'étais au Vietnam.
T'y es jamais allé.
Pendant les années 60,
tout ce que t'as réussi, c'est à faire
peur dans les "Grateful Dead Shows".
Je me souviens de vous.
C'est bien. OK.
Allez, sortons de là pour nous friter.
Tommy, couvre l'arrière de Dennis.
Ça suffit !
Allez, sortez de là !
Établissez un périmètre !
Rappelez-vous d'Altamont !
J'ai remarqué que tu m'avais
rien donné à faire.
Oui, je pensais que ce serait bien, si
tu restais ici avec moi, Krandall.
Tu peux me passer mon arme ?
J'ai peur de ne pas pouvoir.
Tu veux pas faire ça. Qu'est-ce que
ça t'apportera de me tirer dessus ?
Tu serais hors jeu,
j'aurais du temps, seul avec mon fils.
Je ne me mets pas entre toi et Tom.
Ah bon ? Alors pourquoi il vient te voir
toi pour des conseils ?
C'est normal que les ados se confient
à d'autres que leurs parents.
D'accord. Qu'est-ce qu'il te raconte ?
- J'ai peur que ce soit confidentiel.
- Mauvaise réponse.
Ne tire pas.
Donne-moi une bonne raison
de ne pas le faire.
De si prêt, tu vas me laisser
de ces bleus et les gens
à la piscine peuvent être très cruels.
À terre, Gary ! Attention !
Oh, mon Dieu !
Ça arrive de partout !
- Mon arme. C'est notre seule chance !
- Je te fais pas confiance !
- Tu peux pas te le permettre !
- D'accord !
Je suis sérieux pour Tommy !
Reste loin de lui ! Je suis son héros,
tu m'entends ?!
Tu comprends pas !
- Comprendre quoi ?
- Tu es son héros.
Tu l'es tellement qu'il ne pense pas
être capable de tenir ses promesses.
Pourquoi il penserait ça ?
Il me fera jamais honte.
Regarde-toi.
Tu es un gars fort, un athlète.
Fort en 4 sports, sans compter
ton essai légendaire avec les Dodgers.
C'est pour ça qu'il sèche la gym.
C'est moins dur de ne pas essayer,
plutôt que de risquer de te décevoir.
- Il me décevra jamais !
- Tu le lui as déjà dit ?
Un fils a besoin d'entendre
certaines choses de son père.
D'accord ! Rentrez !
Ils nous encerclent,
je sais pas ce qu'on va faire.
Attendez une minute. Où est mon père ?
Je l'ai vu à la tour de guet.
Il a dit qu'il allait fumer l'ennemi.
Mais il a dit qu'il avait juste assez
pour lui, quoi que ça veuille dire.
D'accord, les gars.
Ça suffit pour aujourd'hui.
Rendons-nous. Je veux pas que
quelqu'un soit blessé, OK ?
Se rendre ? Je suis pas venu ici
pour me faire battre
par 6 régisseurs de plateau
de "Scooter's Auto Sound".
- Tom, on doit...
- On se retrouve en enfer !
Et ouais.
Je l'ai redit.
Qui est avec moi ?
Qu'est-ce qui lui arrive ?
Probablement une combination
de gansta rap, jeux vidéo
et ce qu'il a inhalé
à la station-service.
Gary, attention !
Pourquoi t'as fait ça,
espèce de malade mental ?
Il a besoin de son père. En fait,
il ne parle que de ça.
Quand on va marcher autour du... du...
- du...
- Krandall, reste avec moi.
Cul de sac. Je trouvais plus le mot.
Le fait est que, quand on est ensemble,
il ne parle
que de son admiration pour toi.
Merci, Walter. Merci.
- J'imagine que c'est la fin pour moi.
- Ouais, je...
je pense, Krandall.
On se voit au snack ?
Prends-moi un cheeseburger, OK ?
Je suis déjà mort !
Voilà, les mecs. Un soda très frais
pour le guerrier victorieux,
- et un pour Gary.
- D'accord.
Mais je lui colle aux basques, tu vois ?
Je veux dire,
il a pris le drapeau,
mais j'étais dans son équipe.
Donc, j'ai l'impression
d'avoir pris le drapeau aussi.
OK, avec cette logique,
grâce à mon copain,
j'aurais remporté
trois championnats de NBA.
Attends, c'est un autre indice.
Né au Canada,
3 championnats, mon Dieu !
Tu sors avec Rick Fox ?!
Je crois que j'en ai trop dit.
- Tu sors vraiment avec Rick Fox ?
- Non, je sors avec personne.
J'aime juste embêter Gary.
Donc, Vanessa sort avec un ex-Laker ?
C'est trop cool.
Sauf si tu es l'ex.
Qui peut être à la hauteur de ça ?
Ouais, mais Papa, t'es presque
un joueur professionnel.
T'as fait un essai pour les Dodgers.
J'ai probablement omis
quelques détails à ce propos.
L'essai était une invitation
dans le journal.
Ils ont dit que les premiers 1500
qui arriveraient au parc pourraient
faire un essai pour les Dodgers,
moi et mon cousin on y est allés.
Et... c'est tout. Mon essai,
c'était deux lancers.
C'était ça ton grand essai ?
Ouais, je l'ai exagéré avec les années.
J'étais juste bon en sport à l'école,
pas la peine
de la ramener, et c'est pour ça
que je la ramenais constamment.
Ton histoire de paintball est déjà
épique comparé à ma carrière sportive.
- Tu le penses vraiment ?
- Ouais, hé,
je vis dans ton ombre, maintenant, OK ?
Merci, Papa.
Et t'as fait quoi à ces deux lancers ?
Le premier, je l'ai raté.
Le deuxième
est arrivé sur l'ailier gauche.
Il l'a attrapé à pleine main.
Au moins, ta balle est allée
à l'extérieur du terrain au stade.
Non, j'ai pas frappé
la balle au terrain gauche.
J'ai dit que j'ai frappé la balle
à l'ailier gauche.
Il sortait de l'abri en remettant
son chapeau.
Il a juste tendu la main
et la balle est tombée dedans.
Mais au moins, t'as frappé une balle
jusqu'à l'abri du stade des Dodgers.
Tu sais que je l'ai fait, hein ?
J'ai pris celle-là vers la fin
de la bataille,
- quand je prenais un chewing-gum.
- C'est rien.
J'ai pris celle-là
en sortant des toilettes.
- C'est ta propre peinture !
- Ouais.
Je devais sortir de cet enfer.
J'aimais pas ce que ça me faisait,
je frappais des mecs
et ça me faisait rien.
- Je me sens bizarre.
- Peut-être que t'as faim.
T'as mangé quelque chose depuis
l'incident du sandwich, ce matin ?
Ouais, j'ai pris quelques brownies
du sac de Jack.
Assieds-toi là.
OK, petit frère,
tu es en sécurité et au chaud
sur une planète qui t'aime.
Kumbayah, mon Dieu, kumbayah !
Kumbayah, mon Dieu, kumbayah !
- Aide-moi.
Kumbayah, mon Dieu, kumbayah !
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Dennis a mangé mes brownies.
Quelqu'un est défoncé, mon Dieu,
kumbayah !
Quelqu'un est défoncé !
Quelqu'un est défoncé, mon Dieu...
Ça fait du bien de nettoyer
toute cette peinture, Tommy !
Voilà, j'ai fini.
La douche est à toi, fils !
Hé, Papa, attention !
Désolé. Je pensais pas que
tu te tournerais. J'ai dit attention.
Je suis si fier de toi !
- Merci.
- Apporte-moi un sac de pois congelés.
Un très grand sac !
Team Subs-Addicts"
Hey, guys.
Bills, all Bills.
Bills, Bil... a subscription form
for "High Times" magazine?
You've been here 2 days, dad.
How did they find you?
It's a cosmic thing.
Did my dad tell ya I put
him on one of my work crews?
Yeah, I think that's great.
I'm just gonna do it until I get
enough bread to get my van fixed.
What do you have to do to your van?
Just the usual maintenance, you know?
Rewire the black light,
update the mural,
shampoo the carpet on the ceiling.
I don't want to sound like a gear head,
dad, but maybe you can get a van
where all 4 tires are the same size.
Hey, look at this. Report card time.
The Brooks kids. Let's see how they did.
Louise Brooks, straight as.
That's my girl.
Until a blood test proves otherwise.
Check that out.
Tommy brooks. A. B+. A.
C-.
C- in PE?
How do you get a C- in gym class?
You wear your church
shoes on the wood floor?
Did you,
check his backpack for drugs?
Tommy doesn't have drugs in
his back pack, all right, dad?
Where do you suppose he would keep them?
I don't understand this.
Tommy, Tommy's my son.
He's a Brooks.
We come from a long line of athletes.
Starting with my generation of course.
I played football, I wrestled, track
not to mention
I had a trial with the Dodgers.
Hey, it's 3:00. Time for Gary to mention
his tryout with the Dodgers.
There you go, all set.
Thanks. Feels good.
How's it look?
It's the way you like it. Rickles
in the front, Kenny G in the back.
- I gotta go, my friend's picking me up.
- Your friend? You seein'somebody new?
But don't even bother
asking her about the guy.
She won't give any
information whatsoever.
But, I know he's not in my ballpark,
because my ballpark is Dodgers'stadium,
where I had a tryout, incidentally.
Come on. Just tell us, where is he from?
He was born in Canada.
Look at me?
I'm Canada!
My bacon's round.
It's really ham, but we call it bacon?
And he was a professional athlete.
Look at me? This what I'm aboot.
I played profe, time out!
You're dating a professional athlete?
What sport? Gimme a hint.
He's gay?
He's a basketball player.
Good-bye, Jack.
Good-bye.
She's dating a gay
Canadian basketball player?
You know, I got no recollection
of you ever trying out for the Dodgers.
That probably because that was the year
you decided to try and find bigfoot.
No, that was the year the son
of a bitch made it personal.

VO : ¤AkaZab¤
Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way. fr]
Louise, honey,
do you know where the fly swatter is?
No, and mom?
A fly is a living, breathing creature.
I know. That's why I need a fly swatter.
If it was dead, i'd just need a tissue.
- I got it.
- Hey, Louise, you ready to go?
It's either that,
or stay here and witness a murder.
Louise, do you have any idea
how many flies
die on my windshield every time
I drive you to the recycling center?
- It's a classic Hobson's choice, dad.
- At's how we're gonna handle this?
I say something clever, and then you
say something I don't understand?
Why don't you go wait in the car,
smarty?
Where's Tom?
He's with Walter,
he'll be back in a min.
This fly is driving me crazy.
I can't get it.
Why don't you do what you usually do?
Stop acknowledging it,
don't let it touch you,
and then just chip away
at its soul
until it loses the will to live.
Hey. So,
did you see Tommy's report card?
I know, I have. I'm so proud of him
for bringing up that science grade.
Thank you for not helping
him as much this semester.
He did great in everything,
except gym class.
I mean, how do ya how do ya
get a C- in PE? I know a kid
when I was in high school that smoked
in gym class. He got a B+.
I know, it's unacceptable,
but, Frankly, I mean, Gary...
Of all of his classes,
PE.'s the least of my worries.
Wait. All right.
- Hey, guys, how was your hike?
- Fabulous.
- Wait, time out.
- You guys went on a hike?
I've been takin'Tommy on urban nature
hikes around the neighborhood lately.
That must be fascinating. I bet you get
up real early and if you're real quiet,
you can sneak up on
the elusive man who leaves
pizza coupons on door knobs.
Actually, it was sort of cool.
Dr. K knows all kinds of stuff.
Do you know that there are places
in the neighborhood
where you can find
edible plants and animals?
Yeah, they're called
restaurants and salad bars.
- Am I right? Right?
- I guess, but
you know, you can also get nutrients
from pine needles, acorns.
But good joke about the salad bar.
Yeah. Salad bar.
All right, don't pity me.
Go wait in the car.
- Thanks, Dr. K.
- I enjoyed it, too, Tom.
I should get going.
I'm having a new phone put in.
That must be exciting. Maybe they can,
let you keep your original number.
One.
Another jab at my age. Tell me, Gary,
when you enrolled in college,
what did the operator
standing by say to you?
Now I know why Tommy
is getting a C- in gym.
- Because of Krandall.
- What are you talking about?
Think about it. When he's at my house,
he with me. 2 guys, hanging out, right?
But when he comes here, he's with
3 women, Louise, you, and Krandall.
Are you implying that Walter is
an inadequate male role model?
No, I'm implying that Walter
is an inadequate male.
Yep, well, he is enough of a man
to keep a big smile on my face.
OK, that's disgusting.
And during sex,
he never once said, "hey,
do you mind keeping this going
on your own while I go grab a beer?"
You know, in all fairness, when I came
back, you had lost interest in yourself.
I have carpal tunnel, you know that.
Look, whatever you think of him,
Gary, he is great with Tom.
He's great with Tom?
What are you talking about?
There's a 14-year old boy
roaming the neighborhoods
eating the weeds out of people's yards.
- Did you get it?
- Of course I got it.
Using skills I honed in gym class, OK?
- They taught you how to catch flies?
- No, but they taught us
hand-eye coordination, dexterity
and look, here's the bottom line.
When I have Tom, I put a little
more "manfluence" in his life
and strip away all the "kranfluence."
Give me the fly swatter. All right.
There ya go, buddy. Have at it.
What are you doing?
- That was fun, Tommy. How ya doin'?
- I'm beat.
3 hours of running and jumping
and catching frisbees?
Don't take this wrong, dad,
but you might need a puppy.
You know, we learned
a very valuable lesson today, son.
You can go to the park, you can play
football, baseball. You can shoot hoops,
play soccer. But as soon as a man and
his son start wrestling in the grass,
people call the cops.
I think we wandered into
the wrong section of the park.
I've got something really
manly planned for us tomorrow.
What? More manly than getting
my head squeezed in a leg scissor hold?
I told you if that happened, just scream
out for help if it was bothering you.
Yeah, I couldn't hear you, dad. Your
thighs were pressed against my ears.
Look, tomorrow. Paintball. Come on,
we're gonna do it. It'll be great.
It'll be me, you, grandpa,
Jack, and Dennis.
And you can bring a friend if you want,
handsome?
I don't know, dad.
Can we just go for a hike?
I mean it's, it's wildflower season.
Look, I need to talk to you
about your grades a little.
I mean, you did really good,
but a C- in gym, that's not cool.
I mean, we're Brooks men.
We have a rep to protect.
I know, I just keep forgetting
my gym bag. It's no big deal.
Well, you know you can talk to me if
you need to talk about anything, right?
- Yeah, of course.
- Anything you want to talk about?
You sure? I mean, I can really
help you school, girls, gym class.
I'm an expert in everything,
except school and girls.
Dad, there is nothing
that I need to talk about, OK?
- I'm gonna hit the showers.
- OK, I love you.
I used to love gym when I was in school.
That was my favorite class.
It was just fun. It was just a break in
the day, where you could just run wild.
Run all you want. Shoot some hoops.
Tackle each other.
The best was talkin'smack in
the locker room, afterwards.
That was always fun, you know?
Hey, Tommy. Heads up!
Oh, my god!
- Tommy! Are you OK?!
- No, I'm not OK!
What the hell was that for?!
Yeah, that's right, dad, I said hell!
- Son, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it.
- You didn't mean to what?
Deliberately roll up a towel,
wait'til I got my pants off,
and then crack me in the nards?!
- Tommy, I said "heads up."
- Yeah, and then I turned around!
But heads up doesn't mean "turn around"!
Heads up means like, Duck.
- Everyone knows that!
- Yeah? I beg to differ!
Paintball starts in an hour.
Where is private Tom?
Private tom is icing his privates.
Snapping him with a towel? Really?
I mean, what are you gonna do next?
Put bars of soap in a pillowcase
and beat him in his bunk?
All right. Look, I feel bad enough
about this without you piling on.
It was just a little locker horseplay,
and he turned into a heads up.
- That's all.
- So, you're saying this is his fault.
His testes just jumped into
the path of your towel.
Kind of, yeah. I mean, everyone knows
that heads up means you turn away.
You don't turn into a heads up.
It means a ball,
a puck, or a towel is coming your way.
I was kind of hoping we were
raising a gentleman, OK?
Not pluto, from "animal house."
- Bluto.
- Whatever.
No! That is, bluto! That's the kind
of stuff he's not learning over here!
Or on his nature walks
with "crocodile Krandall."
You know what, Gary? It's a good thing
Walter was here, because Tom got home.
He was so embarrassed, he didn't want
talk to me. Wanted to talk another man.
Wait. Wha... time out. My son's talking
to Krandall about this stuff?
Why isn't he talking to me?
I mean, I'm his father. I'm the man.
Yeah. Well, thanks to the man,
right now,
Tom is upstairs with a bag of
frozen peas on his scrotum.
Your dad's here! Bring down
that bag of peas! I'm makin'pot pie!
How are the fellas?
Hurt, angry, and a little less
trusting than they were before.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, son, but
way to man up and play hurt today.
Did you get a friend to play with us?
- What are you doing, Krandall?
- Tom invited me to join you.
No. No, Tommy, I said that you should
probably bring a friend, right?
Well, dr. K is my friend.
No, I meant, like, a school friend.
Like Brian, or Glenn.
Not a friend that needs
a chair in the shower.
Dad, Dr. Knows everything
about war and historic battles.
But this is paint ball.
You have a flag that you defend, and
you go and try to get
the other guy's flag.
You don't have to know about battles.
Hey, Dr. K, someone sounds like
the french at the battle of agincourt.
So, Tom, what do you want
for st. Crispin's day?
I'll tell you what I don't want.
Heavy French armor in the mud.
Get in the car.
All right, come on, let's go! Get'em
in here! Drag'em in here, you guys!
Come on, hurry up, hurry up! We've
got a few minutes while they reload,
and then they're gonna come at us
with everything they got, all right?
OK, we've got "boo goo" bad
guys up in the tree line!
Dad, would you stop talking like that?
You're freaking everybody out!
- Dennis is in bad shape, dad.
- Come on, Dennis, get up.
I'm in pain.
Of course you are. You had
3 breakfast sandwiches at a gas station.
What do you expect?
If something bursts out of my stomach,
kill it.
What's going on with you?
You're our point man.
You supposed to be there shooting
guys. You haven pulled the trigger.
I know. I'm just trying
to get a feel for my gun.
Well, you gotta get a feel for it,
and quick, OK? So, why don't you,
shoot Dennis.
Great. This is just like a war movie.
Ethnic guy always dies first.
Gary, if tom's truly a pacifist, perhaps
intimidation isn't the best motivator.
You wanna take over here? You wanna
be responsible for 4 souls out there,
walkin'the wire? Is that what you want?
- Actually, I'd be happy.
- Yeah, I didn't think so. Look. Dad,
Dennis, Tom, you guys form
a perimeter and meet back here at 03,
30, wait, 03, screw it!
3:30, come back at 3...
Ditty before they flank us, or we're
gonna end up in a world of hurt.
Dad, stop talking like
you were in Vietnam.
You've never been there.
All through the sixties,
all you did was manage to freak
out tents at "grateful dead" shows.
I remember you.
That's good. OK.
Let's, let's get out there and hustle.
Tommy, you cover Dennis's rear.
Would guys knock it off?
Come on, get out there, let's go!
Set a perimeter up!
Remember the altamont!
I noticed you didn't
give me an assignment.
Yeah, I thought it would
be good if you just,
stayed back here with me, Krandall.
Can you hand me my gun, Gary?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Walter.
You don't want to do this, Gary. What
can you possibly gain by shooting me?
For one thing, you'd be out of the game,
I'd have some private time with my son.
I'm not standing between you and Tom.
Yeah? Then why does he keep
coming to you for advice?
It's normal for teens to confide in
someone other than their parents.
All right. What is he telling you?
- I'm afraid that's confidential.
- That's the wrong answer.
Don't shoot me, Gary.
Why not? Give me one
good reason why I shouldn't.
At this close range, you leave
a doozy of a bruise and the guys
at the lap pool can be very cruel.
Get down, Gary! Duck!
Oh, my gosh!
It's coming from everywhere!
- Give me my gun. It's your only hope!
- No, I don't trust you!
- You can't afford not to!
- All right then!
I'm serious about Tommy, Krandall!
You stay away from him!
I'm his hero, you hear me?!
Ya don't get it, do ya?!
- Get what?
- You are his hero.
You're so much his hero, he doesn't
think he'd be able to live up to you.
Why would I think that?
He can never let me down.
Look at you, Gary.
You're a tough guy athlete.
You lettered in 4 sports, not to mention
your legendary tryout at the dodgers.
That's why he's tanking gym class.
It's less painful for him not to try,
rather than risk disappointing you.
- He could never disappoint me!
- Have you told him that?
Some things a son needs
to hear from his father.
All right, all right! Bring it in!
They got us covered from every angle,
I don't know what we're gonna do.
All right, hey, wait a minute.
Where's my dad?
I saw him at the lookout tower.
He said he's gonna smoke out the enemy.
But he said he only had enough
for himself, whatever that means.
All right. All right, guys, look,
let's call it a day.
Let's surrender.
I don't want anybody getting hurt, OK?
Surrender? I didn't come all
the way out here to get whacked
by 6 floor managers from
scooter's auto sound.
- Tom, we have.
- I'll see you in hell!
Yeah, that's right, dad.
I said hell again.
Who's with me?!
What the heck got into him?
Probably a combination of gangster rap,
video games,
and that yard long pixie stick
he inhaled at the gas station.
Gary, look out!
What did you do that for,
you crazy son of a bitch?
Needs his dad.
In fact, it's all he ever talks about.
When we go for walks around the... the,
- the...
- Krandall, stay with me.
Cul de sac.
I couldn't think of the word.
The point is, whenever we're together,
all he ever talks about is
how much he looks up to you.
Thank you, Walter. Thank you.
- I guess this is the end for me.
- Yeah, I...
I guess so, Krandall.
So, I'll see you back at the snack room?
Grab me a cheeseburger, would ya?
I'm already dead, for god's sake!
Here we go, guys. Ice cold
root beer for the victorious warrior,
- and one for Gary.
- All right.
But I'm riding this guy's coattails,
you know? I mean,
he captured the flag,
but I was on his team.
So, I'm Kinda making believe
I captured the flag, too.
OK, by that same logic,
because of my boyfriend,
I would have 3 nba championship rings.
Wait a minute. That's another clue.
OK, born in Canada,
3 championship rings, your, my!
You're dating rick fox?!
I think I said too much.
- You're really dating Rick Fox?
- No, I'm not dating anybody.
I just like messing with Gary.
So, Vanessa's dating an ex-laker?
That is so cool.
Unless you're the guy that used to date
her. I mean, who can live up to that?
Yeah, but, dad, you're practically
a pro player, yourself.
I mean, you tried out for the Dodgers.
Tommy, I probably left out a few
details about that, you know?
The tryout was an invitation
in the newspaper.
They said the first 1,500 people
that could get to the park could try out
for the dodgers,
and me and my cousin got there.
And... that was it.
My entire tryout was 2 pitches.
So, that was your big Dodger tryout?
Yeah, I just kind of
exaggerated over the years.
I was just a guy that was pretty good
at high school sports, which is nothing
to brag about, which is exactly
why I bragged about it constantly.
Your paintball story is already epic
compared to my entire sports career.
- You really think so?
- Yeah, hey,
I'm living in your shadow now,
buddy? OK?
Thanks, dad.
So what'd you do with those 2 pitches?
Well, the first one I wiffed.
The second one,
I, popped it out to the left fielder.
Yeah, he caught it with his bare hand.
But, at least you hit a ball all the way
to the outfield at dodgers stadium.
No, no, I didn't say hit
the ball to left field.
I said hit the ball
to the left fielder. He was
coming out of the dugout,
adjusting his hat.
And he just reached out,
and it Kinda just fell in his bare hand.
But, at least you hit a ball all the way
to the dugout at Dodgers'stadium.
You know I did, right?
I took this one near the end
of the battle,
- when I was unwrapping a stick of gum.
- That's nothing.
I took this one coming
out of the men's room.
- That's your own paint, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Just had to get out of that hell hole.
I didn't like what it was doing to me,
I kept wasting guys
and I didn't feel a thing.
I feel weird.
Maybe you're hungry.
Have you eaten anything since
the breakfast sandwich incident?
Yeah. I had a couple of brownies
out of Jack's backpack.
Why don't you sit here?
OK, little brother,
you're safe and warm
on a planet that loves you.
Kumbayah, my lord, kumbayah!
Kumbayah, my lord, kumbayah!
- Help me out.
- Kumbayah, my lord, kumbayah!
- What's going on over here?
- Dennis got into my brownies.
Someone's high, my lord
kumbayah!
Someone's high!
Someone's high, my lord...
It feels good to wash
all this paint off, Tommy!
All right, I'm all done.
The shower's all yours, son!
Hey, dad, heads up!
Dad, I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd
turn into it. I mean, I said head's up.
I'm so proud of you!
- Thanks, dad.
- Go get me a bag of frozen peas.
A very large bag of frozen peas!

Laissez-moi...
Votre veste s'est accrochťe.
Voilŗ.
Angelou.
Maya Angelou.
- Vous Ítes le pŤre de Louise.
- Comment avez-vous devinť ?
C'est la seule qui a choisi Maya Angelou
pour le projet sur les grandes femmes.
On a 5 Britney en papier m‚chť
et un pl‚tre de Paris Hilton.
Je suis Gary Brooks.
Erica St James.
Louise parle beaucoup de vous.
Louise m'a parlť de vous aussi.
- C'est un ange.
- Elle tient Áa de moi.
Je suis 1/4 ange.
Et aussi un peu de Labrador Retriever,
alors...
Si vous avez des balles de tennis
dans votre piscine, appelez-moi.
Vous me les rapporterez,
oý devrais-je vous courir aprŤs ?
Qui n'aime pas
se faire courir aprŤs ?
Vous devriez aller signer
et prendre les brochures
pour vous et votre femme ?
Non, c'est mon ex-femme, ex.
Elle tient ce titre de moi
aprŤs notre divorce et qu'elle soit
totalement sortie de ma vie, la voilŗ.
Excusez-moi.
Tu l'as rencontrťe.
Je dois te dire
que je ne suis pas impressionnť.
Allons, elle est trŤs jolie.
Je suppose. Enfin...
c'est que je le vois pas.
Elle est plus symťtrique... que jolie.
Je suis contente que tu dises Áa,
parce que j'ai h‚te
que tu rencontres Mlle Plummer.
C'est la vraie prof d'art.
Elle est intelligente et cultivťe,
et c'est mon modŤle.
Eh bien, je veux une femme
intelligente et cultivťe, devant moi
et tout de suite, jeune femme !
Va la chercher !
On en fait tout un plat, non ?
Je montre juste ŗ ma fille
que je ne suis pas superficiel.
Mais tu l'es.
Tu sais, Áa m'aurait blessť
si Áa ne venait pas
de quelqu'un physiquement mťdiocre.
- Je suis Joan Plummer.
- Je suis Gary Brooks.
On est ravies
d'avoir Louise en classe.
C'est bien d'avoir une jeune personne
si soucieuse de l'environnement.
C'est bien notre Louise.
Elle nous a mÍme fait remplacer
les assiettes en papier
par d'autres en bambou ťcologique.
En bambou. C'est ťtonnant.
On utilisait 200 assiettes par semaine.
«a m'a paru logique.
Pardon. J'ťtais pas sŻr
que vous soyez encore lŗ.
Allez, on doit aller
dans les autres classes de Louise.
OK, c'est un plaisir
de vous rencontrer Miss Plummer.
Louise veut Ítre comme vous.
Je vous connais depuis 5 secondes :
je voudrais Ítre comme vous.
Merci, et merci d'Ítre venu.
On se voit ŗ la gym, Allison
Au revoir.
Au revoir, Miss Plummer.
- Tu l'as apprťciťe, papa ?
- Elle est super, ouais.
Elle est tellement plus cool
que Mlle St-James.
Beaucoup plus cool. C'est sŻrement
pour Áa qu'elle met tant de couches
et d'ťcharpes de mamie.
- Allez-y. Je vous rejoins, OK ?
- D'accord, viens, chťrie.
Papa, viens lŗ. Regarde mon casier.
Danielle l'a vraiment fťminisť.
Kenny pťtait dans le casier
et fermait la porte
trŤs vite quand il me voyait arriver.
C'est beaucoup mieux.
Je vois rien ŗ toi
dans ce casier, dťsolť.
Non, regarde. C'est lŗ.
- Juste lŗ.
- Je vois rien. Je dois rentrer.
Dans le fond.
OK, attends. Ces cartes de baseball ?
C'est ma grotte.
Mon Dieu, ce parfum, c'est un meurtre !
Je le remarque plus.
Voilŗ.
Je vois Danielle au casier
de Jim et Ellen, ŗ plus.
Attends. J'ai ťteins la bougie ?
Oui, je l'ai fait.
Contente de vous avoir trouvť.
Vous vouliez une liste des numťros ?
Oui, merci.
C'est mon numťro juste lŗ.
J'ai le mÍme indicatif. Je nous trouvais
beaucoup en commun,
mais lŗ, Áa devient flippant.
Ne soyez pas effrayť, mais appelez-moi.
…coutez, je peux pas vous appeler.
Vous Ítes l'enseignante de ma fille.
C'est pas bien.
Je suis une remplaÁante pour 3 semaines.
Je vous appelle demain.
Je peux pas croire que je vous appelle
pour vous inviter. C'est fou.
Mais je paie mes impŰts, vous Ítes prof,
donc vous bossez un peu pour moi.
Si on sort ensemble,
appelez-moi Erica.
Mais pendant le rencard, je peux
vous appeler Mlle St James ? C'est sexy.
Je dois Ítre honnÍte avec vous.
Les portes ouvertes, c'ťtait cool
et la classe d'art,
c'ťtait le meilleur de toute la soirťe.
Je dois vous laisser,
je vous appelle plus tard.
C'ťtait Mlle Plummer ?
- Eh bien...
- Je le savais ! Tu l'aimes bien, hein ?
Mlle Plummer ? Ouais.
- Bien sŻr. Elle est super.
- Tu l'as invitťe ?
«a serait bizarre. C'est ta prof.
Non ! Je l'adore !
T'es cťlibataire. Tu dois sortir
et rencontrer des gens.
- Non.
- Rappelle-la.
- Elle ne sortirait pas avec moi.
- Appelle-la.
- C'est pas une...
- Appelle-la !
D'accord. Laisse-moi trouver son numťro.
Pourquoi tu fais pas "bis" ?
Tu viens de lui parler.
Mes doigts ont grossi.
Je les fais travailler.
J'ai un placard plein de gants
qui me vont plus.
Mlle Plummer, c'est encore Gary Brooks.
Bonjour Gary. Pourquoi "encore" ?
Je sais.
C'est sŻrement contre
votre politique de penser
ŗ sortir avec le parent
d'un ťlŤve, non ? Alors...
- Vous me proposez un rendez-vous ?
- Dťsolť.
J'aurais dŻ savoir
que l'ťcole dťsapprouvait.
En fait, on est libre
de sortir avec qui on veut,
et en fait, je suis libre vendredi.
Je m'en doute.
- Libre vendredi.
- Dis-lui oui.
Oui. On devrait faire
quelque chose vendredi,
et je vous appelle plus tard
pour planifier Áa, OK ?
- Au revoir, Mlle Plummer.
- Merci papa.
Ma confiance en l'homme est ravivťe.
Pourquoi ? Il a mis un pantalon
pour chercher le courrier ?
Papa sort avec Mlle Plummer
vendredi soir.
Vraiment ? Tu l'as invitťe ?
Ouais, bien sŻr.
Tu m'en veux ?
Qui ne passerait pas du temps
avec une fonctionnaire si... attirante ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu vas porter ?
- Quoi ?
Je devrais pas me contenter d'Ítre moi ?
T'as raison. Regarde-moi.
Evan et moi
on se fait attraper des fois.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Un bon exemple pour notre fille.
Tu rigoles ?
T'as invitť la prof de Louise ?
Pourquoi ? Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Y a rien de mal ŗ Áa.
On n'invite pas
les profs de ses enfants.
Tout le monde sait Áa. Il y a trop de
choses qui peuvent mal tourner,
et te connaissant,
elles vont mal tourner.
J'ai jamais pensť ŗ Áa.
Mais c'ťtait pas mon idťe,
mais celle de Louise.
Attends.
Elle t'a fait appeler Mlle Plummer ?
Ouais, car elle m'a entendu inviter
Mlle St James.
Attends, t'as aussi invitť
Mlle St James ?
- Je voulais le lui cacher.
- Gary !
Tu es tarť ? T'essaies de coucher
avec toutes les profs de Louise ?
Je vais coucher avec qui il faudra
pour lui prouver
que je suis pas superficiel.
Mon Dieu.
Tu dois annuler ce rendez-vous.
Je veux pas blesser ses sentiments.
Je suis sŻre que Mlle St James
s'en remettra.
Tu veux dire Mlle Plummer ?
Non, Mlle St James.
Non, Mlle Plummer.
Mlle St James, c'est la sexy.
Je sais. Tu dois appeler
et annuler le rendez-vous.
Je comprends plus rien.
Reprenons au dťbut.
Je recommence. Tu dois annuler
le rendez-vous avec Mlle St. James.
Comment tu peux m'embrouiller
en une phrase ?
Mlle St James est celle qui est canon.
Pourquoi j'annulerais ?
Parce que, Mlle Plummer est la prof
prťfťrťe de Louise et que tu l'as dťjŗ
invitťe ŗ sortir, alors tu dois aller
au bout, mais assure-toi
qu'elle sache
que vous sortez en amis, d'accord ?
Oý on emmŤne une amie ?
Je ne sais pas.
Un endroit qui n'est pas romantique.
Rťflťchissons. Rťflťchissons
ŗ des endroits pas romantiques.
La morgue.
Un cabinet d'avocats. Selon toi,
le cirque n'est pas romantique.
Tu sais quoi ? C'ťtait la pire
St Valentin que j'ai passťe.
Je sais. Mlle Plummer fait partie
de mon club de gym.
Allez lŗ-bas
comme si c'ťtait un rendez-vous sportif.
Bonne idťe. C'est un club de gym,
c'est pas du tout romantique.
Elle se fera pas de fausses idťes,
et comme y'a pas d'alcool,
je m'en ferai pas non plus. Merci.
- Ne merde pas.
- …coute,
j'aurais aimť savoir que tu avais invitť
Brian et Tara dans notre casier.
Ce sont tes amis.
T'as fini ? T'as fini ?
Il aurait dŻ ťtablir
un contrat de casier.
Elle est dťjŗ lŗ ?
Non, mais toi si.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Je m'entraÓne avec mon coach.
Non, tu es venue
pour m'espionner, pas vrai ?
Oui, un peu, et tu ferais mieux
de gťrer les choses avec tact avec elle.
Ne t'en fais pas. Je...
ce sera rapide et facile.
Et je dois partir d'ici.
J'ai un autre rencard dans 2 heures.
Quoi ? Tu n'as pas annulť
ton rendez-vous avec Mlle St James ?
On en revient ŗ Áa ? C'est pas ce
que j'ai retenu de notre conversation.
- Je n'en reviens pas !
- Je dois sortir avec Mlle St. James.
- C'est mon gros coup.
- Mon Dieu !
Tu es si superficiel !
Regarde jusqu'oý tu es prÍt ŗ aller
pour Ítre avec une crťature de rÍve.
Salut, Diego.
Vous Ítes prÍte ŗ vous entraÓner
jusqu'ŗ l'ťpuisement ?
Allongez-vous sur le tapis
et commencez ŗ vous concentrer.
Tout de suite.
- Comment Áa va ?
- Si vous travaillez avec moi, vous...
pourrez avoir Áa.
Pourquoi, alors que j'ai... Áa ?
Mon Dieu, vous ne ressemblez plus
du tout ŗ la prof d'arts plastiques.
- C'ťtait un compliment ?
- Un lamentable. Dťsolť.
Je recommence.
Mlle Plummer, vous Ítes superbe.
C'est gentil.
Merci de m'avoir invitť.
C'est normal. Vous plaisantez ?
Le courant est bien passť entre nous,
en classe.
J'espŤre que je n'y suis pas allť
trop fort.
Non, vous Ítes juste quelqu'un
de dťmonstratif.
Ouais. Quand vous dites
dťmonstratif, vous voulez dire...
Je ne sais pas ce que Áa veut dire.
Je vous donnerais peut-Ítre une leÁon
de vocabulaire, tout ŗ l'heure.
AprŤs la leÁon de vocabulaire,
on pourrait...
Vous n'allez pas m'en donner une,
pas vrai ? C'ťtait une plaisanterie.
Oui, une plaisanterie.
Tant mieux. Une vraie leÁon de
vocabulaire, c'est barbant.
Bon, vous voulez faire quoi ?
C'est...
vendredi, d'habitude,
je ne travaille que le cou.
Vous voulez faire de la boxe ?
Promis, je ne vous ferai pas mal.
Je ne sais pas, je n'ai jamais frappť
de fille, sauf ma cousine Gwen,
mais elle m'avait forcť ŗ venir
ŗ un concert de Scott Baio.
Ce sera marrant.
Vous vous y connaissez en boxe ?
Je porte des boxers.
J'ai un vieux juke-box, alors...
Je suis aussi compťtent qu'un autre,
non ? Allons-y.
- «a va ?
- Oui, trŤs bien.
OK. D'accord.
TrŤs bien.
- Attendez, vous Ítes douťe.
- Merci.
J'ťtais championne de boxe
dans ma catťgorie.
J'ignorais qu'il existait
un championnat fťminin.
Il n'y en a pas.
Dťsolťe.
Faut croire que je suis excitťe.
Excusez-moi. Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Elle est au courant !
- Quoi ?
Elle sait. Louise vient d'appeler.
Elle a entendu le message qu'a laissť
Mlle St. James
pour annuler le rencard parce qu'elle
a appris pour Mlle Plummer.
Attends. Mlle Plummer sait pour
mon rendez-vous avec Mlle St. James ?
Tous les profs sont au courant.
Pourquoi Mlle Plummer a acceptť
ce rendez-vous ?
Merde. TrŤs bien.
Ne bouge pas, OK ? D'accord.
Vous savez, j'ai oubliť de vous dire,
tout ŗ l'heure j'ai fait du cardio, on
devrait peut-Ítre faire du stretching.
Vous Ítes dťjŗ assez mince,
vous ne pensez pas ?
- ArrÍtez ! Je peux vous expliquer.
- Expliquer quoi ?
Pourquoi vous avez invitť deux profs
de la mÍme classe ?
Mon Dieu. OK.
Ou pourquoi vous en invitez une
ŗ faire du sport
et l'autre dans un restaurant
cinq ťtoiles ?
Attendez.
Donnez-moi une seconde, s'il vous plaÓt.
Pourquoi pas deux ?
On dirait que vous en avez besoin.
Ne soyez pas arrogante.
Dťsolť !
Tu es en train de te faire massacrer.
- Qu'est-ce que je dois faire ?
- Je ne sais pas. Sois honnÍte.
Confesse-toi, et je t'en prie,
essaye de balancer une droite.
C'est ce que je fais,
mais elle se dťplace trop vite.
Allez. Vous ne devez pas aller
ŗ un autre rendez-vous ?
OK, je suis dťsolť.
D'accord, Mlle Plummer ?
TrŤs bien. …coutez-moi.
Je l'admets, je suis superficiel.
Je vous ai jugťe par votre apparence.
Je l'admets.
Vous pouvez me frapper,
si Áa peut vous soulager,
mais quand je me rťveillerai
et que je pourrai remanger,
je vous inviterai ŗ nouveau
parce que vous Ítes fantastique.
- C'est trŤs gentil.
- Merci.
Appelez-moi.
C'ťtait pas ton jour, champion.
Allez.
- Voilŗ.
- «a sent le g‚teau.
Dťsolť pour tout Áa.
Je pensais vraiment Ítre plus mature,
mais en vťritť,
je suis attirť par le physique,
comme beaucoup de gens.
Si Áa fait de moi quelqu'un
de superficiel, trŤs bien.
Elle t'a vraiment mis une raclťe,
pas vraie ?
Je n'entends rien.
Tu dois parler dans ma bonne oreille.
Tu as ťvitť quelques coups ?
Oui, j'ai bloquť beaucoup de coups
jusqu'ŗ ce que mon úil droit se ferme,
et puis j'ai perdu
la perception de la profondeur,
Je parie qu'elle a mal aujourd'hui,
elle aussi.
En fait, je l'ai vue.
Elle va super bien.
Vraiment ? Elle a pas de marques ?
Son poing n'est pas enflť
d'avoir frappť mon visage ?
Merci de sortir avec moi, papa.
C'est assez gťnial.
Assez gťnial ?
Laisse-moi te dire un truc, chťrie.
C'est super gťnial,
et je passe un super moment, OK ?
Les mecs font des choses stupides
quand il y a de belles filles,
et tu devrais t'y habituer,
parce que les mecs vont faire
des choses vraiment stupides devant toi.
- Papa !
- C'est vrai, chťrie.
Faut que je te le dise,
- t'es magnifique.
- Je sais.
Scotty me l'a dit,
en voulant m'atteindre.
Hier, son úil qui louche
m'a fixť directement.
…coute,
j'aurais pu emmener Miss Plummer.
Tu me connais. Je peux me battre.
C'est juste une fille sans dťfense
Áa aurait paru terrible.
Oh, mon Dieu.
- Hť, papa.
- Hť, fils. Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
Danielle m'a jetť.
Comment Áa, elle t'a jetť ?
C'ťtait ton casier.
Non, on s'est disputť, et
elle a jetť mes affaires
dans le couloir et changť le cadenas.
Elle a trouvť mon livre de socio
dans le casier de Mary Ellen Mazowski.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il faisait lŗ-bas ?
- Je sais pas.
Elle voulait le regarder
avant le contrŰle.
Est-ce que Mary Ellen Mazowski
n'a pas son propre livre de socio ?
OK. J'ťtais lŗ-bas, l'autre jour
aprŤs l'ťcole
et j'ai mis mon livre dans le casier de
Mary Ellen. Rien de grave.
Si on ťtait en Europe,
Áa serait mÍme pas un problŤme.
Les femmes aiment vraiment Ítre
la seule et unique dans ta vie.
Tu sais ? Alors, tu vas faire quoi ?
Tu vas emmťnager avec Mary Ellen ?
Non, je vais me poser
chez Kenny un moment.
Tu sais, quand j'ai ouvert le casier
un faux chien m'a sautť dessus,
et j'ai ri comme j'avais plus ri
depuis longtemps.
Mais tu sais quoi ?
Je crois que j'en avais besoin.
Team Subs-Addicts"
I can't believe nobody's
thought of this.
What's, what's all that, son?
I had clear some space out of my locker
because Danielle is moving in with me.
The girlfriend's moving in?
OK, but, why buy the locker when
you're getting the combination for free?
She was always over there anyway,
and we were spending a lot of time
going back and forth between hers and
mine, so, you know, it just makes sense.
I'm proud of you, son. You know what?
I'm gonna take you to the Go-cart ranch
for one last hurrah.
How'd your old lockermate Kenny take it?
Not so good, but it's made
him take a look at his own life.
You know what? I think he's finally
gonna take that hall monitor job.
Oh, my gosh! Louise, that is awesome!
Yeah, she's got a few more finishing
touches before the open house tonight.
What are you talking about? It
already looks exactly like tracy Morgan.
It's Maya Angelou.
She's a poet and one of the most
amazing women of the 20th Century.
I don't want to disagree with you,
sweetheart, but I was reading "swimsuit"
magazine. They listed the 50 most
amazing women she wasn't mentioned.
It might not be the best time for that
kind of teasing. Louise had a tough day.
Sweetheart, what happened? Why'd
you have a tough day? What happened?
Miss St. James happened.
Miss St. James is a temporary teacher's
assistant in Louise's art class,
and apparently she's been drawing
a lot of attention from the boys.
Why?
She has arthritis?
She's a juggler?
She has enormous beach balls.
Got it, got it.
Good.
It's like every guy's IQ. Drops
50 points when she walks in a room.
When do guys stop acting so stupid, mom?
When they close the lid on the coffin.
Look, Louise, not all men are shallow
and just into looks. I mean look at me.
I married your mom. I didn't know if
she was gonna grow into that forehead.
My forehead? When you wear a Halloween
mask, his Lazy eye corrects itself.
Even my best friend Scotty,
who is smarter than me
can't take his eyes off of her.
When she walks n the room,
his Lazy eye corrects itself.
All right. Hey.
How hot is this teacher?
That's right. Were you not just
sitting here when you told your daughter
that all men are
not obsessed with looks?
How hot is this teacher?
Unbelievably hot.
It's like looking at the fricking sun.
You just.
You have to behave yourself tonight, OK?
'cause Louise is gonna be watching you.
- Of course, yeah.
- And, Gary.
Make sure to get all your giggles
out of the way now because Louise's
math teacher is still named
mr. Balzac, OK?

Here. Let me.
Your jacket is caught on the.
- Oh my!
- There.
Angelou.
Maya Angelou.
- You must be Louise's dad.
- Yeah, how'd you know that?
She's only one who chose Maya Angelou
for our great American women project.
We have 5 papier-mache Britneys
and one plaster of Paris Hilton.
I'm Gary Brooks.
Erica St. James.
Louise always talks about you.
Louise has been talking about you, too.
She's darling.
She gets that from me.
I'm a quarter darling.
And, I'm part Labrador Retriever,
also, so
if you have any tennis balls floating
in your swimming pool, I'm your man.
Will you bring it back or will
I have to Chase you around the yard?
Who doesn't like to be chased?
Why don't you go ahead
and sign in and
grab a pack of the reading materials
for you and your wife?
No, that's my ex-wife, ex.
She got that title from me
when I divorced her and got her
completely out of my life, here she is.
OK. Excuse me.
- Hey, guys.
- I see you met her.
I did. I got to tell you, not impressed.
Come on, Gary. She's very pretty.
I guess so. I mean, I...
I just don't see it.
She's more symmetrical than...
than pretty.
I'm so glad you just said that, dad,
because I can't wait
for you to meet Miss Plummer.
She's the real art teacher.
She's smart and well-read, and I
want to be just like her when I grow up.
Yeah! Well, you know what?
I want a smart
and well-read woman
standing in front of me,
and I mean right now, young lady!
Go get Miss Plummer!
Laying it on a little thick, aren't we?
What? Just showing
my daughter that I'm not shallow.
But you are shallow, Gary.
You know, that would hurt
my feelings if it wasn't coming
from such a mediocre-looking person.
- I'm Joan Plummer.
- Hi. I'm Gary Brooks.
Well, we are so happy
to have Louise in class.
It's nice to have a young person
so concerned about the environment.
Well, that's our Louise.
She actually switched us
from paper plates
to eco-friendly bamboo.
Bamboo. That is amazing.
We were going through 200 plates
a week. It just made sense.
Sorry.
I wasn't sure if you were still there.
Come on. Gary, we have to go to
the rest of Louise's classes, OK?
OK, hey, it's great to meet you,
Miss Plummer, OK?
I mean, wants to be you
when she grows up.
I've known you 5 seconds;
I want to be you when I grow up.
Thank you.
Thanks, and thanks for coming.
And I'll see you at the gym, Allison.
Bye, Louise.
Bye, Miss Plummer.
- Didn't you just love her, dad?
- She was awesome, yeah.
She's so much cooler
than Miss St. James.
Way cooler. That's probably why
she dresses in so many layers and wears,
like, granny scarves.
- You guys go ahead. I'll catch up, OK?
- All right. Come on, honey.
- Dad, come here. Check out my locker.
- All right.
Danielle has really girled
it up in there, hasn't she?
You know, Kenny used to fart
in the locker and shut the door real
quick when he saw me coming.
This is way better.
Son, I don't see any
of your stuff in this locker. I'm sorry.
- No, look. It's in here. Come on.
- No, that's...
- It's right there. Right.
- I don't see it. Got to get in there.
In the back.
In the back.
OK, wait. Those baseball cards?
That's my cave.
My gosh. That perfume is murder, Tommy.
- I guess I don't notice it anymore.
- Thank you.
All right, so. But...
I'm meeting Danielle at Jim
and Ellen's Locker, so I'll see you.
Wait. Did I blow out the candle?
Yeah. I did.
Mr. Brooks. I'm glad I caught you. Did
you want a classroom phone directory?
Yes, I would. Thank you.
That's my number right there.
I have the same area code. You know,
I thought we had a lot in common,
but now it's getting kind of scary,
you know?
Well, don't be scared, but do call.
Listen, I can't call you.
You're my daughter's teacher.
It's not right.
I'm just a temp.
I'm gonna be gone in 3 weeks.
I'll call you tomorrow.
I can't believe I'm actually
calling to ask you out. This is crazy.
You know, i'm a taxpayer, you're a
teacher. You kind of work for me, right?
If we're going out on a date,
you should call me Erica.
OK, but on the date, can I call you
Miss St. James? It's Kinda hot.
I got to be honest with you.
The open house was great and the...
The art class was
the best part of the whole night.
I have to go and I'll
talk to you later. Bye.
Was that Miss Plummer?
- Well.
- I knew it! You like her, don't you?
Miss Plummer? Yeah.
- 'Course I do. She's great.
- Did you ask her out?
Well, I you know, I don't.
That be weird for you wouldn't it?
She's your teacher.
No! I love Miss Plummer.
Dad, you're single. You got to get
out there and, you know, mix it up.
- I don't. I don't.
- Call her back.
- I don't think she'd go out with me.
- Call her.
- I don't think it's a good.
- Call her!
All right.
Let me get her number out of here.
No, why don't you just hit redial?
You were just talking to her.
My fingers are kind of fat.
I want to work them out.
I got a closet full of gloves.
They don't even fit me anymore.
Miss Plummer, it's Gary Brooks again.
Hi, Gary. What do you mean, "again"?
I know.
It's probably against
your policy to consider
going out with the parent
of a student, right? So.
- Are you asking me out?
- I'm sorry.
I should have known that the school
would frown on that kind of thing.
Actually, we're free to date
whomever we want,
and it just so happens
i'm available on friday.
I'll bet you are.
- Available on friday.
- Tell her. Tell her yes.
Yes. Yeah.
We should do something friday,
and I'll call you later
and we'll just shore up some plans, OK?
- Bye, Miss Plummer.
- Thank you, dad.
You've renewed my faith in men.
What did he do,
wear pants to go get the mail?
Dad's going out with Miss Plummer
this friday night.
Really? You asked out Miss Plummer?
Yeah, I sure did.
I mean, but can you blame me?
Who wouldn't want to spend time with
such an attractive... public servant?
- What are you going to wear, dad?
- What am I gonna wear?
Shouldn't I just, you know,
concentrate on being me?
You're right.
I mean, look at me.
Even I get caught up in it sometimes.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Setting good example for our daughter.
What, are you kidding me?
What, you asked out Louise's teacher?
Why? What's the big deal?
There's nothing wrong with that.
You don't ask out your kids'teachers.
Everybody knows that. There's
too many things that can go wrong,
and knowing you, they all will.
Well, I never even thought of that.
But it wasn't even my idea.
It was Louise's idea.
So wait a minute.
She made you call Miss Plummer?
Yes, because she heard me
making a date with Miss St. James.
I'm sorry.
You asked out Miss St. James, too?
- I was trying to slip that one by her!
- Man! Gary!
Are you out of your mind?
What are you trying to sleep
with all of Louise teachers?
Look, I'm gonna sleep
with whoever I have to
to prove to my daughter
i'm not shallow, OK?
God! Gary.
Look, you've got to cancel that date.
I just don't want to hurt her feelings.
I'm sure Miss St. James
will get over it.
You mean Miss Plummer.
No, I mean Miss St. James.
No, Miss Plummer. Miss st.
James is the hot one.
I know. You have to
call and cancel the date.
I'm totally confused. We have
to start this conversation over again.
Fine. I will start. You have to cancel
the date with Miss St. James.
How do you lose me after one sentence?
Miss St. James is the hot one.
Why would I cancel the date with her?
Because, Gary, Miss Plummer is Louise's
favorite teacher and you already
asked her out, so you have
to go through with it, but just be clear
that she knows you're just taking
her out as a friend, all right?
Where do you take a friend?
I don't know.
Just someplace that isn't romantic.
Let's think for a second. Let's think
of places that aren't romantic.
The mortuary.
Lawyer's office. According to you,
the circus isn't romantic?
You know what? That was, like,
the worst valentine's day ever.
Hey, I know.
Miss Plummer belongs to my gym.
Just take her there
and make it like a workout date.
Hey, that's a good idea.
And it's a gym, so it's not romantic.
She won't get the wrong
idea and there's no booze there,
so I won't, you know,
get the wrong idea. Thank you.
- Gary, do not mess this up.
- Look, Danielle,
I wish you would have told me you
invited Brian and Tara to our locker.
They're your friends.
Are you done?
Are you done?
He should have gotten
that locker prenup.
Hey, is she here yet?
No, but you are.
What are you doing here?
I'm working out with my trainer today.
No, you're here to spy on me,
aren't you?
A little bit of that too, and you better
handle things delicately with Miss P.
Don't worry about it. I'm...
It's gonna be quick and easy.
Besides, I got to get out of here.
I got another date in 2 hours.
What? You didn't cancel
your date with Miss St. James?
Is that where we landed? 'cause that's
not what I took from our conversation.
- I can't believe you!
- I have to go out with Miss st. James.
- It's my one shot at the bigs.
- Oh, my god!
You are so shallow! I mean, the
lengths you will go to to put yourself
in the presence of a perfect specimen.
Hello, Diego.
Are you prepared
to work your core today?
Lie down on the mats
and start focusing your attention.
Yes, I will.
- How you doing?
- If you train with me, you...
Could have this.
Why, when...
I have this?
My gosh, you don't look anything at
all like Miss Plummer, the art teacher.
- Was that a compliment?
- A poor one. I'm sorry.
Let me start over.
Miss Plummer, you look fantastic.
Well, that's sweet.
And thanks for asking me out.
Of course. Are you kidding me?
I thought we really hit it off in the,
art class,
you know. I hope I didn't come
on too strong in there.
No, you're just
a really effusive person.
Yeah. Effus.
When you say effusive, you mean.
I don't know what that means.
Ha! Well, maybe i'll give
you a vocabulary lesson later.
Well, maybe after
the vocabulary lesson, we can.
You're not. Not really, right?
You're just. It's a suggestive.
Yeah, suggestive.
Good. 'cause a real
vocabulary lesson boring! All right.
All right. Well,
what do you want to do? It's...
Fridays,
usually I just like to work neck.
Well...
hey, do you want to spar?
I promise I won't hurt you.
I don't know. I never hit a girl before,
except for my cousin Gwen,
but that's 'cause she dragged
me to a scott baio concert.
Well, it'll be fun.
Do you know anything about boxing?
I wear boxers.
I got my refrigerator from a box, so...
I'm as qualified as anybody else, right?
Let's get going.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, fine.
OK. All right. All right.
- Wait a minute. You're pretty good.
- Thanks.
I was golden gloves
champion of my weight class.
I didn't know golden gloves
had a division for girls.
Yeah. They don't.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm just excited, I guess.
- Hey. Excuse me. OK.
- What's up?
- She knows!
- What?
She knows. Louise just called.
She heard Miss St. James on
the answering machine leave a message
canceling the date because
she found out about Miss Plummer.
Wait. Does Miss Plummer know
about my date with Miss St. James?
The whole teachers'lounge knows.
Well, then why would Miss Plummer
agree to come here on a date?
Oh boy. All right.
Stay close, OK? All right.
Hey, you know, i, forgot to tell you,
before you got here, I did some cardio,
maybe we should just do some stretching.
You're stretched kind of thin already,
don't you think?
- OK, stop it! Easy. I can explain.
- Explain what?
Why you asked out two teachers
from the same classroom?
My gosh. OK.
Or why you're taking one out
for a workout
and the other one
to a 5-star restaurant?
My gosh. Wait!
Just give me a second, please.
Why don't you take two?
You look like you need it.
Hey, don't get cocky.
I'm sorry!
Gary, you're getting killed out there.
- What am I supposed to do?
- I don't know. Just be honest with her.
Come clean, and for god's sakes,
try and throw a punch.
I'm trying to throw a punch,
but she's not where I'm punching.
Let's go, Gary. Don't you have another
date you need to get to?
OK, I'm so sorry about this.
OK, Miss Plummer?
All right, look. Hear me out.
I admit, I'm a very shallow person.
I judged you by the way
you looked at work. I admit it.
You can knock me out if it's
gonna make you feel any better,
but when I wake up
and I start chewing solid foods,
i'm gonna ask you out again
because I think you're fantastic.
- That's really sweet.
- Thanks.
Call me.
All right. Just wasn't your night,
champ. Come on.
- Here we go.
- I smell biscuits.
I'm so sorry about all this.
I honestly thought I was
just more evolved, but the truth is,
I guess I'm just attracted to beauty
a lot of people are.
So if that makes me shallow,
then so be it.
She really clobbered you, didn't she?
I can't hear anything you're saying.
You have to talk more into my good ear.
Did you block any of her punches?
Yeah, I was blocking a lot of her
punches until my right eye closed up,
and then I lost my depth perception,
I bet she's feeling some pain today?
Actually, I saw her.
She looked great.
Really? There's no marks on her?
Her fist isn't swollen from
me beating it with my face?
Thanks for taking me out on a date, dad.
This is Kinda neat.
Kinda neat?
Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
This is super neat,
and i'm having a great time, OK?
And listen, guys do dumb
things around beautiful girls,
and you should get used to it,
because guys are gonna start
doing really dumb things around you.
- Dad!
- It's true, sweetheart.
I got to tell you, OK,
- you're beautiful.
- I know.
Scotty's told me,
trying to get on my good side.
Yesterday,
his Lazy eye went straight on me.
I could have taken Miss Plummer.
You know me. I can fight.
It's just, she's a defenseless girl.
It would have just looked terrible.
Oh, god.
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, son. What, what happened?
Danielle threw me out.
What do you mean, she threw you out?
That was your locker.
No we got in fight then she
threw all my stuff out
in the hallway and changed the lock.
All because she found my social studies
book in mary Ellen Mazowski's locker.
- What was it doing there?
- I don't know.
She just wanted to
look at it before the test.
Doesn't mary Ellen Mazowski.
Doesn't she have her
own social studies book?
OK. I was over there
the other day after school
and I put my book in Mary
Ellen's Locker, all right? Big deal.
If this was Europe,
it wouldn't even be an issue.
Women, they really like to know that
they're the only one in your life,
you know? So what are you gonna do?
You gonna move in now with Mary Ellen?
No, I'm gonna crash
at Kenny's for a while.
You know, the moment I opened the locker
some fake dog poop fell out on me,
and I laughed like I haven't
laughed in a long time.
But you know what?
I think I need it.

Les enfants, debout ! Bon sang !
Je ne me suis pas réveillé !
Panne de réveil ! Si je tombe sur celui
qui a inventé la fonction répétition,
je vais lui en coller une
toutes les cinq minutes.
Allez ! Dépêchez-vous ! Il ne faut pas
faire attendre votre mère.
Alors... ça termine notre exercice
sur ce qu'il faut faire
en cas de panne de réveil.
Retournez dans vos chambres
et mettez vos uniformes.
Ne faites pas attendre votre mère.
C'est bien. Allez.
Papa, j'en ai assez d'être réveillé
comme un pompier,
sans l'excitation du métier.
Allez, on s'en va dans cinq minutes.
Je vais faire quelques toasts.
- N'en fais pas tout un plat, OK ?
- "N'en fais pas tout un plat" ?
Pourquoi tu agis tout à coup
comme celle que j'aurais aimé épouser ?
On peut pas être en retard. Je contrôle
les retards. De quoi j'aurais l'air ?
Si tu programmais ton réveil ?
Tu pourrais me réveiller
tous les jours.
Pour la même raison que je ne vais pas
me conduire à l'autel :
ce n'est pas mon boulot.
Tom, trésor, n'oublie pas de te mettre
sur ton 31, ce soir.
Je n'en reviens pas
que tu m'obliges à faire ça.
Quoi ?
Elle a dit aux voisins
que j'inviterai leur fille
- sans amis au bal de l'école.
- Allez, sois sympa.
Ils viennent d'arriver. Ça ne va pas
te tuer de présenter Marjorie
à ses camarades de classe.
D'accord.
Mais on est officiellement quittes.
Après, je ne veux plus jamais entendre
que ma grosse tête a détruit ton corps.
Que se passe-t-il, ici ?
Tu es sympa,
tu fais le ménage sans raison.
Qu'est... mon Dieu,
le docteur a appelé, j'ai un cancer.
Au cerveau ou au colon ?
Je ne peux pas être sympa
et facile à vivre sans raison ?
D'après mes 15 ans de recherches, non.
Laisse le lave-vaisselle, il est cassé.
Qu'est-ce que tu as ?
On a arrêté une date, le 16 mai.
- C'est génial ! Vraiment génial !
- Pas vrai ? Je vais me marier.
Plus de pension pour Allison !
Plus de pension alimentaire ?
C'est peut-être de là
que vient le mot "pension alimentaire".
- Pension Allison. Pension alimentaire.
- Quoi ?
- Pension Allison. Pension alimentaire.
- C'est très excitant. Vraiment.
J'ai l'impression de savoir enfin
où va ma vie.
On dirait que j'ai évacué un calcul
rénal de 60 kg qui devait en peser 55.
Je me demande comment ça va être
d'être mariée
à un homme qui ne renifle pas
ses cotons-tiges usagés.
- Allez ! Vous êtes prêts ?
- Oui ! On y va !
Je dois y aller.
Je dois être à Long Beach à 9 heures.
Quelle belle journée !
Tu te souviens du "Magicien d'Oz",
quand le film a été
colorisé ?
J'ignore comment ils ont fait.
- Je suis vraiment désolée.
- "Ne lance pas le lave-vaisselle."
Il n'y a qu'une seule façon
de ne pas respecter cette consigne.

Je suis terriblement désolée.
Quoi. Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Tu te souviens, mon père m'a offert ce
journal quand l'homme a marché la lune
et tu disais qu'il vaudrait jamais rien.
Maintenant, tu as raison.
- Alors, c'est grave ?
- "C'est grave" ?
Tu rigoles ?
L'eau a coulé pendant 7 heures.
Tout le plancher gondole.
Les voisins encerclaient la maison.
Ils pensaient que la maison pleurait
et que c'était un miracle divin.
Je suis désolée.
Je suis vraiment désolée.
Arrête de dire ça.
On dirait moi quand on était mariés.
Tu veux vraiment que je reste ici ?
Je ne veux pas que tu restes,
mais après ce que j'ai fait,
je ne peux pas t'envoyer à l'hôtel,
car tu...
- tu me le reprocherais éternellement.
- Éternellement.
D'accord, alors... je t'ai acheté,
de la bière.
Et je vais te cuisiner un steak.
Et tu occuperas la chambre principale.
Mon ancienne chambre.
Génial. Ça sera comme...
ça sera comme montrer à un prisonnier
la cellule où il a vécu pendant 15 ans.
- Salut, papa.
- Salut, mon cœur.
Chérie ? Ton père va rester
avec nous quelques jours.
Et je ne veux pas
que ça soit perturbant, mais...
ton père et moi ne nous remettons pas
ensemble, OK ? Dans quelques jours,
tout redeviendra comme avant,
mais pas "avant" comme quand
on était mariés, mais "avant"
comme avant le plancher.
Je n'étais pas perturbée
avant que tu me l'expliques.
Je suis comme Louise.
On ne se remet pas ensemble, hein ?
C'est ça.
Fiston, tu pars quand
pour le grand bal ?
Dès que Gozilla aura arraché le toit
pour m'enlever.
C'est pas sympa. Tu sais même pas
à quoi ressemble cette fille.
Je sais mais c'est injuste.
Maman aurait dû me demander.
Quel est le problème ?
Tu l'emmènes au bal,
Tu la promènes en la tenant par le bras,
tu la laisses se remplir la panse
au buffet et tu la ramènes à la maison.
- Elle est là ! Elle est là !
- C'est grave ?
OK. Essaie de ne pas la fixer.
- Salut, Marjorie. Ça va ?
- Ravie de vous rencontrer M. Brooks.
Heureux de te rencontrer. Entre.
Faut que je dise quelque chose.
Je crois que ça y est.
Salut, Marjorie. Regarde-toi.
T'es si jolie. J'adore cette robe.
N'est-ce pas une jolie robe ?
Je te remercie de faire ça.
Trop la honte de sortir
avec la nouvelle, non ?
À un moment ou un autre,
on a tous été la nouvelle.
Tu sais quoi ? Chérie, tes cheveux
se défont derrière. Laisse-moi t'aider.
Allons parler un peu.
Tom, allez. Viens.
- Est-ce que ça va ?
- Non, ça ne va pas.
Mon cœur bat si vite,
que ma cravate bouge.
D'accord. Voilà de l'argent, OK ?
Est-ce que je lui donne maintenant
ou quand on revient ?
C'est pour dépenser au bal.
Désolé. Je suis juste...
un peu nerveux, tu vois ?
C'est une poche. OK.
Ça va ?
Laisse-moi t'aider
à calmer tes peurs, OK ?
T'as pas besoin de changer l'huile
de ta voiture tous les 4 500 km.
Ça va si tu le fais tous les 7 500.
C'est bon.
Qu'est-ce que ça a
à voir avec mon rencart ?
Rien. J'essaie juste de te faire penser
à autre chose. Allons-y.
Allez.
La mère de Marjorie attend.
Ravie de vous connaître, Mme Brooks.
Ravie de vous connaître, M. Brooks.
Allons-y, Tom.
Je veux juste vous dire que je suis
vraiment pas préparé pour ça
et c'est votre faute.
Vous êtes au courant que Tom est parti
avec une femme formée ?
Elle a 15 ans, Walter.
A-t-elle été envoyée d'une île
pour protéger l'humanité ?
Elle et sa famille viennent de l'Iowa.
Bien sûr. Le maïs.
Félicitations pour avoir pris
les rênes de l'équipe Allison.
J'espère que tu feras un meilleur boulot
que moi avec la franchise ! Allez !
On peut pas juste se taper la main,
ou quoique vous fassiez entre vous ?
J'ai amené les CD des groupes
de mariage potentiel que t'as demandé.
Il y a Dixieland, Disco...
j'ai même ajouté une peu de country
pour les Krandall du Texas.
Les Krandall du Texas. Alors quand
ils disent, "souvenez-vous d'Alamo,"
tu t'en souviens.
Très drôle, Gary.
Je m'en souviendrais la prochaine fois
que je serais allongé sur ton ex-femme.
Je vais mettre mon sac dans ta chambre,
d'accord ?
Attends un peu.
Pourquoi va-t-il dans ta chambre ?
J'ai inondé sa maison.
Le moins que je puisse faire
est de l'accueillir et de le laisser
dormir dans la grande chambre.
- Et tu vas dormir...
- Dans la chambre d'ami.
Attends un peu.
T'es pas jaloux, n'est-ce pas ?
De Gary ?
Combien de temps va-t-il rester ?
J'ai oublié de te dire
que j'ai peut-être
un peu exagéré avec cette fille
qui travaille au café.
Alors si le téléphone sonne, dis
que c'est le bureau du sénateur Brook.
Deux jours, max.
Alors, on se voit à l'école demain ?
Promets-moi qu'on déjeunera ensemble.
Je ne veux pas manger seule.
Demain c'est le jour du pain de viande,
alors j'amènerais du Beaujolais.
- Papa ! Papa !
- Hé, fils. Comment ça va ?
Je crois que je peux dire
que je suis vraiment dépassé, là.
Pourquoi, que s'est-il passé ?
Je sais pas si t'as remarqué,
mais Marjorie est assez sexy.
La loi ne m'autorise pas à avoir
cette conversation avec toi, mais...
je comprends ce que tu dis.
On a été le centre d'intérêt
toute la soirée,
les gens nous fixaient
et prenaient des photos.
Et puis l'entraîneur m'a pris
par l'épaule et m'a dit
que quelqu'un comme moi
pouvait servir en défense.
Je commence la semaine prochaine,
et je sais même pas quel sport.
D'accord. Calme-toi.
En étant avec une fille comme Marjorie,
tu vas attirer beaucoup d'attention.
C'est comme conduire une Ferrari.
Quand t'es à côté d'une chose
belle et soignée.
Je dois faire une métaphore
pour des raisons légales.
Les gens vont le remarquer, tu vois ?
Je crois pas que je peux gérer ça.
Tu sais,
je suis quelqu'un qui passe inaperçu.
Une partie de toi
n'a pas aimé cette attention ?
Allez. Dis-le. T'as aimé.
Oui. OK. J'ai adoré.
Je me sentais comme Dieu.
Tu te sentais comme Dieu ! Oui !
Très bien !
Va en haut maintenant, mettre ton pyjama
et te préparer à dormir.
Et demain,
tu t'assois avec elle au déjeuner,
et tu seras le mec
le plus cool de l'école.
Tu sais, je suis enfin
plus cool que Randy Wilcox.
Et il a amené son fils en classe.
Hé, Coloc'. J'avais oublié
combien j'aimais vivre ici.
Est-ce que tu t'es rasé
dans l'évier de la cuisine ?
Oui, mais t'inquiète pas.
C'était surtout le visage.
Que fais-tu ?
J'organise un mariage
et je suis avec un agent immobilier.
Je pense à vendre la maison
quand j'aurais emménagé avec Walter.
C'est Allison Brooks. Je vous ai parlé
la semaine dernière et je me demande...
Oui, et on a vu votre pub sur le bus.
Très joli sourire.
- Tu peux pas vendre notre maison.
- Non, mais je peux vendre ma maison.
Non. Dans ce contexte ? Ce serait fou.
Laisse-moi te la louer.
OK. Quoi ?
Tu veux pas déraciner les enfants.
Ils vivent ici.
Ils ont tous ces souvenirs ici.
Pense à tous les animaux
qu'on a enterrés dans le jardin.
Tu sais ? Une famille arrive,
ils veulent faire une piscine,
ils commencent à creuser. Et ensuite
un hamster avec un badge
pose plein de questions.
Je sais pas. Tu vois,
je serais ta propriétaire.
Oui. Tu serais ma propriétaire
et si je paie pas le loyer,
tu me jetteras dehors en plein hiver.
- T'adorerais ça.
- J'adorerais ça.
C'est parfait ! Alors ?
OK. Oui, tu peux louer ma maison.
Jessica, me revoilà !
Tu as appelé notre maison "Jessica" ?
Quand t'es en prison, tu te sens seul.
Tu commences à nommer les choses.
C'est parfait. Comme au bon vieux temps.
À part pour le bon.
Ton lama s'est perdu.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je crois avoir oublié mes clefs,
tout à l'heure.
Oui, les voilà,
juste où je les avais laissées.
Alors, que faites-vous ?
Eh bien, j'organise un mariage,
Gary me dérange,
et tu es manifestement ici
parce que tu es jaloux.
D'accord, et alors ? Je trouve déplacé
que Gary reste ici.
Il y a des hôtels et des motels.
Il pourrait même rester chez moi.
Il y a un canapé-lit
dans la pièce des trains.
Tu sais, j'aime pas ce côté de toi.
Nous allons nous marier,
et tu me fais même pas confiance ?
- Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire de nous ?
- Ça suffit vous deux.
Calmons un peu les choses.
Krandall a une pièce pour les trains ?
Mais je sais ce que c'est.
Juste de la tension avant mariage.
Ne perdons pas de vue
ce qui est important, d'accord ?
Et c'est moi qui déménage de mon trou
et qui re-emménage ici, OK ?
Tu sais ce que je ressens pour Gary.
Je coucherais même pas avec lui
pour lui sauver la vie.
Et au fait,
je crois que c'est comme ça
qu'il m'a eue la première fois.
J'ai juste dit que je savais pas
combien de temps il me restait.
- Et en fait, quelqu'un le sait ?
- Oui. Bon...
Si je voulais coucher avec Gary,
je dirais mon dégoût
aussi fortement que tu le fais.
Oh mon Dieu. Je peux pas croire
que tu sois si irrationnel.
Je peux pas gérer ça maintenant.
Je vais prendre un bain, un somnifère
et aller au lit.
Si on finit par dormir ensemble,
tu dois savoir
que je suis un homme qui aime être tenu.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
Mangue.
Patte d'ours ?
Walter, quoi...
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je suis venu
avec des pattes d'ours d'excuse.
La question est,
qu'est-ce que vous deux faites là ?
Oui. Gary, tu fais quoi là ?
Tu m'as dit de dormir là !
Qu'est-ce que toi, tu fais là ?
Je sais pas. J'ai pris un somnifère.
J'ai dû atterrir là par accident.
- Pourquoi tu me collais ?
- Pourquoi tu t'es lovée contre moi ?
Tu sais quoi ?
Quand tu te fais coller, tu te loves.
J'ai été élevée comme ça.
Et dire que tu m'as accusé
d'être trop jaloux.
Quoi, tu... t'es entré dans ma maison ?
- Tu es au lit avec un autre homme.
- C'est pas un homme. C'est Gary.
Exactement !
Elle a raison. Rien ne s'est passé.
Comme quand on était mariés.
Maman, où...
- vous faites quoi, ici ?
- Une patte d'ours, Louise ?
- Je peux, maman ?
- Oui, prends-en une pour ton frère.
Merci, Dr. Krandall.
On part à l'école.
Bonne journée.
J'ai aucune idée de ce qui se passe,
mais on a du sucre comme petit déj !
Les affaires familiales sont privées !
Je sais de quoi ça a l'air,
mais tu dois nous croire.
C'était un accident.
Je sais de quoi ça a l'air,
et c'était pas un accident.
Attends une minute.
Jette pas ton mariage
avec Allison. Et plus important,
tu vas bousiller mes chances
de revenir avec Jessica.
- Qui est Jessica ?
- C'est le nom qu'il donne à la maison.
Un truc de prison.
Désolé de décevoir toi et Jessica,
mais il n'y aura pas de mariage.
Allison n'est clairement
pas prête à être ma femme.
Walter, attends !
Tu peux pas partir comme ça !
Je le peux, et le ferai !
Walter est tombé dans les escaliers !
Jessica, qu'est-ce que t'as fait ?
Walter, ça va ?
Je vais bien.
J'ai jamais été bon pour les sorties.
J'ai de petits pieds
et mon centre de gravité est haut.
Joli sauvetage des pattes d'ours.
Voilà, laisse-moi. Laisse-moi t'aider.
Non, laisse-moi.
Je vais rester là et dire ma tirade.
Pourquoi dis-tu que je ne veux pas
me marier ?
Chacune de tes actions, en commençant
par l'inondation chez Gary,
est explicable par le subconscient.
Je peux élaborer ?
Non, je pense pas que ce soit bon
d'élaborer après une chute.
Gary, allez.
Walter, continue.
Il t'a dit de ne pas lancer
la machine, mais tu l'as fait,
en sachant que ça inonderait sa maison
et qu'il aurait besoin d'un endroit.
Tu dis que j'ai fait ça délibérément
pour l'avoir ici, dans mon lit ?
- Exactement.
- Tu as tort.
Elle a inondé ma maison seulement
parce qu'elle vit
pour faire de ma vie une misère,
et je suis là seulement
pour qu'elle le fasse
et économiser le gaz.
Non, Walter a raison. J'ai fait ça
inconsciemment en sachant que Walter
était si jaloux que s'il nous
attrapait au lit ensemble,
il annulerait le mariage.
C'était si délibéré.
Jusqu'aux somnifères.
C'est quoi, un vieil épisode
¨de "Quincy ?"
Tu peux le dire, Mangue.
Tu n'es pas prête à te marier.
Non. Ne le dis pas, Mangue.
- Ne le dis pas.
- Non, il a raison.
Je ne veux pas me marier.
Bien sûr que tu veux !
Regarde comme il est beau.
Tu l'aimes, il t'aime,
et il est...
il lui faudrait 2 hanches en titane
pour avancer jusqu'à l'autel.
C'est comme si notre relation
était juste une réaction
à mon mariage avec Gary.
Embrasse-la, Krandall.
Embrasse ta femme.
Walter, tu es un homme
aimant et gentil, mais je ne peux pas
t'épouser parce que tu es
complétement l'opposé de Gary.
Je comprends, Mangue.
Je mentirais en disant
ne pas avoir le cœur brisé.
Mais je vais te laisser partir,
et avec dignité.
Maintenant.
Airelle,
je vais te chercher de la glace.
Veux-tu aider cet homme
génial et gentil jusqu'au sofa ?
- Je peux pas le croire.
- J'ai peur qu'elle soit loin.
C'est là qu'ils envoyaient
mon "Sports Illustrés".
Les cartes de baseball sont prêtes.
Voyons ça. Qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
Harmon Killebrew.
Il est chaud.
Pour ce que ça vaut,
désolé que tu puisses pas retourner
dans ta maison. Mais
au moins Allison s'est pas mariée
à un gars qu'elle aimait pas !
Tu vois mon mijoteur ?
Il est par là.
Salut, papa, Dennis.
Ton père m'a dit que
tu conduis une Ferrari.
- Je conduisais une Ferrari.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
On était assis à la cantine,
je suis allé chercher du lait
et... elle est partie.
Ça a pas dû prendre plus de 30 secondes.
Celui qui l'a prise
devait savoir ce qu'il faisait.
J'avais pas à m'en faire
avec mon autre copine.
Je pouvais laisser Danielle partout.
Tu pourrais laisser ma femme
dans le jardin toute nue,
personne la prendrait.
C'est mieux d'avoir conduit une Ferrari
et de l'avoir perdue,
que de n'en avoir jamais conduit.
C'est Danielle.
On dirait que je vais reconduire le bus.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Kids, wake up! Oh, my gosh!
I overslept! Guys!
I overslept! If I ever meet the guy
that invented the snooze alarm,
i'm gonna slap him in
the face every 5 minutes.
Come on, you guys. Come on, hurry up! We
don't want to keep your mother waiting.
So. So, that, concludes our
drill on what to do in case
we ever oversleep. So...
Just go back into your rooms
and put your school clothes on.
Don't keep your mother waiting.
That's good. Come on, guys.
You know, dad, I'm tired of
being woken up like a fireman,
without the thrill of the job.
Come on, We'll be out of here in 5 min.
I'll pop in some toaster waffles.
- Don't make a big thing about it, OK?
- Don't make a big thing about it?
Why are you suddenly acting like
the woman I wish I'd married?
We'd better not be late. I'm the tardy
officer. How would that look?
Hey, why don't you set your alarm,
Louise?
And then you can wake me up every day.
For the same reason I'm not going
to give myself away at my wedding:
because it's not my job.
Hey, Tom, honey, don't forget to
bring some nice clothes tonight.
I can't believe you're still
making me do that, mom.
Do what?
Mom told the new neighbors
I would ask their friendless
- daughter to the school dance tonight.
- Come on, Tommy, be nice.
Be nice. They just moved in. It wouldn't
hurt you to introduce Marjorie
to the people she'll be
going to school with.
Fine. But we are officially even.
After this, I don't ever want to hear
about how my big head ruined your body.
What's going on around here?
I mean, you're being nice,
you're cleaning up for no reason.
What's, my gosh,
the doctor called, I have cancer.
Is it in my head or in my butt?
Can't I just be nice
and easygoing for no reason?
Based on my 15 years of research, no.
Don't run the dishwasher. It's broken.
What's going on with you?
Walter and I may 16.
- That's great! Allison, that's great!
- I know. Isn't it? I'm getting married.
No more Allison money!
No more alimony?
Hey, maybe that's where they got
the word "alimony" from.
- Allison money. Alimony.
- What?
- Allison money. Alimony.
- It is exciting though. I mean, really.
I feel like I finally know
where my life is headed.
I feel like I just passed a 120-pound
Kidney Stone that says she's 110.
You know, I wonder what it's
gonna be like to be married
to a man who doesn't smell
his q-tips after he uses them.
- Come on, Louise! You guys ready?
- Yep! Let's go!
I got to get going.
I have to be in long beach by 9:00.
What a happy day.
Remember in "the wizard of oz"
when the movie went from black and white
to technicolor?
I don't know how they did that.
- I am so sorry.
- "Don't start the dishwasher."
There's really only one way to
screw up those instructions.

[Sub-way. fr]
I am so sorry, Gary.
What. What is this?
Well, remember my dad gave me that
newspaper when man landed on the moon
and you told me it would never be worth
anything? Well, now you're right.
- So, how bad was it?
- How bad was it?
Are you kidding me?
The water ran for 7 straight hours.
Every floorboard buckled.
The neighbors gathered around the house.
They thought the house was weeping
and it was a miracle from god!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gary.
I am so sorry.
Stop saying you're sorry.
You sound like me when we were married.
You sure you want me to stay here?
Well... tch!
I don't want you to stay here,
but after what I did,
I can't make you go to a hotel,
because you...
- You'll hold that over my head forever.
- Forever.
Right, so... I... i got you,
some beer.
And I'm gonna make you a steak.
And I insist that you stay
in the master bedroom.
Oh, my old bedroom.
Great, you know. That'll be like...
It'll be like when they show a prisoner
the cell he lived in for 15 years.
- Hey, dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
Louise, honey? Your dad is gonna
be staying with us for a couple days.
And I don't want it to
be confusing, but...
Your father and I are not getting back
together, OK? In a few days,
everything'll go back to the way it was
before, but, you know, not "before" when
we were married "before,"
before the flood "before."
I wasn't confused until you
tried to explain it that way.
Yeah. I'm with Louise. I'm...
We're not back together, right?
Right. Yeah.
Hey, son,
when you leaving for the big dance?
As soon as Cowzilla rips
the roof off and plucks me out.
That's a lousy attitude Tommy. You don't
even know what this girl looks like.
Yeah I know, but it's just not fair,
dad. Mom should have asked me first.
What's the big deal?
You take her to the dance,
you stiff-arm her through
a couple of numbers, you
let her graze over the buffet and fill
her 4 stomachs, and you bring her home.
- She's here. She's here!
- How bad is it?
OK. Look. Try not to stare.
- Hi, Marjorie. How are you?
- Nice to meet you, mr. Brooks.
It's nice to meet you. Come on in, OK?
I'm gonna say something now.
That may have been it.
Hi, Marjorie. Look at you.
You look so pretty. I love that dress.
Isn't that a pretty dress, Tom?
You know, thanks for doing this, Tom.
Total drag taking out
the new girl, right?
Hey, at one time or another,
we've all been the new girl.
You know what? Honey, hair is starting
to fall in the back. Let me help you.
Let me. Let me talk to you.
Tom, Let's go. Come on.
- Are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK.
My heart's beating so fast,
my tie is moving.
All right, look. OK.
Here's some money. OK?
OK. Do I give it to her
now or when we come home?
That's for snacks at the dance.
Sorry. I'm just...
just a little nervous, you know?
It's a pocket. OK. You all right?
Let me help calm your fears
a little here, OK?
You don't have to change the oil
in your car every 3,000 miles.
It's OK to do it every 5,000 miles.
That's fine.
What does that have to do with my date?
Nothing. I'm just trying to get
your head out of it, OK? Let's go.
Hey, Tom, come on.
Marjorie's mom's waiting.
Nice to see you, mrs. Brooks.
Nice to meet you, mr. Brooks.
Let's go, Tom.
I just want to let you know that
I am completely unprepared for this
and I blame both of you.
Are you aware that Tom just left
the house with a grown woman?
She's 15, Walter.
Was she sent from some
Island to protect mankind?
She and her family just
moved here from iowa.
Of course. Corn.
Congratulations taking over
the reins of team Allison.
Yeah. I hope you do a better job with
the franchise than I ever did? Come on!
Can we just settle for a high-five,
whatever it is your people do?
I brought over the cds of the potential
wedding bands you asked for.
We got Dixieland, Disco...
I even threw in some Country-Western
for the Texas Krandalls.
The texas Krandalls.
So when they say, "rember the alamo,"
you do.
Very funny, Gary.
I rember that joke fondly the next time
I'm lying on top of your former wife.
I'm gonna go put my bag
in your room, OK, Allison?
Wait a minute.
Why is he going to your bedroom?
I flooded his house.
The least I can do is
put him up for a couple days
and let him sleep in the master bedroom.
- And you'll be sleeping...
- In the guest bedroom.
Walter, wait a minute.
You're not jealous, are you?
Of Gary?
How long is he gonna be staying?
Allison. I forgot to tell you,
I might have exaggerated
a little bit with this girl
that works down at the coffee shop.
So if the phone rings, please answer,
"senator Brooks'office."
Two days, tops.
So, I'll see you tomorrow at school?
Promise me you're gonna have lunch
with me. I don't want to eat by myself.
Tomorrow's meatloaf day,
so I'll bring a Beaujolais.
- Dad! Dad!
- Hey, son, how are you?
Well, I think it's safe to say
that I'm in really over my head here.
Why, what happened?
I don't know if you've noticed or not,
but Marjorie's kind of hot.
The law doesn't really let me have
this conversation with you, but...
I understand the words you're saying.
I mean, we were the center
of attention all night,
and people were staring
and snapping pictures.
And then the coach slapped
on the shoulder and told me
he can use someone like me on defense.
I'm starting next week, and I don't
even know what sport I'm playing.
All right. Calm down.
When you're with a girl like Marjorie,
you're gonna draw a lot of attention?
All right. It's like driving a Ferrari?
When you're next to something
that's sleek and beautiful.
Again, I have to go with the car
metaphor for legal purposes.
People are gonna notice, you know?
I don't think I can handle that.
You know,
I'm an under-the-radar kind of guy.
Didn't a part of you
tonight like that attention?
Come on. Let me hear it. You liked it.
Yes. OK? I loved it. I felt like a god!
You felt like a god! Yes! All right!
Now go upstairs and put on
your pajamas and get ready for bed.
And tomorrow,
you sit with her at lunchtime,
and you're gonna be
the coolest guy in school.
You know,
I'm finally cooler than Randy Wilcox.
And he brought his own
son to health class.
Hey, Roomie. You know I forgot
how much I loved living here?
Gary, did you shave in
the kitchen sink a while ago?
Yes, I did. Don't worry, though.
It was mostly my face.
What are you doing?
I'm planning a wedding, Gary,
and I'm on hold with a realtor.
I'm thinking about selling
the house once I move in with Walter.
It's Allison Brooks. I spoke with
you last week. I have this wonder...
Yeah, and we saw your ad
on the bus bench. Very nice smile.
- You can't sell our house.
- No, but I can sell my house.
No. In this economy? You'd be crazy.
Let me rent it from you.
OK. What?
You don't want to uproot the kids.
They live in the house.
They have all these
great memories here.
Think of all the dead pets
buried in the backyard.
You know? Some family comes in,
they want to put in a pool, they start
digging. Next thing you know, there's
a hamster with a badge
asking a lot of questions.
I... i don't know. I mean, Gary,
I would be your landlord.
Yes, you would. You'd be my landlord,
and if I fell behind on the rent,
you could just throw
me out in the dead of winter.
- You would love that.
- I would love that.
It's perfect! So? So?
OK. Yeah, you can rent my house.
Jessica, i'm back!
You named our house "Jessica"?
When you're in prison, you get lonely,
Allison. You start to name stuff.
This is perfect. It's just
like old times. Except good.
Allison, your llama got loose.
What are you doing out there?
When I was here earlier,
I think I left my keys.
Yeah, there they are,
right where I left them.
So, what are you two doing?
Well, I am planning a wedding,
Gary is bothering me,
and you're obviously here
because you're jealous.
All right, so what if I am? I think it's
inappropriate that Gary is staying here.
There are hotels and hostels.
I could even make room at my place.
There's a pull-out
couch in the train room.
You know, Walter,
I don't like this side of you.
We're getting married,
and then you don't even trust me?
- I mean, what does that say about us?
- Wait a min, you two. Knock it off
OK? Let's just slow things
down for a second here.
Krandall has a train room?
But I know what this is.
It's just pre-wedding jitters, OK?
Let's not lose sight of
what's important here, OK?
And that is me moving out of
my dump and moving back here, OK?
Walter, you know how I feel about Gary.
I mean, I would not sleep with
Gary if it would save his life.
Which, by the way,
I think that was the way he tricked
me into doing it the first time.
All I said was,
I didn't know how much time I had left.
- And in all fairness, do any of us?
- Yeah. Well...
if I was planning on sleeping with Gary,
I would express my disgust
as vigorously as you just did.
Oh, my god. I can't believe
you are acting so irrational.
I can't deal with this right now.
I'm gonna run a bath,
take a sleeping pill, and go to bed.
If we wind up sleeping together,
you should know
I'm a man that likes to be held.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Mango.
Bear claw?
Walter, what...
What are you doing here?
I came over with a box
of apology bear claws.
The question is,
what are you two doing here?
Yeah. Gary, what are you doing here?
You told me to sleep in here!
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
I took a sleeping pill.
I just I must have, you know,
stumbled in here by accident.
- Why were you spooning me?
- Why were you backing up into me?
Hey. You know what?
When you get spooned, you back in.
That's the way I was raised.
And to think you accused
me of being overly jealous.
What, were you just...
You just walked into my house?
- You're in bed with another man.
- Please. It's not a man. It's Gary.
Exactly!
She's right, Krandall. Nothing happened.
It was just like when we were married.
Mom, where...
- What is everybody doing in here?
- Bear claw, Louise?
- Can i, mom?
- Yeah, grab one for your brother.
Thank you, dr. Krandall.
Our ride to school is here.
Have a great day.
Tommy, I have no clue what's going on in
here, but we get sugar for breakfast!
Remember, honey,
family stuff is private!
Look. Walter, I know what this must
look like, but you have to believe us.
This was an accident.
I know exactly what it looks like,
and it was no accident.
Wait a minute.
Don't throw away your marriage
with Allison. And most importantly,
you're gonna blow my shot at
getting back together with Jessica.
- Who is Jessica?
- It's the name he calls the house.
It's a prison thing.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and Jessica,
but there isn't gonna be a wedding.
Allison clearly isn't
ready to be my wife.
Walter, wait a minute!
You can't leave like this!
I believe I can, and I will!
My god, walter fell down the stairs!
Jessica, what have you done?
Walter, are you all right?
No, I'm fine.
I've never been good at storming out.
I have small feet
and a high center of gravity.
Excellent save on the bear claws,
Krandall.
Here, let me. Let me help you up.
No, leave me alone.
I'm gonna sit here and say my piece.
OK. Look. Walter, why would you
say I don't want to get married?
Because every one of your actions,
starting with flooding Gary's house,
is explainable on a subconscious level.
May I elaborate?
No. I don't think it's good
to elaborate after a fall.
Gary, come on. Walter, go on.
Gary told you not to run the dishwasher,
yet you did,
knowing it would flood his house
and he'd need a place to stay.
You're saying I did all
this deliberately just
so I could get him over here
and get into bed with him?
- Exactly.
- You're wrong.
The only reason Allison flooded
my house is because she lives
to make my life miserable,
and the only reason i'm here
is so she can make my life
miserable and save on gas.
No. Walter's right. I did this all
subconsciously knowing that Walter
was so jealous that if he
caught us in bed together, he would
call off the wedding.
God, it was all so deliberate.
Right down to the sleeping pills.
What is this,
an old episode of "quincy"?
You can say it, Mango.
You're not ready to get married.
No. No, don't say it, Mango.
- Don't say it.
- No, he's right.
I don't want to get married.
Sure, you do! Yes, you do!
Look how handsome this guy is.
You love him, he loves you,
and he's just.
He's two titanium hips away
from walking down the aisle.
It's like our whole relationship
was just a reaction
to my marriage with Gary, wasn't it?
Kiss her, Krandall. Kiss your woman.
Walter, you are a loving
and kind man, but I cannot marry
you just because you're, like,
the complete opposite of Gary.
I understand, Mango.
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't heartbroken.
But I'm gonna let you go,
and I'm gonna do it with dignity.
Starting now.
Cranberry, I'm gonna get you some ice.
Gary, would you help this wonderful,
sweet man to the sofa?
- Man, I can't believe it.
- No, I'm afraid she's gone, Gary.
This is where they've been
sending my "sports illustrated."
The baseball cards are done.
Well, let's see them. Let's see them.
What have we got? Harmon killebrew.
He's hot.
For what it's worth, you know,
i'm sorry you couldn't move
back into your old place. But, hey,
at least Allison didn't marry a guy
she wasn't in love with?
You see my crockpot?
It's over there.
Hey, dad. Hey, Dennis.
Your dad tells me you're
driving a Ferrari.
- I was driving a Ferrari. Was.
- What do you mean, was?
We were sitting outside
the lunchroom, and
I went inside to grab some milk, and...
she's gone.
Couldn't have been more than 30 seconds.
Whoever took her must have
known what he was doing.
You know, I never had to worry
about that with my old girlfriend.
I could leave Danielle anywhere.
You could leave my wife
on the front lawn with her robe open,
no one would take her.
Look. Son,
it's better to have driven a Ferrari
and lost than to have
never driven a Ferrari.
It's Danielle.
Looks like I'm back to riding the bus.

T'as gagné.
Je conduirai les enfants

C'est quoi cet endroit ?
C'est la maison McKenzie.

Elle était à Hamish Mckenzie.
Un magnat de la navigation

La maison a été restaurée en 1975,
et avant ça,
c'était un squat
pour pauvres et hippies.
Voilà.
J'ai habité ici en 71.
Y a toujours cette grande salle à orgies

La remise à calèches ?
Je suis sûr
que c'était une salle à orgies.
J'ai une réduction de taxe

Excusez-moi. Je cherche mon...
- Gary, c'est génial.
- Je peux pas ne pas être d'accord.
- Ça fait longtemps.
- Je sais pas.
Sûrement depuis la dernière fois qu'on
s'est vu, qui était quand ?
Tu me reconnais pas, hein ?
Jette-moi un verre au visage.
Voir si ça me rafraîchit la mémoire.
Anna ! Tu es une...
Oh, mon Dieu, Anna !
T'es la petite sur de Dennis.
- C'est cool de te voir.
- Toi aussi.
T'étais censée être là y a une heure.
Appelle-moi quand t'es en retard.
Désolée, OK ? Je cherchais un boulot.
Tu me veux plus sur ton canapé, non ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Tu vis plus à Chicago ?
Je suis revenue après que
mon stupide copain m'a lâchée.
Allez, qui te lâcherait ?
- Beaucoup de gars.
- Vraiment ?
Elle est sérieuse.
Beaucoup de mecs.
Beaucoup.
Et ta recherche de boulot ?
J'ai eu une offre, mais je veux pas
m'habiller en téléphone portable

J'ai peut-être un boulot pour toi.
Allison cherche quelqu'un
pour l'aider à la maison
- et avec les enfants, à mi-temps.
- Vraiment ? Ça serait super.
Comment vont Louise et Tom ?
Fantastique et facile à distraire,
dans cet ordre.
Allison, c'est Gary,
j'ai la réponse à tous tes problèmes,
à part les vergetures
et ta voix stridente.
On a dû être coupé.
Voilà. Parle-lui, OK ?
Allison, salut. C'est Anna Lopez.
J'ai entendu que tu cherchais quelqu'un.

Salut, Gary. À plus, débile.
Désolé de te déranger. Louise voulait

Elle a dit que tu oublierais.
Elle a un poisson ?
- Entre.
- Où est sa chambre ?
Au bout du couloir à droite.
C'est la chambre de fille.

Fantastique.
Merci beaucoup pour le boulot.
De rien. Tu es la sur de Dennis,

Tu te rappelles quand

Je continue de penser
que tu aurais été géniale à Clemson.
Oui mais j'étais pas inscrite,
j'avais nulle part ou vivre,
alors ça aurait été dur
comme première année.
Mais le boulot est cool.
Allison est génial,

pour que le poisson rouge reste en vie.
Je sais pas. On a pas trop de chance

et elle est pas du tout
fun quand tu es marié à...
Mon Dieu, je parle trop fort ?
Je pensais que tu étais là-bas.
Je pensais que je devais te suivre.
J'en suis content
parce que je suis paresseux. Tiens.
- À nos retrouvailles.
- À la tienne.
Tu sais, j'avais le béguin pour toi,
quand j'étais jeune.
Vraiment ? Je l'ignorais.
J'embrassais mon oreiller
en pensant à toi.
Quelle coïncidence. J'embrassais
Allison en pensant à quelqu'un d'autre.
Tu es nerveux ?
- Tu trembles.
- Je suis devant le frigo.
Laisse-moi te réchauffer.
Attends. C'est mal.
Tu es la petite sur de Dennis.
Techniquement,
je suis plus sa petite sur.
Je suis une adulte,
tu n'as pas remarqué ?
Tu parles que j'ai remarqué.
J'ai remarqué, j'ai remarqué.
Si on continue comme c'est parti,
ce qui serait l'un des trucs
les plus génial
qui puisse m'arriver y compris
la fois où j'étais derrière
Chuck Norris dans un escalator.
Et si on rompt ?
Dennis aurait le cur brisé.
C'est mon meilleur ami
Je peux pas lui faire ça désolé.
OK. Tu as raison, tu es un bon ami.
Je voulais juste accomplir
un petit fantasme innocent où
je retournerais Gary Brooks
à grand coup de sexe.
Et ça n'aura pas lieu.
Si pendant une minute,
tu pouvais faire comme si
tu n'étais pas le meilleur ami
de mon frère ?
Juste une minute,
et je t'embêterai plus jamais.
Tu dois comprendre un truc. D'accord.
On devrait sûrement s'arrêter.
Pas moyen, il me reste 48 secondes.
Je compte dans ma tête.
45, 4... Hé !
Je sais pas comment ce serpent
t'a mordu la langue,
mais je pense avoir aspiré le venin.
Je ferais mieux de trouver
ce petit enfoiré.
Je peux t'expliquer.
T'as pas à t'expliquer. J'ai des yeux.
- On faisait que...
- Que
faire de moi le plus heureux des frères.
Oh, mon Dieu...
- Je te suis pas.
- C'est génial.
Tout le monde dans ma famille priait
pour qu'Anna se trouve un mec bien,
- et elle l'a fait.
- Vraiment ? Qui ?
Toi, andouille. Allez, je m'en vais,
et vous reprenez là où vous en étiez.
C'était bizarre et tu sais quoi ?
Maintenant que le danger
est écarté,
ça m'intéresse plus vraiment.
Mon Dieu, cette nuit a été incroyable.
J'en reviens pas.
Bonjour, chérie. Je t'ai laissé dormir,
mais tu ferais mieux de te bouger.
J'ai fais la lessive. Une chose, chérie,
tu veux bien vider tes poches
avant mettre tes affaires à laver ?
Je repêche des pièces
- du séchoir depuis ce matin.
- Tu as fait la lessive ?
Et le docteur a confirmé
ton rendez-vous de vendredi.
Chérie, tu peux me le dire
quand tu prends des rendez-vous
qu'on prévoit pas des trucs
en même temps. On est une équipe, non ?
J'ai dormi combien de temps ?
Ce petit salon est actuellement
en réparation,
mais c'est là que M. Mckenzie
prenait son petit-déjeuner,
établissait des contrats,
et rencontrait les marchands locaux.
Oui, et Dennis Hopper jouait
au backgammon avec Frank Zappa juste là.
Ne faites pas attention.
Cette rumeur n'est pas fondée.
S vous voulez bien passer
dans la cuisine où...
Où...
Où Tommy Smothers
n'a jamais fait de space gâteau !
Space cake...
Et si, il l'a fait.
Je crois qu'elle m'apprécie.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
C'est la sur de Dennis.
Elle me rend un peu dingue.
On est sorti ensemble y a 3 jours,
et elle fait comme si on était marié.
C'est le deuxième mariage que tu foires.
Non. On est pas marié.
Et c'est le 2ème divorce que je rate.
Excuse-moi.
Hé, regarde qui j'ai trouvé.
Chéri, t'as oublié ton déjeuner.
T'oublierais même ta tête
si elle était pas fixée.
Tu sais quoi ? Merci, mais
je vais sortir manger avec les gars.
La nourriture de restaurant
est pleine de sel,
et je veux pas que mon Gary soit bouffi.
Et je t'ai acheté de nouveaux caleçons.
Je pensais que tu voudrais essayer
ceux dans lesquels
l'élastique est intégré au tissu.
Ce que vous êtes adorables ?
Je voudrais vous croquer.
J'ai parlé à maman et papa. Ils veulent
qu'on aille chez grand-mère pour Pâques.
- J'ai hâte que tu la rencontres.
- Moi ?
Elle va te manger à la petite cuillère.
C'est quoi le problème ? Vous pouvez pas
aimer quelqu'un sans le manger ?
Je te vois pour le dîner,
et sois pas en retard.
Je prépare un truc spécial.
Bye, chéri.
À plus, stupide.
Je l'ai jamais vu aussi heureuse.
C'est super qu'elle soit avec quelqu'un
qui va bien la traiter,
- pas comme tous les autres.
- Tu sais quoi ? Pour être honnête,
on a jamais entendu
les versions des autres.
Que fais-tu ici ?
T'as pas les enfants aujourd'hui.
Quoi, faut que j'ai les enfants
pour venir chez toi ?
D'après le tribunal, oui.
Je sais que tu travailles très dur
avec l'école et tout ça, et
je t'ai vraiment jeté la sur de Dennis
à la gorge, alors si ça te dérange et
que ça marche pas pour toi,
j'en suis vraiment désolé.
Anna est formidable.
Je m'en sortirais pas sans elle.
Donc si elle était en colère et quittait
la ville, ce serait pas cool ?
Non. Ce serait pas cool,
je l'adore, les enfants aussi.
La seule chose qui soit pas cool,
c'est qu'elle sorte avec un type âgé.
Tu dois le connaître. C'est toi !
T'es devenu fou ?
J'ai enfin trouvé la nounou parfaite.
Mary Poppins descend du ciel en flottant
et tu regardes sous sa jupe.
Elle m'étouffe.
Elle laisse des post-it
"Je t'aime Gary" partout dans la maison.
Elle dessine des curs
en rouge à lèvres sur mes glaces,
et elle fait couler mon bain.
Elle me masse les pieds.
Quelle salope !
Tu peux pas rompre avec elle, OK ?
Si tu la jettes, elle me jettera,
et j'ai bien plus besoin d'elle que toi.
- Trouve quelqu'un d'autre.
- T'es coincé.
La seule chose que tu puisses espérer
c'est qu'elle rompe avec toi. Ainsi,
Dennis ne t'en voudra pas
et elle ne me quittera pas.
Elle va pas rompre avec moi.
Qui quitterait ça ?
Moi, et n'importe quelle femme
qui a des jambes.
Pourquoi m'as-tu quittée ?
Pourquoi avons-nous divorcé ?
Il y a des cartons de transcriptions.
Tu peux les lire.
Écoute.
Si tu veux qu'elle rompe avec toi,
arrête d'être
le Gary du premier rendez-vous ?
Sois le Gary après 10 ans
avec les caleçons ouverts le matin
et qui pisse dans la douche...
Compris.
Et les pets, les grattages, les rots,
le coupage d'ongles sur le canapé...
J'ai compris !
Je suis un homme dégoûtant !
Comment ça va ?
Hé, chéri, t'étais où ?
Dans un bar. Je sais que
t'as dû préparer le dîner et tout,
mais je suis déjà rempli de poulet et de
bière et si tu m'en veux, m'en fiche.
Je t'en veux pas. Je vais tout mettre
au frigo pour que tu l'aies plus tard.
Ne me le donne pas comme des restes
parce que j'en mange pas,
d'accord, et si ça te dérange,
je m'en fiche.
Je suis pas en colère.
Tu peux manger ce que tu veux.
Tu sais quoi ? Peut-être que
je ne veux pas manger ce que je veux.
Qu'est-ce que t'as ? On dirait qu'un
type complètement différent est entré.
Oui, c'est ça. OK, poupée ?
Le vrai Gary Brooks vient d'entrer, OK ?
Faut que tu t'y fasses,
et si tu m'en veux, je m'en fiche.
Tu plaisantes ?
J'adore ça.
Ça veut dire
que t'es suffisamment à l'aise
dans notre relation pour être toi-même.
On vient de faire
un grand pas aujourd'hui.
OK. c'est bon. OK.
- Temps mort.
- Super.
Je veux pas faire un grand pas.
Je sors à peine d'un mariage, et
avec toi, on dirait que j'entre
dans un nouveau mariage.
On dirait que t'es ma femme.
Parce que je cuisine ce que tu aimes,
et que je m'occupe
de toi, et fais l'amour quand tu veux ?
Oui. T'es pas du tout comme ma femme.
Ça fait 3 jours. Tu crois pas
que c'est un peu trop intense ?
Attends. Qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
T'es en train de rompre avec moi ?
Non.
J'aimerais que tu rompes avec moi.
- Eh bien, ça n'arrivera pas.
- Alors, c'est moi qui rompt avec toi.
Pourquoi ?
Ne le prend pas mal.
T'es belle, et je t'aime vraiment bien,
mais t'es un peu trop fofolle.
Et voilà.
On me reparle de fofolle.
Encore ?
On t'a déjà dit que t'étais fofolle ?
Pleins de fois, et quand on en parle
c'est le premier avertissement
que quelque chose ne va pas.
- Anna, je ne voulais pas...
- Non, t'as foiré.
On ne revient pas de fofolle.
- Hé, le voilà.
- T'as parlé à ta sur ?
T'as pas dû entendre la nouvelle.
Je savais que ça arriverait,
mais pas que ça arriverait si vite.
- Dennis, Dennis...
- Attends.
Je me rappellerai toujours de ce moment
et je veux qu'il soit parfait.
Attends.
Dis les mots
que je meurs d'envie d'entendre.
- J'ai largué ta sur.
- C'étaient pas ceux-là. Essaie encore.
Ça marchait pas. J'ai rompu.
Pas de quoi en faire une histoire.
Mais tu peux pas la considérer
comme un jouet et la jeter.
Un vrai ami ne ferait pas ça.
Tu fais chier, je démissionne.
On peut en parler ?
Tout ce que t'as à me dire, tu peux
le dire devant mes amis.
- Mes vrais amis.
- Tes vrais amis ?
On a pris 3 de ces mecs ce matin.
Tu sais quoi ? Je leur fais
plus confiance qu'à toi.
Ça n'a pas marché entre moi et ta sur.
J'ai essayé de lui dire, mais elle a pas
voulu écouter, OK ?
Alors, c'est de sa faute. Vous y croyez,
il rejette la faute sur ma sur.
Le Gary dit que c'est la faute
d'Anna s'ils se sont séparés.
Je savais que si je rompais,
ça te briserait le cur,
et je ne veux pas te faire ça, OK ?
Alors, c'est de ma faute.
Vous y croyez, les gars ?
Vous y croyez ? Maintenant,
Gary dit que c'est la faute de Dennis.
Il y a toujours 2 versions
d'une histoire,
et je suis pas sûr
que la mienne soit représentée ici.
Excusez, amigos.
La sur de Dennis très jolie, mais
tout le temps ici, ici, ici.
"Ici, ici, ici."
Je me casse.
Attends. Tu disais
que ta sur était un morceau,
- n'est-ce pas ?
- Je sais pas de quoi tu parles.
Tu m'as dit que "beaucoup de mecs"
l'avaient larguée.
Notre culture est passionnée.
C'est tout ce que je sais.
Tu voulais que ça marche
pour que t'aies plus à t'en soucier ?
- Je sais pas.
- Tu sais pas ?
- Peut-être.
- Peut-être ?
Je me suis emporté. J'étais excité
que tu fasses partie de la famille.
T'es mon meilleur ami.
On est déjà de la famille.
On peut pas revenir
à juste toi et moi ?
Je sais pas.
Vous en pensez quoi les mecs ?
On est 4 à penser que
vous devriez rester ensemble, 3 contre,
et un pense que tout ça est un peu gay.
Qu'est ce que t'en dis ? Ça fait 4 pour
qu'on reste ensemble, 3 contre et 1 gay.
J'ai encore les places pour les Lakers.
On a de la peinture dorée et violette,
je pourrais me peindre un grand L.
Tu te peindrais un grand A ?
Maintenant c'est unanime.
On pense tous que ça fait gay.
- Oh, mon Dieu papa !
- Salut.
Tu connais Miss Peters.
- Bonjour, Miss Peters.
- M. Brooks.
Mon père vous embête ?
Mais vous me gâchez mon plaisir.
Oui, je vais prendre un jour de congé.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Hey guys, I saw your mom pull up.
So, put down your juice boxes,
close up your tabs You know,
let's go to your mom's house.
But you got to get the heck out of here.
You know, dad, you forgot all
about my cello practice yesterday.
Or did i?
And you forgot to remind
me about my science paper.
Sorry, hammer.
I talked to you about it last night.
You told me you finished it, so we're
gonna have to tell mom about that one.
Or do we?
Hey, guys, would you go wait in the car?
I got to talk to your dad for a second.
If we're gonna talk,
I need one of them as a witness.
I just wanted to remind
you that starting tomorrow
is that thing I told
you about last week.
Yeah, the thing.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
The thing. No. I don't know. I told you.
You want me to really
remember something, you have to
make it rhyme and turn it into
a Catchy tune.
I was hired to be a research
assistant on a project that's cool,
so I need you to drop off and
pick up the kids at their school
- for the next 6 weeks yeah.
- I can't do it.
What?
I'm renovating the mckenzie house,
big job.
That's a historic Landmark.
I got to be on site the whole time
and keep an eye on the workers.
This could really lead to
a lot more work, so, sorry,
you're gonna have to find somebody else.
That's too bad. Maybe you know
someone who could help me with these.
Yeah. I won them in a raffle.
- Laker tickets.
- They are. Yeah.
Of course, I don't think
they're very good seats because
they're behind a bench of some kind.
You win, you win, you win.
Lakers-cavaliers. You totally win.
Look. I'll drive the kids around
whenever you need me to,
I'll keep my ears open and my eyes open
for anybody that can help you part-time?
There are your tickets. It's never
a pleasure doing business with you.
I got to bring my air horn to the game.
Not you. I mean the actual one
that used to come in a can.
Well, have fun
with Dennis at the lakers.
All my orgasms were fakers
for the last 15 years

Look at these seats. These are way
better than the last time we went.
I know. Remember?
Our seats were terrible.
You put your binoculars
in front of my binoculars,
and we still couldn't
tell which dot was kobe.
We're gonna sit behind the bench.
Good morning, mr. Brooks.
Hi, Miss Peters.
I like to make all my workers feel good.
I give them a motivational
hug every morning.
That...
I'm not gonna let you down,
Miss peters. I appreciate the work,
and you're gonna find that my crew
is top-notch and professional.
Deja vu.
No. It's not deja vu, dad.
It's your fifth trip into the room.
That's not it. It's something else.
What is this place?
It's the Mckenzie house.
It's an historic Landmark.
This was owned by Hamish Mckenzie.
He was a shipping magnate
in the late 19th century.
The house was restored in 1975,
and before that,
it was a flophouse
for indigents and hippies.
That's it.
I lived here in'71.
You still got that big orgy room out
in the back yard with the giant doors?
You mean, the carriage house?
No. I'm pretty sure it was an orgy room.
I get a tax break by hiring him.
Pardon me. I'm looking for my...
- Gary, this is amazing.
- Yeah. I can't disagree.
- How long has it been?
- I don't know.
Probably since like, the last time
we saw each other which was when?
You don't recognize me, do you?
Throw a drink in my face.
See if it jogs my memory.
Anna! You're an...
Oh, my god, Anna!
You're Dennis' little sister Anna.
- It's good to see you again.
- You, too.
Anna, you were supposed
to be here an hour ago.
When you're late, you got to call me.
I'm sorry, Dennis, OK?
I was out looking for a job.
You want me off your couch, don't you?
On your couch? What's the matter?
You're not still living in Chicago?
No. I moved back after my
Jerk boyfriend dumped me.
Come on.
Who would dump you?
- Lots of guys.
- Really?
No. She's serious. Lots of guys...
lots.
Now, how'd the job search go today?
Well, I got one offer, but I don't want
to dress up like a cell phone
and hand out coupons at the racetrack.
Hey, hey, I might have a job for you.
Allison is looking for someone to
help out around the house
- part-time and with the kids.
- Really? That would be great.
How are Louise and Tom?
Fantastic and easily distracted,
in that order.
Allison, it's Gary,
the answer to all your problems,
except for you stretch marks
and your screechy voice.
We must've gotten
disconnected or something.
Here. You talk to her, OK?
Allison, hi. It's Anna Lopez.
I hear you're looking for somebody.
- What's wrong, Dennis?
- What's wrong?
Anna iback in town. You see,
I'm the oldest brother, and it's
my responsibility to look after her.
My dad said he'll murder me if
anything ever happens to her.
Your dad is not gonna murder you.
Latinos are very protective and literal.
I wasn't always
the oldest brother, Gary.
I'm starting later this afternoon.
Can you believe it?
- Hey, that's great.
- Thank you, Gary.
That's great. Save some
of that hug for Allison, OK?
Well, bye, Gary. See you, stupid.
Sorry to bother you, Gary. Louise
wanted me to come by and feed her fish.
She said you would forget.
Louise has fish?
- Come on in.
- Where's her room?
Right down the hall on the right.
It's the girly one.
How's it going over there?
Fantastic. Thank you so much
for getting me the job.
Of course. Come on. You're Dennis'
sister. I got to look out for you right?
Remember when you and
Dennis drove me to college
and you took me to the wrong Carolina?
Yeah. I still think you would've
done great at Clemson, though.
Yeah, but I didn't apply there,
and I didn't have anyplace to live,
so it would've made for
a rough freshman year.
But the job is great.
Allison is awesome,
and I guess I'll be over here a lot,
assuming the goldfish stay alive.
I don't know. We're having a bad
run in the fish world.
My toilet is known as
death's water slide.
So, this is your new house?
Yeah. It's kind of like my old house
took a dump and this one came out,
but it looks a little better with
a buzz. Can I get you a beer?
Well, I'm off the clock, and in a way,
you're my boss, so I guess I have to.
Well, congratulations.
Your first day with Allison.
You know, she's no picnic to work for,
and she's no picnic to be married to,
and she's certainly
not easy to go on a picnic
with when you're married to...
My gosh, am I speaking way too loudly?
I thought you were still the other room.
I thought I was supposed
to follow you in here.
Well, I'm glad you did
because I'm lazy. Here.
- Here's to getting to know each other.
- Here you go.
You know, I had a huge crush
on you when I was younger.
Really? I didn't know that.
I used to kiss my pillow
and pretend it was you.
What a coincidence. I used to kiss
Allison and pretend it was anyone else.
Are you nervous?
- You're trembling.
- I'm standing in the refrigerator.
Let me warm you up.
Wait. Come on, Anna. This is wrong.
You're Dennis' little sister. Come on.
Well, technically,
I'm not his little sister anymore.
I'm a grown woman,
or haven't you noticed?
Yeah. Boy, I noticed, OK?
I noticed. I noticed, I noticed.
Look. If we did go through
with this and this did happen.
Which I'm sure would be
one of the greatest things
to ever happen to me in my life,
and I am including
the time I rode behind Chuck Norris
on an escalator.
What if we broke up? Then Dennis,
his heart would be broken.
He's my best friend. I can't
let that happen to him. I'm sorry.
OK. You're right. You're a good friend.
I just wanted to fulfill an
innocent little fantasy where
I turned Gary Brooks
inside out with wild sex.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Is there any way you can
pretend for one little minute
that you're not my
brother's best friend?
Just one minute,
and I'll never bother you again.
Anna, you have to realize something. OK.
We should probably stop now.
No way. I got 48 seconds left.
I'm counting in my head.
45... 4 Hey!
I don't know how that snake
bit you on your tongue,
but I think I sucked out all the poison.
Whew! I better go find
that little bugger.
Dennis, I can explain.
You don't have to explain. I have eyes.
- Gary and I were just.
- Just
making me the happiest
older brother in the world.
Oh, my god...
I'm not following you. This is great.
Everyone in my family has been praying
that Anna would find a decent guy,
- and she finally did.
- Really? Who?
You, you knucklehead. Come on.
I'm gonna get out of here,
and you guys go back to doing
whatever it is you were doing.
That was weird, and you know what?
Now that the sense of danger
is out of it, it's really not even
that interesting anymore.
Oh, my gosh, Anna, last night
was amazing. I can't even believe it.
Morning, hon. I let you sleep in,
but you better get moving.
I did the laundry. Little thing, honey.
Would you mind emptying your pockets
before you throw stuff in the hamper?
I've been fishing change
- out of the dryer all morning.
- You did the laundry?
And the doctor called confirming
your appointment on friday.
Sweetie, could you let me know
when you make appointments
so I don't schedule stuff for the same
time? We're a team, right?
How long was I asleep?
This parlor room is
currently under renovation,
but this is where Mr. Mckenzie
took his breakfast,
drew up contracts,
and met with local merchants.
Yeah, and Dennis Hopper played
backgammon with frank zappa right there.
Pay him no mind.
That rumor is unsubstantiated.
Now, if everyone could just
head into the kitchen there...
Where.
Where tommy smothers
never made hash browns!
Hash brownies...
And yes, he did.
I think she's starting to dig me.
What's wrong?
Dad, it's Dennis' sister.
She's kind of making me a little crazy.
We hooked up like, 3 days ago, and she's
acting like we're a married couple.
That's the second
weddingi missed of yours.
No. We're not married, dad.
And that's the second divorce I missed.
Excuse me.
Hey, Gary, look who I found.
Sweetie, you forgot your lunch.
You'd forget your head
if it wasn't screwed on.
You know what? Thank you, but I'm gonna
go out to eat with the guys today, OK?
Restaurant food is full of salt,
and I like my Gary not puffy.
And I bought you some new underwear.
I thought you might like to try
a pair where the elastic band
is attached to the fabric.
How adorable are you guys?
I just want to eat you up.
I talked to mom and dad. They want all
to get together at grandma's for easter.
I can't wait for you to
meet our grandma, man. Me?
She's just gonna eat you with a spoon.
All right. What's with you people? Can't
you like somebody without eating them?
Stop it. I'll see you at dinner, OK,
and don't be late.
I'm making something special.
Bye, honey.
See you, stupid.
I've never seen Anna this happy before.
It's so great that she's with somebody
that's gonna treat her right,
- not like all the other guys.
- Yeah. You know what? To be fair,
we never heard all those
other guys' stories.
What are you doing here?
You don't have the kids today.
What, I have to have the
kids to walk into your house?
According to the court, yeah.
Look. I know you're working super
hard with school and everything, and
I really forced Dennis' sister down your
throat, so if it's a big inconvenience
it's not working for you,
i'm really sorry about that.
No. Anna is amazing.
I couldn't get along without her.
So, if she was to get angry and suddenly
leave town, that wouldn't be cool?
No. That wouldn't be cool. I mean,
I love her, and the kids love her.
The only thing that isn't cool is,
she started dating some crepy older guy.
You might know him. He's you!
Are you insane?
I finally find a perfect nanny.
Mary poppins comes floating down from
the sky. You're looking up her skirt.
She's smothering me, Allison.
She leaves "i love you, Gary"
post-its all over the house, right?
She draws hearts
on my mirrors with lipstick,
and she runs baths for me.
She rubs my feet.
What a bitch.
Look, Gary.
You cannot break up with her, OK?
If you dump her, she will dump me, and I
need her whole lot more than I need you.
- Well, find someone else.
- You are stuck, Gary, OK?
The only thing you could hope for is for
Anna to break up with you. That way,
Dennis won't be pissed at you,
and she won't leave me.
She's not gonna break up with me.
Who would leave this?
Me and any other woman with legs.
Why did you leave me?
Why did we get a divorce?
OK. There are boxes of transcripts,
Gary. You can read them?
Look.
If you want her to break up with you,
just stop being
first-date Gary, you know?
Be 10-years-Down-the-road Gary
with the open boxers at breakfast
and the peeing in the shower...
I get it.
And the gassy, scratchy, burpy, slurpy,
cutting-your-toenails-on-the-sofa Gary.
I get it! I'm a disgusting man!
How you doing?
Hey, sweetie, where you been?
At a bar. I know you probably
made dinner and everything,
but I already filled up on wings and
beer, and if you're mad, I don't care.
I'm not mad. I'll just put it in
the fridge, and you can have it later.
Don't feed it to me as left over
because I don't eat leftovers,
all right, and if you're mad about that,
I don't care.
I'm not mad.
You should eat whatever you want.
You know what? Maybe I don't
want to eat whatever I want.
What's with you? It seems like a totally
different guy just walked in the door.
Yeah. He did, OK, baby doll?
The real Gary Brooks just
walked in that door, all right?
Get used to it,
and if you're mad, I don't care.
Are you kidding?
I love it.
This means
that you are comfortable enough
in our relationship to be yourself.
We just took a huge leap forward today.
OK. All right. OK. I give.
- Timeout.
- Great.
I don't want to take a leap forward.
I just got out of a marriage,
and with you, it's like
I got back into another marriage.
It's like you're acting like my wife.
You mean, because I cook your
favorite food and take care
of you and make love to
you whenever you want?
Yeah. You're nothing like my wife.
It's been 3 days. Don't you think
this is a little intense?
Wait, wait. What are you saying?
Are you breaking up with me?
No. I'm not.
I would like you to break up with me.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.
- OK. Then, I'm breaking up with you.
Why?
Don't take this the wrong way.
You're beautiful, and I really like you,
but you're a teeny bit banas.
Here we go.
I'm getting the bana talk again.
Again? You've had the bana talk before?
Lots of times, and the bana talk
is the very first warning sign
there's something wrong.
- Anna, I didn't mean any...
- No. You blew it.
There's no coming back from banas.
- Hey, there he is.
- Talk to your sister?
Guess you didn't hear the big news.
I knew this was gonna happen, but I just
didn't think was gonna happen so soon.
- Dennis, Dennis...
- Wait, wait.
I'm gonna remember this moment forever,
and I want to make it perfect.
Wait.
Say the words I've been dying to hear.
- I dumped your sister.
- Those weren't them. Try again.
It didn't work out. I broke up with her.
That's all there is to it.
It's no big deal?
But you know what? You can't just treat
her like some toy and toss her aside.
You know, a real friend wouldn't
do that. You suck, and I quit.
We go somewhere and talk about this?
Anything you have to say to me
you can say in front of my friends,
- Your real friends?
- my real friends.
We picked 3 of these
guys up this morning.
Well, you know what? I trust them
a lot more than I trust you, Gary.
Dennis, look. It didn't work
out with me and your sister.
I tried to tell her that,
but she wouldn't listen, all right?
So it's her fault. Can you believe this,
guys? He's blaming my sister.
El Gary la hecha la culpa
a Anna porque se dejaron.
I knew that if we broke up,
it would break your heart,
and I don't want to do that to you, OK?
So it's my fault.
Can you believe this guy?
Creen este guey?
Ahora, Gary le hecha la culpa a Dennis.
To be fair,
there's two side to every story,
and I'm not sure my side
is being represented here.
Scusi, amigos.
Hermana de Dennis muy bonita pero
always aqui, aqui, aqui.
"Aqui, aqui, aqui."
I'm out of here.
Dennis, wait a second.
You said your sister was a handful,
- didn't you?
- Know what you're talking about.
You told me she got dumped by
"lots of guys, lots," your words.
We're a passionate culture.
That's all I know.
Didn't a part you want me
and your sister to work
out so you wouldn't have
to worry about her anymore?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
I got carried away. I got excited about
you being a part of our family.
Dennis, you're my best friend.
We already are family, OK?
Can't we just go back
to being you and me?
I don't know. What do you guys think?
4 of us think you should stay together,
3 are against,
and one of us thinks the
whole thing is kind of gay.
What do you think? That's 4 for staying
together 3 against, and one kind of gay.
I still got the laker tickets. We got
purple and gold paint here. We could
paint a big "l" on my chest.
Will you paint a big "a" on your chest?
Now it's unanimous.
We all think it's kind of gay.
- Oh, my gosh, dad!
- Hey, Gary.
You know Miss Peters.
- Yeah. Hi, Miss Peters.
- Mr. Brooks.
Yeah. Is my dad bothering you?
But you are kind of harshing my mellow.
Yeah. I'm gonna take a sick day.

Tout va bien se passer, d'accord ?
Les entreprises ont tout le temps
des contrŰles fiscaux, non ?
Arthur veut que tu te calmes,
que tu arrÍtes de l'observer,
et que tu commandes ŗ manger.
T'es mťdium ?
Tu sais tout Áa juste en le regardant ?
On est cousins germains, mec.
Crois-moi, fiston,
il faut que tu ailles au Mexique
et que tu t'y caches
jusqu'ŗ ce que tout Áa soit terminť.
Tu m'as donnť le mÍme conseil
quand j'ai dŻ redoubler le CE2.
OK. Mais si les choses dťrapent et que
tu as besoin d'une nouvelle identitť,
J'ai un scalpel et une plastiqueuse
dans mon van.
C'est la seule boÓte de reÁus
de Peinture Gary
que j'ai trouvťe.
J'espŤre que Áa aidera.
Non, pas vraiment.
Le contrŰle est de 2002 ŗ 2004.
Ce sont les reÁus de 1995.
Pourquoi tu n'appelles pas Taylor ?
- Non. Je n'appelle pas Taylor.
- Qui est Taylor ?
Mon petit frŤre.
Il a fait les dix derniŤres
dťclarations d'impŰts de Gary.
C'est un gťnie financier.
DiplŰmť d'Harvard,
il ťtait vice-prťsident d'une des plus
riches entreprises du pays ŗ 26 ans.
Il figure aussi dans la Bible.
Il a fait les dťclarations des apŰtres
et il a marchť sur l'eau.
Et il a pris le temps, tous les ans,
de faire ta dťclaration gratuitement.
Apparemment, Allison,
on rťcolte ce qu'on sŤme,
- parce que j'ai un contrŰle fiscal !
- Bon.
Dieu merci, Dennis, ton cousin est lŗ.
Je saurais jamais comment te remercier.
- Quand est votre contrŰle ?
- Lundi.
Lundi ?
Oý va-t-il ?
Tu vas arrÍter d'Ítre si bornť
et appeler mon frŤre ?
Je n'appelle pas ton frŤre...
Donne-moi ce tťlťphone.
Je ne l'appelle pas. Il agit toujours
comme s'il ťtait le meilleur.
- Il l'est.
- Non ! Il me rabaisse tout le temps.
- Il a raison.
- D'accord.
- Il me fait passer pour un ratť.
- Gary...
D'accord ! «a suffit !
Je ne le supporte pas.
Il me donne toujours des surnoms idiots
comme Garsenic ou Garinator.
Gary S. Truman.
Salut, vive Taylor !
Salut, Taylor.
C'est ton ex-beau-frŤre, Gary.
Yo, comment Áa va, G-Force ?
- T-Bone, c'est ta grande súur.
- Comment Áa va, Alley Cat ?
…coute, G-Force ŗ quelques soucis
avec un contrŰle fiscal.
Et il se demandait
si tu pouvais l'aider.
Sans problŤme. Je cherchais un prťtexte
pour venir ŗ Cali, de toute faÁon.
Non. Ne viens pas ŗ Cali.
C'est bon. Je t'enverrai tout.
- Je t'enverrai tous les reÁus.
- Trop tard. Je suis dťjŗ dans l'avion.
T-Bone arrive !
On dirait que T-Bone vient voir
G-Force et Alley Cat.
Gťnial. G-Force va exploser sa Cerv-L.

Je l'ignore, chťrie,
mais il y a trois choses dans ce menu,

Pourquoi on doit retrouver
ton frŤre ici ? C'est dingue.
Car c'est le seul endroit

C'est un New Yorkais maintenant.
Il n'aime pas grand-chose ŗ L.A.
C'est super. Il devrait nous faire

«a sera trŤs amusant de l'entendre

Attendez !
Ce sont ma niŤce et mon neveu !
Je suis avec eux ! Venez lŗ !

Alley Cat, regarde-toi.
Bontť divine !
On dirait que tu as perdu 80 kilos.
- Quoi ?
- Je parle de ce mec !
Le divorce ? Regarde-toi, Taylor.
Tu es superbe.
C'est parce que je suis assis
ŗ cŰtť de Gary.
- Dťsirez-vous boire quelque chose ?
- Salut, ma jolie.
Oui. Je voudrais un macallan 25,
3 glaÁons, et une goutte de club soda,

En fait, j'ai des problŤmes
avec l'IGI pour

oý tu as fait mes dťclarations.
Regarde ce mec.
Il se la joue dťjŗ.
J'adore quand il fait le gros dur
avec moi.
Ne t'inquiŤte pas pour l'IGI.
Je peux m'en occuper les yeux fermťs.
Le truc, c'est qu'il ne faut pas

C'est fantastique.
Merci. C'est Clive Christian nį 1.
Plus de 2 000 $ le flacon. Je l'ai

- ArrÍte.
On pourrait ťviter de comparer

Tu as rencontrť des cťlťbritťs,

Voyons voir.
Est-ce que pour vous...
la superstar de la NFL Eli Manning

- C'est lui !
- Tu connais Eli Manning ?
Je travaille avec lui.
Je travaille aussi avec Harrison Ford,
Shia Labeouf, Áa c'est le gagnant

On finit par se lasser ŗ force, non ?
Alors, Tom...
Quand est-ce que tu viens ŗ New York

- Je peux, papa ?

Il ne faut pas compter sur ton pŤre

Je lui ai dit d'acheter Google en 1998.
Comment Áa marche pour toi, Gary ?
- On aurait pu Ítre riches.
- C'est vrai. Mais pour sa dťfense...
qui a faim ? Commandons !
Taylor, tu as faim ?
Oui. Je suis encore ŗ l'heure
de New York, alors j'ai envie de sushis.
En fait, sushis faÁon Toshimi.
Je fais un rťgime sans glucides.
- Edamame, soupe miso, wasabi.
- Oki Doki !
Je vais me sortir
de ce contrŰle fiscal, ou quoi ?
Tout va bien se passer, mais je peux
te poser une simple question
de philosophie du business ?
Tu dťtestes gagner de l'argent ?
Oui, je dťteste gagner de l'argent.
Alors, tu fais exactement ce qu'il faut.
Pourquoi tu n'utilises aucune
des combines, failles ou opťrations
- que je t'ai crťťes.
- C'est ŗ cause de Áa
que j'ai un contrŰle fiscal.
Je suis peintre en b‚timent.
Tu as basť le siŤge social
de mon entreprise aux őles CaÔmans.
C'est parfaitement lťgal. T'en fais pas
tant qu'on vient pas chez toi.
On vient chez moi !
Ils n'ont rien contre toi.
Tu dois arrÍter de voir petit.
C'est pour Áa que tu en es lŗ.
Je suis oý exactement ?
Dans une petite maison,
une petite entreprise et une petite vie.
Ma vie est peut-Ítre petite,
mais je l'aime.
Je vais te dire ce que je n'aime pas.
Toi. OK ?
Pendant 15 ans, j'ai encaissť tes
humiliations car tu ťtais de la famille.
Mais je n'ai plus ŗ les subir
parce que je suis divorcť.
Tu es un abruti, tu es odieux,
tu es un connard, et ŗ ta place,
je prendrais ma plus chŤre voiture
et je ma jetterais avec
du plus haut pont de Manhattan !
Ce serait la Maserati et le Triborough.
Et j'ai failli faire Áa
sur le chemin de l'aťroport.
Quoi ?
T'as raison sur tout.
Je suis un hypocrite.
Tu es riche.
Normal que tu sois hypocrite.
T'as pas compris.
J'ai perdu mon boulot, mes comptes.
J'ai perdu mes ťconomies,
je vis avec des cartes de crťdit.
Calme-toi, Taylor.
Tu fais de l'hyperventilation.
J'ai ťtť, j'ai ťtť virť.
- Allison n'est pas au courant.
- Quoi ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
Et toutes ces belles voitures ?
En leasing.
Et ton appartement,
le duplex avec l'ascenseur ?
Ex-expulsť.
Et la fille super belle
avec qui tu sortais ?
Trans, trans, trans...
Tu sortais avec un travesti ?
Transfťrťe ŗ Londres !
OK, ťcoute. Fuyons nos responsabilitťs.
On s'en fiche.
Occupons-nous de l'audit, d'accord ?
Et puis on passera au reste.
Il n'y a pas de reste. Je ne veux
plus jamais voir un nombre.
Je suis un ratť !
Mon comptable, Mesdames et messieurs !
Laisse-moi, et ťteins la lumiŤre.
Si ta voix ťtait plus profonde,
on dirait Allison ŗ notre nuit de noces.
J'essayais juste
de dťtendre l'atmosphŤre.
- Avec une blague sexuelle sur ma súur ?
- J'avais tort.
J'ai eu tort. …coute, ce n'est pas toi.
Ce n'est pas toi du tout.
Pas moyen, mec ! Le Taylor
que je connais est un gagnant !
T'es un gagnant !
Allons en bas.
Occupons-nous de ces taxes,
attaquons l'audit, et bottons des culs !
Allez, Taylor. Allons-y !
T'es censť me courir aprŤs.
Je croyais que c'ťtait clair.
Je peux plus le faire Gary.
Comment Áa, tu peux plus le faire ?
Mon audit est lundi. Tu dois le faire.
Je suis un ratť.
Ma vie n'est qu'un mensonge.
Je suis si seul.
Tu n'es pas seul. Tu as...
moi.
- Tu ne m'aimes mÍme pas.
- Allez. Je t'aime bien.
D'accord, mes enfants t'aiment.
Je suis lŗ. Si t'as besoin
de quoi que ce soit, je le ferais.
N'importe quoi dont t'as besoin,
je t'aiderais.
Serre-moi.
Je vais allumer la tťlť.
Te faire de la soupe.
Serre-moi.
Te couler un bain.
Te chercher un magazine.
Je suis un Ítre humain pleurant
de dťsespoir et de besoin.
Viens ici et serre-moi !
D'accord.
Voilŗ, voilŗ.
Tu sais pas ce que c'est
d'Ítre la super star de la famille.
T'as bien fait, Gary.
Tu t'es fixť de petits objectifs.
Personne ne s'attend ŗ ce que tu fasses
de grandes choses, et tu les dťÁois pas.
C'est le toast
que t'as fait ŗ mon mariage.
Allez, Taylor. Et alors ? T'as eu
un problŤme. C'est pas bien grave.
Ce qui compte c'est que tu dois
revenir ici, te remettre en...
c'est ton pantalon et ton caleÁon
sur ma commode ?
Je ne les mťrite pas. Ce sont les
vÍtements du succŤs et je suis un ratť.
Je suis un ratť ŗ poil.
Mets-les.
Remets-les ! Non !
Je ne veux pas voir Áa.
Excusez-moi.
Comment Áa se passe ?
Eh bien, fťlicitations, Gary.
«a ne t'a pris qu'une heure pour changer
un des plus brillants esprits financiers
en un dťsastre peureux qui ne veut pas
mettre de sous-vÍtements.
Dťsolť. J'ai arrÍtť d'ťcouter aprŤs
que tu aies dit, "fťlicitations, Gary."
Alors... merci.
Il va descendre faire mon audit,
ou quoi ?
Qui se soucie de ton stupide audit.
Mon petit frŤre est en haut
en position foetale.
- Tu dois faire quelque chose.
- Pourquoi je devrais ?
Tu l'as cassť, Gary, rťpare-le.
Ce mec s'est cassť tout seul.
C'est ton frŤre, ŗ toi de l'aider.
J'ai essayť de le faire venir chez moi,
il ne veut pas quitter ta chambre,
Je ne sais pas quoi lui dire parce que,
bien sŻr je ne peux pas m'identifier.
…coute, Gary. Je crois que le mieux
pour Taylor est de le garder occupť.
Et c'est pour Áa que je lui ai dit
que tu allais le mettre
- dans une de tes ťquipes de peintres.
- Quoi ?
T'as perdu la tÍte ?
Tu crois que n'importe qui
peut mettre un pinceau dans un pot
et peindre ?
OK, laisse-moi recommencer.
Je le veux pas dans une de mes ťquipes.
Je ne l'aime pas.
- Oý est ta compassion ?
- Tu l'as prise lors du divorce !
Quelque chose est arrivť
ŗ oncle Taylor ?
Chťri, ton oncle Taylor
a perdu son boulot et son argent.
Et sa tÍte.
Eh bien, c'est vrai.
Alors, il fait une dťpression ?
Oui. Mais Áa va quand mÍme.
Tu sais, Áa arrive quand les gens ont
des boulots avec beaucoup de pression
et travaillent avec beaucoup d'argent.
- Alors, Áa pourrait t'arriver ?
- Eh bien... quoi ?
Ton pŤre est en sťcuritť, chťri.
Mais, ne t'inquiŤte pour oncle Taylor,
parce que ton pŤre
va le mettre dans une de ses ťquipes
de peintre pour le remettre sur pieds.
Et quand il sera sur pieds,
on lui achŤtera des chaussures
pour qu'il puisse aller ŗ l'aťroport
et rentrer chez lui.
Mais papa, allez. Il est de la famille.
Tu dois l'aider.
Va-t-il m'aider ?
…coute, sois devant la porte
demain ŗ 6h du matin, OK ?
6h du matin ?
On est des mineurs ou quoi ?
C'est simple. Tu prends le pinceau,
tu le trempes dans la peinture, OK,
puis tu prends la peinture qui est sur
le pinceau pour la mettre sur le mur,
comme Áa, OK ?
Et si je mets de la peinture
sur les habits que tu m'as donnťs ?
On s'en fiche. …coute,
le rouleau c'est pour quand
tu veux peindre une zone plus vite.
Tu le fais rouler
de haut en bas comme Áa.
- Je peux poser une question ?
- Quoi ?
Si je mets de la peinture
sur les chaussures ?
On s'en fiche. On s'en fiche si tu mets
de la peinture. OK ? Regarde ? Super.
Nous sommes des peintres. Regarde.
Mets ta main ici. Je vais t'aider.
Je vais te montrer. Allez.
Voilŗ. Quand tu peins, tu vas
de haut en bas.
Tu peux le faire tout seul.
Je vais l‚cher ŗ trois, OK ?
1, 2... regarde Áa !
T'y arrives tout seul !
Je sais pas, Gary. Je crois pas que ton
ex-beau-frŤre soit fait pour Áa.
Bien sŻr qu'il est pas fait pour Áa.
C'est le but.
Il fait Áa, Áa le rend tarť, et
il me supplie de retourner ŗ mes impŰts
Hť, t'as vraiment pris le coup !
Qu'est-ce qui se passe
quand j'ai fini tout le mur ?
Ne t'inquiŤte pas, on doit encore
faire trois autres piŤces, OK ?
- C'est si rťpťtitif.
- Oui, trŤs,
trŤs rťpťtitif. Chaque minute
est comme celle d'avant chaque jour
est comme celui d'avant.
Tout est pareil, jour aprŤs jour.
Il y a des milliers de murs ŗ peindre,
alors, ťteins ton cerveau et vis ta vie
un mouvement ennuyeux aprŤs l'autre.
Je dťmissionne.
Ce discours ťtait pas pour toi, papa.
Mais pour Taylor.
J'essaie de lui foutre
un peu les boules, tu vois ?
D'accord. Et je suis fier de toi,
parce que tu l'aides, fils.
Merci, papa.
Tu sais que tu as un grand,
trop grand cúur ?
Tu penses que c'est
pour Áa que je l'aide ?
Non. C'est quelque chose que j'oublie
toujours de te dire. C'est hťrťditaire.
Je vais dans le comtť d'Orange.
J'ai du boulot.
Si ce gars commence ŗ faire des calculs,
appelez-moi tout de suite, OK ?
D'acc. Et tu devrais voir
un cardiologue deux fois par an.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ici ?
- On a fini.
Vous avez vraiment fini ? Vous avez
cachť toutes les erreurs de Taylor ?
On en avait pas besoin. J'avais jamais
vu un gars aimer un rouleau comme Áa.
Ouais. Et il a peins deux couches,
et l'a mÍme pas dit, comme
je le fais.
Super boulot sur le plafond
de la chambre.
Jack attaque, j'adore la cuisine.
Vert ťmeraude, c'est parfait.
Excusez-moi ? Vert ťmeraude ?
Non, non. La cuisine est supposťe
Ítre caramel coucher de soleil.
Je la sentais pas. Des fois,
tu dois penser en dehors de la boÓte.
Non, ne fais pas Áa. On est peintres.
On vient, on voit la boÓte, on la peint,
c'est tout. La boÓte.
C'est le meilleur boulot que j'ai eu.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ? Quand
je t'ai laissť, il y a deux heures,
tu tenais le rouleau comme
si c'ťtait un ťchantillon d'urine.
Je sais pas. C'est...
Je suis tombť amoureux de la peinture.
La texture soyeuse, l'odeur,
le challenge d'un mur vide.
Quand j'irai au lit ce soir,
je rÍverai de la peinture.
Mon Dieu, Gary. C'ťtait moi ?
J'ťtais aussi jeune ?
Garinator, tu m'as sauvť la vie.
Je sais pourquoi j'adore ce travail.
C'est si... zen, si simple,
si primitif. C'est comme
si un singe pouvait le faire.
…coute, Taylor, j'ai dit ŗ Allison
et ŗ Tommy que je serais juste
envers toi, et je le suis.
- Super !
- Tu es virť.
- Virť ?
- Tu es virť.
Je croyais que la conversation
prendrait un tout autre sens.
T'as pas ta place ici. T'as un
esprit brillant pour les nombres.
Ce boulot t'ťcraserait comme un insecte.
Allez. C'est si rťpťtitif.
Chaque jour peindre et sabler,
peindre et sabler,
regarder le monde entier dťfiler.
Je dťmissionne.
Et cette fois je le pense vraiment.
D'accord. Allez, Taylor. Tu t'es fait
botter les fesses, mais tu vas
te relever, te dťpoussiťrer et
utiliser ce cerveau pour ce dont
il a ťtť fait : Wall Street.
Je me fous de ce que tu dis.
C'est ma vie, maintenant.
Et si tu me veux pas, je trouverai
une ťquipe de peinture qui me veut.
OK, Taylor, t'as gagnť.
- T'es engagť.
- Ah oui ?
D'accord. Fťlicitations, ouvrier.
Tu vas aller
te laver les mains
avec le savon qui fait mal.
Tu auras un chŤque la semaine prochaine,
mais en attendant... voyons voir.
- Voilŗ ton salaire.
- C'est quoi Áa ?
Une paie journaliŤre.
- Une paie journaliŤre ?
- Ouais. Attends une seconde.
Je t'ai trop donnť. Je t'ai surpayť.
- Surpayer ?
- «a a pas l'air beaucoup,
mais il faut imaginer
que c'est multipliť par 6 autres jours.
Le reste est pour mon 2e pilier ?
Regarde. C'est Shia LaBeouf.
T'es prÍt ŗ te remettre en selle,
homme de Wall Street ?
Shia, attends une seconde.
Je serai prÍt pour ton contrŰle lundi.
Ils vont regretter le jour
oý ils m'ont rencontrť.
Je sais de quoi tu parles.
Shia-nola, comment t'as su
que j'ťtais sur la cŰte gauche ?
Mon comptable, Mesdames et Messieurs !
Hť, Allison. Je viens de dťposer
ton frŤre ŗ l'aťroport.
Il m'a dit de te faire un gros bisou.
On va mentir et dire qu'on l'a fait.
- Et le contrŰle ?
- C'ťtait gťnial.
C'ťtait T-Bone et son plus T-Bonien !
- Attends, il les a eus ?
- S'il les a eus ?
Ils arrÍtaient pas de quitter la piŤce.
Un mec est parti, et je suis
sŻr que c'ťtait pour pleurer.
D'accord ? Je suis allť ŗ ce contrŰle
devant des milliers de dollars,
j'en suis ressorti gr‚ce ŗ ton frŤre
avec un chŤque de 83 balles.
C'est super, parce que j'ai reÁu
une facture pour un des cours de Louise.
D'accord. Prends-le.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Everything's gonna be okay, right?
I mean, buisnesses get audited
all the time, right?
Arthur wants you to relax,
Quit looking over his shoulder,
and go order us some dinner.
What do you have ESP?
You got that all from a look?
We're second cousins, man.
I'm telling you, son,
you gotta go down to Mexico yourself
and hide out until this
whole thing blows over.
You gave me that same advice when they
told me I had to repeat third grade.
OK. But if things don't work out,
and you need a new identity,
I got an x-acto knife
and a laminator in my van.
This is the only box of receipts
for Gary's painting
I could find at my house.
I hope it helps.
No, this doesn't help.
The audit is from'02-'04.
These are just receipts from 1995.
Look, Gary.
Why don't you just call Taylor?
- No. I'm not calling Taylor.
- Who's Taylor?
He's my little brother.
He's been doing Gary's
taxes for the last 10 years.
He's a financial genius.
MBA from harvard,
he was vice President of a fortune
500 company at the age of 26.
You can also read
about him in the Bible.
He did the apostles' taxes,
and he walked on water.
And also took the time year after year
to do your company's taxes for free.
Yeah, apparently, Allison,
you get what you pay for,
- because I'm being audited!
- Well.
Thank god, Dennis, that your cousin's
here. I'll never be able to thank you?
- When is your audit again?
- It's monday.
Monday?
Where is he going?
Gary, are you gonna stop being
so stubborn and just call my brother?
I'm not calling your brother, I'll tell
you why, I'm not. Give me the phone!
I'm not calling your brother. He always
acts like he's better than me, you know?
- Well, he is.
- He's not! He always talks down to me.
- He should.
- All right.
- Always makes me feel like I'm a loser.
- Gary, I mean...
All right! Enough, now.
I can't stand the guy. He's always
got some crazy nickname for me,
like boysen-Gary-pie or the Garinator.
Gary's. Truman.
Hey, go for Taylor!
Hi, Taylor.
It's your ex-brother-in-law Gary.
Yo, what's up, G force?
- Hey, T-Bone, it's your big sister.
- What's up, Alley Cat?
Yeah, look, g force here has
a little bit of a tax audit problem.
And he was wondering if
you could do him a favor.
No worries. Been looking for
a reason to get out to Cali, anyways.
No, don't come to Cali.
That's fine. I'll just mail you.
- I'll mail you all the receipts.
- It's too late. I'm already on a plane.
T-Bone out!
Well, looks like T-Bone is on his
way to see G force and Alley Cat.
That's really great. G force is
gonna go blow out his B-Rains.

Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way. fr]
Mom, they have a hamburger
that costs $23.

Bison, monk fish? Is there anything
on this menu I'm not trying to save?
I don't know, sweetheart, but there's
3 things on the menu right there
that you're not doing
a very good job of saving.
Why do we have to meet
your brother here? This is crazy.
Because this is the only place
he'll go to when he's in town.
He's a New Yorker now, Gary. There's
not a lot of things he likes about LA.
That's great. Maybe he can share
some of his insight with us.
It'd be very refreshing to hear
a New Yorker crap on LA. For a change.
Waitress, will you please
introduce me to those two engaging,
hip, VIP,
trend-setters over there? Wait!
That's my niece and my nephew!
I'm with them! Come here!
Come here, you little one.
You! Alley cat, look at you.
My goodness gracious.
You look like you've lost 190 pounds.
- What?
- I'm talking about this guy right here!
Yeah. The divorce? Look at you, Taylor.
You look like a million bucks.
That is because i'm sitting
next to Gary.
- May I get you something from the bar?
- Hi, brown eyes.
Yeah. I'd like a macallan'25,
3 ice cubes, a drizzle of club soda,
and if your phone number is on
the napkin, just know tomorrow
you get to choose where
we're going for breakfast.
The one year I don't do your taxes,
and you're in trouble with the irs.
Actually, Taylor,
i'm in trouble with the irs from
the years that you did do my taxes.
Look at this guy.
Already with the attitude.
I love it when he plays
so gruff with me.
Don't worry about the irs. I can take
care of that problem in my sleep.
The trick is you don't want
to let 'em smell the fear.
Speaking of smell, what are you wearing?
It's just fantastic.
Thanks. It's Clive Christian no. 1.
Over $2,000 a bottle.
I got it at a boutique in London.
It's amazing. Check this out.
Ivory soap. 49 cents.
- Got it at a big lots in Tarzana.
- Please.
Can we not compare smells for once, OK?
Have you met anybody cool lately,
uncle "T"?
Well, let's see. Do you consider
NFL superstar Eli Manning cool?
- That's him!
- You know Eli Manning?
I work with him.
I also work with Harrison Ford,
Shia Labeouf that is the winner
of the third season of "Survivor."
And... rae dawn chong!
Kind of peters out at the end there,
doesn't it?
So, Tom...
When are you gonna fly out to New York
and hang out with your uncle "T"?
- Can i, dad?
- We'll talk about it.
You can't expect your dad to
make a snap decision like that.
I told him to buy Google in 1998.
How's that going for you there, Gary?
- We could've been rich.
- It's true. But in Gary's defense...
Who's hungry? Let's order.
Hey, Taylor. You hungry?
Yeah. I'm still on New York Time,
so I'm kind of in the mood for sushi.
Actually, let's make it toshimi
I'm on a no-carb thing.
- Edame, miso soup, wasabi.
- Okey-dokey!
Am I gonna be OK with this
audit on monday, or what?
I think we're gonna be all right,
but can I ask you a simple business
philosophy question?
Do you hate making money?
Yes, I hate making money.
Well, then you are
doing everything right.
Why don't you use any of the tricks
or loopholes or mechanisms
- that I've set up for you?
- It's the tricks, loopholes,
and mechanisms that got me audited in
the first place. I'm a house painter.
You have my corporate headquarters
in the cayman islands.
That's completely legal.
You don't have to worry about
it till they come knocking.
They're knocking!
There's nothing here
they can ding you for.
Gary, you have to stop
thinking so small.
That is why you are where you are.
Where exactly am i, Taylor?
In a Tiny house with a Tiny
business and a Tiny life.
My life maybe Tiny,
Taylor, but I like it.
And I'll tell you what I don't like.
You. OK?
For 15 years, I put up with all your
putdowns because you were family,
but I don't have to anymore if I don't
want to, because we got divorced.
I think you're a Jerk, you're obnoxious,
you're a Jackass, and if I was you,
I would take my most expensive car
and I would drive it off
the tallest bridge in Manhattan!
That would be the maserati
and the triborough.
And I almost did that very thing on
the way to the airport.
What?
You're right about everything.
I'm a phony.
You're Rich.
You're supposed to be a phony.
You know, you don't get it.
I lost my job, I lost my accounts,
I lost my savings,
I am living on c credit cards.
Calm down, Taylor.
You're hyperventilating.
I got fi. I got fi. I got fired.
- Allison doesn't know.
- What?
Oh, my gosh.
What about all those cool cars?
Lee-leased.
What about your apartment,
the penthouse with the elevator?
Ee-ee-evicted.
What about that super-gorgeous
girl you were going out with?
Trans, trans, trans...
You were going out with a transvestite?
Transferred to London!
Oh, my gosh. All right, look. Come on.
Let's blow the dust off. Who cares?
Let's get back to the audit, what do
you say? Then we'll take the next step.
There's no next step. I neve
want to see another number again.
I'm a failure!
My accountant, Ladies and Gentlemen!
Leave me alone, and turn the light off.
If your voice was deeper, you'd sound
just like Allison on our wedding night.
Sorry. I was just trying
to lighten the mood.
- With a sex joke about my sister?
- I was wrong.
I was wrong. Look, this isn't you.
This isn't you at all.
No way, pal!
The Taylor I know is a winner!
You're a winner!
Now, let's go back downstairs.
Let's do those taxes,
attack the audit, let's kick some ass!
Come on, Taylor. Let's go! Let's go!
You're Kinda supposed to run after me.
I thought that was clear.
I can't. I can't do it anymore, Gary.
What do you mean you can't do it?
My audit is monday. You have to do it.
I'm a failure. My whole life is a lie.
I am so alone.
You're not alone. You have...
me.
You don't even like me.
Come on. I like you.
All right, my children like you.
All right?
I'm here for you, man.
Whatever you need, i'll do it for you.
Whatever it is that you need,
I'll help you.
Hold me.
I'll put the Tv on.
I'll make you some soup.
Hold me.
Run you a bath.
Get you a magazine.
I am a human being crying
out in desperation and need.
Just come here and hold me!
All right.
There, there.
You don't know what it's like
to be the family superstar.
You did it right, Gary.
You set the bar low for yourself.
Nobody ever expected great things out
of you, and you never disappointed them.
That's the toast you gave at my wedding.
Come on, Taylor. So what? You hit
a rough spot. That's not a big deal.
The important thing is you got to get
back out there, get back on the...
Is that your pants
and underpants on my dresser?
I don't deserve'em. They're the clothes
of success, and I am a failure.
I am a naked failure.
Put these on.
Oh, geez. Put 'em on! Don't!
I don't want to see that.
Excuse me.
How's the audit going?
Well, congratulations, Gary.
It only took you an hour to reduce one
of the most brilliant financial minds
in America to a frightened, insecure
mess, who won't put on his underwear.
I'm sorry. I stopped listening after
you said, "congratulations, Gary."
So... thank you.
Is he coming down to do my audit,
or what?
Who cares about your stupid audit.
My little brother is upstairs
in the fetal position.
- You have to do something.
- Why do I have to do anything?
You broke him, Gary, you fix him.
That guy got broke all by himself.
He's your brother. You help him.
I tried to get him to come home with me,
he doesn't want to leave your bedroom,
I don't know what to tell him because,
of course I can't relate to that at all.
Look, Gary. I think the best thing for
Taylor right now is just to stay busy.
And that is why I told him you
were gonna put him
- to work on one of your paint crews.
- What?
No. Are you out of your mind?
You think anybody
can put a paintbrush
in a paint can and put paint on?
All right, let me start over.
I don't want him on one
of my paint crews. I don't like the guy.
- Where's your compassion?
- You got it in the divorce!
Hey. Did something
happen to uncle Taylor?
Honey, your uncle Taylor
lost his job and his money.
And his mind.
Well, he did.
So he had a breakdown?
Yeah. It's OK, though.
You know, it happens
when people have real high-pressure
jobs and they work with a lot of money.
- So it could happen to you?
- Well... What?
Your dad is safe, honey.
But look, don't worry about uncle
Taylor, OK, because your dad
is gonna put him on one of his paint
crews to help him get back on his feet.
Then when he's on his feet,
we'll buy him a pair of shoes
so he can walk back to the airport
and go home.
But dad, come on. He's family.
You have to help him.
Is he gonna help me?
Look, be out front tomorrow
morning at 6 am, OK?
6 am? What, are we coal miners?
It's pretty simple. You take the brush,
you dip it in the paint, OK,
then you take the paint that's on
the brush and put it on the wall,
just like that, OK?
What happens if I get paint on
the clothes that you gave me?
Nobody cares about that. Listen,
the roller is when you want
to cover more area faster.
You just roll it right up
and down like that.
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?
What happens if I get paint
on the shoes that you gave me?
Nobody cares. Nobody cares if you get
paint look, hey. OK? Look. Great.
We're painters. Now, look.
Put your hand here. I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna walk you through it. Come on.
There you go. Now, when you paint,
you just go up and down.
You can do it all by yourself.
I'm gonna let go on the count of 3, OK?
1, 2... look at that!
You're doing it all by yourself!
I don't know, Gary. I don't think your
ex-brother-in-law's cut out for this.
Of course he's not cut out for this.
That's the point.
He does this, he goes crazy, and then
he begs me to go back to doing my taxes.
Hey, you're really getting
the hang of it now!
What happens when
I finish the entire wall?
Don't worry, there's like 3 other rooms
in this house we have to get to, OK?
- It's so repetive.
- Yes, it's very,
very repetitive. Every minute
is just like the minute before it, every
day is just like he day before that.
It's just all the same,
just day after day.
And there's thousands of walls to paint,
so just turn off your brain and live
your life one boring stroke at a time.
I quit.
That speech wasn't for you, dad.
That speech was for Taylor.
I'm just trying to freak
him out a little you know?
Right. And I'm proud of you
for helping him out, son.
Thanks, dad.
You know, you have a great,
big, oversized heart?
That's why i'm helping him, you think?
No. It's something I keep
forgetting to tell you. It's hereditary.
I'm gonna go to orange county.
I have a job.
If this guy starts crunching numbers,
you call me immediately, OK?
Check. And you should see
a cardiologist twice a year.
- What happened in here?
- We're done.
I mean, you're really done? Like you
covered up all of Taylor's mistakes?
We didn't have to. I've never
seen a guy take to a roller like that.
Yeah. And he actually painted two coats,
you know and didn't just say he did like
I do.
Hey. Beautiful job on
the ceiling in the bedroom.
Jack attack, I love the kitchen. Emerald
green was definitely the way to go.
Excuse me. Emerald green?
No, no. The kitchen's supposed
to be butterscotch sunset.
It just wasn't in my gut. Sometimes
you got to think outside the box, Gary.
No, no, you don't. We're painters.
We show up, we see the box, we paint it,
that's it, we're done. The box.
It's the best job I've ever had.
Look, Taylor. What the heck happened?
When I left here two hours ago,
you were holding the roller
like it was a urine sample.
I don't know. I just...
I fell in love with painting.
The silky texture, the smell,
the challenge of an unpainted wall.
When I go to bed tonight,
I am going to dream of painting.
God, Gary. Was that me?
Was I ever that young?
Garinator, you have saved my life. Now
I know why you love this job so much.
It's so... zen, so simple,
so primitive. It's like
a Monkey could do it.
Look, Taylor, I told Allison
and Tommy that I would
do right by you and I am.
- Great!
- You're fired.
- Fired?
- You're fired.
I thought the conversation was gonna
go a whole different direction.
You don't belong here, man.
You got a brilliant mind for numbers.
This job would squash you like a bug.
Come on. It's so repetive.
Every day painting and sanding,
painting and sanding,
watching the whole
world just pass you by.
I quit.
And this time I really mean it.
All right. Come on, Taylor. You got
knocked on your butt, but you gotta
get up and brush yourself off and
use that mind for what
it was made for wall street.
I don't care what you say.
This is my life now.
And if you don't want me, I will
find a paint crew out there who does.
OK, Taylor, you win.
- You're hired.
- Oh, yeah?
All right. Congratulations,
working man. You get to
wash your hands with soap that hurts.
You'll get a check next week,
but in the meantime, here... let me see.
- There's your money.
- What is this?
That's a day's pay.
- A day's pay?
- Yeah. - Hold on a second. Yeah.
I gave you too much. I overpaid you.
- Overpaid?
- I mean, it doesn't seem like much now,
but you have to imagine
it multiplied by 6 more days.
Did the rest of it go to my 401k?
Look at that.
It's Shia Labeouf.
You ready to get back on the horse,
wall street man?
Shia, hold on one second.
I will be ready
for your audit on monday.
They are gonna regret
the day they ever met me.
I know the feeling.
Shia-nola,
how'd you know I was on the left coast?
My accountant, Ladies and Gentlemen!
Hey, Allison, I just dropped
your brother off at the airport.
He told me to give you a big kiss. We'll
just lie and we'll say we did that.
- How'd the audit go?
- It was amazing.
It was T-Bone at his T-Boniest!
- Wait, did he beat them up?
- Did he beat'em up?
They kept leaving the room.
Two guys left,
one guy left
I'm pretty sure just to cry.
All right? I went into that audit
owing thousands of dollars,
I came out of the audit because
of your brother
with a check for 83 bucks.
That's great, 'cause I just got
a bill for one of Louise's classes.
All right. Just take it.

- C'est une idťe gťniale.
- Je dois faire Áa, pas vrai ?
Doux Jťsus !
Quel est ce bruit insupportable ?
C'est encore un dťgťnťrť ŗ moto.
C'est de plus en plus fort, non ?
- C'ťtait Gary ?
- Il est dans le garage.
Gary ! Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
J'ai achetť une moto-cross ŗ Tom.
Attends une minute. Tu as achetť
une moto ŗ notre fils ?
Tu as dit de lui trouver un centre
d'intťrÍt. «a va l'intťresser.
Tu es complŤtement idiot ?
Les motos sont dangereuses.
C'est la dťcision parentale la plus
irresponsable que j'ai jamais vue.
Bon sang, si je pouvais,
je mettrais mon droit de veto.
Ne dis pas Áa. S'il te plaÓt.
Reste en dehors de Áa.
C'est pour que mon fils devienne
un homme.
- Non. Papa a raison.
- Allison, je t'en prie,
- ne mets pas ton veto sur la moto.
- Dťsolťe. Mais je le dois.
- Attends, chťrie.
- Quoi ?
Je ne sais pas quoi
mais il y a un truc pas net.
Et Charlie fait
son mauvais cinťma
ŗ chaque fois qu'il veut
se sortir du pťtrin.
Insinues-tu que ma prťoccupation
pour le bien-Ítre
de mon petit-fils, est feinte ?
Comment oses-tu ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
Pourquoi tu tiens tant
ŗ ce que je mette mon veto ?
Quoi ? Je ne veux pas
que tu mettes ton veto sur la moto.
D'accord. TrŤs bien.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Quoi ?
Tu penses que Tommy devrait faire de
la moto alors c'est ce qu'il va faire.
Bien. Appelle-le.
Fais-le descendre.
- Qu'est ce qu'il y a ?
- Regarde ce que t'a achetť ton pŤre.
- Tu m'as achetť une moto-cross ?
- Un peu.
- Maman, tu es d'accord ?
- Oui.
Si ton pŤre pense que c'est
une bonne idťe, Áa doit l'Ítre.
- «a l'est, papa ?
- C'est une excellente idťe.
- Maman ?
- Allez, Tommy.
Monte. Qu'est-ce qui peut bien
arriver de grave ?
Devoir apprendre
ŗ ťcrire avec le nez ?
- Allez, grimpe.
- Oui, monte sur la moto.
TrŤs bien. Regarde-toi !
Regarde comme il est beau
lŗ-dessus, Gary. Pas vrai ?
- Si tu la dťmarrais, mon cúur ?
- Oui, essaye ta nouvelle moto.
Sois un homme.
- …teins-la ! Coupe le moteur !
- Quoi ? Quoi ?
Quoi ? Allez.
N'aie pas peur. Remonte.
J'ai entendu un truc bizarre
avec le connecteur d'essieu.
Tu ne peux pas la conduire
avant que je ne jette un úil.
Merci mon Dieu.
Je sais pas ce qu'il se passe,
mais Áa ne me plaÓt pas.
Il ne se passe absolument rien.
D'accord ?
Le seul problŤme, c'est que
cette moto est pas assez grosse.
Je dois lui acheter
une plus grosse moto et un couteau.
Suis-je le dernier
ŗ Ítre sain d'esprit par ici ?
En avant !
Joli.
- Louise, joli coup.
- Merci, maman.
- C'est mon troisiŤme ŗ la suite.
- Super, chťrie.
3 ŗ la suite. C'est super.
- Veto !
- Quoi ?
Tu mets ton veto
sur les gobelets en carton ?
Je mets mon veto sur le golf.
Il s'agissait de Áa ?
Tu veux qu'elle joue au golf ?
Je te le dis, ma fille ne jouera pas
ŗ ce jeu horrible.
Tu dois voir comme elle est douťe.
Hallucinante. Ne mets pas ton veto.
Tu sais quoi ? Elle aurait aussi ťtť
trŤs douťe en chinois.
Un milliard de personnes parlent
chinois. On a besoin d'une de plus ?
Veto !
S'il te plaÓt ! C'est enfin une activitť
que je peux faire avec ma fille,
- une qui m'intťresse.
- D'accord,
si Áa a tant d'importance pour toi,
je peux peut-Ítre mettre mon veto !
Pourquoi tu le fais pas pour moi ?
Ne soyons pas idiots.
Je ne rajeunis pas,
et j'adorerais voir
ma petite Louise jouer au golf
avant que ce soit trop tard.
S'il te plaÓt.
Tu mourras
quand j'en aurais fini avec toi.
«a y est, Charlie.
La mort de notre rÍve.
J'ai dťjŗ tout vu.
J'ai vu la petite Louise jouer
au Dinah Shore Classic.
Au 18e trou, elle le rentre
ŗ plus de 100 mŤtres.
La foule est en dťlire,
elle fixe les camťras et dit :
"C'ťtait pour mon papa."
Ensuite
elle me lance les clefs
de la nouvelle voiture qu'elle a gagnťe.
Regarde-moi, Gary.
Qu'est-ce que tu vois ?
Un mec avec une moustache qui...
est surtout des poils de nez.
C'est toi dans 20 ans
si tu ne fais rien pour changer.
FantŰme du Gary futur,
c'est de toi dont j'ai le plus peur.
Allons. Je suis dťsolť
de t'avoir dťÁu, mais y a le veto.
- C'est la chose qu'on doit respecter.
- Allons Betty...
C'est plus grand
qu'un petit arrangement stupide.
On parle du futur de Louise, lŗ.
Je parie que tu connais pas
un seul violoncelliste.
- Yo-Yo Ma.
- Tu vois !
Parce qu'il n'y en a pas.
Mais tu pourrais citer des golfeurs
cťlŤbres pendant toute la journťe.
Et un de ces noms pourrait
peut-Ítre Ítre Lulu Brooks.
- Lulu ?
- Lulu. Tu vois Áa sonne mieux.
- Lulu.
- «a dťpend de toi.
Je te le laisse.
Mais quand t'auras mon ‚ge, voudras-tu
te rappeler des dimanches
passťs dans les vieilles
salles de concert
ou des promenades sur Pebble Beach
ŗ porter son sac ?
- Joli coup, papa.
- Merci, ma chťrie.
«a me fait bizarre
de rater ma leÁon de violoncelle.
On fait tous des choses
qui font bizarre et peut-Ítre mal.
AprŤs un moment,
ce sentiment disparaÓt.
Et si il disparaÓt,
ťtait-ce vraiment si mal ?
Super. Louise,
tu devrais aller t'entraÓner
ŗ faire des "chips" depuis le bunker.
Et souviens-toi.
Je sais. Frappe 5 cm sous la balle
et suis-la.
Ne le dis pas au garÁon,
mais c'est ma prťfťrťe maintenant.
- C'est Connie.
- Ne rťponds pas.
T'inquiŤte pas. C'est prťparť.
Connie m'a fait enregistrer le rťcital
de Louise l'autre jour.
Un truc pour se souvenir.
Hť, mon chou.
J'appelle juste pour savoir comment
se passe la leÁon.
C'est magnifique.
Je suis si fier de notre petit ange.
Tu devrais la voir.
Elle joue comme une pro.
Je suis si contente que t'ai voulu
aller ŗ la leÁon de violoncelle.
«a te ressemble pas.
Eh bien, c'est le nouveau moi, mon chou.
Tu sais, je crois que je vais aller
ŗ beaucoup
de leÁons de Louise
ŗ partir de maintenant.
Remets ton chapeau.
T'es pas censť prendre le soleil.
D'accord. Merci.
On est mort.
Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
Super. Ce sont
les deux cavaliers de l'apocalypse.
C'ťtait l'idťe de Gary.
Il m'a dit que si je le suivais pas,
je perdrais ma sťcuritť sociale.
Comment nous avez-vous trouvťs ?
La prof de violoncelle de Louise
a appelť pour savoir oý elle ťtait.
Violoncelle ? Oh.
Quand t'as dit amŤne lŗ au violoncelle,
j'ai cru que tu disais au golf.
Maman a dit que vous seriez lŗ,
et j'ai dit, "bien sŻr que non
"parce que Gary ne ferait jamais Áa
vu que j'ai mis mon veto sur le golf,"
et le veto est la chose qu'on respecte
tous les deux.
Comment je pourrais
te faire confiance ŗ nouveau ?
Quoi ? Je comprends pas
ce que vous dites. Dťsolť.
Il croit que tu joues avec sa balle.
Je joue pas sa balle.
Je joue ma balle. Regarde. C'est ma...
Je te pardonne.
Allons, chťrie, allons-y.
Temps mort.
Je suis curieux
que ma fille parle si bien
une langue pour laquelle
j'avais mis mon veto.
Je sais pas. Les gamins.
Quoi, tu l'as apprise dans la rue ?
- Ce sont des petites ťponges.
- Temps mort.
Recule. Qu'est-ce qui est arrivť
au "Gary, le veto
est la seule chose
qu'on doit respecter" ?
OK. J'ai ignorť ton veto,
mais t'as ignorť le mien.
Mais t'as ignorť mon veto en premier.
Mon veto ťtait finito.
- Tu le savais pas, techniquement.
- «a suffit !
Qui se soucie
de qui a fait quoi en premier ?
Le fait est que vous devriez fÍter
le fait d'avoir contribuť
ŗ crťer cette enfant incroyablement
talentueuse.
T'as raison, Connie.
Merci, maman.
C'est gentil.
J'aurais tuť pour avoir un enfant
avec une fraction de ce talent.
- Prends les clubs.
- Oui, chťrie.
J'emmŤne Louise au violoncelle.
Tu peux aller la chercher ŗ 1 h 30
pour l'emmener au volley.
Et demain elle a un dťbat avant l'ťcole,
alors faudra l'emmener tŰt.
Et samedi, je l'emmŤne au golf
de 7 h 00 ŗ midi.
Mets une cassette de chinois,
en chemin,
qu'elle soit prÍte pour
sa leÁon de mercredi soir.
Trop tard pour mettre mon veto
sur avoir un 2e enfant ?
Je plaisante. Elle a enrichi
nos vies de faÁon magnifique.
Allez, maman.
Mamie est dans la voiture.
Elle dit que si on se dťpÍche pas,
elle va se mettre ŗ fumer.
J'arrive.
On dirait que tu vas te promener
sur Pebble Beach, aprŤs tout.
Merci.
Merci de m'avoir donnť le courage
de casser cette histoire de vťto.
Si seulement on pouvait trouver un truc
pour lequel Tom est bon.
- Salut les mecs.
- Salut fiston.
Il doit bien y avoir une chose
pour laquelle il est bon.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Don't go in the cellar!
Don't go in the cellar! No!
The name in the movies:
"Don't go in the cellar"
And there goes your head.
Stupid teenagers.
He's inside my house?
Oh, my gosh.
Louise, why are you practicing so late?
I'm sorry, dad.
I forgot this was your Tv time.
All right. Look, you know,
I got the premium package, I told you.
If I don't watch 5 hours of tv a day,
i'm throwing money out the window.
I have to practice. Grandma and grandpa
are coming for my recital tomorrow.
- You remember my recital, right?
- Remember?
Are you kidding me?
I'm your Roadie, man.
Sound check is at 11:00 sharp.
And sober, all right?
How come you didn't practice
this earlier, you know?
Well, I had choir practice after school,
then volleyball.
Then I had to study for my geography
test, and then I had my math tutor.
That's too much stuff, Louise. When
are you gonna take time to be a kid?
In my late 30s, like you.
I'd ground you for that, but then
I wouldn't have anybody to play with.
I'm gonna go watch baseball.
Play me out.
Charge!

" Gary Uses His Veto "
Sub VO :   ¤Aka¤
Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way.fr]
- I can't take this.
- Look, it's almost over.
Louise is gonna be playing.
Dear god. She's freaking last!
- I'm making a break for it.
- What?
Act natural. Be cool. Be cool.
Take a break.
Take a break.
Go back. Go back.
This concludes our concert.
I think all of your children were
simply marvelous, and I look forward
to seeing all of you at the next recital
at the mcmartins'house next week.
What?!
Should I bring? Ham?
Jello salad?
I'll start working on both.
Oh, my gosh. I don't mind listening
to my own daughter, but
3 hours of listening to other kids?
I was willing my appendix to burst.
I'll tell you one good thing
that came out of that recital.
I don't fear death anymore.
You've got a real prodigy
on your hands, Allison.
Please don't squander her
talents the way you did yours.
OK, look, mom, I was never going
to become an Olympic gymnast.
I have bad depth perception.
Fine. So gymnastics wasn't your thing.
But you were an excellent swimmer.
I was.
With your tiny breasts
and your huge feet,
you could glide through
that water like a little seal.
OK, look, mom, no one is
squandering Louise's talents, OK?
We both encourage her to
explore all of her interests.
Did I tell you she's starting
Mandarin lessons tomorrow?
What? You didn't tell me.
My granddaughter,
the concert cellist who speaks Chinese.
I can't wait to whip that one
out when my neighbor brags
about her blind daughter
who climbed everest.
Time out. Wait a second here.
Why does Louise have to take Chinese?
When the Chinese take over the world,
they're gonna teach it to us
all for free in the reeducation camps.
Louise is an exceptional child.
She needs to stay stimulated.
Yeah, but she's too stimulated.
You know, she's got volleyball
and cello and now Chinese?
I mean, she's pretty.
She doesn't have to be smart.
She's taking Mandarin.
- Maybe she's not.
- Maybe she is.
Maybe I'll pull out
the big gun on this one.
Please. What,
you're gonna pull out your veto here?
- Try me.
- What are you two talking about?
When we were in marriage counseling,
they gave us a tool to get
through deadlocks the veto.
You get one a year, it's ironclad,
and the other one has to honor it.
Hey, maybe we should.
Gary, think about this.
I mean, all the career opportunities
this could open up for Louise.
- A translator.
- Veto.
- Ambassador.
- Veto.
- International trade lawyer?
- Wait a second. What was that last one?
- International.
- Veto.
- The veto is finito.
- All right, fine,
- but that is your veto for the year.
- Great. Fine with me.
I would do it again if I had to.
Sayonara, Chinese.
- That's Japanese.
- I guess we'll never know, will we?
Hey, mom,
when is the recital gonna start?
It's over, Tommy.
You slept through the whole thing.
But I was here, so it counts, right?
Yes, you were here. You were here
and accounted for. That counts.
All right. I'm gonna go tell Louise
she was great. She was, wasn't she?
You know,
rather than focusing on Louise,
you might want to
spend some time on Tom.
Now, that's a boy that needs
to be interested in something.
Tommy's good at a lot of things.
He's got hobbies, you know?
He, he can fall asleep anywhere.
You know?
Hey, what about golf?
I was gonna play 18 holes
at rancho tomorrow, and I was
may I please play
18 holes at rancho tomorrow?
Hey, you know,
that's a great idea, Charlie.
Let's get Tommy interested in golf.
Can we play?
All right.
But no beer, no cigars,
and it wouldn't kill you
to walk the course.
If it would, i'd walk it.
Well, Tom, welcome to heaven on earth.
What makes you think
I'm gonna like golf so much?
Because every guy loves golf.
Hey, you're walking around
in the great outdoors.
- You're drinking beer. You're cussing.
- Yeah. I like the hell out of that.
- How about no cussing today?
- Can I have a beer?
So basically we're just
in the great outdoors?
Yeah. Have fun.
I'm just gonna sit over here
and study for my history test.
OK, Tom. I want you to bend your knees.
Keep your head down.
All right, eyes on the ball
and make sure you follow through.
Are you OK, dad?
No, I'm not OK!
The ball hit me on my neck!
Tom, you can't learn golf that quickly.
You got to keep trying.
Here we go. Try it again.
Here we go.
Sorry.
In 35 years of golf,
I have never seen anyone lose a shoe.
I guess I'm trying too hard?
Yeah, well,
that's the spin we'll put on it.
Now, from now on, what I want
you to do is to really concentrate
on keeping your feet planted.
Yes! I hit it further than Tom.
Nice shot, Louise.
I'd like to see you ricochet one off
the wall and then hit dad in the neck.
So, Louise,
why don't you try hitting another one?
- I lost it.
- It's not coming down.
I hit that sign. Sorry.
That's OK. That's just
put out there so people know
how far away 200 yards is.
So how long has
your daughter been playing?
Including today? One minute.
Don't beat yourself up over it, Tom, OK?
I know, but that guy seemed
really mad about his windshield.
Right. Look,
forget about it. He'll get over it.
Bentley, very common car.
Nobody learns golf and is good
at it on the first try. Nobody...
- Hey, look, Tom. Check it out.
- Stop showing off, Louise.
I'm still gonna get
my license before you.
You realize you have to
take a test for that, right?
A test?
I did it, Charlie.
I'm a golf dad.
You know, Tiger Woods bought his
paren a mansion and cars and trips.
I know I'm just the grandfather,
but, Louise knows I love her, right?
Listen, I've got to run this by Allison.
We got to get her into lessons.
Yeah, right. Allison. You know,
I don't think she's gonna
be quite as thrilled as we are.
Wait. Why not?
When Allie was younger, I tried to
get her interested in golf
by sort of, shoving it down her throat.
- She never told me that.
- Yeah, it ended kind of ugly.
I think it really peaked when she ran
away from golf camp down in Florida.
She was never the same
sweet little 9-year-old
after they pulled her out
of the everglades.
- No wonder she hates golf.
- And leeches.
God. She's got to go along
with this golf thing. I just...
I wish I didn't veto
chinese the way that I did.
Yeah, well,
you did lay it on pretty thick.
I love to torture Allison.
If only there was a way I could get
her to use her veto on something else.
- Wait a minute. What did you just say?
- I love to torture Allison.
No, after that.
I should get her to use
her veto on something else.
- That is a great idea.
- That's what I should do, right?
Good grief. What is that horrible noise?
Sounds like some nut on a motorcycle.
And it seems to be getting louder,
doesn't it?
- Was that Gary?
- Come on. He's in the garage.
Gary! What the hell are you doing?
I bought Tom a dirt bike.
OK, wait a minute.
So you bought our son a motorcycle.
You said get him interested in
something. He'll be interested in this.
Are you a complete idiot?
Dirt bikes are dangerous.
This is the single most irresponsible
act of parenting I have ever seen.
Boy, if I could,
I would veto the hell out of this.
Don't say that. Don't say that, Charlie.
Come on. Stay out of it.
This is about my son becoming a man, OK?
- No. Dad's right.
- Allison, please,
- don't use your veto on the motorcycle.
- Sorry. You know what? I have to.
- Hold on, dear.
- What?
Now, I can't put my finger on it, but
there's something weird going on here,
Gary and Charlie is doing
that bad acting thing
he does every time he wants
to get away with something.
What? Are you saying my concern
the well-being
of my grandson is just an act?
Well, how dare you!
All right, what's going on?
Why are you trying so hard
to get me to use my veto?
What? No, I don't want you to
use your veto on a dirt bike.
OK. All right. Fine.
- What are you doing?
- What?
You think Tommy should ride
a dirt bike, then that's what he'll do.
Good. Then you call him.
Get him down here.
- What's going on?
- Look what your dad got you.
- You bought me a dirt bike?
- You betcha.
- Mom, you're OK with this?
- Yeah.
If your dad thinks it's a good
idea, then it must be a good idea.
- Is it, dad?
- It's a real good idea, Tommy.
- Mom?
- Come on, Tommy.
Get up there. I mean,
what's the worst that can happen?
Having to learn how to type
with a pencil taped to my nose?
- Come on, Tommy. Jump inside.
- Yeah. Get on the bike, Tom.
All right. Look at you?
Look how great he looks up there, Gary.
Right?
- Why don't you start it up, sweetie?
- Yeah, Tom. Start your new dirt bike.
Be a man.
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- What? What? What?
What? Come on. Come on.
Don't be afraid. Get back up there.
You know, I heard something weird
with the axle rows connector.
You can't ride this
until I get it checked out, Tom.
Thank god.
I don't know what's going on here,
but I don't like it.
Nothing, nothing is going on here,
Allison, OK?
The only problem with that motorcycle
it's not big enough.
I've got to buy him a bigger
motorcycle and a knife.
Am I the only one left sane around here?
Fore!
Nice.
- Louise, nice shot.
- Thanks, mom.
- That's my third one in a row.
- That's great, honey.
3 in a row. That is great.
- Veto!
- What?
- Are you vetoing paper cups?
- No. Gary, i'm vetoing golf.
That's what this was all about?
You want Louise to play golf?
I'm telling you. My daughter
is not playing that awful sport.
You've got to see how good she is. She's
phenom. She's amazing. Don't veto golf.
You know what? She would have
been really good at Chinese, too.
Come on. A billion people speak Chinese.
Why do you need one more?
Veto!
Please! Finally it's an activity
that I can enjoy with my daughter,
- something I'm interested in.
- All right. So
if it really means
that much to you, maybe I can veto it!
Allie, why don't you do it for me?
Let's not kid each other here.
I'm not getting any younger,
and I would love to see
my little Louise play golf
before the big guy signs my scorecard.
Please.
You'll die when i'm done with you.
That's it, Charlie.
It's the death of a dream.
I saw it all.
I saw little Louise playing
in the dinah shore classic.
On the 18th hole, she sinks a 30-footer.
The place goes crazy, and she looks
right into the camera and goes,
"that was for my dad."
And then
she tosses me the keys
to a brand-new saturn she won.
Look at me, Gary.
What do you see?
A guy with a mustache that's...
mostly nose hair.
Gary, it's you in 20 years
if you don't do something to change it.
Ghost of Gary future,
it's you I fear most of all.
Come on. Charlie, I'm sorry
I disappointed you, but it's the veto.
- It's the one thing we have to respect.
- Knot up, betty.
This is bigger than any
stupid little agreement.
We're talking about Louisa's
future. Look.
I bet you can't name
me one famous cellist.
- Yo-yo ma.
- You see? You see?
You see? Because there aren't any.
But you can rattle on, like,
famous golfers all day long.
And maybe one of those
names could be Lulu Brooks.
- Lulu?
- Lulu. See, it chants a lot better.
- Lulu.
- Hey, it's up to you, Gary.
I leave it up to you.
But when you're my age, do you want
to be looking back at sundays
spent in some stuffy old concert hall
or walking the links
of pebble beach half in the bag?
- Nice shot, dad.
- Thanks, sweetheart.
I still feel weird about
skipping cello practice.
Well, we all do things we feel
weird about that might be wrong.
After a while, that feeling goes away.
And if the feeling goes away,
was it every really wrong?
Great. Louise, why don't you go practice
some chip shots out of the sand trap?
And remember.
I know. Hit two inches behind
the ball and follow through.
Don't tell the boy,
but she's my favorite now.
- It's Connie.
- Don't answer it.
Don't worry. I got it covered.
Connie had me record Louise's
recital the other day.
Something about memories.
Hey, buttercup.
Just calling to see how Louise's
cello practice is going.
It's wonderful.
I'm so proud of our little Angel.
You should see her.
She's playing like a pro.
I am so happy you wanted
to go to Louise's cello practice.
It's not like you.
Well, it's the new me, buttercup.
You know, I think i'm gonna
be going to a lot of
Louise's practices from now on.
Put your hat back on.
You're not supposed to get sun.
All right. Thanks, dear.
We're dead.
What? Why?
Great.
It's the two horsemen of the apocalypse.
It was Gary's idea.
He told me if I didn't play along,
i'd lose my social security.
How did you guys find us?
Louise's cello teacher
called asking where she was.
Cello? Oh cello.
When you said take her to cello,
I thought you said take her to golf.
Mom said you guys would be out here
playing golf, and I said, "of course not
"because Gary would
never do that because I vetoed golf,"
and veto is the one thing
that we both respect, Gary.
How am I supposed to
ever trust you again?
What? I don't know what
you're saying. I'm sorry.
He thinks you're playing his ball.
I'm not playing his ball.
I'm playing my ball. Look. That's my...
I forgive you, Gary.
Come on, honey, let's go.
Time out.
I'm curious as to how my daughter is
fluent in a language that I vetoed.
I don't know. Kids.
What, did you pick it up off the street?
- They're like little sponges, you know.
- Yeah, time out.
Back it up.
Whatever happened to "Gary, the veto
is the only thing we have to respect"?
OK. I ignored your veto, OK?
But you ignored mine.
But you ignored my veto first.
My veto was finito.
- You didn't know that, so technically.
- Enough!
Who cares who did what first?
The point is, you should be celebrating
the fact that you both had a hand
in creating this incredibly
wonderfully talented child.
Well, you're right, Connie.
Thanks, mom.
That's a sweet thing to say.
I would have killed to have had
a child with a fraction of this talent.
- Get the clubs.
- Yes, dear.
Gary, I'm taking Louise to cello now.
You can pick her up at 1:30,
take her to volleyball practice.
And tomorrow she has debate before
school, so you have to take her early.
And then saturday i'm taking her to
golf from 7:00 in the morning to noon.
But be sure to pop in a Chinese
tape on the way to the course
so she'll be ready for her
wednesday night lesson.
Is it too late to veto
having a second child?
I'm kidding. What? She's enriched
our lives in so many wonderful ways.
Come on, mommy. Grandma's in the car.
She says if we don't hurry up,
she's gonna go ahead and smoke.
Coming.
Well, Gary, it looks like
you may get to walk the links
of pebble beach after all,
there, golf dad.
Thank you. You know what?
Thanks for giving me the courage
to break that veto agreement, you know?
If only there was something we could
find for Tommy that he's good at.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, son.
There's got to be
something he's good at.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Votre père les accrochera
ce soir dans vos chambres.
Je veux plus en entendre parler.
Gary, tu peux leur dire d'utiliser les
panneaux d'activités que j'ai achetés ?
Utilisez les panneaux d'activités
qu'elle a achetés.
Papa, dis-lui
que je suis trop vieux pour ça.
Tom est trop vieux pour ça.
Éteins la télé et montre de l'intérêt
pour la vie de tes enfants.
Dites à votre mère que je m'intéresserai
à vos vies à la pub.
Tu regardes une pub.
Quand Billy Mays crie, j'écoute.
Gary, il faut que tu accroches
ces panneaux.
Ils sont très motivants
et aideront les enfants à s'organiser.
Pourquoi ils en ont besoin ici ?
Ils en ont pas chez toi ?
C'est le truc. Ça fait partie
de mon projet de continuité des foyers.
Ça fait partie de ton initiative
"pourrir la vie de Gary" ?
Non, j'ai déjà fini ça.
J'ai fini avant le délai
et en dessous du budget, merci.
Je sais. Non, j'ai lu un bouquin
là-dessus, OK ? La continuité
entre les maisons, rends la transition
moins difficile pour les enfants.
C'est difficile pour vous ?
Y a une autre émotion imaginaire
dont tu veux m'affubler ?
Allez mettre ça dans vos chambres, OK ?
Comment je suis censé vous monter
l'un contre l'autre
si mes deux maisons sont pourries ?
Miss Plummer a dit qu'elle sortait
de nouveau avec toi demain soir.
Miss Plummer a dit ça devant la classe ?
Non, elle me l'a dit en privé.
S'il te plaît, ne bousille pas ça.
Je l'ai encore une année.
Je veux pas avoir de mauvaises notes
parce que j'ai tes yeux.
J'ai besoin d'une clé, parce que
je vais souvent passer.
- Quoi ?
- Depuis que j'ai rompu avec Walter,
j'ai enfin le temps d'arranger
cet endroit pour les enfants.
Non, tu peux pas avoir une clé.
Quand j'ai emménagé,
j'avais l'impression que j'aurais
plus à te voir autant.
C'est comme ça que le juge
m'a vendu le divorce.
J'aurais pas à faire ça si toi
et la maison n'étiez pas un chantier.
C'était quoi le dernier truc que
t'as fait pour arranger cet endroit ?
T'as raison. Mais, tu sais,
je voulais te faire une surprise,
mais comme on en parle,
je vais te montrer. J'ai fait quelque
chose pour arranger ça.
Mais c'est dehors. Je vais te montrer.
Vas au... c'est beaucoup mieux.

Je sais pas. Je dois me lever tôt.
J'ai passé un très bon moment,
Mlle Plummer.
Arrête de m'appeler Mlle Plummer.
- Tu n'es pas un de mes élèves.
- Je peux pas m'empêcher.
Comme l'incomparable David Lee Roth
dit, je suis chaud pour une prof.
- Je reste pour un verre.
- Super.
C'est ça ! Et, tu sais, je sais pas
si tu sais ça ou pas,
mais c'est notre quatrième rendez-vous,
et je crois qu'il y a une sorte de
loi qui dit que quelque chose
doit se passer après le troisième.
Je suis plutôt sûre
que ce n'est pas une loi.
Je suis plutôt sûr que c'est une loi,
et j'ai été jury sept fois.
Je connais bien la loi.
J'ai le sentiment que tu m'aimes bien.
Je serais pas resté à un
"one-woman show" de deux heures
si je t'aimais pas bien.
Allez. Tu dois admettre,
Shirley Maclaine
a eu une vie fascinante.
C'était fascinant. J'aurais
préféré que son "one-woman show"
soit joué par des gars
lançant un ballon de foot.
Tu as été un très bon sport.
Oui, je l'étais.
Hé, Gar. Hé Joan.
- Allison, Je... on...
- Ne t'inquiète pas.
J'ai déjà vu Gary essayer
d'embrasser quelqu'un.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
- Je te l'ai dit.
J'ai une étagère
pour la chambre de Louise
qui est exactement comme chez moi,
et je la monte.
- Va ! Allez ! Sors d'ici !
- Je...
dès que j'ai sorti mes muffins
aux carottes du four.
Et, Gary, les enfants
peuvent en manger autant
qu'ils veulent, car ils sont faits
de farine d'avoine, d'huile de lin
et sont sucrés avec
de la compote de pommes.
C'est pas une mauvaise idée, tu sais ?
Et j'aime ce que tu dis à propos
de l'huile de lin,
ça me parle vraiment.
Je devrais y aller.
Non, je veux pas que toi tu partes,
mais elle.
Elle est tout le temps ici
depuis qu'elle a rompu avec Krandall.
Elle essaie manifestement
de se tenir occupée
à cause de la rupture.
Elle a besoin de ton soutien.
Je la soutiendrai demain.
On a déjà soutenu Shirley Maclaine.
Combien de vieilles chouettes
grognonnes on doit soutenir en un jour ?
En plus, je sais pas si tu le sais,
mais t'étais à 3 minutes de 2 minutes
d'extase.
Des fois l'anticipation de l'événement
est plus excitante
que l'événement lui-même.
Alors ma réputation de bon coup
m'a précédé.
Tu dois goûter ces muffins.
Le reste de vos cafés arrivent.
Merci, Lindsay. Tu te souviens d'elle ?
Elle a gardé Tom et Louise.
Voilà. 8 mokas quadruple-dose. Bonne
chance pour votre folie meurtrière.
C'est pour mon équipe de peinture.
On peint un deuxième étage aujourd'hui.
Après ça,
ils auront pas besoin d'échelles.
On peut pas retourner
à notre café habituel ?
Cet endroit me fout les boules. Regarde.
Ils ont des cruches de crème.
Traite-moi de ringard,
mais la crème doit être en poudre.
Joan m'a amené ici
à un de nos premiers rencards.
Elle dit que le café à meilleur goût
si tu le boit dans un endroit class.
J'ai aussi de la classe.
Excusez-moi.
D'autres personnes attendent.
Ouais, mais ils le gardent pour eux.
Cassé.
Je sais combien vous les peintres
vous trouvez fascinant de mélanger,
mais pourriez-vous finir à votre
travail, s'il vous plaît ?
C'est incroyable, vous avez deviné.
C'était votre rêve d'enfant de devenir
un devineur de boulot dans un café ?
Double casse.
Ce gars me fait manquer Krandall.
Au moins, il éloignait Alison de moi.
Tu devrais trouver un autre mec
pour Allison.
Tu sais avec qui la caser ?
Pas possible. Les gars dignes d'Allison
sont déjà en prison ou en enfer.
Alarme incendie ! Au feu !
Oh mon Dieu ! Tom ! Louise !
Réveillez-vous ! Il y a le feu !
Au feu ! Au feu !
Descends de là, il y a le feu.
C'était moi, je changeais les piles
dans tes alarmes incendie.
- C'est quelle heure ?
- 6 heures 30.
Félicitations, c'est le plus tôt
où tu m'as énervé.
Désolé, mais je vais au spinning à 7h.
C'était mon seul moment de libre.
Comment t'es entrée ? Je dois mettre de
la laine de fer autour des gouttières ?
C'est une bonne idée. J'avais oublié ça.
T'auras fini quand ?
Dès que ta vie sera en ordre,
donc pas de si tôt.
T'es sûr que c'est le meilleur moyen
de trouver un rencard pour Allison ?
J'ai vendu mon lit à eau comme ça.
C'était un peu lesbien.
Vous ne pouvez pas mettre
ça à la fenêtre.
On a une politique très stricte
concernant le trafic humain.
D'accord.
On est tous contre le trafic humain,
mais c'est Allison. Y a sûrement
une zone grise ici, non ?
D'accord.
C'est super.
Je me débarrasserai jamais d'elle.
Pourquoi tu vas pas chez Mlle Plummer ?
- Peux pas, elle a des chats.
- Et ça va pas ?
Je peux pas me déshabiller devant
des chats, ils jouent avec ce qui pend.
On dirait que vous êtes coincés ici
pour toujours, à moins de pousser.
Bien joué.
J'aurais trouvé sans vous.
Désolé de vous avoir empêché.
Je sais à quel point votre genre
aime les petites victoires.
Ce mec est comme Krandall.
- Hé, il est comme Krandall.
- C'est ce que je viens de dire.
Tu pourrais le caser avec Allison.
T'as raison.
Mais je peux pas lui parler.
Il est méchant, il me déteste
et il est sinistre.
Comme Allison.
- Va lui parler.
- T'as raison.
- Vous lisez quoi ?
- "L'Archéologie Aujourd'hui".
C'est assez bizarre. Aujourd'hui,
l'archéologie c'est à propos
de vieux trucs, mais c'est aujourd'hui.
C'est en quelque sorte un oxymore.
Pas besoin de m'insulter.
Je crois qu'on est partis
du mauvais pied et,
j'aimerais recommencer.
Laissez-moi vous poser une question.
Êtes-vous célibataire ?
- On est toujours du mauvais pied.
- Je sais. Non, pas pour moi.
Pour mon ex-femme. Elle est seule
et le courant passerait entre vous.
Vous seriez parfaits ensemble,
sérieusement.
Je suis flatté et
un peu plus qu'effrayé.
Mais je ne vais pas sortir
avec une femme qui...
mon Dieu ! Elle est sensationnelle.
Je pense que le courant
passerait entre vous.
Vous avez tant en commun.
Vous êtes intelligent, elle aussi.
Vous êtes archéologue, elle est osseuse.
- J'adorerais la rencontrer.
- Super, vous serez pas déçu, au début.
Vous êtes sûr que nous avons
assez de choses en commun ?
Voilà votre café. Autre chose ?
Oui, j'aimerais un muffin aux carottes
sont-ils faits avec de la farine
d'avoine et de l'huile de lin ?
J'entends les cloches !
J'avais complètement oublié
qu'on avait rendez-vous, désolé.
On en avait pas.
OK, je le dis tout le temps
pour être sûr. Entre.
Alors, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je viens de voir un ami qui m'a donné
deux billets pour aller voir
- "Don Giovanni."
- Super, il se bat contre qui ?
Non, c'est un opéra, et j'ai des loges.
C'est formidable.
Tu veux qu'on se retrouve après ?
Allez, Gary.
Ce sera amusant.
On peut bien s'habiller et s'arrêter
boire un verre de vin en route,
et puis aller voir un super opéra.
Est-ce l'opéra dont
"kill the wabbit" a été tiré ?
Tu penses à "La Walkyrie."
Je te promets que non.
Alors, vas-tu venir ?
Je pense que oui. En plus,
après on pourrait revenir ici
et cette règle du 3e rendez-vous
qui nous poursuit,
on pourrait sûrement trouver
un moyen d'y répondre.
Parce que je crois pas
qu'Allison sera là.
Pourquoi, parce que tu l'as tuée ?
Non. Non. Je crois avoir trouvé
un mec pour Allison.
Il est super. Il est intelligent.
C'est un intellectuel.
Il a corrigé ma grammaire plusieurs
fois. Tu savais que "Ravel"
et "Unravel" voulait dire
la même chose ?
T'as pas besoin de dire le "un".
J'ai perdu tant de temps.
J'aurais voulu que tu me dises ça
que tu cherchais à caser Allison avec
quelqu'un. Je connais le mec parfait.
Non, non. Assieds-toi.
Voilà le mec parfait.
Je l'ai pris en photo.
C'est lui là.
Il s'appelle Edward.
Pourquoi tu fais, "huh" ?
T'as pas l'air "thousiasmée."
Gary tu peux pas faire ça
avec tous les mots.
Écoute.
Il y a ce père à l'école qui je pense
serait mieux pour Allison.
Tu connais Andy Russell ?
Oui. Le mec qui s'occupe
du carnaval du printemps ?
Si tu veux caser Allison avec quelqu'un
je pense que tu veux Andy.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
Je l'ai trouvé
sur une cabine téléphonique !
Quoi ?
5 numéros manquent.
En fait, ne t'emporte pas trop.
Il en manque que 3.
J'ai du en enlever 2 pour que t'ais pas
l'air trop désespérée.
T'as dit toi-même que t'avais
trop de temps seul
depuis que t'as rompu avec Krandall,
et j'ai remarqué tu le passais sur moi.
Alors t'as décidé de poster
ma photo partout en ville ?
T'es dingue ou quoi ? On m'a déjà appelé
pour un enterrement de vie de garçon !
Si t'as les enfants ce soir-là,
je les prendrais.
D'accord.
Écoute, j'essayais juste d'aider.
En fait, je crois que j'ai trouvé
le mec parfait au café.
Mais s'il ne l'est pas, je connais
quelqu'un qui pourrait l'être.
Écoute, Joan, je suis sûre
que tes intentions sont bonnes, et Gary,
je demanderais ce à quoi tu pensais,
mais ça impliquerait que tu peux.
Allison, c'est juste que je pense
que t'es un peu dans une ornière.
Désolé.
Je suis pas dans une ornière, Gary.
Si je veux rencontrer un mec,
j'ai juste à mettre ma robe rouge,
coiffer me cheveux,
et remuer mes fesses !
Mon Dieu ! Comment oses-tu supposer
que parce que j'ai passé des jours
et des jours ici à poser des étagères
et des meubles à chaussures
et à faire des rangements pour les
enfants dont je ne suis pas satisfaite ?
D'accord. Envoie tes 2 meilleurs choix
au café demain, OK ?
Pas de drogués, pas de gros.
C'est ton téléphone ?
C'est bon. Je suis médecin.
Oui, infirmière.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- C'est Lindsay.
- Lindsay, pourquoi tu m'appelles ?
Je suis vraiment occupé là.
Parce que vous m'avez promis 20$
si je vous appellé
pour vous dire comment se passait
le rendez-vous d'Allison.
- Pourquoi vous chuchotez ?
- Je suis à l'opéra.
Vous le repeignez ?
Non, je ne le repeins pas !
Excuse-moi.
D'accord,
alors qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
Son rencard se passe vraiment bien.
Elle est assise avec ce mec
depuis un bon moment.
Le mec au muffin à la carotte ?
Le mec au muffin
s'est fait renvoyé rapidement.
Elle est avec un mec...
plutôt du genre Donut à la confiture.
Vraiment ?
Ils sont là depuis 2 heures.
Ils parlent. Ils rient.
Merci, Lindsay.
Bonne nouvelle.
Allison a trouvé son homme.
C'est Andy, n'est-ce pas ?
Comment tu savais qu'elle le choisirait ?
Ton mec était trop parfait.
Les femmes ne veulent pas de quelqu'un
tout fini. Elles veulent l'arranger.
C'est ridicule. Qui en voudrait un à
arranger quand on peut avoir un Edward,
- un mec déjà prêt pour tout ?
- Parce que c'est pas amusant.
Elles veulent quelqu'un qu'elles peuvent
arranger comme elles veulent.
Arranger ses cheveux, ses vêtements,
l'initier à de nouveaux trucs.
Des nouveaux trucs comme les cafés,
les spectacles féminins et l'opéra ?
- Quoi ?
- Oh, mon Dieu ? Tu es mon arrangeuse !
Maintenant j'ai des problèmes.
Merci. C'est fini.
C'est juste l'entracte.
Et je veux pas t'arranger.
Bien sûr que si. Ça se voit.
Tu le vois pas ? Pendant 15 ans,
j'ai été avec une femme qui ne voulait
que me changer...
comment je me comportais,
ce que je portais, ce dont j'avais l'air.
Elle était chez moi ce matin,
à arranger la façon dont je vis.
Je peux pas recommencer ça. Désolé.
Je dois être moi.
Oui, mais t'as jamais pensé
que j'essayais juste de te montrer
des choses qui m'intéressent
pour que tu me connaisses un peu mieux ?
Bien sûr, ça commence comme ça,
mais juste après je prends
des cours de ballet,
j'apprends une autre langue,
j'achète du fromage dans un magasin
qui ne vend que du fromage.
Où ça s'arrête ? À l'opéra.
Alors, pourquoi t'as dit
que tu viendrais avec moi ?
Parce que je pensais
que ça amènerait au sexe.
T'es seulement venu à l'opéra
pour avoir du sexe ?
C'est la seule raison pour laquelle
un mec va à l'opéra. Tu crois que
ces mecs veulent être là ?
Non.
Tu crois que ce mec veut être
à l'opéra ? Non.
D'accord, ces deux-là veulent
être à l'opéra.
On devrait y aller.
Je crois pas que tu meurs d'envie
de savoir comment ça finit.
C'est en français.
Je sais même pas comment ça commence.
- C'est de l'italien !
- Parce que je parle italien, hein ?
Alors, ça s'est bien passé.
Donne-moi juste mon sac
que je rentre chez moi.
Pardon.
Pourquoi t'avais laissé
ton sac chez moi ?
Parce que je pensais
que j'allais dormir ici.
Ce soir t'allais passer la nuit ici,
et j'ai tout foiré ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
Tu sais, tu es très jolie ce soir.
- Passe-moi... mon sac !
- Oui. Désolé. Désolé.
Et voilà. Écoute. Soyons honnêtes.
J'ai tenu la moitié de l'opéra.
C'est... je gagne rien ?
Voilà. On est quitte.
Merci.
- Salut, Gar.
- Pourquoi tu ne serais pas là ?
J'ai bu du café pendant 2 heures.
Je suis excitée.
Alors je me suis dit que j'allais venir
ici finir ce que j'avais commencé.
Que s'est-il passé
avec ton rencard, Andy ?
Oui, c'est fini.
Comment ça c'est fini ? Je croyais
que ça marchait bien entre vous.
Oui, c'est vrai.
On parlait. On se connectait.
On faisait des projets pour demain
et j'ai proposé qu'on déjeune ensemble,
qu'on prenne un café, tu vois,
qu'on achète des vêtements, peut-être
une coup de cheveux pour lui...
Je sais pas.
Des lentilles ? Chercher un meilleur
appartement ? Et puis il s'est levé,
Il est allé aux toilettes, et je l'ai
jamais revu. Je comprends pas.
Tu comprends pas ?
Tu comprends pas ? Tu viens de le
rencontrer et tu veux déjà le changer ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il vous arrive ?
C'est comme une addiction.
Écoute, je ne veux pas le changer.
Tu vois, je veux juste qu'il soit...
le meilleur Andy possible.
Pourquoi les femmes veulent toujours
changer les mecs, les arranger
et leur faire aimer de nouvelles
choses ? Tu sais où j'étais hier soir ?
J'étais à l'opéra.
Joan m'emmené à l'opéra !
Tu le repeignais ?
Je le repeignais pas. J'aurais voulu
le repeindre. J'ai dû rester assis.
Et alors, Gary, et si elle essayait
de t'apprendre à grandir ?
Tu veux savoir ce qui va pas ?
C'est agaçant, voilà pourquoi.
Je vais te dire ce qui est agaçant,
c'est quand un mec a le potentiel
mais ne me laisse pas l'exploiter.
OK. Tu sais quoi ?
Je ne veux pas qu'on m'exploite.
Gary, tu ne vivras jamais
une relation durable si t'as peur
- de t'ouvrir à la nouveauté.
- Et toi ?
Tu ne vas jamais retenir un mec
si t'arrêtes pas de lui casser
les pieds pour qu'il change
des choses qu'il ne veut pas changer.
Gary, et si... et si on conitnuait
de repousser les gens ?
Tu sais, à la fin,
il ne resterait plus que nous deux.
On va se remettre ensemble, non ?
Tu sais quoi ?
Ne dis pas ça. C'est terrible.
Oh, mon Dieu.
OK. Tu sais quoi ?
J'ai dû boire trop de café ou cette
pensée vient de me faire une attaque.
Calme-toi.
La prochaine fois que tu sors avec
quelqu'un, essaie pas de le changer OK ?
Oui. OK. Je le ferais pas à moins...
à moins qu'il y ait quelque chose
de flagrant, comme une chaîne en or.
T'as raison. T'as raison ! D'accord...
je les laisserais être qui ils sont.
Et, Gary, tu sais quoi ?
Tu ne peux pas avoir peur de t'ouvrir
à la nouveauté, tu sais ?
T'as raison.
Tu sais quoi. On doit tous les 2 essayer
d'être plus flexible avec les gens.
Ça doit être la chose la plus adulte
que t'es dite.
Merci.
Joan était là, et je suis encore
un peu chaud. Tu veux le faire ?
Non, oublie ça. De toute façon,
j'ai pas 2 minutes. À plus.
Je voulais te parler de l'inachevé
que j'ai eu hier soir.
Les notes sont définitives.
Je sais que j'ai été un abruti,
pompeux et odieux...
Oui, c'est vrai.
- Mais je mérite pas une 2e chance ?
- Non...
Mais si tu me donnes
une deuxième chance...
J'adorerais t'emmener
voir "Don Giovanni."
Je veux savoir si Don Giovanni
est capable d'entraîner Zerlina
loin de son fiancé Masetto.
Oui, je connais Google.
T'as pas peur que j'essaie de t'arranger
comme je le veux ?
Regardons en face. Je suis une épave.
N'importe quelle réparation
que tu veux faire m'ira.
- Es-tu allé au ballet ?
- Allez !
Team Subs-Addicts"
Look, your father is going to hang
those in your room tonight.
I don't want to hear
another word about it.
Gary, would you please tell them they
can use these activity boards I bought?
Use your activity boards
that she bought.
Yes but Dad,
tell her I'm too old for this.
Tom is too old for that.
Can your turn off the Tv, and show a
little interest in your children's life.
Tell your mother I'll show interest
in your life when there's a commercial.
You're watching a commercial.
Hey, when Billy Mays yells, I listen.
Gary? Gary,
I need you to hang these boards.
They're a great motivator
and will help keep the kids organized.
Why do they need these boards here?
Don't they have them at your house?
That's the point. It's all part of
my household continuity project.
Does that fall under the umbrella of
your "ruin Gary's life" initiative?
No, I already finished that.
I came in ahead of schedule
and under budget, thank you.
I know, I know. No, Gary.
I read a book on this, OK? Continuity
between homes makes transitions
Less Jarring for children of divorce.
Do you guys Feel Jarred?
Any other imaginary emotions
you want to pin on me?
Guys, why don't you just go
put those in your rooms, OK?
How am I supposed to play
you two against each other
if both my houses are equally lame?
Dad, Ms. Plummer said that she's going
out with you again tomorrow night.
Ms. Plummer said that
in front the class?
No, she told me in private.
Dad, please don't mess this up.
I have her for one more year.
I don't want to get a bad grade
just because I have your eyes.
Gary, i'm gonna need a key 'cause
I'm gonna be coming and going a lot.
- What?
- What? Since I broke up with Walter,
I finally have the time to make
this place work better for the kids.
No. You cannot have a key.
See, when I moved out of the house,
I kind of under the impression
I wouldnt have to see you as much.
That's how the judge sold
me on the whole divorce thing.
I wouldn't have to do
any of this at all if you
and the house weren't
a constant work in progress. I mean,
seriously when was the last time
you did anything to fix this place up?
You're right, Allison. But, you know,
I was gonna surprise you with this,
but since we're talking about it,
I'll show you. I did something
to spruce the house up.
But it's outside. Let me show you.
Just go to the... That's much better.

" Gary Hooks Up Allison "
Sub VO :   ¤Aka¤
Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way.fr]
I don't know, Gary. I've got to get up
pretty early in the morning.
- I sure had a good time, ms. Plummer.
- Well, Gary,
you've got to stop calling me
Ms. Plummer.
- You're not one of my students.
- I can't help it.
Like the incomparable David Lee roth
says, I guess I'm just hot for teacher.
- I'll stay for one drink.
- Attagirl.
That's the spirit and, you know, and
I don't know if you know this or not,
but this is our fourth date,
and I think there's some kind
of law that something's supposed
to happen after a third date.
I'm pretty sure that's not a law.
I'm pretty sure it is a law, you know,
and I've gotten out of jury duty
7 times. I know a lot about the law.
So I get the feeling you like me.
I wouldn't have sat through a two-hour,
one-woman show if I didn't like you.
Come on. You've got to admit,
Shirley Maclaine
as had a fascinating life.
Yeah, it was fascinating.
I just wish her one-woman show
was performed by a bunch
of guys throwing a football.
Well, you were a very good sport.
I was, wasn't i?
- Hey, Gar.
- Hey, Joan.
- Allison, I... We just were, Hey.
- Don't worry about it.
I've seen Gary attempt to
kiss other people before.
- What are you doing here?!
- I told you about this.
I found bookcases for Louise's room that
are exactly like the ones at my house,
and i'm just putting them together.
- Go! Come on! Get out of here!
- Well, I just...
Soon as I get my carrot
muffins out of the oven.
And, Gary, the kids can have as many
of these as they want because
they're made with oat flour
and flaxseed and they're sweetened
with applesauce.
That's not a bad idea, you know that?
And I like what you're
saying about the flaxseeds,
so you're really speaking
my language on that one.
I think I should probably go.
No, no. Hey, I don't want you to go.
I want her to go.
She's over here all the time ever
since she Broke up with Krandall.
Yeah, but, Gary, she's obviously
trying to keep busy
because of the breakup.
She really needs your support right now.
I'll support her tomorrow.
I mean, we already
supported Shirley Maclaine.
How many crotchety old bags do
we have to prop up in one day?
Besides, I don't know if you know this,
but you were just 3 min away from 2 min
of ecstasy.
Sometimes the anticipation of the event
is more exciting than the event itself.
So my reputation
as a lovemaker precedes me.
Hey, Gary,
you got to taste these muffins.
The rest of your coffees
will be right up, Mr. Brooks.
Thanks, Lindsay. Remember Lindsay?
She baby-sat Tom and Louise?
Here you go. 8 quadruple-shot mochas.
Good luck on your murder spree.
It's for my paint crew.
We're painting a second story today.
After this, they won't need ladders.
Can't we just go back to
our regular coffee place?
This place creeps me out. Look.
They have pitchers of cream.
Call me old-fashioned,
but cream should be powder.
Well, Joan took me to this
place on one of our first dates.
She says that coffee tastes better if
you enjoy it in a place that's classy.
I'm classy, too.
Excuse me.
Other people are waiting here.
Yeah, but they're
keeping it to themselves.
Burn.
Yeah, I know how fascinating
stirring is to you painters,
but, could you finish it
at the job site, please?
That's amazing.
You guessed it. Did you
as a child dream of becoming
a coffee-shop job-guesser?
Double burn.
That guy makes me Ms. Krandall. At least
Krandall kept Allison out of my hair.
Maybe should find Allison another guy.
You know anybody could set her up with?
That's impossible. Any guy worthy of
Allison is already in prison or hell.
Smoke alarm! Fire! Fire!
Oh, my gosh! Tom! Louise!
Wake up! There's a fire!
Fire! Fire!
Allison, get down from there.
There's a fire.
Gary, that was just me. I'm changing
all the batteries in your smoke alarms.
- What time is it?
- It's 6:30.
Congratulations, Allison. This is the
earliest I've ever been pissed at you.
Gary, I'm sorry, but I have a spin class
at 7:00. It was the only time I had.
How do you get in here?! What, do I got
to put steel wool around the drainpipes?
That's a good idea.
I forgot all about that.
When are you gonna be done?
Well, as soon as we get
your life in order, so, no time soon.
Are you absolutely sure this is
the best way to get Allison a date?
Yeah. It's how I sold my waterbed.
That was a really tiny lesbian.
Mr. Brooks,
you can't put this in the window.
We have a pretty strict policy
against human trafficking.
All right.
Look, Lindsay, we're all against
human trafficking, but
that's Allison. There's probably a gray
area here somewhere, right?
All right.
This is great.
I'll never get rid of Allison now.
Why don't you just go to Ms. Plummer's?
- Can't. She has cats.
- What's wrong with cats?
I can't get naked in front of cats.
They bat things that dangle.
Looks like you're stuck in there
forever, unless you want to push.
Well done.
I would have figured it out without you.
I'm sorry I took that away from you.
I know how much you people
enjoy your little victories.
That guy's just like Krandall.
- Hey, he's just like Krandall.
- That's what I just said.
No, you could set him up with Allison.
You're right.
But I can't talk to that guy.
He's mean, he hates me, and he's spooky.
Just like Allison.
- Why don't you go talk to him, man?
- You're right.
- What are you reading?
- "Archaeology today."
Well, that's kind of weird.
Today, archaeology's about old stuff,
but it's today.
Yes, I suppose it is
a bit of an oxymoron.
You don't have to call me names.
Look, I think you and I got
off on the wrong foot and,
I'd like to maybe start over.
Let me ask you a question.
Are you, are you single?
- We're still on the wrong foot. Bye.
- I know. No, not for me.
For my ex-wife. See, she's single and I
think you guys would really hit it off.
You guys would be perfect together,
seriously.
Look, I'm flattered and,
more than a little frightened.
But, I'm not gonna go out
with some woman who...
Good god! She's stunning.
I just think you guys
would really hit it off.
You have so much in common.
You're smart. She's smart.
You're an archaeologist.
She's bony.
- You know what? I'd love to meet her.
- Great. You won't be sorry, initially.
Are you,
you're sure we have enough in common?
Here's your coffee. Anything else?
Yes, I'd like a carrot muffin and,
now, can you tell me, is that made
with oat flour and flaxseed?
I hear wedding bells!
Oh, my gosh. I totally forgot
we had a date. I'm sorry.
We don't.
All right, good. I say that all the time
anyway to be safe. Come on in.
So, what's going on?
Well, I just ran into a friend who gave
me two tickets to see
- "Don Giovanni."
- That's cool. Who's he fighting?
No, it's an opera, and I got box seats.
That's terrific.
You want to meet up afterwards?
Come on, Gary.
It'll be fun.
We can get all dressed up and stop
for a glass of wine on the way,
and then go see a great opera.
Is that the one
"kill the wabbit" is based on?
You're thinking of
"flight of the Valkyries."
I promise you i'm not.
So will you go?
Yeah, I think I'll go. Besides,
you know, afterwards,
we can come back here, and
that third-date rule
that's been dogging us,
we could probably figure
out the answer to that
'cause I don't think
Allison's gonna be here.
Why, because you killed her?
No. No, I think I found
the guy for Allison.
He's great. He's smart.
He's an intellectual.
I mean, he corrected my grammar
several times. Did you know that "Ravel"
means the same as "Unravel"?
You don't have to say the "un" at all.
I've wasted so much time.
I wish you would have told me that
you were looking to set Allison up
with someone. I know the perfect guy.
No, no. Here, sit.
This is the perfect guy.
I took his picture.
That's him right there.
His name is Edward.
What do you mean, "huh"?
You don't seem "thused."
Gary you can't do that with every word.
See, look.
Listen, there's this dad at school who I
think would be much better for Allison.
Do you know Andy Russell?
Yeah. The guy that runs
the spring carnival?
If you really want to set Allison up
with someone, I think you want Andy.
What the hell's this?
- I found it tacked to a telephone pole!
- What?
5 of the tabs are missing.
Actually, don't get ahead of yourself.
Only 3 are missing.
I had to pull 2 to get the ball
rolling so you didn't look desperate.
You said yourself you have
too much time on your hands since
you broke up with Krandall, and I've
noticed. You're taking it all out on me.
So you decided just to post
my picture around the city?
What are you, nuts? I already got
a call about a bachelor party!
If you have the kids that night,
I'll take'em.
All right.
Look, I was just trying to help out.
In fact, I think I found the perfect
guy for you at the coffee shop.
Well, but if he isn't,
I know somebody who might be.
OK, look, Joan, I'm sure
your intentions are good and, Gary,
I would ask what you're thinking,
but that implies that you can, so...
Allison, give me a break. It's just
I think you're kind of in a rut.
I'm sorry.
I am not in a rut, Gary.
If I want to meet a guy,
all I have to do is put on my red dress,
blow out my hair, and shake my cookies!
God, Gary! How dare you assume that just
because I've been spending days
and days here laying shelf
liner and hanging shoe trees
and making cubbies for the kids'
school that somehow I am unfulfilled?
All right. Send your top two picks
to the coffee shop tomorrow, OK?
No druggies, no fatties.
Is that your phone?
It's OK. I'm a doctor.
Yes, nurse. What is it?
- It's Lindsay.
- Lindsay, why are you calling me?
I'm so busy right now.
Because you promised you'd
pay me 20 bucks to call you
and tell you how
Allison's dates are going.
- Why are you whispering?
- I'm at the opera.
Are you painting it?
No, I'm not painting it!
Excuse me.
All right,
so what's going on over there?
Her date's going really well.
She's been sitting with
this guy for a long time.
Is it the carrot muffin guy?
Muffin man was shot down really quickly.
She's with more of a...
Jelly-filled-donut kind of guy.
Really?
They've been sitting here for two hours.
They're talking. They're laughing.
Thanks, Lindsay.
Good news. Allison found her man.
- It's Andy, isn't it?
- Yeah. How did you know she'd pick him?
Well, your guy was too perfect.
Women don't want someone who's
all finished. They want a fixer-upper.
That's ridiculous. Who would want a
fixer-upper when you could have Edward,
- a guy who's in move-in condition?
- Because it's no fun.
They want a guy who they can fix
up exactly the way they want them.
Fix their hair, fix their clothes,
you know, introduce them to new stuff.
New stuff li coffee shops,
one-woman shows, and the opera?
- What?
- Oh, my god, I'm your fixer-upper!
Now I'm in trouble.
Thank you. It's over.
It's just intermission.
And you are not my fixer-upper.
Sure, I am. I can totally see it.
Don't you see? I mean, for 15 years,
I was with a woman that all she wanted
to do was change me...
How I acted, how I behaved,
what I wore, the way I looked.
She was at my house this morning
trying to fix the way I live.
I can't do that again. I'm sorry.
I have to be me.
Yeah, but did it ever occur to you that
I was just trying to show you some of
the things that interested in so that
you could learn a little bit about me?
Sure that's how it starts but next
thing you know, I'm taking, like
ballroom dancing classes,
i'm learning another language,
i'm buying cheese from a store
that only sells cheese.
Where does it end? At the opera.
So, then, why did you even say
that you would come with me?
Because I thought it would led to sex.
You only came to the opera to get sex?
That's the only reason any guy goes to
the opera. What, do you think these guys
running around the theater.
That guy wants to be at the opera? No.
You think that guy wants
to be at the opera? No.
All right, these two guys,
they want to be at the opera.
I think we should just go.
Something's telling me you're not
dying to see how the story ends.
It's in French.
I don't even know how it begins.
- It's Italian!
- 'cause I speak Italian, right?
So, that went well.
Just get my bag so I can go home.
Sorry.
Why'd you leave your bag at my house?
Because I thought I was going
to be spending the night.
Tonight was the night you were gonna
sleep over, and I totally blew it?
Oh, my gosh.
You know, you look very pretty tonight.
- Get... my bag!
- Right. Sorry. Sorry.
Here you go. Look. Let's be honest.
I sat through half of the opera.
That's... I get nothing?
There. We're even.
Thanks.
- Hey, Gar.
- Why wouldn't you be here?
I've been drinking coffee for the past
two hours. I'm completely wired.
So I thought I'd come over
and finish up a couple things I started.
What happened to your date with Andy?
Yeah, that's over.
What do you mean it's over? I thought
you guys were really hitting it off.
We were, we were.
We were talking. We were connecting.
W were making plans for tomorrow
and I suggested maybe we could have
lunch, you know, get some coffee,
get some new clothes,
maybe get a haircut for him, you know.
I don't know.
Contact lenses? Look for a better condo?
And then he gets up,
he goes to the bathroom, and I never
see him again. Just don't get that.
You don't get it?
You don't get it? You just met the guy,
and already you want to change him?
What is it with you people?
It's like an addiction.
Look. I don't want to change him.
I you know, I want him just to be the...
The best damn andy he can be.
Why do women always want
to change guys and fix them up
and make them like new things?
You know where I just was all night?
I was at the opera.
Joan took me to the opera!
Were you painting it?
I wasn't painting it. I wish I was
painting it. I had to sit through it.
So what, Gary so what if she was
trying to help you learn and grow?
Want know what's wrong with that?
It's annoying that's why.
You know, I'll tell you what's annoying,
is when a guy has potential
and he won't let me work with it.
OK. You know what?
I, for one, don't want to be worked on.
Gary, you are never gonna get into
a lasting relationship if you're afraid
- to open yourself up to new things.
- What about you?
You're never gonna hang onto
a guy if you keep nagging him
to change stuff
that he doesn't want to change.
Gary, what if...
What if we both keep chasing people off?
You know, eventually,
we're gonna be the only two left.
We're gonna get back together,
aren't we?
You know what?
Don't say that. That's terrible.
Oh, my god.
OK. You know what? Either
I've had too much coffee the thought
of that just given me a heart attack.
Just calm down.
Allison, next time you go out with
a guy, just don't try to change him, OK?
Yeah. OK, I won't, unless.
Unless, there's something glaring,
like a gold chain or something.
OK! You're right!
You're right! All right. I'll just...
I will let them be who they are. OK.
And, Gary, you know what?
You can't be afraid to open
yourself up to new things, you know?
You're right.
You know what? Both of us have to start
cutting other people a lot more slack.
That might be the most grown-up
thing I think you've ever said.
Thank you.
Joan was here, and I'm still
a little revved up. You want to do it?
Nah, forget it.
I don't have 2 minutes, anyway. See you.
I wanted to talk to you about
the incomplete I got last night.
All grades are final.
I know I was a Jerk
and I was pompous and obnoxious...
Yes, you were.
- But I don't deserve a second chance?
- No, you don't.
But if you do give me a second chance...
I would love to take you
to see "Don Giovanni."
I want to know if Don Giovanni
is able to Lure Zerlina
away from her fiance Masetto.
Yeah, I can Google.
Well, aren't you afraid that I might
try and fix you up the way I want you?
Let's face it. I'm a tear-down.
Any repairs you want to
make is fine with me.
- Have you been to the ballet?
- Come on!
Team Subs-Addicts"
OK. Pas grave.
Juste un petit problème.
Un spare facile, Gary.
Oui mec. Fais-la tomber
et on est en finale.
Depuis quand mon nom
est sur ma chemise ?
Toute l'année, papa. Tout le monde
a son nom. Nous sommes une équipe.
À part qu'il n'y a que sur le tien qu'il
y a ton adresse et des instructions
écrites à l'intérieur
pour les chauffeurs de taxi.
- Le Championnat.
- Continue comme ça, papa.
Merci, fiston.
Tu sais, ça te montre
que tu peux faire ce que tu veux
quand tu t'appliques.
Ça aide que 2 mecs de l'équipe adverse
aient eu une intoxication alimentaire.
Écoute, Louise, ils ont commandé
des sushis dans un bowling.
Ils ont eu ce qu'ils méritaient, OK ?
Papa, pourquoi ces 4 types te fixent ?
Les frères Kim,
des carrelages frères Kim.
Ça fait 4 ans qu'ils gagnent
le championnat.
Tu leur as fait quoi ?
Parce qu'ils te regardent comme Maman.
Ce sont des carreleurs, Tom.
Ils détestent les peintres.
- Les peintres détestent les carreleurs.
- Pourquoi on les déteste ?
Parce qu'ils abiment des plinthes
parfaitement peintes
avec leurs raclettes.
Les peintres ne respectent
pas le carrelage.
Ils laissent des éclaboussures partout.
J'espère qu'on jouera contre eux
en finale.
J'adorerais leur botter le cul.
Nous les jouons en finale.
Eh bien... tu sais.
Il y a pas de honte à être deuxième.
C'est quoi cette attitude, Stuart ?
Allez. On peut battre les Kim.
On gagne ce trophée, et on pourra
leur mettre le nez dedans pendant un an.
C'est quoi la deuxième place,
un diner au Rusty Anchor ?
Rusty Anchor.
Tu sais, on peut sentir ce resto
depuis l'autoroute.
C'est comme ça qu'on sait
que c'est du bon poisson.
On ne joue pas pour ça. On joue
pour le trophée. Je veux le trophée.
Je veux que vous vouliez le trophée,
et c'est là qu'on sera quand
on bottera les fesses des Kim !
Parle autant que tu veux, Brooks.
On vous verra samedi.
Oui, ne t'inquiète pas, Kim.
On sera là.
On cirera le sol pour vous.
On peindra les murs avec vous !
Deux vestes !
Vous savez que vous faites que décrire
vos boulots, les mecs ?
Hé, Fiston. Rends-moi service.
Ramène mes chaussures, OK ?
Miam.
Elles sont encore chaudes et humides.
Tu as fait tomber ton...
livre.
Merci. Je suis Ella.
Je suis Tom.
Qu'est-ce que tu lis ?
Pre-calc.
J'ai lu la suite, "calc."
T'es marrant.
Je dois ramener ces chaussures.
- Alors... au revoir.
- D'accord, au revoir.
Ella, on y va.

Sub VO : ¤Aka¤  &  VeeN
Subs-Addicts" [Sub-way. Fr]
Merci d'être venu au royaume de papa.
De retour chez mamatopia,
là où l'on ne s'amuse jamais.
Est-ce qu'au Royaume de Papa
il y a toujours l'attraction où on reste
6 heures sur le canapé
à regarder sa vie défilée ?
Je vais prendre une douche. Je sens
le popcorn, la bière et les pieds.
Attends. Gary, tu les as encore
emmenés au Bowling ?
C'est un centre d'amusement familial.
Et, oui.
L'équipe de Papa a gagné, Maman.
- Contre qui vous allez jouer ?
- Les frères Kim.
Deuxième place.
On ne va pas être deuxième
cette année, Allison. On va gagner.
Je sais pas si tu as remarqué,
mais mon équipe est invaincue.
Oui, juste parce que
tu as eu 2 forfaits, Gary, OK ?
Et avant de jouer contre les toitures
de Dave, la mère de Dave est morte.
C'était leur meilleure joueuse.
Et ils ont joué de tout leur cœur
en sa mémoire, d'accord ?
Et on les a quand même ridiculisés.
Bonne chance,
pour battre les Kim sans moi.
- J'étais la meilleure de l'équipe.
- C'est vrai, était.
Tu étais la meilleure de l'équipe, OK ?
Mais maintenant je suis le meilleur
de l'équipe, OK ?
Je suis le meilleur joueur de l'équipe
parce que je suis libre.
Enfin, tu n'es plus là à compter
mes bières et jeter mes ailes de poulet,
ou te servir de lingettes
après chaque coup.
Tu sais qu'il y a plus de germes
sur une boule de bowling
que sur le rectum d'un chien.
Tu sais, je crois que tu devrais
te trouver d'autres hobbies, plutôt
que chercher à savoir sur quoi il y a
plus de germes qu'un rectum.
Tu sais, bien que ça me tue de ne pas
devoir passer mes lundis et jeudis
au Bowling, à porter les chaussures
d'autres personnes, qui d'ailleurs,
rectum de chien. Bonne chance
pour le championnat, Gary.
Pourquoi tu l'admets pas ?
Ça te tue de pas être dans l'équipe
quand on est en finale.
Admets-le.
Tu aimerais revenir dans l'équipe.
Admets-le.
- Je déteste ne plus être dans l'équipe.
- Admets-le c'est tout.
Je viens de le faire.
T'as enlevé tout le plaisir.
Écoute, j'aimais être dans l'équipe,
c'est bon ?
Et j'ai été un peu blessé que tu ne me
demandes pas de revenir.
- D'accord, bien.
- Et tu sais quoi ? J'ai hâte
que tu te fasses battre à plate couture
par les frères Kim.
Ça n'arrivera pas, OK ?
Parce qu'avec un peu de coaching,
mes gars vont s'en sortir.
Mais t'es nul comme coach, Gary.
Je veux dire qu'un peu de coaching
va rendre ton équipe un peu plus nulle.
Je suis le meilleur coach du monde.
J'ai une tasse à café qui le dit.
S'il te plaît. Gary,
j'ai été dans ton équipe pendant 7 ans.
Ta seule technique de motivation
utilise des verres d'alcool.
Quand les membres de ton équipe ont des
problèmes de boisson, c'est motivant.
On s'est bien entrainé, les mecs.
Mais...
mais on doit passer au niveau supérieur.
Faut qu'on reste concentré et motivé.
Motivé. Ça veut dire des verres.
Non, non, non. Dennis, pas de verres.
Dennis, allez. Pas d'alcool aujourd'hui.
Mais c'est un entrainement.
On boit toujours des verres.
Tu as créé le monstre, Gary.
Va falloir que tu le nourrisses.
Pas de verres, cette fois.
Je veux vraiment qu'on se concentre
sur cet entrainement.
C'était pas mal, mais on peut
faire mieux. Par exemple, Stuart,
tu te précipites trop.
C'est que si je suis trop long,
Dennis boit ma bière.
- C'est pas vrai.
- Je sais que si, Dennis.
Tu es le seul qui met du gloss.
C'est du baume à lèvre,
et c'est très sec ici.
Allez, les mecs. Pour maintenant,
laissez tomber. Du calme.
Faut qu'on sorte le grand jeu pour
battre les frères Kim. Regardez-les.
Ils sont si précis. Ils quittent jamais
la balle des yeux.
C'est ta chance, Dennis.
Va boire leurs bières.
Je ne fais pas ça.
C'est pas pour te presser.
C'est juste pour garder ma place.
Tu sais quoi ? T'as des bras fins.
Si tu veux vraiment cet éléphant,
tu pourrais juste l'attraper.
Je surveillerai si tu veux.
T'es très gentil, Tom,
mais on ne devrait pas être vu ensemble.
Pourquoi pas ?
Je t'ai fait rire l'autre jour,
tu te souviens, le truc de "calc" ?
Je m'en souviens, c'était drôle.
Drôle à la Adam-Sandler,
mais soyons honnête,
Mon peuple déteste ton peuple.
Tu parles de peintres et des carreleurs,
pas des Coréens et
des quoi que je sois, hein ?
T'es mignon,
mais je ferais mieux d'y aller.
Mon père me tuerait
s'il nous voyait ensemble.
Ne me suis pas.
C'est bien trop dangereux.
Mais il le faut.
Mes nachos sont prêts.
Il y a une chose sur laquelle je veux
vraiment attirer votre attention.
J'ai ce qu'il faut pour ça.
Celui qui conduit
n'a droit qu'à la moitié.
Papa, c'est non, papa ?
Allez. C'est différent.
Le mien implique la visualisation.
Mon truc fait ça aussi.
Papa ?
On peut essayer le mien d'abord ?
Alors, on va visualiser.
Fermez tous vos yeux
C'est la dernière manche du championnat.
On y est, à jouer
pour ce magnifique trophée.
Je suis debout, dernière manche.
Je lance la boule.
- C'est un strike !
- Continue comme ça, Gar.
Excellent.
Quelqu'un d'autre voit l'indien nu ?
Non, papa. Détends-toi, OK ?
Gardez tous vos yeux fermés.
Dennis, tu es debout.
À ton tour, mon ami.
D'accord, c'est mon tour,
j'ai ma boule dans la main
je suis prêt à la lancer.
Et j'entends le nez de Stuart siffler.
- Quoi ?
- Ton nez siffle, mec.
- Mon nez ne siffle pas !
- Il siffle toujours, d'accord ?
Dès que tu renifles, dans toute la ville
les gamins sortent de la piscine.
Oui, et vous savez ce que je visualise ?
Les stupides gants orange de Dennis
C'est mon style, d'accord ?
C'est comme ça qu'on me connait
sur les pistes.
Mec, on te connait pour boire
les bières des autres.
Et porter du rouge à lèvres.
C'est du baume, d'accord ?
Et tu sais ce que je vois ?
Toi devant le séchoir à main
en train de faire sécher ton short.
Personne ne fait attention à ça.
Personne ne remarque
le vieux hippie souriant
à cheval sur le retour des boules.
D'accord, d'accord. Allez.
On peut juste se concentrer ?
J'essaie de nous préparer pour les Kim.
À 3, tout le monde prend une profonde
inspiration et se détend. 1, 2, 3.
T'as entendu ?
- Je l'ai vraiment entendu.
- Je l'ai entendu.
On dirait les sept nains
qui vont au travail.
Ne vous moquez pas de Stuart, parce que
s'il y avait un tremblement de terre
et qu'on était enterré
sous les décombres
ce serait ce sifflement qui guiderait
les chiens des secours vers nous.
Vous saviez que j'avais des problèmes
de sinus quand j'ai rejoint l'équipe !
Ce n'est plus amusant.
Je pars.
Stuart, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
On fait que plaisanter !
Tu peux pas partir ! Il me faut
4 personnes pour faire une équipe.
Désolé, Gary.
Je dépose mes chaussures.
Je peux manger chez Rusty Anchor
quand je veux !
C'est pas pour ça qu'on joue !
- Eh bien, c'est fini.
- Non, non, non. Je veux ce trophée.
Faut juste que je trouve quelqu'un
pour l'équipe
- c'est tout.
- Pourquoi pas Allison ?
Papa, je ne veux entendre cette phrase
que si
on est dans un canot de secours
et que quelqu'un doive partir.
Il nous la faut, ou on sera forfait.
On va trouver
un moyen d'avoir ce trophée.
Brooks,
Je viens d'appeler le Rusty Anchor
pour faire une réservation
pour ton équipe samedi soir.
On ne joue pas pour ça.
T'inquiète pas, OK, Kim ?
Parce qu'on sera là samedi soir,
et on va vous battre.
- Pas avec 3 joueurs, non.
- Ne t'inquiète pas.
J'ai un quatrième joueur,
et tu ferais mieux de te préparer,
parce que je vais relâcher
l'enfer sur toi.
- Comment va Allison ?
- Bien. Je lui dirai que t'as demandé.
Ella ?
J'y crois pas.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je voulais te voir.
Normalment je ne porte pas de pyjamas.
Je suis désolée de m'être
enfui de la salle de jeu,
mais j'ai pas pu m'empêcher
de penser à toi,
et je voulais être sure que tu venais
au bowling samedi.
Oui. J'y serais.
Et ton père ?
Je me fiche de ce qu'il pense.
Je veux juste qu'on soit ensemble.
Tu veux entrer une seconde ?
Je dois rentrer avant qu'il fasse nuit.
Oui, je dois me mettre au pieu
assez tôt aussi.
J'ai rendez avec un recruteur
des marines demain matin.
C'est quoi, ta télé ? Éteins-la ! Ça
fait une heure que tu devrais dormir !
- Bonjour.
- Ça l'était.
Quelqu'un s'est réveillé du mauvais
côté du lit ce matin.
Regarde. Je t'ai amené
le petit déjeuner. C'est pour toi.
- Gary, qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
- Rien. Tu sais, j'ai réfléchi
à ce que tu disais, tu voulais
revenir dans l'équipe de bowling.
J'ai dit que j'étais blessée.
J'ai jamais dit que je voulais revenir.
T'es trop fière pour l'admettre, mais
je vais te faciliter les choses.
J'ai décidé de t'autoriser
à revenir dans l'équipe.
Pourquoi ? Que s'est-il passé ?
Rien ? Je sais juste ce que ça
représente pour toi.
Et maintenant qu'on va jouer
les frères Kim en finale,
on peut gagner ce championnat
et avoir ce gros trophée.
Je vais te laisser en faire partie.
De rien.
Eh bien oublie ça Gary.
C'est trop tard.
Tu voulais pas de moi avant,
pourquoi vouloir de moi maintenant ?
Je vais être brutalement
honnête avec toi.
Mais ça ne quitte pas cette maison, OK ?
L'équipe ne marche plus
aussi bien qu'avant,
et je pense à laisser parti quelqu'un.
Je penche pour Stuart.
Stuart ? Vraiment ? Je pense
que c'est Dennis le maillon faible.
- Non, je crois que ce sera Dennis.
- Pourquoi pas Jack ?
- Ça va être Stuart, OK ?
- Tu sais quoi, Gary ?
Tu disais que ce serait
plus amusant sans moi,
alors je ne veux pas te gâcher ça.
On s'amusait bien quand on était
dans la même équipe. Vraiment.
Gary, tout ce qu'on faisait
était se disputer.
Se disputer ?
C'était que des blagues entre sportifs.
"S'il n'y avait pas les enfants,
je te quitterais"
c'est une blague de sportifs ?
Il est évident que t'es jamais allée
dans des vestiaires, mais...
Écoute, j'ai besoin que tu reviennes.
Reviens juste dans l'équipe.
D'accord.
Je vais le faire...
si tu reconnais
que je joue mieux que toi au bowling.
C'est un sport d'équipe, Allison.
Pas des qualités individuelles.
- Dis-le.
- Je joue mieux au bowling que toi.
Eh bien, amuse-toi bien au Rusty Anchor.
Profite des jambes de poisson-chat.
Tu es une meilleure
joueuse de bowling, OK ?
Merci, merci.
Je serais là samedi soir,
mais je t'en prie, débarrasse-toi
de Dennis ? J'aimerais finir une bière.
Ça va être historique !
Mon Dieu, les Kim viennent de faire
un autre strike. On dirait des machines.
Peut-être que ce sont des machines.
Ça expliquerait beaucoup de choses.
Ah bon, vraiment papa ?
Ta vie entière prendrait un sens
s'ils étaient des machines ?
Tu as déjà désinfecté la boule
quand tu l'as lancée.
C'est que je sais pas ce qui se passe
quand elle disparait derrière.
D'accord. À moi.
Tu vas y aller ? Vas-y !
Gary ! C'est mon procédé.
Je peux pas juste prendre la boule,
tu sais quoi ? C'est pas ma boule.
T'as vu les scores, Brooks ?
Je sais que les peintres
sont nuls en math,
mais notre score
est plus haut que le votre.
Tu vas avoir besoin de bien plus que
le meilleur score pour nous battre, Kim.
Non, ça marche
à peu près comme ça, Dennis.
Je suis en feu.
J'aimerais que tu le sois.
- C'est à quelqu'un ?
- C'est à moi.
- Pourquoi t'as rien dit ?
- Je viens de dire que c'était à moi.
- Tu les jettes à la poubelle !
- Arrête de te plaindre. C'est à toi.
Je me plains ? C'est ma nourriture.
Tu as jeté ma...
Gary, je peux te donner un conseil ?
J'essaie de t'aider.
On peut encore gagner,
mais il te faut une boule plus légère.
- J'ai en ai pas besoin.
- Tu sais quoi ?
Les hommes perdent
de la masse musculaire en vieillissant.
Arrête. J'ai pas besoin
d'une boule plus légère, OK ?
Zut !
Regarde ce que tu m'as fait faire !
Tu contrôlerais mieux
avec une boule plus légère.
Je m'en souviendrais la prochaine fois
que je voudrais te frapper.
Tu sais quoi, Gary ?
Tu devrais me remercier.
Je suis la seule
qui nous maintient en vie là.
Je suis la meilleure joueuse que tu ais.
T'as raison, Allison. Merci.
Merci de me rendre misérable.
Je peux pas jouer si t'es là.
J'ai jamais pu.
C'est comme si t'entrais dans ma tête
et que tu chassais tout mon talent.
Pourquoi t'as voulu que je revienne ?
- C'est Stuart qui est parti !
- Oh, merde.
C'est fini ? Parce qu'on ne devait pas
dire ça avant la fin du match.
T'as fais quoi ?
Tu m'as menti ?
Je voulais tellement ce trophée,
je pensais que pour un soir ça irait.
J'avais tort.
Compter le nombre de bières que j'ai bu,
jeter ma nourriture,
désinfecter ta boule,
faire ce stupide mouvement
à chaque fois que tu lances la boule.
- J'aurais du déclarer forfait.
- Tu sais quoi ?
- Il est pas trop tard.
- Où tu vas ? Quoi ?
Non, tu sais quoi ? Pourquoi tu restes
pas ? Tu es la reine du bowling.
Tu es la meilleure joueuse du monde.
Tu restes. Je pars. OK ?
Mais qu'est-ce qu'on fera alors
sans notre super coach ?
T'as surement désinfecté
toutes les pistes.
T'as fait que ça toute la soirée.
Si tu veux te baigner dans les germes,
te gêne pas.
- Je vais faire ça je crois.
- C'est bien.
Rectum de chien.
Et voilà. Un rectum de chien.
Gary, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
La personne responsable de Tom Brooks
est priée de se rendre aux jeux vidéo.
La personne responsable de Tom Brooks.
- Salut.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il s'est passé ?
Ma main s'est coincée
dans l'attrape peluche.
Vous avez entendu mon nom ?
C'est plutôt cool !
Pourquoi t'essayais de voler
dans l'attrape peluche ?
C'est pas du vol, maman. J'ai mis
tout mon argent pour cet ours rouge,
mais la grue ne voulait pas le lâcher.
Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive, Brooks ?
Tu joues, ou tu déclares forfait ?
Je m'occupe de mon fils là.
Tu veux pas me laisser tranquille ?
C'est ton fils ?
Pourquoi je suis pas surpris ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Il a des soucis avec une machine
à un bouton.
Ne te moque pas de lui.
Il faisait ça pour moi.
- Je l'aime bien, papa.
- Tu vois la fille de Bobby Kim ?
Tu ne vas pas sortir avec le fils
d'un peintre.
Excuse-moi.
Tu dis que mon fils n'est pas assez bien
pour sortir avec ta fille ?
Si tu parles du gamin dont le bras
est coincé dans la machine,
oui, c'est ce que je dis.
Laisse-moi te dire un truc Kim.
Tu peux te moquer de moi, tu peux
te moquer de mon équipe, de mes amis.
Tu peux te moquer d'elle.
C'est bon. Mais écoute,
quand il s'agit de mon fils, fais gaffe.
Oui, c'est vrai. Notre fils est un jeune
garçon intelligent et
une fille aurait
de la chance d'être avec lui.
Merci, maman.
Est-ce que ça vient ?
Parce que j'aurais plus d'impact
si tu n'étais pas coincé là-dedans.
Dites à votre fils
de rester loin de ma fille.
Tu sais quoi, Allison ?
Peut-être qu'on devrait mettre
notre dispute de côté
pour s'occuper des Kim.
Oui, tout à fait.
Mais après on reprendra
là où on s'est arrêté, OK ?
Absolument.
T'en dis quoi, Kim ?
Retournons là-bas régler ça
avec nos boules.
Tu vois ce qu'il a voulu dire ?
Vous ne mettez pas
d'animaux dedans vous ?
Quelque chose lèche mon doigt.
Tu retrouves des sensations
dans ta main, fiston ?
Oui, j'ai encore un peu mal.
C'est la dernière fois que je fais
une chose stupide pour une fille.
Tu sais, après encore
8 ou 9 choses stupides,
tu prendras même plus la peine
de dire ça.
Ella a été très gentille, Tom.
T'aurais dû nous dire que tu la voyais.
Oui, c'est surement fini.
T'as pas vu sa tête
quand le mec de la maintenance
a du tenir une serviette que je puisse
faire pipi dans une bouteille.
T'as super bien joué, Allison.
- Merci.
- Écoute...
J'ai que 3 personnes dans mon équipe,
et il va y avoir un nouveau championnat
bientôt.
- Voudrais-tu...
- Je jouerais pas dans ton équipe.
Dieu merci.
J'arrive pas à croire qu'on soit parti
avec cette œuvre d'art.
C'est magnifique.
Oui, personne ne s'attendait
à ce qu'on parte avec.
Oui, c'est ce que les Kim ont gagné en
laissant la porte de leur van ouverte.
Team Subs-Addicts"
All right. No big deal.
Minor setback.
Easy spare, Gary.
Yeah, man. Pick this one up
and we're in the finals.
- That's right.
- How long has my name been on my shirt?
All year, dad. Everyone's name
is on the shirt. We're a team, OK?
Except yours is the only shirt
with your address and instructions
for a cab driver pinned
inside your collar.
- The championships.
- Way to go, dad.
Thanks, son.
You know, it just goes to show you,
you can do anything when
you put your mind to it.
Doesn't hurt that two of the other guys
on the other team got food poisoning.
Look, Louise,
they ordered sushi in a bowling alley.
They got what they deserved, OK?
Hey, dad,
why are those 4 guys staring at you?
The Kim brothers,
from Kim brothers flooring.
They won the championship
the last 4 years.
What did you do to them?
'cause they're looking
at you like mom does.
They're floor guys, Tom.
Floor guys hate painters.
Painters hate floor guys.
Why do we hate them?
Because they scuff
perfectly painted baseboards
with their buffers.
Painters have no respect for floors.
They leave splatters everywhere.
Man, I wish we were
playing them in the finals.
I'd love to kick their asses.
We are playing them in the finals.
Well... You know,
there ain't no shame in second place.
What kind of attitude is that, stuart?
Come on. We can beat the Kims.
We get that trophy, we can rub
their noses in it for a whole year.
I mean, what's second place,
dinner at the Rusty Anchor?
Rusty Anchor.
You know, you can smell that place
all the way from the freeway.
That's how you know it's good fish.
We not playing for that. We're playing
for the trophy. I want the trophy.
I want you guys to want the trophy,
and that's what we're gonna get
when we beat the Kims' butts!
Talk big, Brooks.
We'll see you on saturday.
Yeah, don't worry, Kim. We'll be there.
We're gonna wax the floor with you.
We're gonna paint the walls with you!
Two coats!
Yeah, you know you guys are just
describing your jobs, right?
Hey, son. Do me a favor.
Return my shoes, OK?
Goody.
They're still warm and humid.
You dropped your...
Book.
Thanks. I'm Ella.
I'm Tom.
What are you reading?
Pre-calc.
I read the sequel, "calc."
You're funny.
I got to go return these shoes, OK.
- So... bye.
- All right. Bye.
Ella, let's go.

" Gary and the Trophy "
Sub VO :   ¤Aka¤
Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way.fr]
Thanks for visiting Dadland.
Welcome back to momtopia,
where the fun never starts.
Hey, do they still have that ride at
Dadland where you sit on the couch
for 6 hours and watch
your life pass you by?
I'm gonna go take a shower.
I smell like popcorn, beer, and feet.
Wait a min. Gary, did you take
them to the bowling alley again?
It's a family fun center, OK?
And, yes, I did.
Dad's team won, mom.
They're in the championship.
- Who you playing?
- Kim brothers flooring.
Second place.
We're not getting second place
this year, Allison. We're winning.
OK? I don't know if you noticed.,
my team's undefeated.
Yeah, only because you had two forfeits,
Gary, OK?
And just before you played Dave's
Roofing, Dave's mother died.
She was their best bowler.
And they played their hearts out
in her loving memory, all right?
And we still spanked them.
Well, good luck beating
the Kims without me.
- I was the best bowler on the team.
- That's right, was.
You was the best bowler on the team, OK?
But now I was am the best
bowler on the team, OK?
I'm the best bowler on
the team because I'm free.
At last I don't have you counting my
beer or throwing away my chicken wings
or using hand sanitizer on
your bowling ball after every roll.
You know, there are more germs on
a bowling ball than a dog's rectum.
Look, I think you have to
find other hobbies aside
from figuring out what has
more germs than a dog's rectum.
You know, as much as it's killing me
not to be spending mondays and thursdays
at a bowling alley, wearing
somebody else's shoes Which, again,
dog's rectum Good luck
on the championship, Gary.
Why don't you just admit it? It's
killing you that you're not on the team
when we're in the championships.
Just admit it.
You wish you were back on the team.
Admit it.
- I hate that i'm not on the team.
- Just admit it.
I just did.
You took all the fun out of that.
Look, I liked being on the team, OK?
And I was a little hurt you didn't
ask me back, but I'm over it.
- All right, good.
- And you know what? I cannot wait
until you get your butts
shellacked by the Kim brothers.
Not gonna happen, OK?
Because with a little extra coaching,
my guys are gonna be fine.
But you stink as a coach, Gary.
I mean, a little extra's just gonna
make your team a little extra stinky.
I'm the world's greatest coach. I have
a coffee mug that says that on it.
Please. Gary,
I was on your team for 7 years.
Your only motivation technique
includes shots of booze.
When your team consists of problem
drinkers, that's very motivating.
We had a good practice,
you guys, OK? But
we got to step it up a notch. We got
to really focus and stay motivated, OK?
Motivated. That means shots.
No, no, no. Dennis, no shots.
Dennis, come on. No booze today.
But this is a coaching session.
We always have shots.
You created the monster, Gary.
You're gonna have to feed it.
No shots this time, OK?
I really want us to just focus
on the practice we just had.
It was pretty good, but we can improve.
For instance, OK, stuart?
You are rushing everything.
Well, if I take too long,
Dennis drinks my beer.
- I do not.
- I know you do, Dennis.
You're the only one
that wears lip gloss.
It is lip balm,
and it's very dry in here.
Guys, come on. Just, Now can you
knock it off? Sit down. Relax.
We gotta bring our "A" game to beat
the Kim brothers. Look at them in there
They're so precise. They never
take heir eyes off their pins.
Now's your chance, Dennis.
Go drink their beer.
I don't do that.
That's not meant to rush you.
I just want to make sure
I hold my place in line.
You know what? You have Skinny arms.
If you really want that elephant, you
could just reach up there and grab it.
I'll keep a lookout if you want.
You're so sweet, tom,
but we shouldn't be seen together.
Well, why not?
I mean, I made you laugh the other day,
remember, the whole "calc" bit?
I remember, and it was funny.
Adam-Sandler funny, but let's be honest.
My people hate your people.
You're talking about painters
and floorers, not, like,
Koreans and whatever I am, right?
You're cute, but I better go.
My dad would kill me
if he saw us together.
No. Don't follow.
It's way too dangerous.
But I have to.
My nachos are up.
OK, look, there's something I want to
try to really harness our attention.
I got just the thing for that.
Whoever's driving only gets half.
Dad, that's No, please. Dad?
Come on. This is different.
Mine involves visualization.
Well, my thing has that.
Dad? Can we try mine first, please?
Now, we're gonna visualize.
Everybody close your eyes.
It's the final frame
of the championships.
There we are, playing for that big,
beautiful trophy.
I'm up, last frame.
I roll the ball.
- It's a strike!
- Way to go, Gar.
Excellent.
Anybody else see the naked Indian?
No, dad. Just relax, OK?
Everybody keep your eyes closed.
Dennis, you're up.
Your turn to bowl, my friend.
All right, it's my turn
and I've gotand my ball
I'm ready to roll.
Then I hear stuart's nose whistle.
- What?
- Your nose whistles, man.
- My nose does not whistle!
- It always whistles, all right?
Every time you sneeze, kids all
over the city get out of the pool.
Yeah, well, you know what I visualize?
Dennis' stupid orange gloves.
This is my look, all right?
This is what I am
known for in the lanes.
Dude, you're known for
drinking other people's beer.
And wearing lipstick.
It's a balm, all right?
And you know what I see?
You standing over the hand dryer
and having it blow up your shorts.
Nobody pays any attention to that.
Nobody noticed the old, smiling
hippie straddling the ball return.
All right, all right. Come on.
Can we please just concentrate?
I'm trying to get us ready for the Kims.
On the count of 3, everybody just
take a deep breath and relax. 1, 2, 3.
Did you hear it?
- I definitely heard that.
- I heard that.
Sounds like the 7 dwarfs
are going to work.
Well, you know, don't make fun of stuart
because if there's a massive earthquake
and we're all covered in rubble,
it's that nose whistle
that's gonna lead the rescue dogs to us.
You guys knew I had sinus issues
when you asked me to join the team!
This isn't fun anymore.
I quit.
Stuart, what are you doing?
We're just kidding around!
You can't quit!
I need 4 people to fill out a team.
Sorry, Gary.
I'm hanging up my shoes.
I can eat at the Rusty Anchor
anytime I want!
That's not what we're playing for!
- Well, it's over.
- No, no, no. - I want that trophy.
I just got to figure out somebody
else to put on the team
- in his place, that's all.
- What about Allison?
Dad, the only time I ever
want to hear that sentence
is if we're on a life raft
and someone has to go.
We got to get her or we got to forfeit.
No. We're gonna get that trophy somehow.
Hey, Brooks,
I just called the Rusty Anchor
and made your team
a reservation for saturday night.
It's not what we're playing for.
Hey, don't worry, OK, Kim?
Cause we're gonna be there saturday
night. We're gonna beat you.
- Not with 3 players, you're not.
- Don't worry.
I got a fourth player,
and you better brace yourself,
'cause I'm unleashing
hell itself on you.
- How is Allison?
- She's good. I'll tell her you asked.
I can't believe it.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
I don't normally wear pajamas to bed.
Listen, I'm sorry for
running out of the arcade,
but I haven't been able to
stop thinking about you,
and I wanted to make sure you're going
to the bowling alley on saturday.
Yeah. I'll be there.
What about your dad?
I don't care what he thinks.
I just want us to hang out.
You want to come in for a second?
I have to be home
before it gets dark out.
Yeah, I got to hit
the rack pretty early, too.
I'm meeting with a marine
recruiter in the morning.
What is that, your Tv? Turn it off!
It's an hour past your bedtime!
- Good morning.
- It was.
Somebody woke up on the funny
side of the bed this morning.
Here, look. I got you a breakfast
sandwich. That's for you.
Gary, what do you want?
Nothing. I you know, I was thinking bout
what you said the other day bout wanting
to be back on the bowling team.
I said I was hurt. I never said
I wanted to be back on the team.
You're too proud to really admit
it, but I'm gonna make it easy for you.
I've decided to allow you
back onto the bowling team.
Why? What happened?
I just knew how much it
meant to you to be on the team.
And now that we're playing
the kim brothers in the finals,
we can win the championship,
get that big trophy.
I'm gonna let you be a part of that.
You are welcome.
Well, forget it, Gary. It's too late.
Yo don't want me before.
Why would I do that now?
But, look, OK. I'm gonna be
brutally honest with you here.
And this,
this doesn't leave this house, OK?
the team's not gelling like it used to,
and I'm thinking about cutting somebody
loose. I'm leaning towards Stuart.
Stuart? Really?
I think Dennis is the weak link here.
- No I think I'm gonna cut loose stuart.
- What about Jack?
- I mean It's gonna be Stuart, OK?
- OK, you know what, Gary?
You said you were having
a lot more fun without me,
you know, so I don't want
to ruin that for you.
We had a lot of fun when you and I were
on the same team. We had loads of fun.
Gary, all we ever did was fight.
Fight? That was just
harmless sports banter.
"If it wasn't for the kids, I would
leave you" is harmless sports banter?
I mean, obviously you've never
spent time in a locker room, but...
Look, I need you back on the team, OK?
Just come back on the team.
All right.
I will do it...
As long as you admit that I am
a better bowler than you.
It's a team sport, Allison.
It's not about individual achievements.
- Say it.
- I'm a better bowler than you.
Well, have fun at the Rusty Anchor.
Enjoy the catfish legs.
You're a better bowler than me, OK?
Thank you, thank you.
I will be there saturday night,
but please, would you get rid of Dennis?
I'd like to finish a beer.
It's gonna be historic!
Gosh, the Kims just pulled another
strike. They're like machines.
Maybe they are machines.
That would make a lot of sense.
Would it, dad, really?
Your whole life would just get tied
together if they were machines?
You just sanitized the ball when
you rolled it the last time.
Yeah, well, I don't know what happens
to it once it disappears back there.
All right. Here I go.
Would you go, already?! Go!
Gary! This is my process.
I can't just pick up a ball,
you know what? This is not my ball.
Have you noticed the score, Bbrooks?
I know painters aren't good at math,
but our score is higher than yours.
You're gonna need a lot more
than the highest score to beat us, Kim.
No, that's pretty much
how it works, Dennis.
I am on fire.
I wish you were.
- Are these somebody's?
- Those are mine.
- Why? Why didn't you say something?
- I just said those are mine.
- You threw in the garbage!
- Stop whining. It's your turn.
How am I whining? It's my food.
You threw my...
Gary, can I give you some advice?
Look, I'm just trying to help, OK?
We can still win this thing,
but I think you need a lighter ball.
- I don't need a lighter ball.
- You know what?
Men lose muscle mass
when they get older.
Stop. Just stop.
I don't need a lighter ball, OK?
Gosh! Look what you made me do now!
You would have more control
with a lighter ball.
I'll rember that the next time
I decide to bludgeon.
You know what, Gary?
You should be thanking me, OK?
I'm the only one that's
keeping us alive here.
I am the best bowler you have.
You're right, Allison. Thank you.
Thank you for making me miserable.
I can't bowl with you around.
I never could.
It's like you get inside my head and you
annoy all the talent out the other side.
Why did you want
me back on the team?
- I didn't! Stuart quit!
- Oh, crap.
Game over? 'cause we weren't supposed
to say that until the game's over.
What did you do?
What, did you just lie to me?
I wanted that trophy so bad, I thought
I could put up with you one night.
I was wrong.
Counting how many beers I've had,
throwing away my food,
sanitizing your ball,
doing that stupid ickey shuffle
before every time you roll the ball.
- I should have just forfeited.
- You know what?
- It's not too late.
- Where are you going? What?
No, you know what? Why don't you stay?
You're the queen of the lanes tonight.
You're the best bowler in the world.
You stay. I'll leave, OK?
But then what would we do
without our brilliant coach?
You'd probably sanitize the whole lanes.
That's what you've been doing all night.
You know what? If you want to
wallow in germs, be my guest.
- OK, think I will.
- That's nice.
Dog's rectum.
There it is. Dog's rectum.
Man, on attention, bowlers.
Would the party responsible for Tom
Brooks please report to the arcade?
The party responsible for Tom Brooks.
- Hey, mom.
- What happened?
I got my hand stuck in the claw machine.
Did you hear my name over
the announcement? It's pretty cool.
Why were you trying to steal
something out of the claw machine?
It's not stealing, mom. I put all my
money in it just for that red Teddy bear
but the claw wouldn't drop it.
What happened to you, Brooks?
What, are you bowling or forfeiting?
I'm dealing with my kid right now.
Why don't you leave me alone, all right?
This is your son?
Why am I not surprised?
What do you mean by that?
He's confused by
a machine with one button.
Don't make fun of him.
He was doing it for me.
- I like him, daddy.
- You're seeing bobby Kim's daughter?
You are not going to go out
with the son of a painter.
Excuse me.
Are you saying that my son isn't good
enough to go out with your daughter?
If you're talking about the kid with
his arm stuck in the machine,
yeah, that's what i'm saying.
Let me tell something Kim. You
can make fun of me and you can make fun
of my bowling team, my friends.
You can make fun of her all you want.
That's good. But listen,
when it comes to my kids, back off.
Yeah, that's right.
Our son is a bright young man who any
girl would be lucky to go out with.
Thanks, mom.
Is it loosening up at all?
Because my point would have
a better impact if you
weren't stuck in a prize slot.
Just tell your son to stay
away from my daughter.
You know what, Allison?
Maybe we should put our fighting aside
to take care of Kim brothers flooring.
Yeah, absolutely.
But then we're gonna pick up
right where we left off, right?
Definitely.
What do you say, Kim?
Let's get back out there
and settle this with our balls.
You know what he meant.
You don't put live animals in here,
do you?
Something's licking my finger.
Getting the feeling back
in your hand yet, son?
Yeah, my hand's still pretty sore.
You know, that's the last time
I do anything stupid for a girl.
Well, after your next 8 or 9
stupid things that you do,
you won't even bother
saying that anymore.
Ella was really sweet, Tom.
You should have told
us you were seeing her.
Yeah, that's probably over.
You didn't see the look on her face
when the maintenance guy
had to hold up a towel
so I could pee in a bottle.
You bowled a heck of a game, Allison.
- Thank you.
- Listen...
I still only have 3 people on my team,
and there's going to be
a new league starting off.
- Would you...
- No I'm not bowling on your team.
Thank god.
I can't believe we left with
this lovely little piece of hardware.
It is beautiful.
Yeah, no one expected us
to walk away with that.
Yeah, that's what the Kims get
for leaving their van door open.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Je veux dire, ça me rend taré, Gary.
Je dois te dire quelque chose,
mais j'ai oublié.
- Pas grave, oublie.
- Non, c'est important.
Pourquoi je me souviens de rien ?
Beaucoup de raisons, papa.
Des tonnes de raisons.
- Salut papi.
- Louise,
je t'ai demandé
de me rappeler quelque chose ?
Si quelqu'un demande,
tu étais avec nous au ciné.
Non, c'est pas ça,
mais ça tient toujours.
Salut, papa.
OK, Gary, désolée de te le dire,
mais c'est le moment
de t'atteler ŕ l'ouvrage.
Je croyais qu'on était d'accord.
T'aimes pas ça et je suis nul.
Oui, c'est vrai.
Je parle de s'atteler
ŕ une tâche ce week-end,
car Tom échoue en histoire.
- Tu veux savoir pourquoi ?
- Il y en a trop ?
Car il a pas fait son exposé sur Hoover.
Ça arrive chaque fois qu'il est lŕ.
- Ça a l'air accusateur.
- Dans le mile, parce que je t'accuse.
Écoute, tu lui fais jamais faire
son travail.
Pourquoi t'as pas fait ton exposé
sur Herbert Hoover ?
C'était mon week-end avec toi
et en tant qu'enfant de divorcés,
j'essaie de profiter du peu de temps
qu'on a ensemble.
T'as fait ton enfant de divorcés
ŕ l'animalerie,
et maintenant, je suis coincé
avec un hamster pygmée.
Tu dois agir
et ętre plus dur avec lui.
Je suis fatiguée
de jouer les casse-pieds.
Ça nous fatigue aussi.
On est crevés.
J'ai parlé ŕ son prof
et il le laisse rattraper son exposé,
mais il doit ętre pręt lundi
et il doit ętre bon, ou il va échouer,
et tout ŕ les coups, il peindra
des maisons, sans vouloir te vexer.
Bonjour madame, votre mari est lŕ ?
Petite fille, je prends des bonbons
ŕ la menthe et des biscuits.
Comment ça va ?
Regardez-vous.
Comment vous allez ?
Vous avez grandi.
Si on était en Afghanistan,
tu travaillerais dans les champs d'opium
et toi, tu te marierais.
Et toi, Allison.
Comme ils disent lŕ-bas,
tu es jolie.
Merci.
Papa, c'est ça que t'essayais
de te rappeler ?
Oui, ton frčre rentre d'Afghanistan.
Comment ça va ?
C'est bon de te voir.
Pourquoi t'es pas venu ŕ l'aéroport ?
Il était avec nous au ciné.

Team Subs-Addicts"
On est ŕ 300 km de Kaboul.
Je suis dans le véhicule de tęte.
Mon artilleur voit quelque chose au loin
qui bouge bizarrement.
On prend pas de risque,
on lance une attaque aérienne.
5 minutes plus tard...
Baissez-vous !
En fait, c'était qu'une chčvre.
T'as tué une chčvre ?
Non, on l'a loupée de 11 km.
La petite est montée avec nous,
ça a été notre mascotte pendant 8 mois.
Jusqu'ŕ Noël, lŕ on l'a mangée.
Je rigole. On l'a pas mangée.
Je suis assez vieille pour m'expliquer
cette histoire de demi-frčre ?
Bien sűr.
Ton oncle Mitch et moi,
on a des mčres différentes,
qui vivent trčs loin
et on passait les étés avec papa.
Attends,
papi Jack avait deux femmes ?
Tu veux gérer celle-lŕ, Don Juan ?
C'était les sixties.
On était pas officiellement mariés.
Le frčre Groovy dit "c'est tes nanas
tant que c'est cool" et...
Mais papi Jack aimait trčs fort
ces deux femmes.
C'est pourquoi papa et oncle Mitch
sont demi-frčres. Fin.
Comment papi Jack pouvait
aimer deux femmes ?
Tu aimes le beurre de cacahučtes
et la gelée.
- Si tu peux les avoir en męme temps.
- J'ai dit "fin" !
Bon, je vais y aller.
Mitch, félicitation
pour ta retraite.
- C'est super que tu sois revenu.
- Merci.
Content d'ętre lŕ oů on me force
pas ŕ aller ŕ un concert de Toby Keith.
Si je peux faire quelque chose,
dis-le-moi.
- Super. Tu veux m'épouser ?
- Toi, alors.
Allez. Me dis pas que Gary
est dans ta ligue et pas moi.
Pour commencer,
Gary n'a jamais été dans ma ligue.
C'est plutôt un spectateur bourré
qui a couru sur le terrain.
Je reviens demain pour amener Louise
ŕ son camp de golf.
Rappelle-toi.
L'exposé de Tommy, Herbert Hoover,
10 pages. J'ai compris.
Je vais m'en occuper.
Tu l'as entendue.
Je veux 2 pages écrites
avant 22 heures.
Et si je t'attrape dans ta chambre
ŕ chahuter... Elle est partie.
Tu t'occupes de la bouffe.
Commande des pizzas.
Vous pouvez manger autour du meurtre.
Bon, Tommy,
tu t'occupes des bičres, OK ?
Importées avant locales,
bouteilles avant canettes.
Si on en arrive ŕ ce que papa
boive une canette de locale,
envoie-moi au lit.
- Compris, papa.
- Écoute,
c'est seulement parce que ton oncle
Mitch est de retour.
Mais demain, tu commenceras
ton exposé, d'accord ?
OK, bien.
- Pourquoi tu ris ?
- Toi, en pčre. Ça m'éclate.
Je suis un meilleur pčre
que toi un marine.
Vraiment ? Une section entičre
suivait mes ordres.
- Tu peux ŕ peine gérer deux gosses.
- Mais t'avais un flingue.
Tu veux vraiment que je dorme
sur ce canapé ?
Non, t'es pas obligé.
Tu peux aussi dormir
dans le lit superposé de Tommy.
- Ou dans ta chambre.
- T'auras pas ma chambre.
- Je suis pręt ŕ lutter, pour ça.
- Non. Quoi ?
- Tu vas lutter.
- On est plus des gosses. On va pas
lutter chaque fois
que t'obtiens pas ce que tu veux.
- File moi ta chambre.
- Non, tu l'auras pas.
- T'auras le canapé.
- J'en veux pas.
- Et le lit superposé ?
- J'en veux pas.
Luttez.
Déplacements ŕ 3 heures.
Descends et tire.
Descends et tire !
C'est trop fort !
Il y a des ennemis partout.
Louise, ŕ l'aide !
Attends.
J'arme mon lance-grenades.
Crčve, pourriture de nazi !
Hé !
- Salut, Gar.
- Salut, papa.
Salut, papounet.
C'est un peu fort.
Désolé, hippie.
Tu sais ce qui est fort, aussi ?
La vraie guerre.
Louise,
"Crčve, pourriture de nazi" ?
T'es fan des Nazis ?
Génial. Vous avez sűrement réveillé
tout le voisinage.
Bien joué. Vraiment...
J'arrive !
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Brooks ?
Il est 2 heures.
Salut, M. Piscazzi.
Ils jouaient ŕ la console.
Excusez-moi. Bonsoir, monsieur.
Sergent-chef Mitchell Brooks.
Il y a eu une défaillance audio
avec la console de jeux,
- mais nous y avons remédié.
- Je me lčve tôt. Je nage.
Évidemment.
Męme ŕ travers votre peignoir, je vois
que vous faites du sport intensivement.
Ne vous en faites pas.
On ne vous dérangera plus.
Je le jure.
Trčs bien.
Pas de problčmes.
Pas de bruit.
Bien joué, Mitch.
On a failli se faire tuer.
- Allez, les enfants, au lit !
- D'accord.
Désolé, mec, d'accord.
Les gosses me tenaient compagnie.
Et puis, aprčs avoir été réveillés,
ils pouvaient pas se rendormir.
Je retourne me coucher.
Je travaille, demain.
Tant que t'es lŕ.
Tu veux m'aider ŕ accéder
au prochain niveau ? Allez.
- Non. Je dois aller travailler.
- Je lutterai, pour ça.
Je vais me coucher.
Dire que tu m'as mordu.
La guerre, c'est l'enfer.
Bonjour, papa.
Je vois qu'il y a du laisser-aller
dans le réveil.
Mange un bout.
Oncle Mitch nous a laissés préparer
le petit-déjeuner.
Je t'explique, Mitch. D'habitude,
on cuisine pas ici
ŕ cause de, eh bien, ça et...
J'ai viré la femme de ménage.
Obligé, vu qu'elle m'a quitté.
T'en fais pas. On s'en occupera
dčs qu'on aura fini de jouer au basket.
- On y va.
- On a pas de panier de basket.
Maintenant, si. Oncle Mitch a mis
celui de M. Piscazzi dans notre allée.
Tu lui as volé son panier ?
Je me suis battu pour sa liberté,
d'accord ?
Je pense qu'il veut que je l'aie.
On y va !
Hé, mon grand, attends un peu.
T'as un devoir sur Herbert Hoover.
J'ai aujourd'hui et demain, papa.
Trčs bien. Je veux
que tu t'appliques, cette fois.
Ton dernier devoir ressemblait
ŕ une liste de course.
Ça sera facile.
Herbert Hoover est né.
Il a fait des trucs. Il est devenu
Président. J'en suis déjŕ la la 6e page.
Vous pouvez jouer 1/4 d'heure.
C'est tout.
C'est pas vrai.
Je vois que tu fais la vaisselle.
J'ai une question.
Pourquoi les enfants sont dehors
- ŕ jouer au basket en pyjamas ?
- Parce qu'ils sont nuls en rugby ?
Louise doit ętre sur le terrain
de golf dans 40 min.
Je parie que Tom a pas commencé
son devoir.
Ah bon ? Combien tu veux parier ?
- 100 dollars.
- Je bluffais. Il a pas commencé.
Louise, Tom, venez ici.
Gary, c'est bien toi.
Je reprends Tom chez moi
pour m'assurer qu'il le fasse.
Temps mort.
Ma maison, mes enfants, mes rčgles.
Du calme. Il le fera.
Il joue avec son oncle. Décompresse.
Écoute, combien de fois
vais-je devoir le dire ?
On s'amuse pas
tant que les devoirs sont pas faits.
Elle est bonne, Monstrueuse Poppins.
Louise, prépare-toi pour le golf.
Tom, commence ton devoir.
Les enfants sont avec moi.
Ils suivent mes rčgles.
Si tu veux bien m'excuser.
Faites ce que dit votre mčre.
Je le ramčnerai, M. Piscazzi.
Comment ça ?
Vous ętes génial.
- Salut, Allison.
- Salut.
Tu serais pas plus belle
de jour en jour ?
Arręte, Mitch, je suis affreuse.
Comment t'as pu la laisser partir ?
J'ai mis le feu ŕ la grange
et je lui ai donné une fessée.
Tu sais quoi Mitch, tu es beau,
charmant, intelligent, et Gary
tu es obligé de me donner
la moitié de tout tes biens.
Je vais au boulot
et j'emmčne Tommy pour m'assurer
qu'il finisse son devoir.
Fais pas ça. Il le fera ici.
T'es sourd ? Il doit le terminer.
C'est important.
- Je m'assurerai qu'il finisse.
- Comment ?
Tu peux pas lutter avec Tommy
pour ça. J'ai essayé. Ça marche pas.
Je sais combien c'est important.
Une fois missionné, je m'en occupe.
- T'es sűr ?
- C'est fait.
- Le devoir ? Nettoyer la cuisine ?
- Fait. Fait.
- M. Piscazzi ?
- Mort.
Non, tu lui ramčnes juste
son panier, d'accord ?
Heureusement que j'ai demandé.
Hé, les mecs !
Voilŕ.
- C'est pas KFC.
- Si.
C'est le nouveau poulet grillé.
Ça te plaira.
C'est si tendre.
Tu sens toutes les herbes
et les épices.
Tu penses qu'il y a 5 herbes
et 6 épices ?
J'en sais rien. Mange, OK ?
Et s'il y avait 10 herbes
et une épice monstrueuse ?
Pourvu que cette conversation
ne finisse jamais.
Hé, Mitch, C'est Gary.
Salut, Gary. Quoi de neuf ?
Tom a presque fini le meilleur devoir
sur Hoover au monde.
Génial.
Revenez. J'ai ramené le dîner.
On a eu un petit problčme de voiture.
On sera pas de retour de si tôt.
Je vais venir vous chercher.
Vous ętes oů ?
Las Vegas.
Au Nevada ?
Les gens fument dedans
et boivent dehors, alors oui, au Nevada.
Purée t'es arrivé vite.
Tu conduis trčs vite quand tes enfants
ont été emmenés dans un autre état.
On a changé d'état ?
Oui et quand t'auras fini
ton exposé sur Hoover,
on en fera un sur la géographie
du sud-ouest.
- Oů est Mitch ?
- Au casino.
OK, je vais aller le tuer.
Appelle le service et demande
un gros sac de citron et une pelle.
Quand tu le vois, dis-lui qu'on a
des billets pour Danny Gans ŕ 11h.
Non, vous avez pas de billets
pour Danny Gans ŕ 11h,
car vous serez dans la voiture
avec moi ŕ 11h. Et c'est tout !
Salut, Gar.
C'est... bizarre.
On a que 3 billets pour Danny Gans.
Personne n'ira ŕ Danny Gans, OK ?
Quoi, tu te fais porter pâle au boulot
pour aller ŕ Vegas avec Mitch ?
- Pourquoi tu me l'as pas dit ?
- T'aurais jamais été d'accord.
Ne jouons pas ŕ ça, fiston.
Je vous veux habillés et pręts.
On se voit dans le hall
dans 15 minutes, OK ?
Quinze minutes.
Tu sais,
je viens de rentrer de la guerre.
Donc si tu veux attacher
un ruban jaune ŕ quelque chose,
j'ai quelques suggestions pour toi.
Hé, qu'est-ce que tu fous, bordel ?
Un dix dur, voilŕ ce que je fais.
T'es fou, amener Tommy jusqu'ici ?
Je t'ai dit au téléphone.
On était ŕ la maison,
travaillant sur son exposé et c'est
tellement déprimant et le bordel.
- Tu vois ?
- La faute ŕ qui ?
C'est pas ma faute si t'as divorcé
de ta femme de ménage sexy.
Alors au lieu de nettoyer,
tu viens ŕ Vegas ?
Ouais, son exposé était sur Hoover,
et le barrage de Hoover
est qu'ŕ 2 h de voiture.
- C'est 4 heures.
- Trois, grand-mčre.
Souffle lŕ-dessus.
Un six dur.
- Voilŕ.
- Allez, donne-le !
Donc t'as jeté mon fils dans une voiture
et tu l'as traîné ŕ travers le désert ?
Avec un arręt ŕ Barstow pour manger.
Au fait, t'as déjŕ mangé
ce poulet grillé de KFC ?
C'était incroyable.
T'aurais dű m'appeler.
C'est du poulet, mec.
J'allais te le dire
la prochaine fois qu'on se verrait.
- Il a un délai.
- Je sais.
Il le fait. Seulement, ŕ Las Vegas.
- On s'est beaucoup amusés.
- Tu peux pas t'amuser
avant la fin du travail.
- Je viens de dire ça ?
- Pas moi en tout cas.
Oh mon Dieu.
Tu vois ce que t'as fait ?
Tu m'as transformé en Allison.
On y va.
- Je vais nulle part.
- On part.
Tu montes, prépares tes affaires.
- On rentre ŕ la maison. Allons-y !
- Arręte de crier, Allison.
M'appelle pas Allison. On y va.
T'es sűr ? Parce que j'ai pris une
chambre sous le nom "Allison".
Excusez-moi. M. l'Agent.
Quoi encore ?
Je sais de source sűre
que ce prisonnier
a de la drogue sur lui.
- Elle serait oů ?
- Dans son vagin.
Donnez-moi ça.
Super. Maintenant,
on a plus de balai.
Qu'est-ce qui t'es arrivé ?
T'étais drôle, avant.
J'ai des enfants, Mitch, OK ?
Avec des enfants,
il faut un adulte responsable.
D'habitude c'est Allison.
Mais quand tu viens,
tu agis comme moi,
donc je dois ętre Allison.
- J'agis comme moi.
- T'agis pas comme toi
t'agis comme moi.
Rester debout tard,
jouer aux jeux vidéo,
aller ŕ Vegas.
C'est du moi tout craché,
tu me piques mon rôle.
Et le pire,
c'est que maintenant que tu es lŕ,
je vois le point de vue d'Allison.
Je lui ai transformé sa vie en enfer.
Et si tu lui dis ça,
je jure devant Dieu que je te tuerai.
Pas si je te tue d'abord.
Et je peux le faire avec n'importe quoi.
Non, tu pourrais pas.
Trouve quelque chose.
- Je cherchais qu'un trombone.
- Je sais.
Ce sont vos fils ?
Eh oui.
Vous ne croyiez pas ŕ la fessée,
pas vrai ?
Je pensais les avoir mieux
élevés que ça.
Papa, tu nous as pas du tout élevés.
Alors c'était inévitable.
- Il a commencé !
- Il m'a taclé !
- Il a dit que j'avais un vagin.
- Arrętez !
Regardez-vous.
Vous battre comme des ados.
Vous devriez vous entre-aider.
Vous avez les deux
beaucoup traversé.
Un de vous a été dans un bourbier
absurde, ŕ se battre contre
un ennemi retors,
et Mitch était ŕ la guerre.
Vous devriez vous soutenir.
Votre famille...
j'en suis plutôt sűr.
- Papa a raison, tu sais.
- Désolé, papa. Merci.
C'est bon, vous pouvez partir.
Votre caution a été payée.
J'ai dű revendre les billets
pour Danny Gans. Désolé.
C'est bon. C'est plus pareil depuis que
sa partenaire a été mangée par un tigre.
- Papa, je suis plutôt sűr que Mitch...
- Pourquoi ? Juste...
J'imagine qu'on rentre ŕ la maison.
Ce serait la chose responsable
ŕ faire.
C'est une honte. On a une suite d'hôtel
et des boissons gratuites.
La voiture sera pręte demain.
Ce serait responsable de rentrer.
Papa, tu veux bien surveiller
Tom deux heures ?
Parce que moi et mon frčre
allons investir les tables !
C'est bon, je suis fier de vous.
Sortir de prison,
aller jouer ensemble.
J'ai hâte de le dire ŕ votre sśur.
On a une sśur ?
Tu te rappelles le beurre de cacahučtes
et la gelée ?
Apparemment, je les aurais descendus
avec un verre de chocolat chaud.
- Vous ne...
- Tiroir du haut.
Je dois dire.
Tommy a fait un trčs bon exposé.
C'est vrai. Mitch et moi, on est restés
dans sa chambre ŕ tour de rôle,
pour s'assurer qu'il se baladait pas
et qu'il faisait son boulot.
La partie sur le barrage de Hoover.
On dirait qu'il y était.
C'est internet. Ça peut t'emmener
partout dans le monde.
- Super boulot, Gary. Merci.
- Merci ŕ toi.
C'est pour toi.
- C'est quoi ?
- Ouvre-le. Vas-y.
Gary, c'est magnifique.
C'est pour quoi ?
Tu t'es chargée de beaucoup
de choses, alors c'est pour toi.
- C'est trčs gentil, merci.
- De rien.
Je vais rentrer. Mitch et moi,
on va boire deux bičres et se relaxer
de tout le boulot qu'on a fourni
pour aider Tommy et son exposé.
Comment était Danny Gans ?
On a dű vendre les billets pour que
Tommy puisse nous sortir de prison.
- C'est pas fini !
- Ça l'est jamais !
Team Subs-Addicts"
I mean, it's just like it's
driving me crazy, Gary.
There is something I'm supposed to
tell you. I can't remember what it is.
- Who cares? Forget about it, dad.
- No. It's important.
Why can't I remember anything?
Lots of reasons, dad.
Ounces and ounces of reasons.
- Hey, grandpa.
- Hey, Louise,
did I ask you to
remind me of anything?
You said if anyone ever asks,
that you were with us at the movies.
No, that's not it,
but that still stands.
Hi, dad.
OK, Gary, I hate to break it to you,
but it's time to put
your nose to the grindstone.
I thought we agreed. You don't
really like it, and I'm not good at it.
No, no, you're not.
I'm talking about buckling down
this weekend
because Tom is failing history.
- And you want to know why?
- Cos' there is too much of it.
Because didn't do his report on Hoover.
This happens every time he is here.
That sounds accusatory.
Then I nailed it,
because I'm accusing you.
Look, Gary,
you never make him do his work.
Hey, Tommy, how come you didn't
do your report on herbert hoover?
'cause it was my weekend with you,
dad, and as a child of divorce,
I try to spend what little time
we have creating memories together.
You did that childhood divorce
speech on me once in the pet store,
and now I'm stuck raising
your stupid pygmy hamster.
Gary, you have to chip in
and be tougher on Tommy.
I'm so tired of having to
be the nag all the time.
We're all tired of it, Allison.
We're exhausted.
Gary, I talked to his teacher,
and he'll let him make up his report,
but it has to be in on monday and it
has to be good, or he is going to flunk,
and the next thing you know, he's
gonna be painting houses. No offense.
Hello, ma'am. Is your husband home?
I'll tell you what little girl. I take
a box of thin mints and some tagalongs.
How you doing?
Look at you guys.
How are you?
You guys got big.
If we were in Afghanistan,
you'd be working in the opium fields,
and you'd be getting married.
And you, Allison.
As they say over there,
you look, l lovely.
Thank you.
Hey, das is this what you
were trying to remember?
Yeah, your brother's come home
from Afghanistan.
How you doing, dad?
Good to see you.
How come you didn't pick
me up at the airport?
He was with us at the movies.

"Gary and His Half Brother"
VO By : ¤Aka¤
Team Subs-Addicts"
So we're 200 miles outside of Kabul.
I'm in the lead vehicle.
My tour gunner spots something up ahead,
and it's moving erratically.
So we don't take any chances.
We call in an air strike.
5 minutes later...
Get down!
Turns out, it was just a goat.
You killed a goat?
No. We missed him by 11 kilometers.
Little fella came on board with us.
He was our mascot for the next 8 months.
Till Christmas. Then we ate him.
I'm kidding. I'm just kidding.
We didn't eat him.
So am I old enough for you to explain
this half-brother thing to me?
Sure.
Well, your uncle Mitch and i, we
we have different mothers
who live far apart and
summers we would spend with dad.
Wait, grandpa Jack had 2 wives?
You want to handle that Mclovin'?
Well, it was the late sixties.
We were not really
married officially.
Brother groovy said these are your old
ladies for as long as it's cool, and...
But grandpa Jack loved
both these women very much.
That's why daddy and uncle Mitch
are half-brothers. The end.
Yeah, but how can grandpa
Jack be in love with 2 women?
You love peanut butter
and Jelly, right?
And if you can have them both
at the same time.
I said the end! OK?
Anyway, I'm gonna go, OK?
Mitch, congratulations
on your retirement.
- It's really great to have you back.
- Thank you.
I'm just glad to be someplace where i'm
not forced to go to Toby Keith concert.
Well, if there's anything I can
do for you, just let me know.
- Great. Will you marry me?
- You.
Come on, Allison. Don't tell me Gary's
in your league and I'm not.
Well, Gary was never in
my league to begin with.
He's more like a drunk spectator
who ran onto the field.
Gary, I'm going to be by tomorrow
to pick up Louise for golf camp.
Please rember.
Tommy's paper. Herbert hoover.
10 pages. I got it.
We're gonna take care of it.
You heard her, Tom.
I want 2 pages written
by 10:00 tonight.
And if I catch you in your room
horsing around... she's gone. Listen,
Louise, you're in charge of food.
Order meat lover's.
You can eat around the murder.
All right.
Tommy, you're in charge of beers, OK?
Imported before domestics,
bottles before cans.
If you get to a point where daddy's
drinking domestic out of a can,
tell me it's time for bed.
- Gotcha, dad.
- Hey, look.
We only doing this cause your uncle
Mitch is home and it's a big deal.
But tomorrow you got to get
started on that paper, OK?
OK, fine.
- What's so funny?
- You as a dad. It always cracks me up.
I'm a better dad
than you were a marine.
Really? I had an entire
platoon follow my every order.
- You can barely control 2 kids.
- Yeah, but you had a gun.
So you're really gonna make
me sleep on this couch?
No, you don't have to
sleep on the couch.
You can get the bottom
bunk in Tommy's room, too.
- Or I could have your room.
- You're not getting my room.
- I'll wrestle you for it.
- No. What?
- You're gonna Wrestle for it.
- We're not children. We're not gonna
Wrestle every time you don't get
your way like when we were kids.
- Give me your room.
- No, not give me my room.
- To sleep on the couch.
- Don't want the couch.
- How about the bottom bunk in Tommy's.
- I don't want the bottom bunk.
Wrestle.
You got movement at your 3:00.
Swoop in and fire.
Swoop in and fire!
It's too loud!
I got the enemy all over here.
Louise, help!
Hang on.
Let me switch to my grenade launcher.
Die, you Nazi scum!
Guys!
- Hey, Gar.
- Hi, dad.
Hi, daddy.
It's a little loud.
Sorry, hippie.
You know what else is loud?
Real war.
Louise, "die, you Nazi scum"?
Big fan of the Nazis?
Great. You probably woke
up all the neighbors.
Good job. Really...
all right!
What the hell's going on, Brooks?
It's 2 in the am.
Hey, Mr. Piscazzi. They were
playing a video game.
Excuse me.
Good evening, sir.
Staff Sergeant Mitchell Brooks.
We had an audio malfunction
with the gaming device,
- but the situation's been remedied.
- I wake up early. I watercise.
Of course you do.
Even through your robe, I can see
you pursue an intense fitness regime.
Don't worry about it. You won't be
bothered again for the rest
of the night. You have my word.
All right. You got it.
Don't worry about nothing.
Keep it down.
Great job, Mitch.
You almost got us all whacked.
- Come on, kids, go to bed, OK?
- All right.
I'm sorry, man, all right.
Kids were keeping me company.
Besides, after I woke them up,
they couldn't get back to sleep.
I'm going back to bed.
I got to work in the morning.
Since you're here.
You want help me get
through the next level? Come on.
- No. I have to go to work.
- I'll wrestle you for it.
I'm going to bed.
I can't believe you bit me.
War is hell.
Morning, dad.
I see reveille's a little
Loosey-Goosey around here.
Grab some chow.
Uncle Mitch let me
and tom cook breakfast.
Here's the thing, Mitch. We usually
don't cook breakfast in the kitchen
because of, well, this and...
I fired the cleaning lady.
I had to 'cause she divorced me.
Don't worry about it. We'll jump on KP.
As soon as we're done playing hoops.
- Let's go.
- Hey, we don't have a hoop.
We do now. Uncle Mitch Rolled
Mr. Piscazzi's over to our driveway.
You stole that guy's hoop?
Gary, I fought for the man's freedom,
all right?
I think he'd want me to have it.
Let's go!
Hey, hot stuff, wait a minute.
You got a herbert hoover report.
I have today and tomorrow, dad.
Well, OK. I don't want you fooling
around with the margins this time.
Your last report looked
like a Grocery list.
It won't be that hard.
Herbert hoover was born.
He did some stuff.
He was president. I'm already on page 6.
Hey, you guys can play for 15 minutes.
That's it.
Man.
I see you're doing the dishes.
I have a question.
Why are the kids outside
- playing basketball in their pajamas?
- 'cause they both Suck at rugby?
Gary, Louise has to be at
golf camp in 40 minutes.
I bet Tom hasn't even
start on his report.
Really?
How much would you like to bet?
- Hundred dollars.
- I was bluffing. He hasn't started.
Louise, Tom, get in here.
Gary, this is typical of you.
I'm taking tom back to my house
to make sure he'll get it done.
Time out.
This is my house, my kids, my rules.
Back off. He'll get it done.
He's playing with his uncle. Relax.
Listen, how many times
do I have to say this?
You can't have fun
until the work is done.
That's a good one, Scary Poppins.
Louise, go get ready for golf camp.
Tom, start your report.
The kids are with me.
They go by my rules.
If you'll excuse me.
Just, do what your mom said.
I'll move it back, Mr. Piscazzi.
What's that?
You're awesome.
- Hi, Allison.
- Hi.
Did you get prettier
since last night?
God, Mitch, i'm a mess.
Gary, how'd you let
this one get away?
I lit the barn on fire
and slapped her on the ass.
You know Mitch,
you got all the looks,
the charm, the brains, and, Gary,
you got to give me half
of everything you own.
I gotta go get to work
and I'm gonna bring Tommy
to make sure he finishes his report?
Don't do that.
He'll do it here.
Didn't you hear what Allison said?
He's gotta finish. It's important.
I'll make sure he gets it done. How?
You can't wrestle Tommy into writing
a report. I tried. It doesn't work.
I know how important this is.
Once I know my mission, i'm on it.
- You sure?
- It's done.
- Tom report? You'll clean the kitchen?
- Done. Done.
- Mr. Piscazzi?
- Dead.
No, just bring him
his hoop back, OK?
Right. Glad I asked.
Hey, you guys!
Here.
- This is not KFC.
- Yes, it is.
It's the new grilled chicken.
You'll like it.
It's so tender.
You can taste all
the herbs and spices.
Do you think it's, like,
five herbs and six spices?
I don't know.
Just eat it, OK?
What if it's, like, ten herbs
and one amazing spice?
I hope this conversation never ends.
Hey, Mitch, it's Gary.
Hey, Gary.
What's going on?
Tom's almost done with
the greatest report on hoover ever.
That's great.
Come on home. I picked up dinner.
We had a little car trouble.
We might not be home for a while.
I'll come pick you up.
Where are you guys?
Las Vegas.
Nevada?
People are smoking indoors and drinking
outdoors, so I'm gonna say yeah, Nevada.
Dad, god, you got here fast.
You drive really fast when your kids
have been taken across state lines.
We crossed a state line?
Yes, and when you're done
with your report on hoover,
we can start one on
the geography of the southwest.
Where's Mitch?
He's in the casino.
OK, I'm gonna go kill him.
Call the concierge, tell them I need
a big bag of lime and a shovel.
Hey, when you see uncle Mitch, tell him
we have tickets to Danny Gans, 11:00.
No, you don't. You don't have tickets
to Danny Gans at 11:00,
'cause you're gonna be in
the car with me at 11:00. And that's it!
Hey, Gar.
This is, Awkward.
We only have three
tickets for Danny Gans.
No one is going to Danny Gans, OK?
What, you called in sick to work so you
can go on a road trip Vegas with Mitch?
- Why didn't you just tell me that?
- You never would have signed off on it.
Let's not play that game, son.
I want you guys dressed and packed.
Meet me in the lobby
in 15 minutes, OK?
Fifteen minutes.
You know,
I just got back from the war.
So if you're looking to tie a yellow
ribbon around something,
I've got a few suggestions for you.
Hey. What the hell are you doing?!
Going with the ten,
that's what I'm doing.
Are you crazy,
bringing Tommy all the way out here?
I told you on the phone.
We were at home
working on his report, and the place
was all messy and depressing.
- You know?
- Whose fault is that?
Hey, it's not my fault you
divorced your hot cleaning lady.
So instead of cleaning up,
you come to Vegas?
Yeah, his report was on hoover,
so I figured hoover dam's
only a couple hours away by car.
- It's four hours away by car.
- Three, grandma.
- Here, blow on these.
- Time out. Six the hard way.
- There you go.
- Give it, give it, give it.
So you tossed my son in a car,
and you dragged him across the desert?!
We stopped in barstow for lunch.
By the way, have you had this
grilled chicken from KFC?
It was amazing.
You should have called me.
You should have called me.
It's chicken, man.
I thought I'd just tell you
the next time I saw you.
- He has a paper due.
- I know.
He's doing it.
He's just doing it in Las Vegas.
- We had a lot of fun today.
- You can't have fun
until the work is done.
- Did I just say that?
- I know I didn't.
Oh my gosh! Do you see what
you've done ou big ummy?
You've turned me into Allison.
We're leaving, now.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're leaving.
You're gonna march upstairs,
pack your bags.
- We're going home. Let's go.
- Stop yelling at me, Allison.
Don't call me Allison.
We're leaving.
You sure? 'cause I got you a room.
It's under the name "Allison."
Excuse me.
Officer.
What now?
I have it on good authority
that this prisoner
is smuggling drugs
somewhere on his person.
- Where would that be?
- In his vagina.
Give me that.
Great. Now we don't have a broom.
What happened to you, man?
You used to be fun.
I have children, Mitch, OK?
When you have children, somebody
has to be the responsible adult.
Usually that's Allison,
but when you come to town,
you act like me,
so I have to act like Allison.
- I'm just acting like me.
- You're not acting like you
you're acting like me.
Staying up past the kids' bedtime,
playing video games off time,
driving off to Vgas.
That's classic me.
You're stealing my bit.
And the worst part is,
now because you're around,
I see point of view on everything. I've
made that woman's life a living hell.
And if you ever tell her I said that,
I swear to god I will kill you.
Not if I kill you first. Which I could
do right now with anything in this room.
- No, you couldn't.
- Go ahead, find something.
- I was just looking for a paper clip.
- I know.
These your sons?
'fraid so.
Didn't believe in spanking, did you?
I thought I raised you
guys better than this.
Dad, you didn't raise us at all.
Well, then this was inevitable.
- He started it!
- He tackled me!
- He said I had a vagina. You do.
- Hey, knock it off! Knock it off.
Look at you two.
Gah, fighting like teenagers.
You should be helping each other out.
You both have been through
terrible situations.
One of you's been in a
senseless quagmire fighting
a devious enemy,
and Mitch was in a war.
You should have each other's backs.
You're family...
I'm pretty sure.
- Dad's right, you know.
- Sorry, dad. Thanks.
All right, you two can go.
Your fine's been paid.
I had to cash in
the danny gans tickets.
Sorry, grandpa.
All right. His act hasn't been the same
since his partner got eaten by a tiger.
- Dad, I'm pretty sure that Mitch,
- Why? Why? Just...
so I guess we're driving home, then.
That would be
the responsible thing to do.
It's a Shame.
Got a free hotel suite, drink coupons.
Car's not gonna be
ready till tomorrow.
It would be responsible
to drive home.
Dad, will you watch
tom for a couple hours?
'cause me and my brother
are gonna go hit the tables!
All right, i'm proud of you guys.
You know, getting out of Jail,
going out gambling together.
I can't wait to tell your sister.
We have a sister?
Yeah, you remember that peanut
Butter and Jelly, you know?
Well, it turns out I may have washed
it down with a glass of hot chocolate.
- Hey, you guys didn't Both.
- Top drawer.
Amazing.
Tommy did a really
great job on his report.
He really did. Mitch and I just took
turns staying with him in his bedroom,
making sure he didn't horse around,
and he got the job done.
This section on the hoover dam
It's almost like he was there.
That's the internet for you.
It can take you anywhere in the world.
- Great job, Gary. Thank you.
- Thank you.
This is for you.
- What is it?
- Just open it. Go ahead.
Gary. It's beautiful.
What is this for?
Just, just you put up with
a lot of stuff, so that's for you.
- It's really sweet.
- Thank you. You got it.
I'm gonna go home. Mitch and I are gonna
have a couple beers and unwind from
all the work we put in helping
Tommy with his report.
So how was danny gans?
We had to sell the tickets
so Tommy could bail us out of Jail.
- This is not over!
- It never is!

Team Subs-Addicts"
Gary, la nuit dernière a été
merveilleuse pour moi.
- Pour moi aussi.
- T'avais sûrement jamais pensé
pouvoir dormir avec une femme
sans faire l'amour.
Eh bien, après 15 ans de mariage,
c'est étonnant ce que tu peux faire
quand t'as pas le choix.
En tout cas,
j'apprécie que tu comprennes.
Il est important
qu'on ne se précipite pas,
mais ta patience sera récompensée.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui. Mais pas tout de suite.
À plus tard, et encore une fois,
merci pour la nuit dernière.
Oui. Merci à toi.
Eh bien, Mitch,
voilà une autre cliente satisfaite
par la maison de l'amour de Gary.
Cinq fois de suite.
- T'as rien eu.
- J'ai rien eu.
- Comment t'as su ?
- Je suis un marine.
Je peux entendre un éclaireur ennemi
entrer dans un trou à 200 m.
Cette nuit, j'ai pas entendu ça.
Joan est super, tu sais ?
C'est juste qu'on a eu
quelques ratés
et elle veut pas conclure
avant d'être sûre qu'on
soit fait l'un pour l'autre.
De la torture.
- Alors pourquoi t'es avec elle ?
- Elle est fantastique, belle,
c'est une maitresse d'école, elle veut
bien d'un mec divorcé
avec une ex-femme agaçante, 2 gamins
et une loque de frère
qui dort sur son canapé.
Un autre vétéran qui est traité
comme de la merde chez lui.
Eh bien, de rien pour la liberté.
Je rigole, t'es mon frère.
Ça me plaît que tu sois là.
- C'est super.
- T'as raison. J'ai un peu
mis le bazar ici. C'est le moment
de faire mes affaires et avancer...
Non. Mitch, tu vas aller où ?
La chambre de Tommy.
C'est ça ton plan ?
Avancer de 10 mètres ?
Oui.
Et si t'es disponible plus tard,
j'aurai besoin d'aide déménager,
J'adorerais,
mais je dois aller travailler.
Et grâce à Joan,
je dois prendre une douche froide.
Allison a appelé. À propos
du changement de son broyeur.
Oh mon Dieu ! J'avais oublié !
Je lui ai dit que je lui ferais ça.
Je dois aller chez Allison, mais
j'ai plus besoin de douche froide.
Plus profondément.
Retenez-le.
Maintenant...
laissez tout sortir.
Oh mon Dieu !
Plus doucement.
Oh... mon... Dieu.
Namaste.
Merci de laisser mon énergie
ne faire qu'une avec la vôtre.
Seven, je m'excuse,
je ressentais toujours ton énergie...
mais on était ailleurs
et elles n'étaient pas là. Bye.
- Bye, Seven. Merci.
- Un plaisir.
Ta maison est une oasis
de calme et de beauté.
- Un peu comme ton âme.
- Merci.
- Ça fera 200 $.
- Oh oui.
C'est juste là.
Tu sais, j'adorerais
te donner un cours particulier.
- Je pense que t'es prête.
- Je le suis. J'ai hâte.
Je suis une...
J'ai hâte.
C'est super.
Et puis après le cours,
je pourrais t'emmener prendre...
une infusion.
C'est très étrange.
Tu adores les infusions et je fais
une fête pour mon anniversaire samedi.
Viens seulement.
D'accord. Ce serait...
Ce serait un honneur d'être là
pour t'aider à fêter, quoi, tes 24 ans ?
Seven, tu es si...
dans le mille.
Jusque-là,
cette huile de jasmin est pour...
ton chakra de cœur.
Merci.
J'en ai vraiment marre
d'huiler moi-même mon chakra.
Il se passe quoi ?
T'es pas assez froide ?
Je me plains,
mais ma langue se collait là contre.
J'ai trop chaud. Je viens de finir
un cours. Tu veux quoi ?
Ce que je ne veux pas,
c'est être ici
à réparer ton broyeur.
Tu sais quoi ?
Finis-en et va-t'en. Et ne mets pas
le bazar et ne mange rien.
Après avoir vu où tu mettais
ta nourriture, c'est pas un problème.
Avançons et ajoutons "ne pas parler"
à la liste.
Pourquoi t'es si grincheuse ?
Le yoga devrait te détendre.
Je suis très détendue.
Lâche-moi.
J'ai vu ton prof de yoga
sortir de chez toi.
- Comment il s'appelle ? Neuf ?
- Seven.
Eh bien,
j'ai vu les pantalons qu'il portait.
Je pense que l'appeler "Quatre"
aurait déjà été généreux.
T'es jaloux parce qu'il est en forme
et que toi, tu es une forme.
Joan ne se plaint pas.
C'est sûrement parce qu'elle n'a pas
encore couché avec toi.
Occupe-toi de tes affaires.
Attends.
Vous n'avez encore rien fait ?
On avait pas ajouté
"ne pas parler" à la liste ?
C'était avant que je découvre que
Joan et toi n'aviez pas conclu.
Comment tu sais ?
Tu comprends rien.
Ta dernière fois, c'est quand
tu t'es assise sur tes clefs.
Ferme-la et répare le broyeur !
- D'accord. Hors de mon chemin.
- Hors du mien !
- Non, toi, hors du mien.
- D'accord.
Fais attention. Atten...
- Tu regardes quoi ?
- Rien.
- Tu regardes quoi ?
- Rien.
Oh mon Dieu.
On fait quoi ?
On devrait faire quoi, selon toi ?
Je sais pas.
D'après toi ?
- Je devrais partir. Non ?
- Tu veux partir ?
- Oui.
- Pars.
OK, je m'en vais.
- Mon Dieu, tu pars vraiment ?
- Non, je pars pas.
- On devrait en parler.
- Je pars.
J'en reviens pas qu'on l'ait fait.
Enfin, à quoi tu pensais ?
C'est de ma faute ?
Pourquoi ?
- C'est toi, l'homme.
- C'est ça.
T'avais de la glace sur les seins.
Désolée.
Mais en quoi c'est un piège ?
Tu sais que j'adore la glace
et les seins.
Tu m'as piégé.
Personne ne doit être au courant,
OK ? Personne.
C'est ça. Je vais dire à mes amis
qu'on a couché ensemble.
Ensuite, je sais !
Je parlerai de la fois où j'ai éternué
et pissé dans la file à la banque !
Je m'en vais.
- Je prends une bière.
- Y en a pas.
J'en gardais toujours une fixée
derrière la lampe en cas d'urgence.
Si j'avais su que ce serait l'urgence,
j'aurais scotché une chaise bancale
et une corde.
Que fait ton frère ici ?
J'avais oublié. Je lui ai dit
de m'amener ma clé Stillson.
Sois naturelle,
comme si rien s'était passé.
Entre.
Le voilà.
- Vous l'avez fait.
- Quoi ?!
C'est de la folie.
Dis-lui qu'il est fou.
Je me hais !
- Joli soutien, Allison.
- Désolée, mais c'est vraiment le cas !
Pourquoi tu pleures ?
C'était pas nul.
Si, ça l'était ! T'as jamais eu
beaucoup de flair pour ça.
Alors, vous vous remettez ensemble ?
Seigneur ! Non !
C'est ignoble de dire ça !
Ça va pas ? On plaisante pas
avec ça. Fais gaffe.
C'était pas une blague.
Ma question est justifiée.
Enfin, Allison vient...
de t'offrir
son plus précieux cadeau.
Il était beaucoup plus précieux
avant les deux gosses.
Ah oui ? Tu me déshabilles toujours
comme un macaque bourré.
Veuillez m'excuser,
je vais voir si j'ai des puces.
Me regarde pas comme ça !
Il s'est rien passé !
J'ai eu des rapports insignifiants
avec mon ex-femme. Fin.
Super. J'ai passé 5 ans en Afghanistan
à essayer de les convaincre
que les Américains sont pas
des tarés dépravés.
Et toi t'es là,
tu vas de lit en lit,
t'écoutes du rock
et tu portes des jeans !
L'Amérique est moins sûre
grâce à toi.
Bien joué !
Je t'ai pas entendu entrer.
Si t'étais l'ennemi,
tu pourrais pas dire ça,
car t'aurais déjà
la gorge tranchée !
C'est un vrai distributeur
de chewing-gums ?
Oui. Sers-toi.
- Tes bagages.
- Merci, Louise.
Attends.
Un petit quelque chose
pour la peine. Tiens.
- Voilà.
- Quoi ?
Tu m'as dit "sers-toi".
- Merci, oncle Mitch.
- De rien.
Alors, coloc'...
pile ou face pour le lit.
Très bien. C'est parti.
- Choisis.
- Pile.
Perdu. Bon, tu dors en bas.
- Mais j'ai même pas vu...
- Crois-moi.
- Tu dors en bas.
- Oui, chef.
Très bien. Occupe-toi des bagages.
J'ai réparé le broyeur,
je pensais que tu serais pas là.
- Je peux partir.
- Non, ça va. Tu sais quoi ?
La fête a lieu demain soir.
C'est bien que ça soit réparé.
Alors...
- Oui.
- Alors...
Écoute, j'ai beaucoup repensé
à ce qui s'est passé.
- On devrait pas en parler ?
- J'en ai pas besoin.
Mais on devrait en parler
et essayer de...
Pas besoin d'en parler,
de lire des articles dessus,
de faire un quiz sur l'intimité,
on va pas exprimer nos sentiments
avec des marionnettes
et se taper dessus avec des bâtons,
sauf si y a pas de rembourrage
et que je peux commencer.
Laisse tomber. On a fait l'amour.
On a eu tort. Fin de l'histoire.
- OK, on oublie.
- Merci !
Je pensais faire des minis quiches
pour la fête.
T'en penses quoi ?
Comment on est passés
de minis quiches...
Je sais pas. On a besoin d'aide.
C'est clair.
Merci d'être venu, Walter.
Content que tu m'aies appelé.
Tu disais avoir un problème.
J'ignore ce que c'est.
Content que notre passé compliqué
soit mis de côté pour en discuter.
Qu'est-ce qui est compliqué ?
On s'est séparés, vous êtes sortis
ensemble, on a divorcé,
vous vous êtes fiancés
et elle t'a largué.
Merci pour ce résumé des années
les plus douloureuses de ma vie.
T'as vraiment besoin de lui ?
On doit le voir pour ça ?
Oui, sauf si tu veux tout
recommencer avec un autre psy.
Non. J'en veux pas, mais
on est obligés d'avoir celui
qui a traité
les survivants du Titanic ?
Tes insultes ne m'éloigneront pas
de ma mission.
Peu importe le sujet de discussion,
je vous conseillerai
de manière strictement
professionnelle.
On a couché ensemble.
Animaux !
Animaux sales et répugnants !
Vous devriez vous faire soigner !
Soigner !
Pardon.
Vas-y, continue.
Walter, je sais que
c'est difficile pour toi,
mais tu dois nous aider
à comprendre ce qui se passe.
D'accord. C'est assez commun
pour un couple divorcé
de retomber
dans une relation physique.
C'est confortable, familier
et on n'est plus attaché.
Mais pourquoi nous ? Le sexe était
même pas bien pendant notre mariage.
Il m'a fallu une réanimation pour
comprendre la magie d'un baiser.
Vraiment ?
Tes préliminaires, on dirait
une otarie essayant jouer du klaxon.
Ne vous disputez pas pour ça.
Vous êtes intelligents, réfléchis
et vous avez compris l'erreur assez tôt.
Soyez contents de n'avoir couché
ensemble qu'une fois.
- En fait, on l'a fait 2 fois.
- Saleté !
Mécréants !
Insatiables païens pervers !
Il faudrait vous enfermer !
Vous enfermer !
- Content d'avoir revu Krandall.
- Il a l'air bien, non ?
C'est pas cool, mec !
La chaleur monte.
Pardon.
Écoute, je suis désolé.
Je vais juste me chercher une bière
et six œufs durs.
Tu vas souhaiter
n'avoir jamais commencé cette guerre.
Prépare-toi
à des attaques fulgurantes !
Attends.
C'est ma chambre, OK ?
Et ce sont mes règles.
Tu vas dormir là où je te le dis,
tu vas bouger tes sacs de là
et remplacer tous les chewing-gums.
Tout ce qui sort de mon corps
est dû au fait
qu'au lieu de burgers
tu as pris des oignons frits.
D'accord ? Pas moi, toi !
Alors mets-toi dans le lit du bas !
Je suis fier de toi, t'élever contre moi
comme ça, ça a dû te faire du bien.
Merci.
- Je prends quand même le lit du haut.
- Ça me dérange pas. Vas-y.
Comment tu t'es fait prendre
à tenir le bar ?
Je suis volontaire.
Dans l'armée,
je voyais pas beaucoup de femmes
avec des robes courtes,
alors c'est mieux
d'être derrière quelque chose.
La demoiselle
voudrait une margarita.
OK. Et Joan, tu voudrais quoi ?
C'était un peu d'humour déplacé.
Pareil. Je vais aller
voir la nourriture.
Ça doit être bizarre,
Joan et Allison dans la même pièce.
Pas du tout.
Ce soir je suis là que pour Joan.
Regarde-la. Elle est radieuse.
Allison est mon ex-femme.
On est divorcés et on va se comporter
comme un couple de divorcés normal.
Occupe-toi de tes affaires.
Voilà Allison.
- Quoi ?
- Rien, tu es super
dans le genre "qui s'accroche
désespérément à sa jeunesse".
Merci, Gary.
Tu es bien dans...
le genre "qui a culminé au lycée".
Si je vous connaissais pas autant,
je dirais qu'il y a encore un truc
entre vous, un truc de ratés.
Il n'y a rien entre nous.
Non.
Quoi qu'il y ait eu, c'est terminé.
On l'a fait, c'était super,
c'est fini, OK ?
D'accord.
Gary, tu veux goûter
une de ces minis quiches ?
Je crois être allergique.
Joyeux anniversaire. Et je t'ai...
amené un petit truc.
C'est un galet que j'ai trouvé
sur une plage de la mer Noire.
- C'est très joli. Merci.
- Eh bien, en fait, il m'a trouvé.
C'était fin juillet,
je me promenais sur...
Tu pourrais m'excuser
juste une seconde ?
Mais vraiment, j'adore la pierre.
Salut Joan. Très jolie.
Gary, je dois te parler.
Comment ça "c'était super" ?
- Quoi ?
- T'as dit que le sexe était super.
- J'ai pas dit ça.
- Si tu l'as dit.
T'as dit à Mitch, "on l'a fait,
c'était super
et c'est fini". Je veux savoir ce que
tu entendais par "super".
J'ai sûrement voulu dire
que c'était super.
Je veux dire, tu bougeais bien,
tu faisais du bruit, t'avais les jambes
agrippées à moi comme une tigresse.
Merde, Gary. C'était super.
- Pour toi aussi ?
- Oui, c'était stupéfiant.
N'élève pas la voix.
Je l'ai pas fait exprès.
Pourquoi c'était pas horrible,
comme quand on était mariés ?
C'était la première fois que j'imaginais
ta tête sur ton corps.
Pourquoi t'as pas imaginé
la tête de Seven ?
La prochaine fois.
Salut Seven. Je suis prête
pour ces cours particuliers.
Je vais regarder mon planning.
Je suis toujours libre.
Le matin, l'après-midi.
Je peux faire partir
tous ces gens en 15 minutes.
- Je dois te parler.
- Non.
Il le faut.
Viens.
- Quoi ?
- Comment ça "la prochaine fois" ?
Je voulais pas dire ça.
Crois-moi, je veux pas le refaire.
Alors pourquoi tu portes
la robe "je veux le refaire" ?
C'est pas vrai. Je porte la robe
"je veux le refaire, mais pas avec toi".
Et toi, avec la jolie veste
qui fait ressortir tes épaules
et fait croire que tu as une taille ?
Merci. Je la porte pas pour toi,
mais pour Joan.
Je porte pas ça pour toi.
Alors laisse-moi.
Laisse-moi tranquille.
C'est bon.
Je croyais que tu l'avais réparé !
J'ai pas pu ! Tu m'as traîné
dans ta chambre pour coucher avec moi !
Je t'ai traîné ?
Tu me poursuivais
comme si j'étais un biscuit.
Tu m'as sauté dessus comme un lion
saute sur un randonneur blessé.
Mon Dieu, regarde ce bazar.
Tu sais quoi ? On dirait notre mariage.
Je t'ai demandé une petite chose,
mais bien sûr, t'as pas pu la faire.
Ça peut pas se finir pareil,
parce qu'on couche ensemble.
J'arrive pas à croire que je sois ici
avec toi quand un bel homme
m'attend là-bas.
Si ça ne te dérange pas,
je vais aller voir combien de Seven
il y a dans 39.
Joyeux anniversaire
Je suis le seul à connaitre ?
Tu sais, au final,
c'était une de mes meilleures fêtes.
Jusqu'au moment où tout le monde
a appris qu'on avait couché ensemble
et où Joan m'a jeté
un verre à la figure.
La tequila te pique
toujours les yeux ?
Eh bien, je vois plus rien
de l'œil gauche,
mais du droit,
je commence à voir des formes.
Je crois que c'est toi par là.
Alors tu crois avoir encore
une chance avec Seven ?
Je m'en fiche.
Il porte une bague à l'orteil.
Et son vrai nom est Larry.
Qu'est-ce que je...
- Qu'est-ce que je pensais ?
- Tu trouveras quelqu'un.
J'ai 39 ans.
Oui, mais tu es aussi divorcée
avec deux enfants.
Pourquoi on a fini au lit,
d'après toi ?
Je sais pas.
Comme a dit Krandall.
C'est facile et familier.
C'est dur les nouvelles relations.
Oui, mais pourquoi ?
Pourquoi c'était si bon ?
Il n'y avait plus tout le poids
du mariage dessus : le prêt,
les factures, les enfants.
C'était fou et sauvage
comme au début de notre histoire,
c'est tout.
C'est exactement ça.
Si on savait que le divorce
allait être si dur,
tu crois qu'on l'aurait
quand même fait ?
Je t'épouserais et divorcerais
à nouveau.
- C'est gentil.
- Je suis un séducteur.
Mais si on veut
que ce divorce réussisse,
- on ne peut plus finir au lit ensemble.
- Plus jamais.
Tu vas réparer le broyeur ?
Tu ferais mieux d'engager quelqu'un.

"Gary Fixes Allison's Garbage Disposal"
VO By :  ¤Aka¤
Team Subs-Addicts"
Gary, last night was wonderful for me.
- It was wonderful for me, too.
- You probably never thought
you could just spend the night
with a woman and not have sex.
After 15 years of marriage,
it's amazing what you can
accomplish when it's not your choice.
Well, I appreciate you understanding.
It's important that we don't rush this,
but your patience will be rewarded.
- Really?
- Yeah. Just not right now.
OK. See you later, Gary, and again,
thank you for last night.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Well, Mitch, there goes
another satisfied customer
from Gary's house of love.
Over 5 serves.
- You got nothing.
- I got nothing.
- How did you know?
- I'm a marine.
I can hear an enemy scout sneaking
into a foxhole from 200 yards away.
Last night,
I didn't hear that.
Look, Joan's a great woman, Mitch,
you know?
It's just we had
a few missteps on our way
and she doesn't want to seal
the deal until we've really
made sure we're right
for each other. It's torture.
- So why are you hanging in there, man?
- Cause she's fantastic! She's beautiful
she's a schoolteacher, she's willing
to put up with a guy who's divorced
with an annoying ex-wife, two kids,
and a deadbeat brother
who's sleeping on his couch.
Another Veteran comes home
and gets treated like crap.
Well, you are welcome for the freedom.
I'm just kidding? You're my brother.
I love having you around.
- It's been great.
- Look, you're right. I've been kind
getting your way around here. So I think
it's time I pack my stuff and moved on.
No, no. Mitch, where are you gonna go?
Tommy's room.
That's your big plan?
You're gonna move on 20 feet?
Yeah, yeah.
And if you're available later,
I sure could use help
moving some of this stuff.
I'd love to, but I have to get to work.
And thanks to Joan,
I have to go take a cold shower.
Allison called. Something about
replacing her garbage disposal.
Oh, my gosh! I totally forgot!
I told her I would do that for her.
Now I got to go to Allison's house,
but now I don't need that cold shower.
Deeper.
Hold on to it.
Now...
Let it all out.
Oh, my god!
Slower.
Oh... my... god.
Namaste.
Thank you for letting
my energy be one with yours.
Seven, I'm sorry.
I was still feeling your energy...
but we were somewhere else
and they weren't here. Bye.
- Bye, Seven. Thank you.
- Pleasure.
Your home is an oasis
of calm and beauty.
- It's much like your soul.
- Thank you.
- That'll be $200.
- Oh, god.
I, I got that right over here.
You know, Allison, I would love
to give you a private session.
- I think you're ready.
- I'm ready. I'm eager.
I am an eager bea...
I am eager.
That's wonderful.
And then maybe after the session,
I can take you out for an...
An herbal tea.
That is so weird.
You love herbal tea, and I am having a
birthday party for myself this saturday.
Why don't you come?
All right.
It would be my...
It would be my honor to be here to
help you celebrate turning, what, 24?
Seven, you are so...
In the ball park.
Until then,
this Jasmine oil is for your...
Heart chakra.
Thank you.
I am so tired of oiling my own chakra.
What's the matter?
Aren't your girls cold enough?
For crying out loud,
my tongue used to get stuck on that.
I am overheated.
I just finished a workout, all right?
- What do you want?
- I'll tell you what I don't want.
I don't want to be here
fixing your garbage disposal.
You know what? Just
get it over with and get out, OK? And
don't make mess and don't eat anything.
After I saw where you store your food,
that's not a problem.
Let's go ahead and add "no talking"
to the list, OK?
Why are you so cranky? I thought
yoga was supposed to mellow you out.
I am very mellow, Gary.
Bite me.
I saw your yoga instructor
walking down the driveway.
- What's his name? Nine?
- Seven, Gary.
Well, I saw those pants he was wearing.
I think calling him "four"
would have been generous.
You're just jealous because
he's in shape and you're "a shape."
Well, Joan doesn't have any complaints.
Then she probably
hasn't had sex with you yet.
What do I do about this?
Wait a minute.
You guys haven't done anything?
I thought we added
"no talking" to the list.
That was before I found out
Joan and you hadn't closed the deal.
How do you know that?
You don't get anything.
The last time you had action,
you sat on your keys.
Gary, just shut up
and fix the garbage disposal!
- Fine. Stay out of my way.
- Fine! Stay out of my way!
- No, stay out of my way.
- Fine. I will.
Look out.
Watch it. Watch...
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
Oh, my gosh.
What do we do now?
What do you think we should do?
- What do you think we should?
- I think I should leave.
- Do you think i should leave?
- Want to leave? Then you should leave.
OK, I'm gonna leave.
- Oh, my god! You're just gonna leave?
- No, I'm not gonna leave.
- I think we should talk about this.
- I'm gonna leave.
Gary, I can't believe we did this.
I mean, what were you thinking?
Me? Why are you blaming it on me?
Why is it my fault?
- Hello! You're the man.
- Oh, yeah.
You had ice cream bars on your boobs.
OK, I'm sorry.
In what world is that me setting you up?
Because you know I love ice
cream and you know I love boobs.
You totally set me up.
Look, we cannot tell anybody
that we did this, OK? No one.
Right. I'm gonna run out and tell
my friends about having sex with you.
Hey! Then I know!
I'll brag about the time I sneezed
and peed a little in line at the bank!
I'm gonna go.
- What are you doing? I don't have any beer.
- Getting a beer.
Yeah, I always kept one taped up behind
the light in case of emergencies.
But if I knew this was
gonna be the emergency,
I would have taped up
a wobbly chair and a noose.
Gary, what is your brother doing here?
I forgot. I told mitch to come
by and bring me my pipe wrench.
Just act natural like nothing happened.
Come in.
Hey, here he is.
- You just did it.
- What?
That's crazy, Mitch.
Tell him he's crazy.
I hate myself!
- Way to play along, Allison.
- I'm sorry, Gary, but I really do!
What are you crying for?
I wasn't bad.
Yes, Gary, it was! You have
never been a good judge of that.
So does this mean you guys
are getting back together?
Oh, my god! No!
What a horrible, horrible thing to say!
What's wrong with you? Don't even
joke like that, Mitch. Watch it.
I wasn't trying to be funny.
It's a legitimate question.
I mean, Allison just...
Gave you her most precious gift.
Her gift was a lot more
precious two kids ago.
Yeah? You still unwrapped it
like a drunk monkey.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
i'm going to schedule myself a flea dip.
Stop looking at me like that, Mitch!
Nothing happened!
I had meaningless sex with my ex-wife.
The end.
Great. I just spent 5 years in
afghanistan trying to convince
them that Americans aren't
a bunch of decadent freaks.
And here you are, jumping bed to bed,
listening to your Rock'n'roll music,
wearing your blue jeans!
You just made America
less safe today, Gary.
Nice job!
I didn't hear you come in.
If you were an enemy combatant,
you wouldn't be able to say that,
'cause your throat would
already be slashed!
Hey, is that a real gumball machine?
Yeah.
Have all you want.
- Here are your bags, uncle Mitch.
- Thanks, Louise.
Hey, hold on a second.
Let me give you a little
something for the effort. Here.
- Here you go.
- What?
You said I could have all I wanted.
- Thanks, uncle Mitch.
- You bet.
So, roomie...
Flip you for top bunk.
All right.
Here we go.
- Call it.
- Heads.
Sorry. All right.
You got bottom.
- But I didn't even see if it was...
- Trust me.
- You got bottom.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Hop on those bags.
I just fixing the garbage disposal
'cause I knew you wouldn't be home.
- I can leave.
- No. It's good. You know what?
The party's tomorrow night.
It'll be nice to have it fixed, so...
So...
- Yeah.
- So...
Look, Gary, I've been thinking
a lot about what happened.
- Shouldn't we talk about this?
- I don't need to talk about it.
But shouldn't we just
talk about it and try...
We don't need to talk about it,
we don't need to read articles about it,
we don't need to take an intimacy quiz,
we're not gonna
act out our feelings with little puppets
or hit each other with anger sticks,
unless the padding's taken off
and I get to go first.
Just let it go. We had sex.
It was a mistake. We're done.
- OK, forgotten.
- Thank you.
So I'm thinking about having
mini quiches at my party.
What do you think?
How did we get here from "mini quiches"?
I don't know, Gary.
We need help.
Yes, we do.
Thank you for coming, Walter.
I'm happy you called me.
You said there was a problem.
I'm not sure what it is.
I'm glad we could put our complicated
past aside and discuss it.
What's complicated about our past?
Allison and I separated, you guys
started dating, we got divorced,
you guys got engaged,
and then she dumped you.
Thank you for the "Tv guide" recap
of the most painful year of my life.
You really need this guy?
We have to see Dr. Krandall about this?
Yes, Gary, unless you want to start
all over with a new therapist.
No, I don't want a new therapist, but do
we have to use the one
that did grief counseling
for the survivors of the "Titanic"?
I'm not gonna let your insults
dissuade me from my mission, Gary.
Whatever it is you want to discuss,
I will advise you
in a purely professional manner.
Gary and I slept together.
Animals! Filthy, disgusting animals!
The two of you should be fixed!
Fixed!
Excuse me.
Please continue.
OK, Walter, I know this is
difficult for you,
but, please, you have to help us
understand what's going on here.
Fine. It's not uncommon
for a divorced couple
to relapse into a physical relationship.
It's comfortable, it's familiar,
and there's no strings attached.
But why us? I mean, the sex wasn't even
good when we were married, you know?
It took me a CPR mummy to realize
how magical a kiss could really be.
Really?
Because you doing foreplay is like a
seal learning a new song on bike horns.
Look, don't beat
yourselves up over this.
You're intelligent, thoughtful
people who caught a mistake early on.
Just be grateful you
only slept together once.
- Actually, it was twice.
- Skank!
Miscreants!
Insatiable, lust-filled heathens!
You should be locked up!
Locked up!
- Good to see Krandall again.
- He looks good, doesn't he?
Dude, not cool!
Heat rises.
Sorry.
Look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, OK?
I'm just gonna go get a can of beer
and a half-dozen hard-boiled eggs.
You're gonna wish you
never started this war.
Get ready for some shock and awe!
Wait, wait.
This is my room, OK?
And these are my rules.
You're here to sleep where I tell you,
You're gonna move your bags, and you're
gonna replace every single gumball.
Anything coming out
of me is due un the fact
you took us for burgers
and you ordered onions rings.
All right? Not me, you!
So just get in the bottom bunk!
I'm proud of you, standing up
to me like that. That had to feel good.
Thanks.
- Still want the top bunk, though.
- Yeah, I'm good with that. Go ahead.
Hey, how'd you get
tricked into bartending?
I volunteered.
When I was in the military,
I didn't see a whole lot
of women in short dresses,
so I thought it'd be best
if I stood behind something.
Well, the lady would like a margarita.
OK. And, Joan, what would you like?
That's a little leatherneck
humor for you right there.
I'll have the same.
I'm gonna check out the food, OK?
This must be a little weird for you,
having Joan & Allison in the same room.
No, it's not weird at all.
Tonight is all about Joan.
I mean, look at her. She's smokin'.
Allison's my ex-wife.
We're divorced, and we're just gonna
ACT like a normal divorced couple, OK?
Just mind your own business.
Here comes Allison.
- What? Nothing.
- You look great, in a
"desperately clinging
to your youth" kind of way.
Gee, thanks, Gary.
You look nice, in a...
"peaked in high school" kind of way.
If I didn't know you, I'd say there's
something still going on between you two
in a really kind of messed up way.
There's nothing going
on between us, Mitch.
No, no.
Whatever it was before, it is over.
We did it. It was great.
It's done, OK? OK?
All right.
Hey, Gary, you want to try
one of these mini quiches?
I, think I might be allergic to those.
Happy birthday. And I...
brought you a little something.
It's a pebble I found while walking
the beaches of the black sea.
- That's very nice. Thank you.
- Well, actually, it found me.
It was late july.
I was walking along...
Hey, just could you just excuse me for,
like, one second?
But, seriously, I love the rock. I do.
Hi, Joan. Boy, you look pretty.
Gary, I need to talk to you.
- What did you mean, "it was great"?
- What?
You said the sex was great.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did, Gary.
You told Mitch, "we did it,
it was great,
and it's done." I want to know what
the hell you meant by "it was great."
I probably meant it was great, OK?
I mean, you, you moved around.
You made noise, you had your legs
wrapped around me like a cage fighter.
Crap, Gary. It was great.
- It was great for you, too?
- Yeah, It was amazing, all right?
Don't raise your voice.
I didn't do it on purpose or anything.
Why couldn't it have been awful,
like when we were married? You know,
it was the very first time
I imagined your head on your body.
Why didn't you picture
seven's head on my body?
Next time I will.
Hi, Seven.
I am ready for those private lessons.
Great. I'll check my calendar.
I'm free anytime...
You know, morning, afternoon.
I can have all these
people gone in 15 minutes.
- Hey, I need to talk to you, Allison.
- No, no.
Yeah, I do.
Hey, come here.
- What, Gary?
- What do you mean, "next time"?
I didn't mean to say that, all right?
Believe me, I don't want to do it again.
Then why are you wearing
your "i want to do it again" dress?
I'm not. I'm wearing my "i want
to do it again but not with you" dress.
And what about you, with the nice jacket
that shows off your shoulders and gives
you the illusion of a waist?
Thank you. I'm not wearing it for you.
I'm wearing it for Joan.
I am not wearing this for you, OK?
So leave me alone.
You leave me alone, all right?
I got it. I got it.
- I got it.
- I thought you fixed it!
I couldn't fix it! You kept dragging me
up to your bedroom to have sex with me!
I dragged you?
You were chasing me around like
I was made out of biscuits.
You jumped on me like a mountain lion
jumps on a hiker with a broken leg.
God, Gary, look at this mess. You know
what? This is just like our marriage.
I'd ask you to do one little thing, but
course, you can't be bothered to do it.
This can't be anything like
our marriage because we keep having sex.
I cannot believe I am in here making out
with you while there is a gorgeous man
waiting in there for me.
Now, if you don't mind, Gary,
i'm going to see how many
times seven goes into 39.
Happy birthday to you
am I the only one who knows this?
You know, all in all,
it was one of my better parties.
It was rockin', right up to the point
where everybody found out we had sex
and Joan threw a drink in my face.
Do your eyes still
sting from the tequila?
Well, the left one is
completely clouded over, so no.
But the right one,
I'm starting to see shapes out of that.
I think that's you over there, right?
So you think you still
got a shot with Seven?
Who cares?
I mean, he wears a toe ring.
And his real name is Larry, you know?
What was I...
- What was I thinking?
- You'll find a guy, Allison.
I'm 39.
Yeah, but you're also
divorced with two kids.
Why do you think we ended
up back in bed together?
I don't know.
I think it's like Krandall said,
you know? It's just easy and familiar.
New relationships are hard.
Yeah, but, why, Gary?
Why was it so good?
It didn't have the weight of the whole
marriage on it: the mortgage,
the bills, the kids.
It was just crazy and wild
and fun, like when we first
started dating, that's all.
That's exactly what it was.
So if we knew divorce
was gonna be this hard,
do you still think
we would have done it?
I would marry and divorce
you all over again.
- That is so sweet.
- I'm a charmer.
But if we have a chance of
making this divorce work,
- we can't end up in bed together.
- Never again. Ever.
Are you ever gonna fix
the garbage disposal?
You should probably just hire a guy.

Ton rencard s'est bien passé ?
J'ai attendu une heure,
elle est jamais venue.
Tu portais cette chemise ?
Elle était là.
Je dépose les enfants, salut, Mitch.
Jolie chemise, tu veux louer un scooter
et faire le tour de l'île ?
C'est marrant.
Moque-toi d'un tueur professionnel.
On verra ce qui se passera.
Tom a fait un test d'orientation.
Quand il t'en parlera,
n'aie pas l'air déçu.
Comme sur nos photos de mariage ?
Plutôt comme moi
pendant notre nuit de noces.
Regarde ça, papa.
On a fait un test à l'école
qui dit pour quel métier on est fait.
Moi, je suis fait pour travailler
dans les industries de services,
du genre serveur, barman,
ou celui qui passe
les glaçons au barman.
T'inquiète pas pour ce test.
J'en ai fait un au lycée,
je me souviens plus du résultat.
Bâtiment et travaux publics
avec un penchant pour la peinture.
Et tu as, à l'évidence,
des capacités relationnelles.
C'est génial. On a rarement
la chance de savoir exactement
ce qu'on va faire
le reste de sa vie.
Et s'il faut un uniforme,
ma décision est prise.
Serveur ? Où est le gosse qui voulait
être scientifique ou archéologue ?
À cet âge, les gosses sont assaillis
d'infos sur leur orientation.
C'est peut-être sa façon
de résister à la pression.
Mais c'est important
de ne pas s'emporter, d'accord ?
Va lui parler
pendant que je rentre pour pleurer.
C'est mieux ?

Je l'aime bien.
Je te laisse, bye.
Tu sais quoi, papa ?
Mon partenaire de hip-hop et moi
avons été choisis pour le récital.
- Génial.
- J'adore le hip-hop.
Quand j'étais en Afghanistan,
on a créé un groupe.
On s'appelait "Jala-bad".
- Tonton peut m'emmener à mon cours ?
- Sans problème.
- Allons-y.
- Attends.
Tu vas pas vraiment porter
cette chemise ?
- Je suis pas assez populaire.
- Allez.

Team Subs-Addicts"
J'ai un penchant pour serveur.
Tu savais qu'on appelle ça
"marier les ketchups" ?
Je vous déclare Heinz et Hunt's.
Vous pouvez embrasser les frites.
C'est très drôle.
Laisse pas ce test décider
de ce que tu feras de ta vie.
T'as toujours eu des rêves.
Où est passé le gosse qui voulait
être vétérinaire ou astronaute ?
Ou qui voulait être biolo...
Ça suffit avec ces bouteilles !
Allez. Ressaisis-toi.
Tu pourrais faire tellement plus
que les résultats du test.
Si quelque chose t'intéresse
vraiment, alors fais-le.
- Réalise ton rêve.
- Tu rêvais d'être peintre ?
Non. Ça payait les factures.
Mais c'était pas mon travail de rêve.
C'était quoi ?
J'ai toujours voulu animer
une émission sportive à la radio.
J'avais même un nom, écoute.
Ici Gary Brooks, et vous écoutez
"Le Score". Nous avons un appel de Tom.
Il pète un plomb, peut-être
parce qu'il est serveur.
C'est trop cool.
Tu m'en as jamais parlé.
- Pourquoi t'as laissé tomber ?
- Pardon ? Pas du tout, monsieur.
J'ai pas laissé tomber mon rêve.
Chaque jour, je fais tout
pour le réaliser.
Non ? Comment ?
Je regarde tout le temps le sport
à la TV. Une recherche très importante.
- Tu comptes le réaliser comme ça ?
- Oui, monsieur.
- Je fais d'autres trucs.
- Comme ?
Lâche-moi, d'accord. Justement,
j'allais appeler mon pote Curtis
à la station de radio à Saugus,
d'accord ?
Comment ça va ?
Je me demandais s'il y aurait
un poste pour moi,
on en avait parlé.
À la... à la radio.
Quoi ? C'est vrai ?
C'est une blague, c'est ça ? Non...
T'as compris
que c'était Gary Brooks, hein ?
Oui, sans problème. Génial.
Super. Merci beaucoup.
Je dois aller à la radio aujourd'hui
et discuter avec son patron !
Voilà, comment on fait !
T'as un rêve,
garde-le dans ton cœur et ta tête
et tu le réalises.
C'est incroyable.
Franchement, je pensais
que c'était du baratin.
Moi aussi.
Voici mon partenaire de danse,
Bradley.
Salut, ça gaze ?
Bradley est le meilleur danseur
du cours.
Son père enseigne la danse
et le mouvement à Berkeley.
Ceci explique cela.
- Je vais m'étirer.
- D'accord.
Louise dit que vous êtes un Marine.
Et pas que j'ai été décoré ?
- Bizarre.
- Mon père n'aime pas les Marines.
On est en Amérique
et ton père peut penser ce qu'il veut.
- Il est antiguerre.
- Super, tant mieux pour lui.
Il dit qu'on devrait appeler
l'hymne national "La poisse étoilée".
Laisse-moi te poser une question.
Qui protège ton père
et lui procure la liberté
de se pavaner à Berkeley
et de gagner sa vie
en enseignant le "Mouvement".
C'est qui, à ton avis ?
C'est les Marines ?
Oui, c'est eux.
Rends-moi un service.
Quand tu rentreras, demande à ton père
quelle langue il parlerait
si les soldats Américains
qui ont débarqué en Normandie
avaient été antiguerre, comme lui.
Tu peux faire ça pour moi ?
Sprechen sie deutsch ?!
- Où est Bradley ?
- Il est parti.
Je t'avais dit, pas cette chemise.
Ty Bobb, Babe Ruth...
Ces gars étaient pas des saints.
Et maintenant,
avec le dopage, vous voulez faire
de Pete Rose un exemple ?
Dans dix ans, Pete Rose sera
dans le Temple de la renommée.
On parie.
Oui. Je sais qui pariera là-dessus,
Pete Rose.
Comment ça va ?
Je vais bien, je suis très excité.
C'est génial.
T'as un appel.
- On sait pas que je suis là.
- Pas toi, lui.
T'es bien élégant, aujourd'hui.
Pas toi, lui.
Je suis un peu nerveux
de rencontrer ton patron.
Si ça se passe mal, fais semblant
de faire de l'hyperventilation
comme quand Stephanie Sheitel
t'a vu la tromper.
On peut pas discuter
avec un mec qui hyperventile.
Malheureusement, tu peux balancer
une pierre sur son pare-brise.
- Je t'emmène au bureau de Sasha.
- OK. Comment...
- Comment est cette Sasha ?
- Elle a grandi riche.
Son père possède la radio.
Elle s'y connaît pas trop,
mais elle est maline
avec des diplômes, donc attention.
Et pense à libeller ton jus d'orange,
sinon elle le boit.
Ça représente
beaucoup pour moi, merci
Si j'ai un boulot dans cette radio, ce
sera une nouvelle vie, un nouveau monde.
Assieds-toi,
je vais t'annoncer à Sasha.
Mon ami est là pour
la peinture pour la radio.
OK, Curtis, vous pouvez l'envoyer.
D'accord, merci, Paul.
Je vous rappelle.
Bonjour, merci de me recevoir.
Je suis Gary Brooks.
Bonjour. Sasha Warden.
Vous m'avez été recommandé
par Curtis, M. Brooks.
Je le connais depuis longtemps,
on jouait ensemble
au football pour...
les Toreadors Combattants
de Jefferson High !
Vous savez, l'an dernier, les Toreadors
ont fini la saison à 8 contre 1.
Bien sûr, leur seule défaite
fut sur de l'herbe synthétique.
Merci.
C'était... bizarre.
Alors, avez-vous de l'expérience ?
Aucune, mais je regarde
tout le temps du sport.
- Je parle tout le temps de sport.
- Je ne vois pas la pertinence.
La pertinence.
C'est très pertinent, un truc fou...
Vous l'utilisez comme il faut ?
Pertinent ?
D'accord,
avez-vous votre propre équipe ?
Vous voulez dire une bande ? Non.
C'est pas mon genre.
Je bosse plutôt seul,
mais je suis prêt à accepter un acolyte
s'il y a une bonne alchimie.
OK. Bon, on devrait
parler de couleurs.
Je n'aime que les blancs.
Pardon ?
Les blancs, c'est mieux au travail.
Vous savez, ils sont...
plus lumineux, plus positifs.
Les jaunes, ça va,
mais vraiment pas de foncés.
Quoi ?
- C'est un problème ?
- Oui.
Un gros problème.
Curtis est au courant ?
Je lui demanderai,
mais on a pas beaucoup de temps.
Je voudrais que la radio soit peinte
d'ici la fin du mois si possible.
Quoi ?
Je voudrais que ce soit peint
pour la fin du mois.
Est-ce irréaliste ?
Non.
Ce n'est pas du tout irréaliste.
C'est juste que là,
je souhaiterais que vous soyez raciste.
Peut-être que tu ne te vois pas
poursuivre une carrière
de couturier ou de photographe, mais
as-tu déjà pensé au fascinant
domaine de la médecine, Tommy ?
Regarde cette photo très
graphique de la syphilis. D'accord.
En fait, je pensais que si papa
allait être à la radio,
je pourrais le faire aussi.
On pourrait avoir notre émission.
Elle s'appellerait "dos amigos locos".
Comment ça s'est passé ?
T'as eu le poste ?
J'ai un travail.
Quel malentendu, il s'est avéré qu'ils
me voulaient pour peindre la radio.
- Ça se comprend.
- Mais c'est un bon boulot.
C'est un mois de travail.
Un immeuble de deux étages.
Je vais gagner de l'argent.
J'ai essayé de réaliser mon rêve.
J'ai essayé. C'est ce que tu devrais
retenir, OK ?
Je suppose, mais peut-être
que certains rêves sont irréalistes.
T'as 15 ans. Tu ne sais pas
où la vie va t'emmener, OK ?
Papa, allez.
Admets-le.
Les gens comme toi et moi
ne travaillent pas dans des radios.
On écoute la radio
pendant qu'on travaille.
Super.
Il est encore moins motivé qu'avant.
Et pourquoi serait-il motivé ?
Regarde-moi.
Je suis entourée d'un cimetière de
choses que j'ai essayées puis arrêtées.
Pourquoi tu me regardes
quand tu dis ça ?
Je sais pas comment je vais faire,
mais je vais passer à la radio
pour montrer à mon fils
que les rêves se réalisent, OK ?
Comment avons-nous fait
pour créer Louise ?
De la chance, ça arrive.
Les Munsters,
ils avaient une jolie fille.
À plus tard, papy.
Désolé d'être en retard.
Je faisais du Moonwalk en venant ici
et je faisais que m'éloigner.
- Que fais-tu ici ?
- Bradley ne dansera pas avec moi.
Sans partenaire,
je ne fais pas le spectacle.
Pourquoi il veut pas ?
Eh bien, c'est à cause de toi.
Moi ?
Tu lui as fait peur l'autre jour,
maintenant il veut plus me parler.
Il t'a traité de belliciste.
Vraiment ?
Dans le mauvais sens.
- Je vais aller lui parler.
- Attends.
Tu ne vas pas le menacer, hein ?
J'ai un truc encore plus...
attends. T'as dit le "menacer" ?
C'est ce que je vais faire.
Pardon pour le retard.
J'ai dû donner une petite leçon
au partenaire de danse de Louise.
En fait,
il connait mieux l'histoire que moi.
C'est assez frustrant,
mais je l'ai fait pleurer.
Voilà Sasha.
C'est le moment de rallumer le vieux
charme Brooks et de passer à l'antenne.
D'où êtes-vous ?
Virginie.
- Une Hokie ?
- Hokies !
- Je ne sais pas ce que c'est.
- Virginia tech. Hokies.
Vous avez fini
15e du pays l'an dernier.
En fait, j'étais à Oberlin.
On a pas d'équipe, je crois.
Si, vous avez les Yeomen.
Fightin'Yeomen !
Tu peux t'assurer que ce fax passe ?
J'ai un déjeuner d'affaires.
Attendez. Écoutez.
Je vais être honnête.
Petite confusion.
Quand je suis venu pour un job,
je pensais venir pour un boulot
à l'antenne.
Voilà pourquoi je portais un costume
et que je parlais comme ça
tout le temps.
C'est embarrassant.
Je me suis senti vraiment idiot.
Pour moi, je veux dire.
C'est beaucoup demander, mais j'ai dit
à mon fils que je passerais à l'antenne.
Vous pourriez m'aider.
J'entre, je lis une pub,
Juste dire 2 mots, quelque chose,
n'importe quoi. Vous pouvez m'aider.
Désolée.
Je ne peux pas le permettre.
Et ne demandez pas à nouveau.
C'est très gênant pour moi.
Désolé, mec.
Je savais pas que tu parlais
d'un boulot à l'antenne !
C'est bon, Curtis,
j'ai entendu ce que je voulais.
Penser que Tommy m'entendrait à la radio
m'a trop excité.
Je te paie un burger.
Désolé, je me sens mal.
Tu dois pas rester ?
Non, l'émission est préenregistrée,
je peux partir.
Alors, laisse-moi lire quelque chose,
une pub, n'importe quoi.
- Je lirai l'annuaire.
- Je sais pas.
- Je sais pas...
- Laisse-moi te dire quelque chose.
Je te l'ai jamais dit,
mais il est temps.
Au lycée,
l'entraîneur Willis m'a dit
"désolé, je vire ton pote Curtis
de l'équipe de foot".
Et je lui ai dit
"si vous virez Curtis,
vous perdez me perdez". Je me suis battu
pour toi, tu m'en dois une.
C'est vrai ?
Willis était
notre entraîneur de foot.
- Bon, d'accord. Vas-y.
- Ouais ! T'es sérieux ?
Mitch, appelle Tommy,
qu'il allume la radio.
J'appelle Tommy !
Voilà, tu peux faire
le résumé des Dodgers.
Lis la feuille
et parle dans le micro, compris ?
Ouais, d'accord.
Je devrais savoir autre chose ?
- T'y es.
- Quoi ?
Non, je me fous de toi.
Fais pas ça, c'est horrible
et pas drôle.
Je fais le décompte
depuis la cabine,
quand je te montre du doigt,
c'est bon.
Je suis Gary Brooks
et c'est le résumé des Dodgers.
Matt Kemp est revenu pour le 2e
match consécutif pour aider les Dodgers
à balayer les Cardinals
et augmenter leur avance
sur la ligue nationale ouest de 5 jeux.
Voilà pour les Dodgers,
passons aux WNBA.
Ils ont décidé d'attirer
plus de fans en abandonnant le "W".
Concernant le hockey, tout
le monde déteste toujours le hockey.
WNBA ?
Hockey ? Je t'ai dit de lire.
Ça va pas la tête ?
Je vais être viré.
- Désolé, j'essayais d'être drôle.
- Je me fous de toi.
C'était trop marrant,
c'est inné chez toi, t'as bien fait.
- Merci.
- On a un appel.
Hello. KPPQ.
Bien sûr.
Ton fils.
Tu veux répondre à l'antenne ?
Tu rigoles ?
Oh mon Dieu,
c'est un rêve devant réalité.
Appuie sur ce bouton
quand je te montre du doigt.
Oh mon Dieu.
Bougez, monsieur.
Je fais 100 kg.
Et toi, 40 kg ?
45, maximum.
Merci.
C'est trop gentil.
Maintenant, écartez-vous !
Sortez de la cabine, tout de suite.
Mon fils est en ligne, laissez-moi
prendre cet appel. Après j'arrête.
Je vous vire si vous le faites.
Retour du résumé des Dodgers,
je suis Gary Brooks.
On a un appel,
Dodger Tom à Santa Monica.
Comment ça va ?
T'as pensé quoi du match ?
C'était bien. Papa, t'es à l'antenne,
trop cool !
C'était Dodger Tom avec un avis
intéressant sur le match.
C'était le résumé des Dodgers.
Je suis Gary Brooks
et je suis à l'antenne !
On a tout remballé,
on sera partis dans 5 minutes.
- Merci.
- Écoutez.
Je sais pas qui vous allez engager
pour finir le travail,
mais voilà la carte d'un gars
que je vous recommande.
C'est votre carte.
Je suis déjà là.
- Au revoir, M. Brooks.
- Écoutez, Sasha,
j'ai fait cela, car mon fils
est rentré de l'école
heureux d'être serveur toute sa vie,
je voulais passer à la radio
pour lui montrer qu'il pouvait essayer,
qu'il pouvait être plus que moi.
C'est la seule raison.
C'est sympa.
Mon père n'a jamais
tenté de m'inspirer.
J'ai dû le supplier pour un boulot
dans l'affaire familiale
et il m'a coincée ici,
dans cette radio pourrie
où, si j'échoue, on ne remarquera pas.
Je me sens mal.
- Toujours viré ?
- Bien sûr.
Mal pour moi,
d'avoir grandi avec un père sans cœur.
Ça va aller ?
Perdre un boulot à la dernière minute ?
Tu rigoles ? L'économie explose
ces temps, je vais trouver.
Je me sens mal, je...
comme cette fois où Stephanie
Sheitel t'a vu la tromper.
Ouais, c'est vrai.
C'était horrible.
Mais ça, c'est pire.
- Il se passe quoi ? Ça va ?
- De l'hyperventilation.
Ça arrive quand son monde
s'effondre autour de lui.
- On peut faire quelque chose ?
- Vous avez un sac en papier ?
- Voilà, j'ai un sac.
- Donnez-le-moi.
Bon, ça marche pas.
On appelle une ambulance ?
Non, il doit entendre
une bonne nouvelle.
Je vais à Aspen à Noël.
Bonne nouvelle dans sa vie.
Bien.
Il peut rester
et peindre la station.
- Merci. Allons manger ce burger.
- Super.
Merci.
Vous savez,
je ne demande pas beaucoup.
Restez loin du micro
et mettez une ceinture
ou remontez vos pantalons
en peignant les plinthes.
Vous l'avez mérité.
Regarde qui j'ai trouvé.
Papa, c'était génial.
Mes potes écoutaient,
je suis célèbre maintenant.
On avait une bonne alchimie.
Tu penses quoi d'une émission
appelée Dos Amigos Locos ?
"Deux potes fous",
qui n'écouterait pas ça ?
Hé Tommy, tu veux des trucs gratuits
de la radio ?
Oui.
Une paire de caleçons
disant "parlez dans le micro" ?
Je suis fière de toi.
Tommy est si excité,
t'es enfin passé à la radio.
Tu vois ?
Tu m'avais parlé de ça une fois.
Même si, à l'époque,
t'essayais juste de venir dans mon lit.
Pour être honnête, c'était
un des plus beaux moments de ma vie.
Venir dans mon lit ?
Non, passer à la radio.
Ça, ça a pas été facile.
Ouais, tu sais quoi ?
Toi non plus t'avais par l'air dur.
On avait bu toute la journée
au barbecue.
Désolé pour Bradley, je pensais
qu'il écouterait la voix de la raison.
T'es prêt ?
Toujours fidèle.
Team Subs-Addicts"
How was your blind date?
I waited in the coffee shop for an hour.
She never showed.
Were you wearing that shirt?
She was there.
I'm dropping off the kids.
Hi, Mitch.
Nice shirt. You wanna rent scooters
and drive around the island?
That's a fun game.
Make fun of the trained killer.
We'll see how that one turns out.
Look, Gary,
Tom took a career aptitude test today.
Now, when he tells you about it, just
don't have a disappointed look
on your face?
Like the one I had in
our wedding photos?
More like the one I had
on our wedding night.
Sheck it out, dad.
We took this test at school that tells
you what you should do for a living.
Mine said I'd be perfectly suited
for a career in the service industry,
like waiter, a bartender,
or guy who hands ice to the bartender.
Don't worry about this test, Tom.
I took this test in high school.
I don't even rember what I got on mine.
Construction and maintenance,
with an emphasis on painting.
And you obviously got
people skills. Why...
But I think it's great. I mean,
how often do you get to know exactly
what you're gonna do
for the rest of your life?
And if one of those jobs
comes in a uniform,
my decision-making days are over.
 What happened to the kid that
wanted to be a scientist or an archaeologist?
I don't know. The kids are bombarded
with all this career stuff at this age.
I think it's just his way of,
you know, handling the pressure.
But the important thing is is
that we don't overreact to this, OK?
So you go talk to him
while I go home and cry.
Is this better?
Tabascos of the world button-down.
I like it, Mitch.
I gotta go. Bye.
Hey, guess what, dad.
My dance partner and I got chosen
for the recital in my hip-hop class.
- Great.
- Hey, I love hip-hop.
When I was stationed in Afghanistan, a
few of us tried to get a crew together.
We called ourselves jala-bad.
- Can uncle Mitch take me to practice?
- It's fine with me.
- Let's do it.
- Wait.
You're not really going
to wear that shirt.
- I'm not that popular as it is.
- Go.

"Gary Has a Dream"
VO By :  ¤Aka¤
Team Subs-Addicts"
Hey, I think I'm leaning towards waiter.
Did you know they call
this "marrying ketchups"?
I now pronounce you heinz and hunt's.
You may kiss the fries.
That's really funny, Tom.
Don't let that test dictate what you're
gonna do for the rest of your life.
You always had such big dreams. What
happened to the kid I knew that wanted
to be a veterinarian or
a rocket scientist?
Or you wanted to be a biologi... that's
enough with the bottles now, please!
Come on, Tommy.
You gotta snap out of this.
You could do so much more than what
that test is telling you, Tom.
If there's something else you really
are into, you should go for it.
- Pursue your dream.
- Was it your dream to become a painter?
No. Painting was a way to pay the Bills,
but, you know, it wasn't my dream job.
So what did you wanna be?
I always wanted to have my own a.m.
Sports radio show.
I even had a name for it.
Check this out.
I'm Gary Brooks, and this is the score.
We got dodger Tom Callin' in.
He's mad as heck.
Maybe it's because he's a waiter.
That's really cool.
I never knew about that.
- So why did you give up on your dream?
- Excuse me? No, sir.
I did not give up on that dream.
I'm out there every day hoofin' it,
tryin' to make that dream happen, Tom.
Really?
How?
I watch sports on Tv all the time,
right? That's valuable research.
So that's how you're trying
to make it happen?
- I do other stuff, too you know.
- Like what?
Get off my back, Tom, all right?!
It just so happens
I was gonna call my friend Curtis down
 at the a.m. Radio station
down in saugus, OK?
What's up? Yeah, look,
I was wondering if there was any,
opportunities for me, you know,
we talked about it once...
Down there at the...
At the radio station.
What?
There is?
You're kidding me, right?
No you...
No you know this is Gary Brooks, right?
Yeah. I could do that. That's great.
Good. Great. Thank you very much.
I'm supposed to go down to the station
today and talk to his boss, Tommy!
That's how you do it.
You get a dream,
keep it in your heart and your head,
and you make it happen for yourself.
This is unbelievable.
You know, to be honest,
I thought you were full of crap.
So did i.
Uncle Mitch, I want you to
meet my dance partner, Bradley.
Hey, Bradley.
'sup?
Bradley is the best
dancer in our whole class.
His dad teaches
danceandmovement at Berkeley.
Well, that would explain it.
- I'm gonna go stretch out.
- All right.
So Louise says you're a marine.
She didn't tell you I was decorated?
- That's weird.
- My dad doesn't like the marines.
Well, this is America,
and your dad's entitled to his opinion.
- He's anti-war.
- Terrific. Good for him.
He says our national anthem should
be called the star-spangled bummer.
Let me ask you a little question there.
Who do you think it is that provides
your dad with the freedom and protection
to prance around Berkeley
and actually make a living
teaching a class called "movement"?
Who do you think that is?
Think that's the marines, Bradley?
Yeah, I think it's the marines.
Do me a favor, Bradley.
When you get home tonight, ask your dad
what language he'd be speaking right now
if the American soldiers who stormed
the beaches at Normandy
had decided to be anti-war like him?
Can you do that for me, Bradley?
Sprechen sie deutsche?!
- Were did bradley go?
- He ran away.
I told you not to wear that shirt.
Ty cobb, babe ruth...
These guys were no saints.
And now,
with all the steroids, you're gonna
make an example out of Pete Rose?
In 10 years,
Pete Rose will be in the hall of fame.
You could bet on it.
Yeah. I know who'll take that bet.
Pete Rose.
How you doin', man?
I'm doin'good. I'm real excited
about this. This is great.
- You got a call on line 2.
- Nobody knows I'm here.
Not you. Him.
Hey, you lookin' sharp today, man.
Not you. Him.
Look, I'm Kinda nervous
about meeting your boss.
Hey, if things go south,
just pretend to hyperventilate
like you did when Stephanie Sheitel
caught you cheating.
Yeah. You can't argue with
a guy who's hyperventilating.
Unfortunately you can put
a brick through his windshield.
- I'll walk you over to Sasha's office?
- OK. What's...
- What's this girl Sasha like?
- You know, grew up rich.
Daddy owns the station.
Doesn't know much about radio,
but she has a smarty-pants, Fancy degree
so watch out for the S.A.T. Words.
And make sure to mark your orange juice
in the fridge, or she will drink it.
I gotta tell you this means a lot to me.
Thank you.
If I get a job here at a radio station,
it's a new life, it's a different world.
Have a seat,
and i'll tell Sasha you're here.
My buddy's here to talk
to you about painting the station.
OK, Curtis, you can send the guy in.
All right, thank you, Paul.
I'll get back to you on that.
Hi. Thanks for seeing me.
I'm Gary Brooks. Hello.
Hi. Sasha Warden.
You come very highly recommended
from Curtis, Mr. Brooks.
I've known Curtis a really long time,
ever since we played football
together for...
Fighting toreadors of Jefferson high!
You know, the toreadors last year,
they finished their season 8 and 1.
Of course,
their only loss was on astroturf.
Thank you.
That was...
Weird.
So, how much experience do you have?
None, really, but,
I watch sports all the time.
- I talk about sports constantly.
- I don't see how that's Germane.
It's Germane.
It's incredibly Germane, crazy Ger...
Are you using the word the right way?
Germane?
All right, so,
do you have your own crew?
You mean like a posse? No.
It's not my style.
I'm more of like a one-man type thing,
but I'm open to bringing in a Sidekick
if there's good chemistry.
OK. Well, we should talk about color.
I only like whites.
Excuse me?
Whites, they're just
better in the workplace.
You know, they're...
They're brighter.
They're more positive.
Yellows, yellows are OK,
but definitely no darks.
Are you serious?
- Is that a problem for you?
- Yes, that a problem for me.
It's a big problem for me.
Does Curtis know about this?
I'll run it by him,
but we don't have a lot of time.
I would like the station painted by
the end of the month if that's possible.
What?
I would like it painted
by the end of the month.
Is that unrealistic?
No. It's not unrealistic at all.
It's just right now,
I really wish you were a racist.
OK, so maybe you can't see
yourself pursuing a career in
sewing or painting or photography, but
but have you ever considered the
fascinating field of medicine, Tommy?
I mean, look at this very, very
graphic photo of syphilis. All right.
Actually I was thinking if
dad's gonna be on the radio,
maybe that's something I could do, too.
You know, we can have our own show.
We could call it
dos amigos locos.
Hey, how did it go?
Did you get the job?
I got a job, son.
What misunderstanding it turns out they
wanted me to paint the radio station.
- That makes sense.
- But it's a good job.
It's a month of work. It's a 2-story
building. It's gonna take a while.
I'll make some good money.
The point is I went for my dream.
I went for it. That's what you
should take away from this, OK?
I guess, but maybe some
dreams are just unrealistic.
You're 15 years old. You don't know
where your life's gonna go, OK?
Dad, come on.
Let's face it.
Guys like you and me don't have
jobs like being on the radio.
We listen to the radio
while we're at our jobs.
Well, this is great.
I mean, he's less motivated than ever.
And why would he be motivated?
I mean, look at me.
I'm surrounded by a virtual graveyard of
things I've tried and lost interest in.
Why'd you look at me when you said that?
Look, I don't know how I'm gonna
do this, but I'm gonna get on the radio,
and I'm gonna show my son
that dreams do come true, OK?
How in the world did
we ever create Louise?
It's a fluke, but it happens.
The munsters,
they had that pretty daughter.
I'll see ya, grandpa.
Sorry I'm late. I was doin' the Moonwalk
on the way over here,
and I just kept gettin' further away.
- What are you doin' out here?
- Bradley won't dance with me.
And if I don't have a partner,
i'm out of the recital.
Why won't he dance with you?
Well, it's because of you, uncle Mitch.
Me?
Yeah. You scared him the other day,
and now he won't even talk to me.
He called you a warmonger.
He did?
He meant it in a bad way.
- I'm gonna to talk to him.
- Wait. Wait.
You're not going
to threaten him, are you?
I've got something even more...
Wait. Did you say, "threaten"?
Yes. That's what i'm gonna do.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Had to give Louise's dance
partner a little history Lesson.
Turns out he actually knows
more history than I do.
It's kind of frustrating,
but I still made him cry.
There is Sasha.
Time to turn on the old Brooks charm
and get myself on the air. Nice.
So where are you from?
- Virginia.
- You a hokie?
Hokies!
- I don't know what that means.
- Virginia tech. Hokies.
You guys finished
15th in the country last year.
Actually I went to oberlin.
I don't think we had a sports team.
- Yeah, you did. The Yeomen.
- Fightin' Yeomen!
Curtis, will you make sure
this fax goes through?
I've got a lunch meeting.
Hey, wait, wait. Listen.
OK, I'll be honest with you.
Little mix-up.
When I came in here for a job,
I thought I was comin' in for a job
as an on-air sports guy.
That's why I was wearing a suit
and that's why I was talking like this
the whole time.
How embarrassing.
Felt like a complete idiot
sitting in there.
No. I mean for me.
I know it's asking a lot, but... I Kinda
told my son I was gonna be on the air.
You could help me out.
I'll go in. I'll read a commercial,
just a call letter, something, just
anything at all. You can help me out.
I'm sorry.
I can't allow that.
And please don't ask again.
It's very uncomfortable for me.
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't know you were talkin'
about on-air work when you called.
That's OK, Curtis.
I just heard what I wanted to hear.
I got so excited at the thought
of Tommy hearing me on the radio.
Let me take you out for a burger. I'm
sorry. I just feel bad about all this.
Don't you have to stay in the booth?
No. We got a prerecorded show.
I can skip out anytime I want.
Then let me go in there read something.
I could read a commer anything.
- I'll read the call letters.
- I don't know, man.
- I don't know. I stand with Sasha yet.
- Let me tell you something, Curtis.
I never told you this before,
but it's time you know.
When we were in high school,
coach willis told me,
"sorry, I'm cuttin' your friend Curtis
from the football team."
And I told coach Willis,
"if you cut Curtis,
you lose your star quarterback, Brooks."
I stood up for you, man. You owe me.
Is any of that true?
Yes. Coach willis was
our football coach.
- All right, man. Get in here. Come on.
- Yes! Are you serious?
Mitch, call Tommy.
Tell him to put on the radio.
Callin' Tommy!
Here. OK,
you can do the dodger wrap-up.
Just read what's on the paper
and talk into the mike. Got it?
Yeah. OK,
is there anything else I should know?
- You're on.
- What?! Now?!
No, I'm just messin' with you, man.
I'm playin'.
Don't do that. That's horrible.
That's not funny.
I'm gonna count you
in from the engineer booth,
and when I point to you, you're on.
I'm Gary Brooks,
and this is the dodger wrap-up.
Matt Kemp homered for the second game
in a row to help the Dodgers
sweep the Cardinals
and extend their lead
in the national league west to 5 games.
So that's what the Dodgers are doing.
Let's move on to the WNBA.
They've decided to attract
more fans by dropping the "W."
And moving on to hockey,
everybody still hates hockey.
WNBA?
Hockey? I told you to read
what was on the paper.
What is wrong with you?
I'm probably fired.
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to be funny.
I'm just messin' with you, man.
I'm just messin' with you.
Hey, man. Hey, that was hilarious, dude.
You're a natural. You did great.
- Thanks.
- Hey, we got a call.
Hello. KPPQ.
Sure. Hold on.
It's your son.
You wanna take this call on the air?
Are you kidding me?
Oh, my gosh.
This is literally a dream come true.
Push the caller button
when I point to you. Hockey.
Oh Boy.
Move it, mister.
I'm 235.
What are you, a buck?
Buck-o-5 tops.
Thank you.
That's so sweet.
Now get out of the way!
Get out of the booth now.
My son's on the line. Let me just take
this one phone call. I'll be done.
You do, and you're fired.
Welcome back to dodger wrap-up.
I'm Gary Brooks.
We got a caller on the line.
We got Dodger Tom in Santa Monica.
How you doin' there?
What'd you think of the game last night?
It was good. Dad, you're on the air.
How cool is that?
That was Dodger Tom with an interesting
take on the game last night.
This has been Dodger wrap-up.
I'm Gary Brooks,
and I'm on the air!
This is pretty much the last of our
stuff. I'll be out of here in 5 minutes.
- Thank you.
- Look.
I don't know who you're planning
on hiring to, finish the job,
but here's the business card
of a guy I could recommend.
This is your card.
I could start right away.
- Good-bye, Mr. Brooks.
- Look, Sasha,
the only reason I did what I did is
'cause my son came home from school
happy to be a waiter
for the rest of his life,
I just wanted to get on the radio to
show him he could shoot for something,
he could be more than what
I amounted to be.
That's the only reason I did it.
That's nice.
You know, my father never
cared about inspiring me.
I had to beg him for a job
in the family business,
and he stuck me here
in this nothing radio station
where if I screw up, no one'll notice.
Now I feel bad.
- Am I still fired?
- Of course.
I feel bad for me growing
up with a heartless father.
You gonna be OK, man,
losing this job at the last minute?
You kidding me? The economy's booming
right now. I'll pick something up.
I just feel bad. I...
Like that time when stephanie
sheitel caught you cheating.
Yes. Yes, that's right.
That was horrible.
But this is much worse.
- What's going on? Are you OK?
- He's hyperventilating.
It's what happens when he thinks his
whole world is falling apart around him.
- Is there something we can do?
- You got a paper bag or something?
- Here. No, I got a purse.
- Gimme the purse. Gimme the purse.
OK. That's not working.
Should we call an ambulance?
No, but he just needs to hear
a little bit of good news right now.
I'm going to aspen for Christmas.
Good news in his life.
Fine.
He can stay and paint the station.
- Thank you. Let's get that burger.
- All right.
Thank you.
You know, I don't ask for a lot,
Mr. Brooks.
Just stay away from the microphone
and either get a belt
or pull up your paints
when you're painting the baseboards.
You've earned that.
Hey. Look who I found.
Dad, That was awesome.
My friends were listening.
We're, like, famous now.
I thought we had pretty good chemistry.
What do you think about
a show called dos amigos locos?
"Two crazy friends."
Who wouldn't listen to that?
Hey, Tommy, you want some free
stuff from the radio station?
Sure.
How about a pair of underwear that says,
"speak into the mike"?
I'm really proud of you, Gary.
Tommy is so excited.
I mean, you finally got on the radio.
You know?
I remember you talking
about that dream once.
Although at the time, I think you
were just trying to get into my pants.
I be honest with you. That was probably
one of the greatest moments of my life.
Getting in my pants?
No, getting on the radio.
Getting on the radio wasn't easy.
Yeah. Yeah, you know what?
You didn't seem that hard yourself.
We'd been drinking all day
at the barbecue, rember?
I'm sorry about Bradley.
I really thought he'd listen to reason.
- Are you ready to do this?
- Semper fi.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Les enfants !
Vos déjeuners sont prêts.
Que fais-tu ?
Je retourne à la base la semaine
prochaine, alors j'envoie des affaires.
- Pourquoi ? Je vais te manquer ?
- Oui, mais t'inquiètes pas.
Je vais trouver un tout petit chien
pour que les voisins
continuent de penser qu'on est gays.
OK, il me faut encore
des chaussettes, du déodorant,
et un carton de sauces à salade
Dottie Lane.
- De la sauce à salade ?
- Ce truc est incroyable.
Une bouteille
dans une cave afghane
fait sortir les insurgés les mains
en l'air, fourchette et
bol à la main.
Vous êtes prêts ?
Voilà.
J'ai eu ma première
leçon de conduite aujourd'hui.
Bientôt je te conduirai
à l'école, Louise.
J'arrête avec mes questions
et je choisis une religion.
Je suis si excité.
Avec la conduite vient la liberté,
l'indépendance et bien sûr, les filles.
Tu viens de résumer pourquoi
je me suis engagé dans les marines...
Ça et faire exploser des trucs.
Salut ! Gary, écoute.
Howard est ici, on commence
juste à se voir et je l'apprécie,
alors ne fais pas
cette blague sur la poigne ferme
qui sera pratique quand
il portera mes bagages, OK ?
Non, c'est... C'est important.
Je vais enfin rencontrer le type
qui pourrit mes enfants
avec des loges au match des Dodgers,
des vêtements chics,
des vélos neufs.
Il vient par la porte,
ou par la cheminée ?
- Bonjour, Louise.
- Bonjour.
Howard,
voici Gary et son frère Mitch.
Gary, j'ai entendu...
des choses sur toi.
C'est une poigne ferme.
Tu sais, ça doit être...
Il venait nous chercher,
pour déposer les enfants à l'école
et puis aller à Malibu prendre
le petit-déjeuner sur son bateau.
Manger sur un bateau ça va,
mais je peux pas amener ma cuisse
de dinde sur le bateau Disney ?
Non, mais on dirait que tu peux
la cacher derrière une poubelle
et la finir après l'attraction.
Les enfants, à l'école.
Attendez un peu. Tom, Louise,
j'ai un cadeau pour vous, un truc que
vous pouvez garder chez votre père.
En fait, ça va.
Les enfants on plein de...
C'est la console de jeu
numéro un en Amér...
Je voulais être sensible
à la situation de divorce,
alors je vous en ai pris une pour ici,
et une pour chez votre mère.
Cool, le jeu "Sport Resort".
On peut sauter en parachute sur une île
et rejoindre d'autres parachutistes
en formation.
- Vous auriez pas les...
- Schwing !
L'épée pour les jeux d'escrime !
Oh, mon Dieu.
Merci, mais c'est vraiment pas...
nécessaire.
Ils ont plein de jeux.
Je dois dire non à tout ça.
Je suis désolé.
Que fais-tu ?
Tu m'embarrasses.
Non. C'est ma faute, Gary.
Je m'excuse. J'aurais dû demander.
Pas besoin de tout remballer.
Je les déposerai
chez vous plus tard.
- Merci, Mitch.
- À plus tard.
On va bien s'amuser.
- Je parlais à mes enfants.
- Toi aussi, alors.
- Je fais la première partie.
- Oui, non.
Tu la feras quand il couchera
avec ton ex-femme.

VO By : ¤Aka¤
Team Subs-Addicts"
T'arrives à croire ce mec ?
Il connait mes enfants depuis 3 semaines
Il leur achète des jouets
que j'aime plus qu'eux.
Tu t'énerves pour rien.
C'est une super console de jeu.
Tu peux jouer au tennis de la meilleure
façon qu'il soit, sur ton canapé...
avec une bière et des tacos.
Tu sais ce qu'il fait, hein ?
Il essaie d'acheter les enfants.
C'est que des cadeaux.
Laisse-moi te raconter une anecdote.
Mais oui.
Un frère peut dire "anecdote."
Il y a quelques années,
je sortais avec une femme, Viv,
et elle avait 3 enfants,
2 garçons et 1 fille.
C'est pour ça que je t'ai jamais demandé
de faire du baby-sitting. Continue.
Je l'aimais bien,
alors il fallait que
ses enfants m'aiment, et donc,
je leur ai acheté une machine à popcorn,
une belle avec le beurre.
Ça a vraiment fait hérisser
les plumes de l'ex-mari,
mais les enfants étaient si contents
qu'ils me voulaient tout le temps.
J'allais les chercher à l'école,
leur acheter des vêtements,
leur parler des cigognes
et des choux.
Et assez vite,
comment ils m'appelaient ?
L'accusé ?
"Papa".
Je te le dis,
si tu veux pas qu'il achète l'amour
de tes enfants, faut le surenchérir.
Pas besoin.
Il a acheté que mon amour.
Curtis, tu pourrais retourner ça
à la collecte d'Al Gore pour moi ?
C'est moi plus un.
Sasha, trouve
un assistant pour ces trucs.
S'il te plaît. Mon père est en ville
et je suis vraiment stressée
parce que lui et moi avons
une relation difficile.
Mon père et moi, pas Gore et moi.
Moi et Gore, ça va.
Je peux faire autre chose pour toi ?
Une manucure/pédicure ?
Un massage ?
Te chercher une robe ?
Je ne te demanderais jamais
de faire une chose comme ça,
mais comme tu le proposes,
merci beaucoup. Tu es un sauveur.
Je peux poser une question personnelle ?
Bien sûr, mec que j'ai rencontré y a
2 semaines et qui peint la radio.
C'est ça. OK,
quand ton père t'achète plein de trucs,
ça te fait l'aimer plus ?
Vous avez vu ? On ne peut pas
acheter l'amour de vos enfants.
Ce qui compte,
c'est d'être un bon père.
Crois ce que tu veux, mais tout ce que
j'ai fait est d'acheter M. Popcorn
et maintenant, d'après ma tasse à café,
je suis le meilleur père du monde.
Ta tasse dit :
"Female Body Inspector."
Je le suis aussi.
Jeu, set et match.
Bien joué, Télé.
Ça va ?
C'était comment l'auto-école ?
L'auto-école ?
C'était... c'était bien.
Je veux dire, c'était...
C'était horrible.
Ils nous ont montré une vidéo
sur les dangers de la route et puis
il y avait tellement de sang...
et de cris, et puis...
ils ont montré ce mec coupé en deux.
Je veux pas être coupé en deux.
Je suis à l'âge où j'apprends
ce que ma moitié peut faire !
D'accord. Viens là. Assieds-toi.
J'ai déjà vu ça au combat.
On voit des trucs horribles,
qu'on peut pas oublier.
Ce qu'il faut,
c'est remonter en voiture avant que
le trauma s'imprime dans ton cerveau.
OK ? Sinon, tu vas toujours
associer la conduite au sang.
Tout ce que j'ai entendu,
c'est "trauma",
"cerveau" et "sang".
Écoute-moi, d'accord ?!
T'as pas le choix !
Soit tu tues la bête,
soit c'est la bête qui te tue !
Tu veux pouvoir fermer les yeux
sans voir le petit torse de Tommy
courir sans jambes ni bras ?
Oui, je le ferai.
J'affronterai la bête. Je le ferai.
Bien. Je vais me chercher
du fromage.
- Mince.
- Ça va ?
Mon ongle.
Il s'est retourné comme
un couvercle de yaourt.
Regarde. On voit mon sang gicler
à chaque battement de cœur.
Mon Dieu.
C'était bien, le festival de l'ail ?
J'ai rien dit. Je le sens d'ici.
Génial. D'abord, on a fait
4 heures de route.
C'était super. Et on a dégusté
de la nourriture à l'ail.
Du pain, du fromage
et de la glace à l'ail.
Et la glace à l'ail ?
C'était excellent.
C'était trop dégueu.
Pourquoi mettre une gousse d'ail
à la place de la cerise ? On a pigé.
Et les badauds ? C'était pas bien ?
Oui, le mec déguisé en bulbe d'ail
m'a reluquée
et m'a demandé
si je faisais de la muscu.
Ça aurait pu arriver n'importe où.
À un festival de l'ail.
Sur un yacht privé.
Là où les riches vont.
- Quoi ?
- Les emmener à un festival gratuit
n'a rien à voir avec Howard,
pas vrai ?
Non. Je veux que mes enfants sachent
qu'on peut s'amuser sans dépenser.
Howard veut juste
que les enfants l'apprécient
et je l'aime vraiment bien
alors tu peux lui laisser une chance ?
Non, car il arrête pas de gâter
mes enfants et j'ai essayé
de modérer leurs envies
pendant des années.
Ce mec va tout gâcher
en leur offrant tout ce qu'ils veulent.
Je veux pas non plus qu'il les gâte,
mais si Howard
leur fait découvrir des choses sympas
et de nouvelles expériences
légèrement au-dessus de nos moyens,
où est le mal ?
Le mal ? C'est que nos gosses
finiront par montrer leurs fesses
aux paparazzis,
en marchant avec des chihuahuas
dans leurs sacs à main.
Tom est assez bizarre comme ça.
Je pense que quelqu'un manque un peu
d'assurance
et se sent menacé
par mon nouveau copain.
Moi ? Non, je me sens pas menacé.
Il me fait de la peine.
Comme Quint dans Les dents de la mer
quand il arrête pas de glisser
dans la gueule du requin.
- Salut, Howard.
- Salut, chérie.
Écœurant.
Tom est sous la douche. Je peux prendre
la tienne ? Salut Howard.
Je voulais justement te voir.
C'est bientôt ton anniversaire
et si tu as prévu autre chose,
dis-le-moi. Mais ta mère m'a dit
que tu étais fan de Yo-Yo Ma.
Je suis la présidente
des Yo-Yo Maniacs.
Il s'avère que je connais M. Ma,
alors ce qu'on pourrait faire,
si ça te tente,
c'est aller à New York
dans mon jet privé,
le voir en concert
et peut-être le voir après.
- Vraiment ? Mon Dieu ! Merci !
- De rien.
Attends, une seconde.
Gary, t'es d'accord ?
Quoi ? Le truc de Yo-Yo Ma ?
M'en fiche. Oui.
D'accord. Mais le truc
c'est que ça tombe
en même temps que mes plans.
T'adores Yo-Yo Ma,
mais tu adores aussi
quelqu'un d'autre, alors
j'ai fait en sorte que...
l'ex Vice Président des États-Unis,
Al Gore,
t'appelle chez-moi
pour ton anniversaire.
Mon Dieu ! Merci !
- Al Gore, Gary ? Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Tu le connais comment ?
La question est comment lui,
me connait ?
D'accord, comment Al Gore
te connait ?
Telle est la question.
Louise lui a fait un câlin.
Un câlin !
Je me suis souvenu que Sasha allait
à ce truc avec Al Gore
alors j'ai lâché
qu'Al Gore allait l'appeler.
Non, c'est bien.
T'as trouvé un truc
bien mieux que son cadeau minable.
Tu l'as écrasé. T'es le meilleur.
T"as raison. C'est le plan parfait
sauf que je connais pas Al Gore.
Il vient collecter des fonds.
T'as pensé à appeler son hôtel ?
Vraiment ? Tu crois qu'il séjourne
au "Tous les malades mentaux,
téléphonez-moi, je suis Al Gore
et je réside dans la suite Me voilà !" ?
Non. En fait, il doit séjourner
au "Désolé,
j'essayais juste de sortir mon frère
de la merde."
Il est au Regent Beverly Wilshire
où a lieu la cérémonie.
Et merde. Je l'appelle.
Regarde le brunch du dimanche.
Crêpes à gogo ?
M'appelle pas dimanche.
La chambre d'Al Gore, je vous prie.
Al, c'est Mitch.
Mitch Brooks.
Oui. Ah bon ?
Quel sandwich ?
Je déconne. Je suis en attente.
C'est moi ou vous faites beaucoup
de pauses ?
J'essayais de trouver un cadeau
pour l'anniversaire de ma fille.
C'est marrant. Les plombiers
parlent de la même chose.
- Ah bon ?
- Non. Ils réparent les toilettes.
Curtis, si t'as besoin de moi,
je serai au bar d'en face.
Et j'emmène mon père
à la soirée caritative.
- Le bar ?
- Je vais chercher mon père
à l'aéroport et je l'emmène
à la soirée caritative.
Ils me le passeront jamais.
Il est inabordable.
À l'époque,
Lincoln marchait dans la rue
et les gens allaient
à sa rencontre lui serrer la main.
Ou le voir au théâtre.
Exactement. Il était accessible.
Bien. Je sais ce que j'ai à faire.
Je m'incruste à la soirée d'Al Gore.
Je me fais passer pour l'invité
de Sasha.
Je fais passer un mot à Al Gore
en espérant qu'il appelle ma fille.
Mauvaise idée.
J'ai une anecdote.
C'est ça.
Deux anecdotes pour le prix d'une.
Je suis allé au cinéma
voir Rush Hour 2
et je me suis dit,
si j'allais dans une autre salle ?
Pour faire court,
on m'a confisqué mon popcorn,
mes bonbons et on m'a jeté dehors.
Je suis rentré affamé, humilié,
me demandant
qui Bridget Jones avait choisi.
Il a raison. C'est risqué.
C'est impossible. Je viens.
Quoi ?
Non. Tu... C'est sympa.
Ça aurait été génial s'il y avait eu
deux invités, mais c'est pas deux.
C'est un invité. J'y vais seul.
Génial. Un mec inexpérimenté,
pas entraîné
se lance alors qu'il n'est
absolument pas préparé.
Tu sais comment les Marines
appellent ça ? L'armée.
Merci de me faire conduire.
Tu vois comme c'est sûr ?
Pas de sang. Pas de tripes.
Un trajet tranquille à la poste
pour envoyer mon courrier à la base.
Dire que t'as emprunté un Humvee.
J'ai l'impression d'être un Kardashian.
Oui, le caporal du camp Pendleton
me l'a prêté
pour cette urgence.
J'ai l'impression d'être puissant.
Tu devrais essayer
la mitrailleuse sur le toit.
Abattre des chèvres,
détruire des camions abandonnés.
Ça, ça te file la trique.
Oncle Mitch, ce mec veut passer.
Je fais quoi ?
Ça va. Laisse-le passer, c'est tout.
Tu vois, il passe.
Essaie de penser à ce qui rend
la conduite super... La liberté,
l'indépendance,
les jeunes filles sexy...
qui mentent à leurs pères,
qui font le mur pour te rejoindre
au restau du coin pour manger avec toi.
Oncle Mitch.
Avec un pull moulant, mais ne voulant
pas ressembler à une fille facile.
Oncle Mitch. Y a un mec
qui veut sortir, je fais quoi ?
Freine !
Mon Dieu !
Je suis coupé en deux !
Je suis coupé en deux !
Oh, mon Dieu !
Je suis coupé !
Du calme, Tom !
- Tommy, c'est de la sauce à salade.
- Non. C'est mon sang.
C'est de la sauce à salade, OK ?
Ça va.
C'est de la sauce à salade.
C'est de la sauce à salade.
- C'est bon.
- C'est de la sauce à salade.
C'est, c'est...
- Qu'est-ce que je vous sers ?
- Je vais prendre une bière.
- Quand est-ce qu'Al Gore arrive ?
- Très bientôt.
Oh, super.
Combien je vous dois ?
C'est un open-bar.
C'est souvent comme ça.
Oui, je sais.
Je parlais pourboire.
Mais vu comme vous êtes malpoli,
oubliez.
Une sucette Ahi au thon ?
Vous me proposez
une sucette au poisson ?
C'est du thon à sushi.
Ça va. Je vais attendre que le mec
au saumon passe par ici.
Oh, mon Dieu.
- Needleman. Quoi ?
- Je voulais te remercier.
Avoir parlé d'Al Gore,
ça nous a inspirés, Ally et moi,
pour s'impliquer et venir à cette fête,
mais je m'attendais pas à te voir ici.
Super. Mais écoute,
Allison ne peut pas savoir que je...
Ally ! Regarde qui est là !
C'est Gary ! Il est là !
Que fais-tu ici ?
Je m'instruis sur l'environnement.
Je bois des bières.
- Comment es-tu entré ?
- Comment ça ?
Désolée.
Je disais, comment es-tu entré ici ?
Gary,
tu ne peux pas te le permettre.
Pour notre planète.
- Je peux pas ne pas le faire.
- Tu sais quoi ?
Je vais te frapper à la gorge
si tu me dis pas ce que tu fais.
Mon patron, elle est très cool et jolie
et elle m'a emmené.
Elle s'est dit
que ça serait sympa.
Je sais que tu mens.
T'arrives pas à accepter qu'il y ait
un nouvel homme dans la vie des enfants.
Tu sais, même si Al Gore appelle Louise,
ça ne changera rien.
Howard sera toujours là
et pourquoi est-ce si mal, Gary ?
C'est une personne bien.
Laisse-moi t'expliquer.
Louise est ma fille,
et depuis des années
elle me regarde comme si j'étais
le mec qui pouvait déplacer la terre
et je vais pas laisser un mec en costume
qui sort Yo Yo Ma
de sa poche, m'enlever ce regard.
C'est mon regard.
Je l'ai gagné, Allison.
Personne ne va te voler ce regard.
T'as raison. T'as bien raison,
parce que je pars pas d'ici
avant d'avoir donné un message
à Al Gore. Je pars pas.
Pardon,
comment ça mon plus un est ici ?
- Mon Dieu. Je dois partir.
- Quoi ?
Cache-moi.
Pour une fois, je voudrais
que ton cul soit plus gros.
Mesdames et messieurs, l'ancien
vice-président des États-Unis,
Al Gore.
Super.
- Gore, j'ai un truc pour vous.
- Arme ! Arme !
Est-ce nécessaire ?
Le mec a même pas gagné.
Fermez-la.
Sors-le d'ici et enferme-le.
Oui, monsieur.
Je te l'ai dit,
tu as besoin de moi.
Voilà, Louise.
Tu vas emmener
ton violoncelle à New York ?
Oui, je veux que Yo Yo Ma le signe.
Ça fait juste un peu loin
pour qu'un mec écrive 6 lettres dessus.
Voilà.
Ça va ?
Ça va mieux
depuis l'incident des sauces ?
Je le croyais jusqu'à
hier, quand on a mis de la sauce
sur ma salade,
je me suis réveillé à l'infirmerie,
à côté d'un gamin qui saignait du nez.
Je suis fier de toi. Tu reviens de loin.
T'étais ce gamin avant.
T'incruster à cette fête est la chose
la plus stupide que t'aies faite
et je compte cette fois où tu as mis
ce crabe sur ton téton.
Tu vas jamais lâcher ça ?
Au bout de 5 minutes, le crabe a lâché.
Tu vas lui dire quoi ?
La vérité.
Chérie.
Je peux pas faire qu'Al Gore
t'appelle pour ton anniversaire.
Ça n'arrivera pas. Je suis désolé.
Je sais que t'es déçue.
Vraiment ?
Mais,
voilà ce que
je t'avais pris au départ.
C'est une photo de toi et moi
sur les rochers de la plage
et on rigolait
parce que les dauphins et les otaries,
on aurait dit qu'ils souriaient et
on leur faisait coucou. Tu te souviens ?
Oui, très bien.
C'est un de mes plus beaux jours.
Moi aussi.
- Merci papa. Je l'adore.
- Je t'aime, mon cœur.
Louise,... chérie, on peut
aller à New York une autre fois.
Si tu veux rester ici et fêter
ton anniversaire avec ton papa, tu peux.
- Je...
- Non, écoute,
va à New York. C'est une occasion
unique dans une vie, OK ?
Et dis à Yo-Yo
que je lui dis Yo, OK ?
Mais surtout, fais en sorte
d'être gentille avec M. Needleman.
Il fait quelque chose de bien, OK ?
D'accord. Allons-y. Je veux arriver
bien en avance à l'aéroport.
Pourquoi ? C'est un jet privé.
Tu vas direct à l'avion.
Je sais. Je veux traîner au bar et
regarder les voyageurs normaux stresser.
Allo. Allo ?
Attendez une minute.
C'est Al Gore.
Allo.
Oui, c'est Louise.
Bonjour, M. Gore.
Merci, papa.
T'es incroyable.
- C'est ton regard ?
- Oui. C'est mon regard.
Comment c'est arrivé, Gary ?
Le mec des services secrets a dû
choper le message et le glisser
- à Al Gore quand il était libre.
- Devinez quoi, M. Gore.
Je m'envole pour New York en jet.
Je veux dire que j'y vais en voiture
avec un moteur hybride.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Hey, kids!
Your lunches are ready.
What are you doin'?
I'm headed back to reserve duty next
week, so I'm shippin'my stuff ahead.
- Why? You gonna Miss me?
- I'm gonna Miss you, but don't worry.
I'm gonna get us a real small dog so the
neighbors don't stop thinking we're gay.
All right. I still need to get socks,
deodorant,
and a case of Dottie Lane
salad dressing.
- Salad dressing?
- This stuff's amazing.
You could roll a bottle
of this in a cave in
Afghanistan and the insurgents'll come
with their hands
in the air holding forks and bowls.
- You guys ready or what?
- Here we go.
Yeah. I got my first class
of driver's ed today.
Pretty soon I'll be driving
you to school, Louise.
I guess it's time I stopped
questioning and pick a religion.
I'm so psyched.
Driving means freedom and independence
and of course the ladies.
Yep, you just summed up
why I joined the marines...
That and blowin' stuff up.
Hey, guys. Gary, listen.
Howard's here, and you know we just
started dating, and I really like him,
so please don't make that joke
about how his strong grip
will come in Handy
when he's carrying all my baggage, OK?
No, this is... This is important.
I finally get to meet the guy
that's been spoiling my kids
with the box seats at the dodger games,
the designer clothes, the new bikes.
Is he comin' in through the door,
or should I check the chimney?
- Good morning, Louise.
- Good morning.
Howard,
this is Gary and his brother Mitch.
Gary, I've heard...
Things about you.
That's... That's a strong grip.
You know, that's gonna come in...
Howard is, He was pickin' us up so
I could drop the kids off at school,
and then we're going to Malibu for
breakfast. We're gonna eat on his boat.
Now it's OK to eat on a boat,
but I can't bring my turkey leg
on it's a small world?
No, but apparently
you can stash it behind a trash can
and finish it after the ride was over.
Come on, kids. Go to school.
Hold up just a second. Tom, Louise,
I got present for you guys, something
you can keep here at your dad's place.
That's OK.
The kids have plenty of, you know...
It's the number one
gaming system in Amer...
I wanted to be sensitive to
the whole divorce situation,
so I got you one for here and one
you can take back to your mom's.
Cool, the sports resort game.
You can parachute over an Island
and join up with other sky
divers in formation.
- You didn't happen to get the...
- Schwing!
Sword attachments for the fencing game!
Oh, my god.
Thank you, but it's real not...
It's not necessary.
The kids have lots of toys.
I just have to say no to
the whole thing. I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
You're embarrassing me.
No. This is my fault, Gary.
I apologize. I should have asked you.
You don't have to pack it all up.
I mean, I'll just swing
it by your house later.
- Thank you, Mitch.
- Hey, i'll see you guys later.
We're gonna have a lot of fun.
- I was talkin' to my kids.
- You, too, then.
- I got first game.
- Yeah, no, no.
You get first game when he's
sleepin' with your ex-wife.

" Gary's Demo"
VO By :  ¤Aka¤
Team Subs-Addicts"
Can you believe this needleman guy?
I mean, he's known my kids 3 weeks.
He's buying thriemed toys
that I like more than they do.
Getting upset over nothing, Gary.
I mean, it's an awesome video game.
You can play tennis the way it was
meant to be played, on your couch...
With a beer and nachos.
You know what he's doin', right?
He's tryin' to buy your kids.
- It's jsust a couple gifts.
- Is it?
Let me tell you a little anecdote.
That's right.
A brother can say, "anecdote."
A few years ago,
I'm dating this woman, Viv,
and she's got 3 kids...
2 boys and a chick.
OK, just so you know, this is why
I never ask you to baby-sit. Go ahead.
I really like viv, OK,
so I figure I need her kids
to really like me, so what did I do?
I buy them this popcorn popper, one of
those fancy ones with the butter warmer.
Now, this really, really ruffles
the feathers of the ex-husband,
but the kids are so grateful that
they want me around all the time now.
So I start picking 'em up from school,
going shopping for clothes with them,
giving them talks about
the birds and the bees.
Pretty soon,
guess what little Kiana's callin' me?
The defendant?
"Dad," OK?
I'm telling you,
if you don't want him to buy your
kids' love, you gotta outdo him.
You don't have to do anything, Gary.
The only love he bought was mine.
Hey, Curtis, would you mind R.S.V.P.
-ing to this al gore fundraiser for me?
It's me plus one.
Sasha, you gotta get
an assistant for this stuff.
Please. My dad's in town to support
Gore, and I'm just really stressed
'cause he and I have
a very difficult relationship.
My dad and i, not gore and i.
Gore and I are fine.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Sign you up for a Mani-Pedi?
Book a massage for you?
Pick up your dress?
I would never in a million years
ask you to do something like that,
but now that you've offered,
thank you so much. You're a lifesaver.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Of course, guy I met 2 weeks ago
who's here to paint the station.
Right. OK,
when your father bought you a lot of
stuff, did that make you love him more?
See that, guys?
You cannot buy your kids' love.
What's important is being a good dad.
You believe what you want, but all I had
to do was buy those kids a Mr. Popcorn,
and now, if you are to believe my coffee
mug, i'm the world's greatest dad.
Your mug says, "female body inspector."
I'm that, too.
Game, set, and match.
Good game, Tv.
How's it goin', buddy?
How was driver's ed?
Driver's ed?
It was, It was... it was good.
I mean, it was.
It was horrifying.
The showed us this video about the
dangers of not driving safely. And then
there was just so much blood and...
and screaming, and then
they show this guy who was cut in half?
I don't wanna be cut in half.
I'm just at the age where I'm learning
what one of my halves can do!
All right. Come here.
Sit down. Sit down.
I've seen this kind
of thing before in combat.
Marine sees something horrible,
he can't get it out of his head
here's the key.
We've gotta get you into a car before
the trauma sets into the brain.
All right? Otherwise, you're always
gonna associate driving with blood.
The only thing I heard out
of that sentence was "trauma,
"brain," and "blood."
Listen to what i'm saying, all right?!
You don't have a choice here?!
You either kill the beast,
or the beast is gonna kill you!
You wanna be able to close your eyes
without seeing a little Tommy torso
running around without legs or feet?
Yes, I do, OK? I'll face the beast.
I'll face... I'll face it.
Cool. I'm gonna grab a string cheese.
- Man.
- You OK?
It's my fingernail.
Peeled off like a yogurt lid.
Hey, look, though. You can see my blood
pump every time my heart beats.
Oh, my god.
Hey, guys. How was the garlic festival?
Never mind. I could smell it.
It was awesome.
First of all, we had a 4-hour drive.
That was amazing.
And then we, had Garlic Food...
Garlic bread, Garlic cheese,
Garlic ice cream.
How'bout the Garlic ice cream?
That was awesome.
It was so disgusting.
Why do they put the Garlic clove
on top like a cherry? I mean, we get it.
How'bout the people-watching?
Wasn't that good people-watching?
Yeah, the guy dressed like
a Garlic bulb leered at me
and asked me if I worked out.
That could happen anywhere.
That could happen at a Garlic festival.
It could happen on a private yacht.
It could happen
other places that rich people go.
- What?
- You taking them to a free festival
didn't have anything to do
with howard, did it?
I want my kids to know that having a
good time doesn't have to be expensive.
You know what ?
Howard just wants the kids to like him,
and I really like him, too, so could
you please just give him a chance?
No, because he keeps spoiling my kids,
and for years,
I've been trying to
lower their expectations. OK?
And this guy's gonna ruin that by
giving them what they actually want.
Gary, I don't want them spoiled either,
but if Howard's,
you know, exposing them to fun things
and new experiences
that are a little beyond our means,
what's the harm?
What's the harm? The harm is you
wind up with kids showing their crotch
to the parazzi, right,
walkin' around
with little Chihuahas in purses.
Tom's weird enough as it is.
You know what? I think
someone's feeling a little insecure
and a little threatened by my new fella.
What, me? No, no. I'm not threatened
by your fellow. I feel sorry for him.
Like In Jaws,
how I'm frightened for Quint
when he keeps sliding
into the mouth of the shark.
- Hi, Howard.
- Hi, sweetheart.
Nauseous.
Hey, mom, Tom grabbed the shower.
Can I use yours? Hey, Howard.
Hey, you're just the person
I wanted to see.
I understand you got a birthday comin'up
and if you have other plans,
just let me know, buy your mom
tells me you're a fan of Yo Yo Ma.
I'm the president of the yo-yo maniacs.
It just so happens that I know Mr. Ma,
so what I thought we could do,
if you're interested,
is get on my private jet,
fly to New York,
see him in concert, then maybe
hang out with him after the show.
- Really?! Oh, my god! Thank you!
- You're welcome.
B... but hang on. Just a second. Gary,
is this OK with you?
What? The Yo-Yo Ma, thing?
I don't care. Yeah.
Here OK. Here's the thing.
It might bump up a little
against my plan.
I know you love Yo Yo Ma,
but I also know somebody else
you really love, and that's why
I have arranged for...
OK, the former vice President
of the United States, Al Gore,
to call you at my house
on your birthday.
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Thank you.
- Al Gore, Gary? Really?
- Really.
How do you know Al Gore?
I think the question, Allison,
is "how does Al Gore know me?"
OK, Gary, how does Al Gore know you?
That's the question.
I mean, Louise actually hugged the guy.
She hugged him. I...
I remembered Sasha had that Al Gore
event she was gonna go to,
so I blurted out that Al Gore
was gonna call her.
No, no. This is good.
You came up with something
that's better than needleman's punk gift
man. You outdid him. You're on top now.
You're right, Curtis. It's the perfect
plan, except I don't know Al Gore.
He's here for the fundraiser. Did you
ever think about just callin' his hotel?
Really? Where you think he's stayin',
the "hey, any lunatic in the world,
pick up a phone and call me, i'm Al Gore
I'm staying at the here I am suites?
No. Actually, I think he's
probably staying at the "sorry,
I was just trying to help
my brother out of the Jam he's in inn."
He's staying at the Regent Beverly
Wilshire where they're having the thing.
Screw it. I'll call him.
Look at this sunday brunch menu.
Crepe station?
Do not call me on sunday.
Al Gore's room, please.
Al, it's Mitch.
Mitch Brooks.
Yeah. Really?
What kind of sandwich?
I'm just kiddin'. I'm on hold.
Is it my imagination,
or do you guys take a lot of breaks?
Just tryin' to figure out what to
get my daughter for her birthday.
That funny. The guys fixing the toilets
are talking about the same thing.
- Really?
- No. They're fixing the toilets.
Hey, Curtis, if you need me, i'm
gonna be at the bar across the street.
I'm picking my dad at the
airport for the fundraiser.
Why goin' to the bar?
Cause I'm picking my dad at the airport
and heading to the fundraiser.
They're never gonna
put me through to him.
He's totally insulated.
You know, back in the day,
abe Lincoln would walk down the street,
and people could just walk right
up to him and shake his hand.
Or see him at the theater.
Exactly.
He was accessible.
All right.
I know what I gotta do.
I sneak into the Al Gore event.
I make believe i'm Sasha's plus-one.
I give Al Gore a note to call my
daughter, and I hope he does me a solid.
This is a bad idea.
Let me tell you an anecdote.
That's right.
It's twofer tuesday on anecdotes.
I went to the movie
one time to go see Rush Hour 2,
and I thought to myself, hey,
why not sneak into another movie?
Long story short,
they confiscated my popcorn,
my malted milk balls and kicked me out.
I had to walk home hungry, humiliated,
and wondering who Bridget Jones chose.
He's right, Gary.
It's Risky.
It can't be done. I'm in.
What?
No. You're...
That's nice,
but that'd be great if it was plus-two,
Mitch, but it's not plus-two.
It's plus-one.
Gotta go it alone.
Great. Guy with no experience, no traing
is gonna stumble into something
he's totally unprepared for.
You know what we call
that in the marines? The army.
Thanks for taking me driving,
uncle Mitch.
See how safe this is?
No blood. No guts.
Just an easy drive to the post office
so I can mail my stuff to the base.
I can't believe you borrowed a Humvee.
I feel like a Kardashian.
Yeah, the motor pool sergeant over
at Camp Pendleton let me borrow
it for this case of Dottie Lane.
You know,
this makes me feel kind of powerful.
You should try it with
the machine gun on top.
Pickin' off goats,
shootin' up abandoned trucks...
That'll put a rise in your Levis.
Uncle Mitch, this guy wants
to go around me. What do I do?
It's all right. Just let him go on by.
Just let him go on by.
See, there he goes.
Just try to think about what makes
driving great... You know, the freedom,
the independence,
the hot, young females...
Lying to their fathers,
sneaking out so they can meet you
at the local diner for a burger...
Uncle Mitch. Mitch.
Hoping you notice their tight sweater,
but worried it makes them a bad girl.
Uncle Mitch. There's a guy who wants
to pull out. What do I do?
Hit the brakes!
Oh, my god!
I'm cut in half!
- I'm cut in half!
- Oh, my god!
I'm cut in half!
OK, calm down, Tom!
- Tommy, it's just salad dressing.
- No. This is my blood.
It's salad dressing, all right?
You're fine.
It's the salad dressing.
It's the salad dressing.
- That's good.
- It's salad dressing.
It's, it's...
- How you doin'? I'll have a beer.
- Yeah, what can I get you, sir?
- What time's Al Gore gonna show up?
- Should be pretty soon.
Oh, good.
How much do I owe you?
It's an open bar, sir.
These things usually are.
Yeah, I know.
I meant, for your tip.
And now that I see how rude you are,
forget it.
Ahi Tuna Lollipop?
Did you just offer me a fish lollipop?
It's sushi-grade Tuna.
That's OK. I'll wait for the Salmon
ding dong guy to come around.
Oh, my gosh.
- Needleman. What?
- Hey, I wanted to thank you.
You mentioned Al Gore the other
day, and it really inspired ally and
I to get involved and come to this event
but I did not expect to see you here.
That's great. OK, but listen.
Allison cannot know that I'm...
Ally! Look who's here!
It's Gary! He's right here!
What are you doing here?
Learning about the environment.
Having some beers.
- How did you get in here?
- What do you mean?
I'm sorry.
I meant how did you get in here?
Gary, you can't afford to do this.
This is our planet.
- I can't afford not to do this.
- OK, you know what?
I'm gonna punch you in the throat
unless you tell me what you're doing.
My, my boss, she's very cool
and pretty, and she brought me.
She thought i'd be fun
to have here with her.
Now I know you're lying.
You can't get your head around the fact
there's a new man in the kids' lives.
I mean, OK, so maybe if Al Gore calls
Louise, it doesn't change anything.
Howard is still gonna be here,
and why is that such a bad thing, Gary?
He's a really good person.
OK, let me explain it to you.
Louise is my daughter,
OK, and for years,
she's always looked at me like I was
the guy that can move heaven and earth,
and I'm not gonna let some guy
in a suit that pulls Yo Yo Ma
out of his pocket
take that look away from me.
That's my look.
I earned that look, Allison.
No one is gonna steal
that look from you.
You're right. You're darn right,
they're not, 'cause I'm not leavin' here
until I give Al Gore a little note.
I will not leave.
I'm sorry.
What do you mean my plus-one is here?
- Oh, my gosh. I have to leave.
- What?
Hide me.
- For once, I wish your ass was bigger.
- What?
Ladies and Gentlemen, former vice
President of the United States,
Al Gore.
Good.
- Hey, Gore, I got something for you.
- Gun! Gun!
Oh, my gosh. Is this necessary?
The guy didn't even win.
You keep quiet. Get him out of
here and lock him in a room.
Yes, sir.
I told you you were gonna need me.
Here you go, Louise.
You're gonna bring that cello
all the way to New York?
Yeah, 'cause I want Yo Yo Ma to sign it.
OK. Just it's a long way to travel with
a cello for a guy to write 6 letters.
Here you go.
We OK?
You feeling better
since the dressing incident?
Well, I thought I was until
yesterday, when the cafeteria lady
put dressing on my salad,
and I wake up in the nurse's office next
to a kid who picked his nose too hard
I'm proud of you, Tommy. You've come
a long way. You used to be that kid.
Sneaking into that event was the
stupidest thing you have ever done,
and I'm including the time you put
that hermit crab on your nipple.
Are you ever gonna let that go?
After 5 minutes, the crab let go.
What are you gonna tell her?
I'm gonna tell her the truth.
Hi, sweetie.
I can't get Al Gore
to call you on your birthday.
It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry.
I know you're disappointed.
Really?
But,
this is what I got you originally.
It's a photo of you and I on that beach,
and we were sitting on the rocks,
and we were really laughing,
'cause the dolphins and the seals,
it they looked like they were smiling,
and we were wavin' at'em. Remember that?
I totally remember.
That was one of
the best days I ever had.
Yeah, me, too.
- Thank you, daddy. I love it.
- I love you, sweetie.
Louise, honey,
we can go to New York another time.
If you wanna stay here and celebrate
your birthday with, you should do that.
- I...
- No, no. Listen,
go to New York. I mean, this is
the opportunity of a lifetime, OK?
And tell Yo-Yo I said Yo, right?
All right. But
most importantly, make sure
you're really nice to Mr. Needleman.
This is a great thing he's doing, OK?
All right, let's saddle up. I wanna get
to the airport a couple hours early.
Why? It's a private jet.
You just walk right on the plane.
I know. I wanna hang at the bar and
watch the commercial fliers stress out.
Hello hey. Hello?
Hold on one second.
It's Al Gore.
Hello.
Yes, this is Louise.
Hi, Mr. Gore.
Thank you, daddy.
You're amazing.
Is that your look?
Yeah. That's my look.
How did this happen, Gary?
The secret service guy must have
grabbed the note and slipped it
- to Al Gore when he had a free moment.
- Guess what, Mr. Gore.
I'm flying to New York in a priva.
I mean I'm driving there
in a fuel-efficient hybrid.
Team Subs-Addicts"
L'action de l'année doit être
celle d'Eric Bruntlett qui a permis
de gagner contre les Mets.
Je sais pas combien de fois c'est
arrivé, mais ça doit être rare.
Oui.
Pourquoi savoir si c'est déjà arrivé ?
C'est pas comme si t'avais
ton émission radio de sport.
Ce mec est nul.
Je sais.
C'est pour ça qu'on le vire.
T'es le meilleur, bébé.
Attends. Vous allez
chercher quelqu'un pour le remplacer ?
C'est ça.
Y a-t-il un moyen
qu'on étudie ma candidature ?
Bien sûr.
T'as des haricots magiques ?
Je dois faire quoi pour avoir ce job ?
Un entretien ?
Remplir un formulaire ?
Ça aiderait si je dis
que je suis 1/16 apache ?
Tu sais, ça va être difficile.
Plein de professionnels
vont venir postuler.
C'était aussi difficile quand j'ai sauté
du balcon du 2ème étage
dans la piscine du motel
et, souviens-toi, j'ai presque réussi.
On fait le point.
Écoute. Faut que tu faire une démo,
la soumettre au responsable de la radio,
et faudra espérer que personne
de plus expérimenté se présente.
Et si je connais
un super ingénieur du son, qui est
mon meilleur ami depuis le lycée ?
Il pourrait m'aider pour la faire ?
Gary, je peux pas, OK ?
Tu sais, t'es censé peindre cet endroit.
Et si j'avais des photos
de ce meilleur ami ingénieur du son
ne portant rien à part un soutif Madonna
et embrassant une nana
avec une pomme d'Adam qui tient
ses haricots magiques et sa tige ?

OK, Tim d'Oxnard,
le record du but le plus loin
est partagé entre
Jason Elam et Tom Dempsey,
mais faut bien reconnaitre que le record
appartient à Tom Dempsey, n'est-ce pas ?
Dempsey mérite un astérisque.
Sa demi-chaussure
lui a donné un avantage injuste.
Tim, écoute-moi bien.
Il portait une demi-chaussure
parce qu'il avait un demi-pied.
Et pas la bonne partie avec les orteils,
espèce de débile.
Écoute, Tim d'Oxnard, pourquoi toi
et les gens de ta belle ville ne vous
réunissez pas et faites un truc valable
comme trouver un nom mieux qu'Oxnard
pour votre ville.
Je suis Gary Brooks
et c'est le Score.
C'est dans la boîte.
C'est quoi ton problème
avec Oxnard ?
Rien, c'est juste un nom stupide.
On juge à partir du nom
maintenant...
Gary Merril Brooks ?
C'est un nom de famille et
tante Merril est une femme formidable.
Je dois dire que ta démo est
plutôt bonne, mec, je suis impressionné.
Fais-moi plaisir, n'espère pas trop.
Sasha est difficile.
Tout ce que je demande, c'est
qu'elle me mette au milieu des autres,
et c'est pour ça j'adoucis le tout
avec une invitation
pour le menu 2 à Burgeroos.
Attends, Sasha est une femme
qui conduit une BMW et qui
reçoit une station de radio
comme cadeau d'anniversaire.
Tu crois qu'elle va écouter ta démo
grâce à un coupon pour des burgers ?
- Y en a aussi un pour toi.
- Allons-y de suite.
Autre chose d'intéressant
sur Oxnard...
c'est le plus grand producteur
de fraises de Californie,
le seul port en eau profonde
au Nord de Long Beach,
et la seule ville de la côte Ouest
qui rime avec "bazar".
On a un problème.
Un garçon a menacé Tom à l'école.
Oh mon Dieu.
Il s'est passé quoi ?
J'étais à mon casier
et ce mec est arrivé,
et m'a dit qu'il allait
me botter le cul demain midi.
- Qui est ce petit voyou ?
- Dylan Mccormick et il est pas petit.
J'ai entendu
qu'il s'était battu avec un 5ème.
- En cinquième.
- Non, avec un 5ème.
OK, Tom, il va falloir
envoyer un message à ce gamin.
Il va te falloir
un tuyau en PVC de 1m50,
une bombe de gel,
un briquet et une patate.
Et le ticket du film où tu étais
pour quand tout pètera.
Mitch, Louise et toi pouvez
nous laisser pour parler avec Tom ?
Bien sûr.
Louise, t'aimes les fraises ?
Les ports en eaux profondes ?
Je ne vais pas à Oxnard avec toi,
oncle Mitch.
Tu penses pouvoir battre ce mec ?
Je m'excuse,
Tom ne va pas se battre.
Cette école à une politique
de tolérance zéro envers les brimades.
On va en parler au principal et faire
une réunion avec les parents de Dylan.
J'ai dit à Tommy qu'il pouvait rester
à la maison le temps que ça se règle.
Bien sûr. Il va rester à la maison
et quand il retournera à l'école,
tu le retrouveras à midi
pour lui donner le sein à la cafétéria.
Écoute, j'en suis pas fier, mais
j'ai frappé pas mal de gamins à l'école.
Beaucoup étaient comme toi, Tom,
des gamins qui,
juste en les regardant, tu savais
qu'ils te poseraient pas de soucis.
Tout ça pour dire
qu'en évitant l'école,
tu lui dis de continuer
à te harceler.
Tu dois retourner à l'école.
D'accord, mais quand il aura besoin
d'un appareil, tu paieras.
- Rien n'arrivera à ses dents.
- Je parlais de ses jambes.
Ça me manque l'époque où vous épeliez
des trucs pour pas que je comprenne.
Chéri, ton père
ne pouvait pas comprendre non plus.
Tom, allons dans le jardin.
Je vais te montrer des trucs.
Comment donner un coup de poing ?
Non, comment te mettre en position
foetale pour protéger ton bazar.
Je sais que je suis nouvelle,
mais mon but
est de faire de KPPQ
un endroit super où travailler.
On va être une grande
et heureuse famille.
Ça a l'air bien, Henry ?
Je suis Chris.
Vraiment ?
Parce que tu ressembles à Henry.
Je suis Henry.
OK. Bonne réunion.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je dois lui donner ma démo.
La lui donner en main propre.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je devrais la lui envoyer.
Plus simple.
- Tu vas l'envoyer ici ?
- Oui.
Avec quelle adresse ?
"Cette radio, là où on est,
en Californie" ?
Vas-y.
Bonjour, Mlle Warden.
Pardon de vous déranger,
mais je dois vous dire un truc.
Depuis que je suis petit,
je rêve d'avoir mon émission
de sport à la radio
et mon petit doigt m'a dit
que vous cherchiez quelqu'un,
alors je...
j'ai fait une démo.
Eh bien...
J'ai hâte.
Je l'écouterai
dès que j'aurai le temps.
Et après l'avoir écoutée
allez faire la grosse commission.
Ce sera plus clair quand vous aurez vu
l'invitation dans l'enveloppe.
Tu devineras jamais
ce qui s'est passé à la bagarre.
T'as fait la position foetale.
C'est comme frapper une tortue.
Vite, de la glace pour ton dos.
Non, papa, Dylan est jamais venu.
Je l'ai attendu derrière la cafétéria.
Il est jamais venu.
C'est super, Tommy.
Un forfait est une bonne victoire.
Tu peux mettre ça à côté
avec tes médailles de participant.
Tu t'es pas dégonflé
et la brute est pas venue.
C'est Tommy le dur, maintenant,
pas vrai ?
Exact. On me respecte,
sauf celui qui m'a surpris aux toilettes
en train de vomir de soulagement.
Tu penses quoi de ton frère ?
T'es fière de lui ?
Dylan s'est pas enfui à cause
de Tom.
Mais à cause de Louise.
Mais elle se bat pas.
Même quand on joue
aux robots,
elle refuse de se battre.
Son robot bouge pas
et proteste en silence.
Apparemment, Dylan était assis,
en train de déjeuner
quand Louise a surgi par-derrière
et lui a murmuré quelque chose.
Selon un enfant qui était là,
le visage de Dylan s'est affaissé,
il avait l'air déprimé,
il s'est levé pour rentrer chez lui.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'elle a bien pu
lui dire ?
Dis-le-lui, Louise.
Mon Dieu.
Je vais chercher
de la pâte de fruit.
J'ai jamais rien entendu
d'aussi horrible sauf ton "Je le veux".
Ou ton "Non, il est pas plus grand".
Quoi qu'il en soit, le principal veut
nous rencontrer avec Louise.
Seigneur, c'est vraiment horrible.
Elle a appris où à détruire
le moral d'un homme comme ça ?
Merci d'être venue, c'était un plaisir.
Je vous tiens au courant.
Ça doit être le 18e
DJ qu'elle reçoit. Tu penses
qu'elle a déjà écouté ma démo ?
Je t'avais dit de pas t'emballer.
Que ça marcherait pas.
- Gary, vous pouvez venir ?
- J'ai toujours cru en toi.
Bonjour.
Peu importe ce que vous allez dire,
je voulais vous remercier.
Je respecte votre avis.
Mais surtout merci. Merci pour ce...
chèque adressé
à Gary Peintre en Bâtiment.
Oui. C'est ce que je vous dois
pour avoir repeint la radio.
Vous allez bientôt avoir fini
alors je voulais vous dire
- que tout a l'air parfait.
- OK. Super. Rien d'autre ?
Les couleurs resplendissent.
L'équipe était courtoise
et sentait bon.
Voilà. Je vous ai donné ma démo,
il y a quelques jours
et je suis juste un peintre
que vous avez engagé mais,
depuis que je vous l'ai donnée,
je suis sur les charbons ardents,
si enthousiaste,
et si vous êtes pas intéressée,
dites-le moi.
- J'encaisserai. Me menez pas en bâteau.
- Je suis pas intéressée.
Vous pouvez un peu
me mener en bâteau.
C'est bon. Vraiment, vous pouvez.
Vous avez aucun retour à me faire ?
Ça vous a plu ?
Vous avez pas aimé ?
Non. C'est pas que j'ai pas aimé.
C'est que... vous savez,
j'ai pas apprécié de manière
à pouvoir vous dire "hé, j'adore".
J'ai pas aimé.
Alors je vais chercher
un moyen élégant
de quitter votre bureau. Et j'ai...
J'ai marché dans un pot de peinture.
Je vais enlever ma chaussure
et comme ça, je partirai plus vite.
Y a un nœud. J'y arrive pas.
- Je vais y aller.
- Ça serait le mieux.
Mec !
- Alors ?
- Elle a dit quoi ?
Elle s'est foutue de moi.
Elle a même pas écouté ma démo.
Regardez, elle l'a même pas ouvert.
T'en fais pas.
La radio, c'est mort comme business.
- Mec.
- Désolé.
Je peux comprendre qu'elle ait pas
écouté la démo, qu'elle l'ait pas aimée,
mais pourquoi mentir
et dire qu'elle l'a écoutée ?
Ta question est
"pourquoi une femme mentirait ?"
Je l'ignore.
Pourquoi une femme te demanderait
d'acheter un jet ski
pour en faire avec ton cousin Leon,
ses bras enroulés autour de sa taille,
en te faisant coucou
comme si de rien n'était.
Je leur ai pas fait coucou.
Pardon. C'était quoi la question ?
Prêt à rencontrer le principal ?
Oui. Je prends ma veste
dans la cabine.
- Bonjour. Je peux vous aider ?
- Non, pas besoin.
Voici mon ex-femme, Allison,
et voici ma chef,
pour un petit moment. Voici Sasha.
On a un truc à l'école.
Et si quelque chose arrive
pendant mon absence,
Mitch est le responsable.
En mon absence, c'est lui le patron.
Ça, c'est du match !
Tu veux te faire rétamer ?
Tu plais à ta chef.
Je crois que c'est l'inverse.
Arrête, c'est évident.
Elle a eu le regard.
Comment ça ? Elle a maté
mes tablettes de chocolat ?
Plutôt le nutella ?
Elle t'a pas regardé. Mais moi.
Quand une femme s'intéresse à un homme,
elle regarde les femmes de sa vie,
C'est très rapide, très subtile.
Si tu sais pas ce que tu cherches,
tu le raterais.
Il fait quoi ?
Il signifie qu'elle fait face
à une menace possible.
En un coup d'œil
d'une fraction de seconde
elle m'a regardée,
a vu l'intelligence.
Elle a regardé mes vêtements,
en a conclu que j'avais du style.
Elle a remarqué que je mets
un point d'honneur à m'entretenir.
Je l'inquiète.
Tu devrais te prendre une chambre.
Le principal a dit que tu n'es pas
obligée de t'excuser en personne.
Tu peux lui envoyer un mot, une lettre.
Tu peux lui téléphoner.
- Je suis pas désolée.
- T'es pas obligée d'être sincère.
Fais semblant
et t'auras plus de problème.
C'est une bonne idée d'apprendre
l'hypocrisie à ta fille ?
En fait, tu as raison. Désolé.
Je sais que tu n'aimes pas Dylan,
mais le principal a dit
qu'il a du mal à s'en remettre.
Il regarde la chaine météo
en répétant "Ça arrive".
"Ça arrive", tu comprends ?
Je veux pas lui faire mes excuses.
Il a pas à s'excuser auprès des enfants
qu'il a embêtés.
- Là, elle a raison.
- Gary, on est une équipe.
- T'as raison. Désolé.
- Merci.
C'est si facile.
Désolée, mais si tu ne t'excuses pas,
pas de violoncelle,
de club d'échecs et tu n'iras pas
à la nuit des pizzas et des logarithmes.
- Injuste !
- Tu sais quoi ?
Si tu continues comme ça,
t'iras pas à la fac !
Tu penses que Sacha n'a pas écouté
ma démo, car je lui plais ?
J'y ai réfléchi,
je crois que j'ai compris.
Je lui plais.
T'es un vrai génie.
C'est...
Attends une minute.
Regarde ça.
Ta théorie est bancale.
- Impossible.
- Non.
Regarde ça : "Gary Brooks".
Sacha a écrit mon nom une centaine
de fois. Regarde !
C'est vrai.
Elle se met en quatre
pour prétendre qu'elle m'aime pas.
C'est moi qui lui plais.
Allison avait raison.
Je lui plais à fond.
C'est pourquoi elle a pas écouté
ma démo. Si elle m'engage,
ça sera bizarre au boulot,
je serais son employé ou son amant ?
- Ne redis plus jamais "amant".
- La voilà. Sois naturel.
Salut. Désolée,
je dois prendre des trucs.
Tu nous excuses une seconde ?
Ouais, bien sûr.
Je vais...
aller au camion
et chercher un marteau.
J'ai réfléchi à ce truc de DJ.
Je me fous de qui ?
J'y suis allé trop fort.
J'aimerais récupérer ma démo.
Vous savez, si je la trouvais.
J'ai dû la ranger
ou... elle peut être dans ma voiture.
En fait, je crois qu'elle est
dans mon pantalon.
Et vous ne l'avez pas écoutée.
Vous savez, je suis très occupée.
J'ai un programme chargé
et j'ai pas le temps
d'écouter chaque démo
de chaque entrepreneur qui arrive...
Je crois savoir ce qui se passe.
Vous n'avez pas écouté ma démo,
car... je vous plais.
- Quoi ?
- Ouais. Je vous plais.
Et c'est bon. Rien que vous et moi,
seuls, dans ce bureau.
Et tous ces gens dehors
qui m'entendront si je crie.
C'est pas de ça que je parle.
J'ai trouvé ça. Vous avez écrit
mon nom partout,
regardez, 100 fois "Gary Brooks".
Vous avez même fait
de jolis petits yeux dans les deux "O".
- Personne ne devait voir ça.
- C'est bon.
On peut s'en sortir.
Je vais faire ça.
Je vais plus porter des habits
qui vous excitent au boulot.
Je garderai mes flingues
dans leurs étuis.
Je ferai taire mon charme et nous...
allons y arriver, ensemble.
Eh bien...
Maintenant que mon secret est connu,
autant avouer.
Confiez-vous.
Je suis trop nulle avec les noms.
Répétez.
J'écris plein de fois les noms
pour m'en souvenir.
Vous avez pas tourné la page
et vu tous ces noms ?
Henry Zangara,
Phil Werner, Anne Johnson.
La liste continue.
Tom Shinsky.
- Comment expliquez-vous le regard ?
- Quel regard ?
Celui que vous avez lancé
à mon ex-femme, Allison.
Vous avez maté ses nichons, ses habits.
Vous avez reluqué son corps.
Ça veut dire que je vous plais.
Oh mon Dieu, d'accord. Vous vous
êtes défoncé avec Mitch et Henry.
J'ai regardé Allison,
car j'aimais son jean.
Je le trouvais mignon.
Où avez-vous trouvé l'audace
de venir ici,
de fouiller mes affaires
et ensuite, faire
ces allégations scandaleuses ?
Pendant des années,
j'ai beaucoup respiré de fumées.
Vous savez pourquoi je n'ai pas
écouté votre démo ?
Parce que vous n'avez aucune
chance d'avoir ce boulot.
Vous avez jamais pensé
que le gars que j'engage pour être
le DJ sportif
doit être un commentateur sportif ?
Curtis me l'a dit,
mais j'ai pensé qu'il voulait
éloigner le mec blanc.
Je vous suggère de sortir
et de finir le boulot
pour lequel je vous ai engagé,
ou j'aurai un nom de moins
à me souvenir.
- C'est Gary...
- Je sais.
Les enfants sont déjà là ?
Pourquoi ce regard ?
T'es plus une experte en regard ?
- Tu parles de quoi ?
- Comment ?
Je viens de me ridiculiser
devant Sacha.
Elle me regardait pas.
Je lui plais pas du tout.
Elle regardait ton pantalon,
elle aime ton jean.
Vraiment ? C'est très gentil.
J'aime aussi ce qu'elle portait.
Allison. C'était le moment
le plus embarrassant de ma vie.
C'est tout ce que tu as à me dire ?
Ce serait bizarre que je l'appelle ?
Alors ?
J'ai demandé pardon à Dylan,
mais j'ai pas pu être hypocrite,
donc j'ai dit que j'étais désolée.
On est très fiers de toi,
tu sais ce que ça veut dire.
Quelqu'un peut
aller au club d'astronomie.
J'ai aussi une bonne nouvelle.
Après que Louise se soit excusée,
Dylan est revenu me botter les fesses.
En quoi c'est bien ?
En me mettant en position "tortue",
j'ai mis mon livre d'histoire dans mon
pantalon et quand Dylan m'a frappé,
il s'est cassé la jambe
à 5 endroits.
Il va étudier chez lui
jusqu'à la fin de l'année.
- Non, Mon Dieu.
- Non.
Je ne vais rien demander, je...
je suis ici pour m'excuser
de 6 choses différentes.
Excuses acceptées.
Je ne suis pas si chiante.
Si on était des amis
qui trainent ensemble,
je dirais
"soit commentateur sportif, essaie".
Mais je suis le patron et tout le monde
dans cette entreprise, mon père,
attend que j'échoue.
Donc si j'engage le mec
qui peint la station
pour être à l'antenne, c'est comme si
je savais pas ce que je faisais.
Pourquoi ne pas me l'avoir dit ?
Désolée. Je suis pas habituée
à détruire les rêves des gens.
Mais maintenant que je l'ai fait,
j'ai l'impression d'y être assez bonne.
Si vous voulez être DJ sportif,
pourquoi ne pas commencer
en bas et grimper les échelons ?
Vous avez commencé en bas ?
Mon cas est très différent,
car j'ai un père qui est riche
qui me donne des choses et vous...
pas vous.
Donc,
non, j'ai pas travaillé pour.
Si je pouvais le refaire,
je grimperais les échelons.
Mais je peux pas, j'ai pas le temps,
donc voilà ce que j'ai fait.
J'ai tenté le coup,
j'ai fait une démo
et je vais vous dire,
je trouve qu'elle est excellente.
Et je demande juste que vous...
Mettez-moi dans la compil.
C'est tout.
- OK, donnez-moi votre démo.
- Sérieux ?
- Vite, avant que je change d'avis.
- Voilà.
OK, vous...
êtes dans la compil.
Félicitations.
C'est une sacrée compil.
Et je suis dedans.
Tu sais pourquoi elle a fait ça.
Team Subs-Addicts"
The play of the year has to be
Eric Bruntlett's unassisted
triple play to beat the mets.
I don't know how many times that's
happened, but I bet it's rare.
Yeah. Why would you know how
many times that happened?
It's not like you have your own
sports talk radio show or anything.
This guy's terrible.
I know. That's why we're firing him.
You the best, baby.
Wait. Curtis, if you're firing him, are
you gonna be looking for someone else?
That's the plan.
Is there any way I could
be considered for that job?
Sure.
How you set for magic beans?
What do I have to do to get this job?
Do I have to interview?
Do I have to fill out an application?
Would it help if I told
people I was 1/16 apache?
You know, it's such a long shot.
They got a lot of professional
guys comin' in here for this job.
It was also a long shot when I jumped
from the second-story balcony
into the motel pool,
and if you rember, I almost made it.
Let's wrap this up.
OK, look. You have to cut a demo,
submit it to the station manager.
Then you'd have to hope that anyone
with more experience doesn't apply.
What if I happen to know
a great sound engineer
who's been my best friend since high
school? Could he help me cut a demo?
Gary, I can't do it, OK? I mean, you're
supposed to be paintin' this place.
What if I had photographs
of this best friend sound engineer
wearing nothing but a pointy Madonna Bra
and making out with a chick
with an Adam's Apple who's holding
his magic beans and stalk?
Gary Brooks demo, take one.
I'm ¨Gary Brooks, and this isthe score.

Team Subs-Addicts"
OK, Tim from Oxnard,
the longest field-goal record
is shared between
Jason Elam and Tom Dempsey,
but we got to agree the record really
belongs to Tom Dempsey. Am I right?
No. Dempsey deserves an asterisk,
because the half shoe gave
him an unfair advantage.
Tim, follow me on this.
He was wearing half a shoe
because he only had half a foot, OK.
And not the good half with the toes,
you Dummy. Listen,
Listen, Tim from Oxnard,
why don't you
and the people of your fine city
get together and do something important,
like get a better name
for your town than Oxnard.
I'm Gary Brooks,
and that'sthe score.
All right.
That's a wrap.
What's your beef with Oxnard, man?
Nothing.
Just a stupid name.
We judging things by their names now...
Gary Merril Brooks?
It's a family name,
and aunt merril is a wonderful woman.
I'd say you cut yourself a pretty good
little demo here, man. I'm impressed.
Just do me a favor. Don't get your
hopes up. Sasha's a tough customer.
Hey, all I ask is
that she puts me in the mix,
and that is why I am sweetening the pot
with a coupon
for the number 2 meal at burgeroos.
Wait a minute.
Sasha is a woman who drives a BMW
and gets a radio station
for a birthday present.
She's not gonna listen to your demo
cause you gave her a coupn for a burger.
- I got one for you, too.
- Snap. Let's go right now.
Other interesting facts about Oxnard...
It's the largest producer
of Strawberries in California,
it's the only deep-water
port north of long beach,
and it's the only city on the west
coast that contains the word "nard."
We got a problem.
Tom was threatened by a boy at school.
Oh, my gosh.
Tommy, what happened?
I was at my slocker,
and this guy came up to me,
and he told me he was gonna kick
my butt tomorrow after lunch.
- Who is this little punk?
- Dylan Mccormick, and he not so little.
I heard he got in
a fight with seventh grade.
- In seventh grade.
- No, withseventh grade.
OK, Tom, it's clear you're gonna
have to send this kid a message.
You're gonna need,
about 4 feet of P.V.C. Pipe,
a can of hair spray,
a cigarette lighter, and a potato.
And a ticket stub to a movie you
were at when all this went down.
Mitch, could you and louise excuse
us for a second so we can talk to Tom?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Louise, you like Strawberries?
How'bout deep-water ports?
I'm not going to oxnard with you,
uncle Mitch.
OK. Tommy, you think you
can take this guy or what?.
I'm sorry.
Tom is not fighting anyone.
This school has a zero tolerance
policy when it comes to bullying.
We'll bring it to the principal's. We'll
arrange a conference with Dylan parents.
I told Tommy he could stay home till we
got this whole thing straightened out.
Sure. He'll just stay home from school,
and then when he goes back to school,
you can meet him for lunch
and breast-feed him in the cafeteria.
Look, I'm not proud of this, but I beat
up my fair share of kids in school.
A lot of those kids were just like Tom,
kids that,
just by lookin' at 'em, you knew they
weren't gonna give you any trouble.
Here's the bottom line.
By not goin' to school,
you send the bully a message
he can just keep pickin'on Tom.
Tom, you gotta go back to school.
All right, but when he needs braces,
you're paying for them.
- Nothing's gonna happen to his teeth.
- I was talking about his legs.
God, I Miss the days when you'd spell
things out so I wouldn't understand.
Honey, it was just that your father
couldn't understand them either.
Tom, let's go out in the yard.
I'm gonna show you some moves.
You mean like, like, like how to punch?
No, like how to curl up in the fetal
position and protect your Oxnards.
So I know I'm new here,
but my goal
is to make KPPQ
a really great place to come to work.
We're really just gonna
be one big happy family.
Does that sound good, Henry?
I'm Chris.
Really?
'cause you look just like Henry.
I'm Henry.
OK. Good meeting.
You know what?
I have to give her my demo.
I'll, just hand it to her.
Hey, you know what?
I should mail it to her.
That's easier.
- You're gonna mail it to right here?
- Right.
How are you gonna address it?
"This station, exactly
where we are, California"?
Now get over there.
Hi, Ms. Warden.
Look, sorry to bother you. But,
OK I have to... I have to tell you this.
Ever since I was a little kid
I had a dream of having my sports
talk radio show,
and a little birdie told me
you guys were lookin'
for someone, so i...
I made a demo.
OK, well...
Can't wait.
I'll... I'll listen to it as soon
as I get a moment.
And I recommend after you listen
to that, you have a number two.
That'd make a lot more sense when you
see the coupon inside the envelope.
You're never gonna guess
what happened with the fight.
You did the fetal position.
It's like trying to kick a turtle.
I'll get you some ice for your back.
No, dad, Dylan never showed.
I waited for him behind the cafeteria
after lunch. He never showed.
That's fantastic, Tommy.
A forfeit is as good as a win.
You can put that on your trophy case
with all your participant Ribbons.
See, you didn't back down,
and the bully never showed.
He's Tommy the tough guy now?
What do you think?
That's right.
Kids respect me now,
except for the ones who caught me
in the bathroom puking with relief.
What do you think of your brother now?
You proud of him, Louise?
Dylan didn't run away because of Tom.
Louise got to him first.
Louise. But Louise doesn't fight.
I mean, even when we play, like,
rock'em sock'em robots,
she won't push the buttons.
Her fighter just stands
there in silent protest.
Well, apparently Dylan was sitting
at a table, having lunch
when Louise came up from behind him
and whispered something in his ear.
And according to a kid who was there,
Dylan's face kind of sagged,
he looked really depressed,
and he got up, and he went home.
Well, what on earth did she say?
Tell why don't you tell him, Louise?
Oh, my god.
I'm gonna get a fruit roll-up.
That is the scariest thing
I've heard since you said, "i do."
Or where you said, "yeah.
That's the whole thing.
Anyway, Gary, the principal wants
to sit down with us and Louise.
Oh, my gosh.
That is really awful.
Where did she learn to break
a man's spirit like that?
Thank you so much for coming in. It was
great to meet you. I'll let you know.
That's like, the 18th
deejay hat she's interviewed.
You think she's listened to my demo yet?
See? I told you not
to get your hopes up.
I told you that it was not gonna work.
- Gary, could I see you for a second?
- I always believed in you, man.
Hi.
No matter what you're about
to say, I just wanna say thank you.
I respect your opinion. But thank you,
mostly. Thank you for this...
Check made out to Gary's house painting.
Yeah. It's the balance of what
I owe you for painting the station.
I know you're gonna be done in a couple
days, so I just wanted to tell you
- that everything looks great.
- OK. Great. Anything else?
The colors were vibrant.
The crew was courteous and smelled good.
OK, here's the thing. I gave you my demo
a couple days ago,
and I know I'm just a guy
you hired to paint the office, but
ever since I gave you that demo I've
sort of been on pins and needles
around here, so excited about it, and
if you're not interested,
tell me you're not interested.
- I take it. Just don't string me along.
- I'm not interested.
You can string me along
for a little while.
It's OK. Really, I can be strung.
It's just,
is there any feedback you can give me?
I mean, did you like it?
Did you not like it? It's just...
No, no. It's not that I didn't like it.
I just... You know,
I didn't love it in a way
where I would say something like,
you know, "hey, I love that."
I didn't like it.
Well, then I will now look
for a graceful way to
exit your office. And i...
I just stepped in a tray of paint.
You know what I'll do?
I'll take my shoe off,
and that way,
I will leave your office faster.
I have a knot.
I can't get it out.
- You know, why don't I just go?
- That's probably best.
Man.
- What happened?
- What'd she say?
She's totally blowin' me off.
She didn't even listen to my demo.
Look at this. She didn't even open it.
Don't worry about it, gary.
Radio is a dying business anyway.
- Dude.
- Sorry.
I can understand not listening
to the demo,
I can understand not liking the demo,
but why would she lie
about listening to the demo?
So your question is
why would a woman lie?
I don't know, man.
Why would a woman
ask you to cosign a loan for a jet ski
that she ends up ridin' with your cousin
Leon, arms all wrapped around each other
wavin' to you on the beach
like nothin's wrong?
I ain't wavin' back.
I'm sorry.
What was the question?
You ready to go see the principal?
Yeah. Let me get my jacket.
It's in the booth.
- Hi. Can I help you?
- No. She doesn't need any help.
That's my, ex-wife Allison,
and this is my, my boss
for a little while Sasha. This is Sasha.
We have a school thing to go to.
And, while if anything
happens while I'm away,
Mitch is in charge.
When I'm not here, Mitch is the boss.
That's game right there!
You wanna get wasted?
Lady boss is into you.
Yeah. I think,
the exact opposite is true.
Come on. It's obvious.
She did the look.
What do you mean? She's...
Checkin' out my new six-pack?
You mean the pony keg?
Gary, she didn't look at you.
She looked at me.
When a woman is interested in a guy,
all the other women in his life
get the look.
It's very quick. It's very subtle.
If you didn't know what you were
lookin' for, you'd probably Miss it.
What does this look do?
Lets her know she's
dealing with a possible threat.
You see, in that split-second glance,
she looked into my eyes,
saw intelligence.
She took in my clothes
and decided I was stylish.
She saw that I take pride in
keeping toned and fit.
I had her worried.
Maybe you and you could get a room.
The principal said you don't
even have to apologize in person.
You can write the kid a note, mail him a
letter. You could do it over the phone.
- But I'm not sorry.
- You don't have to mean your apology.
Just fake it if it gets
people off your back.
You really think it's a good idea
to teach your daughter to be insincere?
Actually, you're right.
I'm sorry, Allison.
Louise, honey, I know
you don't like Dylan, OK,
but the principal says he's having
a rough time coping.
He just sits in front of the weather
channel saying, "it's coming.
It's coming." You know?
I don't want to apologize to Dylan.
Dylan doesn't have to apologize
to all the kids he picked on.
- Yeah. She's got a point there.
- Gary, hello. We're a team here.
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
It's so easy.
Louise, honey, i'm sorry, but until you
apologize, you can't go to cello
or chess club, and no going to the woos
house for pizza and logarithm night.
- At's not fair!
- You know what?
You keep up that attitude,
you're not goin' to college!
You think Sasha didn't listen
to my demo 'cause she's into me?
You know, I've been giving this some
thought. I think I got it figured out.
She's into me.
Yeah, you're a real genius there, Mitch.
That's...
Hey, wait a minute.
Look at this, Mitch.
I think there's a big
hole in your theory.
- Impossible.
- Really?
Look at this.
"Gary Brooks. Gary Brooks."
Sasha wrote my name, like,
a hundred times on there. Don't you see?
It's true.
She's really goin' out of her way
to pretend she doesn't like me.
She likes me, you dope.
Allison was right.
She's totally into me.
That's why she didn't listen to my demo.
Let's say she hires me.
It's gonna be completely
confusing in the workplace,
like am I her employee,
or am I her lover?
- Please never say, "lover," again.
- Here she comes. Act natural.
Hi, guys. Sorry.
I just need to grab some stuff.
Hey, would you excuse us for a second?
Yeah, sure.
I'll just...
Head out to the truck and,
grab a hammer.
I've been thinking about this whole
deejay thing. Who am I kidding?
I'm in way over my head.
I'd like my demo back.
You know, if I could find it.
I might have filed it or...
It could be in my car.
Actually, I think it's in my pants.
And I know you didn't listen to it.
OK. You know,
I'm very busy, all right?
I've got a hectic schedule,
and it's not like I have the time
to listen to every demo CD of every
contractor that comes through...
I think I know what's goin' on here.
You didn't listen to my demo,
because you're into me.
- What?
- Yeah. You're into me.
And it's OK.
Just you and me alone in this office.
And all those people out there
who will hear me if I call out.
It's not what I'm talking about.
I found this. You've been writin'
my name all over the place,
look at this. A hundred times
you wrote "Gary Brooks.
You even made cute little
googly eyes of the double os.
- No one was supposed to see that.
- It's OK.
We can get through this.
You know what I'll do?
I'll stop wearin' clothes
to work that make you wild.
I'll keep my guns in their holster.
I'll take my mojo,
turn it down to low, and we'll...
We'll work it out together.
Well...
Now that my secret's out,
I may as well confess.
Lay it on me.
I'm terrible with names.
Come again?
I write names down over and over
so that I can remember them.
Did you happen to flip
the page and see these?
Henry Zangara,
Phil Werner, Anne Johnson.
The list goes on.
Tom Shinsky.
- Then how do you explain the look?
- I... what look?
The look... what look?
The look you gave my, ex-wife, Allison.
You were starin'at her bangs,
her clothes.
You're totally checkin' out her body.
That means you're into me.
Oh, my god. OK.
You got high with Mitch and Henry.
I looked at Allison
because I liked her jeans.
I thought they were cute.
Where do you get the audacity
to come in here
to rifle through my stuff
and then make these outrageous claims?
You know what? For years,
I've been breathing in a lot of fumes.
You know why I didn't
listen to your demo CD?
Because you have no chance
at getting this job.
Did it ever occur to you
that the guy I hire
to be my sports deejay
might actually be a sports deejay?
Curtis told me that,
but I thought he was just, you know,
trying to keep the white man down.
My suggestion to you
is that you get out there
and you finish the job I hired you for,
or I will have one less name to rember.
- It's Gary...
- I know.
The kids home yet?
What's that look for?
Now you're not
an expert on looks anymore?
- What you talking about?
- What I talking about?
I just made a complete ass out
of myself in front of Sasha.
She wasn't looking at me.
She's not into me at all.
She was lookin' at your pants.
She likes your jeans.
Really? Well, that's so sweet.
I like what she was wearing, too.
Allison. That was the most
embarrassing moment of my life.
That's all you have to say to me?
Would it be weird if I called her?
Well?
I apologized to Dylan,
but I couldn't do the insincere thing,
so I said I was sorry.
Honey, we're very proud of you.
You know what that means.
Somebody gets to go to astronomy club.
And I've got good news, too.
After Louise apologized, Dylan came
looking for me to kick my butt again.
Why is that good news?
Cause right when I went
into the turtle position
I put my history book in the back of my
pants, and when Dylan kicked my butt,
shattered his leg in 5 places.
He has to be home-schooled
the rest of the year.
- No. God.
- No, no, no, no!
I'm not gonna ask for anything.
I'm just...
I'm here to apologize for,
like, 6 different things.
Apology accepted.
Look, I'm not this hard-ass, OK?
If we were just friends hangin' out,
I would say, "be a sports deejay.
Go for it."
But I am the boss here,
and everyone at this company, my dad,
is expecting me to fail,
so if I hired the guy
painting the station
to be my on-air guy, I would look like
I didn't know what I was doing.
Why didn't you just tell
me that in the beginning?
I'm sorry. I just haven't gotten used to
crushing people's hopes and dreams.
But now that I've done it, I feel
like I could be pretty good at it.
You know,
if you wanna be a sports deejay,
why don't you just start at the bottom
and work your way up?
Did you start at the bottom?
My situation is entirely different,
because I have a rich father
who gives me things, and you...
You don't.
So, no, I did not work my way up.
Look, if I could do it all over again
I would start at the bottom,
and I'd work my way up.
But I can't. I don't have that kind
of time, so you know what I did?
I took a stab in the dark.
I made a demo,
and I gotta tell you something.
I think it's a damn good one.
All right? And all I ask
is that you just...
Just put me in the mix.
That's it.
- OK. Give me your demo.
- Are you serious?
- Quick, before I change my mind.
- OK, here. Here it is.
OK, you...
Are in the mix.
Congratulations.
That is a big-ass mix.
And I'm in it.
You know why she did that, right?
Team Subs-Addicts"
Mais si elle dit
"t'es trop vaniteux" parce que
le mec croit que
la chanson parle de lui,
et que c'est bien le cas, alors
il est pas vaniteux, il a raison, hein ?
Si je dis oui, on pourra oublier Don't
Fear the Reefer pour toujours ?
Ça me va.
Rabat-joie.
Papa, j'ai eu un problčme ŕ l'école.
Tu veux bien
nous prendre deux bičres ?
- Super. Ça calmera un peu.
- Pas pour toi. Pour moi et lui.
Eh bien...
J'étais en sport, je prenais
ma douche avec les autres mecs.
J'ai glissé sur une savonnette.
Prends plutôt un pack de 6, Mitch.
Alors j'ai essayé de m'agripper ŕ
quelque chose, c'est instinctif,
- hein ?
- Oui.
Et donc,
ce que j'ai attrapé
c'est le truc de Chris Melnick.
Remplis tes poches, Mitch.
Ramčnes-en tant que tu peux.
Maintenant, tous les mecs
m'appellent poignée de porte.
Mon Dieu.
C'est pas bon.
Combien de personnes le savent ?
Les toilettes sont libres,
Poignée de porte.
Ça se répand.
Quel est le problčme ?
Un problčme de surnom.
- Grave ?
- Poignée de porte.
T'as fait quoi, tu t'es agrippé
ŕ la braguette d'un mec ?
- Ça t'es arrivé ?
- Non. Pas moyen.
Mais c'est arrivé ŕ un gamin
de notre lycée.
Il a fini par se tuer.
Oh mon Dieu.
Non, ça ne va pas t'arriver, OK ?
Tu sais,
ce gamin avait
plein d'autres problčmes.
Écoute.
Fiston, c'est pas grave.
Tu vas dépasser ça, OK ?
Faut pas se faire donner un surnom.
Une fois que t'en as un,
c'est pour toute la vie.
On connait pas mal de mecs comme ça.
Branleur.
M. Cacahučtes,
Le gros Mcfatterson
du Connecticut Mcfattersons.
Tu sais quoi,
on a compris.
Fiston, le truc c'est
que tu dois faire quelque chose
pour éliminer ce surnom.
Tu peux te bagarrer, faire
une farce, une fęte légendaire.
Mais faut le faire vite,
avant que le surnom te colle.
D'accord.
Je vais y réfléchir.
OK.
- C'est un bon conseil, branleur.
- La ferme !
- Salut les mecs.
- Tu sais quoi Allison,
ŕ la fęte de Kathy Polasik
et quand j'étais aux toilettes
pendant trčs longtemps,
j'avais mal au ventre.
Tu peux dire ŕ Mitch
que c'était tout ?
Il avait mal au ventre.
C'est ce que tu voulais que je dise,
branleur ?
Voilŕ les affaires de danse de Louise.
Et n'oublie pas
qu'Howard et moi allons
ŕ Santa Fe ce week, t'as les enfants.
Non. Je peux pas.
T'as les enfants parce que
je sors avec Mitch pour sa derničre nuit
avant qu'il reprenne le service.
Je sais pas quoi te dire.
On a déjŕ les billets d'avion.
Je peux garder Louise.
Je suis pas assez grand pour ça ?
Je sais pas, chéri. Tu sais.
Attends.
On ne va sortir que deux heures.
Dans quel genre de problčme
légendaire pourrait-il se mettre ?
Allez, je suis responsable.
Et Louise m'écoute.
Regardez.
Louise, viens chercher ton sac.
Pourquoi tu le ramasses pas ?
J'ai entendu que t'étais fort pour ça.

Curtis, tu sors avec nous ?
On se fait une grosse soirée avant que
grand frčre ne parte ŕ l'étranger.
Bien sűr.
Vous pensez ŕ quoi ?
D'abord, je pensais aller
au Buggy Whip pour de bons steacks,
ensuite, tout droit au Champs
pour un résumé non-stop des sports.
Attends. Attends un peu.
Ta grande fęte de départ
c'est avec de la viande en promo
et des gens qui passent
en uniforme ?
- Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
- C'est comme les marines.
Je sais quoi faire vendredi soir.
Vous allez venir dans un bar
ŕ la marina qui s'appelle
"Un Jeu d'Enfant".
C'est La Mecque des femmes divorcées
de 30 et 40 ans
ne cherchant rien d'autre
que se rouler dans le foin.
Gary, j'adore les steaks,
mais faut reconnaitre
que du sexe garanti
est trčs fascinant.
Tu es divorcé.
Sais-tu combien d'hommes mariés
fantasment ŕ l'idée de coucher
avec plein d'autres femmes ?
T'as le ticket gagnant et tu n'entres
pas dans la chocolaterie avec papy Joe.
Je sais pas. C'est pas mon genre.
Je suis plutôt un mec ŕ relations.
Je veux m'asseoir sur un canapé
avec quelqu'un qui
me laisse regarder ce que veux.
T'as été dans des relations
toute ta vie et elles ont toujours
étaient des échecs.
T'as trompé Stephanie Schaedel
et elle a brűlé tous tes disques.
La moitié de mes disques. Elle a eu
que de Allman brothers ŕ Metallica.
Puis t'es passé ŕ Allison
et elle a pris tout ce que t'avais,
y compris tes CD.
La moitié.
De Nirvana ŕ Zappa.
Tu trouves ça drôle ?
Sortir, ça c'est amusant.
Essayer quelques parfums de glace
ŕ la cuillčre avant de choisir
celui bizarre au chewing-gum
avec des morceaux.
OK, tu sais quoi, vendredi soir,
Un jeu d'enfant, j'en suis.
J'apporterai ma cuillčre.
Voilŕ de quoi je parle.
Et celui qui ne se réveille pas
avec des brűlures de tapis,
des griffures et son nom
écrit sur sa poitrine
est un looser.
On va ętre partis
deux heures, alors,
ne fais rien de trop légendaire,
comme prendre tout le papier toilette
et emballer la maison
du principal, OK ?
Et j'espčre que tu prévois pas
de regarder la derničre page
de ce journal
et d'appeler un de ces numéros
"Pretty Women."
Mitch, ça serait
un peu trop légendaire.
Ne vous inquiétez pas.
Cette histoire de surnom
est sous contrôle.
C'est bien, Tommy.
Faut attraper
cette histoire de surnom par...
Mauvaise analogie.
Bien joué. Allons-y.
Tu connais la différence
entre légendaire et illégal ?
Oui. C'est illégal de voler
la mascotte de l'équipe adverse,
mais c'est légendaire
de la ramener enceinte.
Alors, c'est quoi ton plan,
poignée de porte ?
Regarde ça. J'ai trouvé ce film
dans un sac au garage.
Il est classé "- de 16 ans"
Et ?
Et ?
Je vais ętre le mec qui a des films
"interdit aux - de 16 ans", OK.
Je serais M. Film.
L'homme aux films cochons.
Hoover le pervers.
Ce qui compte, c'est que,
Poignée de porte, ce sera du passé.
C'est quoi le film ? On devrait pas
le regarder pour connaitre le produit ?
Je connais pas, mais
ça s'appelle Candyman,
les jeunes vont aimer.
Pourquoi le mec sur la pochette
ŕ un crochet pour main ?
Je sais pas.
Il a peut-ętre mis
des marshmallows dessus.
On va s'éclater.
Sergent-chef Mitchell Brooks
au rapport sexuel.
On est lŕ pour une aventure d'un soir.
Pas de discussions approfondies,
pas de "on dirait qu'on se connaît
depuis toujours". Et surtout,
pas de vrais noms. On est lŕ
que pour le sexe. Rien de personnel.
Regardez-les, j'ai jamais vu des gens
plus pathétiques.
On dirait des chiens abandonnés
qui collent leurs museaux
contre leurs cages en te suppliant
de les ramener chez toi.
- Que fais-tu ici ?
- Une grosse dispute avec Needleman.
On a peut-ętre rompu, alors...
Je retrouve des amies,
elles sont déjŕ entrées.
Ils acceptent seulement
les femmes accompagnées.
C'est bęte. Ŕ plus.
- D'accord, viens.
- Merci.
Cet endroit déchire.
- Ça va ętre...
- Oui, un jeu d'enfant.
OK, j'ai compris.
J'ai retrouvé mes amies, alors,
puisque je pars plus,
- j'irai prendre les enfants.
- Bien.
Au fait, ton tee-shirt
"Mammographie gratuite"
se voit ŕ travers ta chemise.
Tu peux le lire, pas vrai ?
Toi et moi allons nous envoyer
en l'air, ce soir.
Les mecs, s'il vous plaît.
- Pas devant...
- Melinda.
On va danser.
Ce bar est vraiment différent.
Elle m'a demandé si je porte un caleçon.
Trčs bien, ŕ toi de jouer.
Y a une blonde canon ŕ 3 heures.
Salut. Ça va ?
- Et toi ?
- Trčs bien. Tu viens d'oů ?
Un petit bled
qui s'appelle Lone Pine.
Lone Pine ? Sérieux ?
J'allais tout le temps randonner
avec mon pčre, lŕ-bas.
J'adore la randonnée.
La journée parfaite serait
une longue randonnée, un dîner italien,
et un film de Scorsese.
OK, avant de te demander en mariage,
quel film de Scorsese ?
- Raging Bull.
- Raging Bull.
On peut ętre ŕ Vegas en 4 heures.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
- Quoi ? On discute.
Fais comme la naissance de cheveux
de Tyra Banks. Recule.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
J'essaie de lui apprendre
comment avoir un coup d'un soir.
Un coup d'un soir ?
C'est pas prčs d'arriver.
Excusez-moi,
un autre verre, s'il vous plaît.
Je peux avoir un coup d'un soir.
Non et je vais te dire pourquoi.
T'es routinier.
Une fois que t'as conclu,
t'es comme un rat dans une roue.
Tu t'arrętes jamais,
tant que tu peux.
Ensuite, elle te propose
un canapé confortable,
un frigo plein et un écran géant.
Tu restes jusqu'ŕ ce
que ton cśur explose,
ou ton ventre, ou qu'elle retrouve
la raison et divorce.
T'as tort, tu sais.
Je vais tirer mon coup ce soir
et je partirai le lendemain matin.
Écoute-moi. Si tu couches
avec une femme pręte ŕ te nourrir,
tu quitteras pas son canapé
męme ŕ coup de dynamite.
Dis donc, cet alcool est bourratif.
Tu peux le faire. Je crois en toi.
T'es la personne qui compte le plus
pour moi. Comment ça va, bébé ?
Un coup d'un soir. J'entre, je sors.
- Salut.
- Je suis...
Johnny.
Johnny Steed.
Je suis Leah.
Tu fais quoi, Johnny ?
Je suis peintre. Pompier.
Et inventeur.
C'est sexy.
Je suis infirmičre donc je suis
ŕ l'aise avec le corps humain.
Trčs.
Avant d'aller plus loin,
je te préviens tout de suite,
je cherche rien de sérieux.
- On va chez moi ?
- Je m'appelle Johnny Steed ?
C'est ce que je t'ai dit, non ?
C'est trčs bien.
Oui, je m'amuse beaucoup.
Tu peux éteindre si tu veux.
Pourquoi ? T'as peur ?
Et toi ?
- C'était génial.
- Pour sűr.
Je dois y aller.
- J'ai un truc.
- C'est bon.
- Vas-y.
- Vraiment ? D'accord...
Je voulais pas
que tu crois que c'était seulement...
Un coup d'un soir ?
Ça l'était pas ? Arręte,
on va pas au "Jeu d'Enfant"
pour jouer aux échecs.
C'est vrai. Si t'es d'accord,
on se voit plus tard.
Content de t'avoir connue. Bye.
T'as faim ? Tu veux manger
un bout avant de partir ?
T'as dit quoi ?
Je sais pas. T'as faim ?
Tu veux un sandwich ?
Oui, j'aimerais bien.
Mais je devrais sűrement partir
tout de suite aprčs avoir mangé.
D'accord. Une bičre ?
Oui. T'essaies de faire quoi ?
Rien. J'ai faim.
Je pensais cuisiner.
Regarder Taxi Driver.
D'accord, nourriture, bičre,
Scorsese.
Et tout ça sur ce canapé
scandaleusement confortable ?
Ouais.
Alors, fais gaffe,
parce que papa s'installe.
Mesdemoiselles,
je me suis bien amusé, ce soir.
Malheureusement le sergent-chef
Brooks embarque demain.
Et ma tourelle n'a besoin
que d'un artilleur.
Alors, Melinda, si on s'en allait ?
Je vais juste aller aux toilettes.
Je partage un lit ŕ étage
avec mon neveu.
On en parlera quand tu reviendras.
Toutes mes amies sont maquées.
Męme les filles banales invitées
pour qu'on paraisse plus belles.
Désolé pour ta mauvaise soirée.
Tu devrais voir leurs mecs.
Des espčces d'adulescents
qui boivent,
jouent aux jeux vidéo
et ne cherchent qu'ŕ tirer leur coup.
Dommage qu'elles aient pris
les meilleurs.
Peut-ętre que tous les hommes bien
sont pris.
Tu vas trouver quelqu'un.
D'accord ?
T'es intelligente,
magnifique, sexy.
N'importe quel mec
serait chanceux de t'avoir.
C'est la chose la plus gentille
qu'on m'a dite.
- Voilŕ.
- Merci.
Non, attends. Attends.
C'était qui ?
Ma derničre chance de m'envoyer
en l'air avant de repartir au front.
Mince. Je suis navrée.
Je peux faire quelque chose ?
Il y aurait quelque chose, mais...
je ne pourrais plus jamais
regarder Gary en face.
Ou pourrais-je ?
Candyman ?
Incroyable.
Apocalypse Now et Platoon
ŕ la suite.
Il n'y a pas de maillon faible.
Je commence ŕ préparer le diner
ou tu veux refaire l'amour ?
Et si on faisait les deux ?
Tu sais, si tu continues ŕ me nourrir,
cette robe va devenir un soutif.
Mes parents viennent diner.
J'espčre que ça te dérange pas.
C'est formidable.
Quelle bonne nouvelle. Laisse-moi
aller me rafraichir ŕ la salle de bains.
- Allo ?
- Allison,
c'est moi, Gary.
Je sais pas quoi faire.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Oů es-tu ?
J'ai rencontré
cette fille l'autre soir,
au "Jeu d'enfant ", on est
rentré chez elle, on l'a fait,
tout allait bien, mais ensuite
j'y suis retourné pour un sandwich
puis une bičre, des films
et encore ŕ manger,
et maintenant, ses parents
viennent pour diner de bonne heure.
Quoi ? Gary,
il est 4 h de l'aprčs-midi.
Je sais. J'ai si peur.
Écoute-moi.
D'accord, je sais que chaque fibre
de ton ętre hurle pour que
tu restes sur ce canapé, manges
et fasses l'amour pendant 50 ans.
Les voix sont si fortes.
Réfléchis, Gary.
Réfléchis. Quel a été ton dernier
coup d'un soir ?
Réfléchis-y bien.
Oh mon Dieu, c'était toi.
C'est ça.
Maintenant, avance jusqu'aux disputes,
aux critiques
et ŕ, tu sais, l'abstinence.
Mon avocat.
Ce fils de pute m'a volé.
Bien, bien, Gary. Vas-y.
Je dois partir d'ici.
Merci, Allison.
Bagels ?
Non, je peux pas.
OK. Non, je devrais pas.
C'est du fromage Monterrey Jack ?
Je devrais pas.
Ça va me couper l'appétit.
Pourquoi je peux pas m'en empęcher.
Désolé.
- Toc toc.
- Bonjour, chérie.
Maman, papa, voici Johnny. Il est
peintre-pompier...
Inventeur.
Oui. Bonjour.
Mais je dois y aller. Excusez-moi.
- Tu pars ?
- Oui, je dois aller travailler.
Un samedi ?
Oui, je dois travailler le samedi.
Je dois faire de la peinture
pour une famille juive qui
ne peut pas peindre au Shabbat.
Salut, canapé.
Je t'aime.
Je te quitterai jamais.
Ça s'est bien passé ?
Ouais. J'ai eu un coup d'un soir.
En fait, je suis resté
chez elle jusqu'ŕ 4 h
et j'ai vu ses parents,
mais bon, techniquement...
c'était un coup d'un soir.
Et toi ? Ça a été ?
Eh bien, c'était intéressant.
Ça n'a pas marché avec Melinda,
grâce ŕ ton ex-femme.
Alors, j'ai dű boire 40 litres d'alcool
et j'ai ramené
la derničre femme assise au bar.
Męme pas sűr que c'était une femme.
Ça aurait pu ętre un blaireau
ou une sorte d'opossum.
Et pourtant, je dois te dire que c'était
le meilleur coup que j'ai jamais eu.
Canapé.
Voyons voir, oů on en était ?
Quoi ?
T'as une chips pour moi ?
Je t'aime.
Louise a encore oublié son sac de danse.
Comment ça s'est passé avec la fille ?
Tu te maries encore ?
Parce qu'on pourrait
te graisser pour te faire entrer
dans ton ancien smoking.
Ça s'est bien passé.
C'était un coup d'un soir, mais
je me sens mal. Je suis parti
en courant, comme si j'étais un monstre.
Je te l'avais dit, t'es pas un mec
qui a des coups d'un soir. Et,
ce n'est pas que parce que
tu es un animal qui a ses habitudes.
D'accord, voilŕ. Écoute bien parce que
je ne dirai ça qu'une fois.
T'es un mec gentil.
Ça a vraiment dű te faire mal.
Oui, Gar.
Tom faisait 4,5kg quand il est sorti
et ça a fait moins mal.
Te revoilŕ.
- Johnny, je ne comprends pas...
- Je m'appelle pas Johnny, c'est Gary.
Oh, d'accord. Moi, c'est Kristin.
Je ne recherche pas une relation.
- Moi non plus.
- C'est super.
Mais tu devrais savoir que je suis resté
si longtemps parce qu'il
y avait une combinaison parfaite entre
Scorsese, alcool, nourriture
et mes fesses sur ton canapé
pour les 50 années ŕ venir.
- Oui, je ne veux pas ça.
- Moi non plus.
Alors on est d'accord,
c'était qu'un coup d'un soir ?
- Bien sűr.
- Cool.
- Super.
- D'accord.
Du vin pour toi.
Juste pour m'excuser
d'ętre parti si vite.
Ça ira bien avec le manicoti
que je viens de faire.
- Tu bloques la porte.
- Mais non.
- Mais si.
- Pardon.
Est-ce que...
du pain ŕ l'ail ?
- Ŕ dans quelques mois, frérot.
- OK, fais attention ŕ toi.
D'accord.
Tu t'occupes de ce surnom, compris ?
Pas de problčme, grâce au gamin qui
s'est endormi sur la table de la cour.
Je ne sais pas de quoi il ręvait,
mais son surnom, c'est cadran solaire.
Joli.
- Amuse-toi bien ŕ assiéger le château.
- Merci.
Gary, ferme les yeux.
Gary, tu peux ouvrir les yeux.
Il me fallait juste une image plus belle
dans ma tęte qu'un blaireau.
Adios, amigos.
Dieu bénisse l'Amérique.
Alors, t'as parlé ŕ cette femme ?
Oui. T'avais raison.
Je suis un mec de relations.
- Les coups d'un soir c'est pour Curtis.
- Je suis amoureux.
- Charleen et moi emménageons ensemble.
- Quoi ?
Tu goűtes pas tous les parfums ?
J'ai trouvé mon parfum.
C'est de la menthe au chocolat.
C'est une Irlandaise noire.
Sortez d'ici.
Rendez-moi service, envoyez-moi Mitch.
J'ai oublié un truc.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Team Subs-Addicts"
But if she's saying
"you're so vain" because
the dude thinks the song is about him,
and the song is actually about him, then
he's not vain, he's just right, right?
If I agree with you on this can't we put
"don't fear the reefer" to bed forever?
Fine with me.
Narc.
Hey, dad, I had a problem at school.
Why don't you grab us
a couple of beers, OK?
- Great. That'll take the edge off.
- Not for you. For me and him.
Well...
I was at gym class,
showering with all the guys.
I accidentally slipped on a bar of soap.
Why don't you make it a 6-pack, Mitch?
So I went to reach for something to
brace myself because it's human instinct
- right?
- Right.
And so,
what I grabbed was
Chris Melnick's Junk.
Fill your pockets, Mitch.
Grab as many as you can carry.
Now all the guys are
calling me Doorknob.
Gosh.
That's not good.
How many people know about this?
Bathroom's free, Doorknob.
It's getting out there.
OK, what's the problem?
We got a nickname situation here.
- How bad is it?
- Doorknob.
What did you do, grab a guy's panhandle?
- This happened to you?
- No. No way.
It happened to a kid in
our high school, though.
Ending up killing himself.
Oh, my god.
No, it's not gonna happen to you,
all right? I mean, this
kid had a lot of other stuff going on.
Look.
Son, this isn't a big deal.
You're gonna get past this, OK?
You don't want to get stuck with
a nickname. Once those things catch on,
they'll stick with
for the rest of your life.
I mean, we know a bunch
of those guys. Tugger.
Mr. Peanut,
Fatty Mcfatterson
of the Connecticut Mcfattersons.
You know what,
we get it there, Mitch.
Son, here's the thing.
You have to do something
that will eliminate this nickname.
You either have to get in a fight,
pull a prank, or have a legendary party.
But you got to do it quick
before this nickname sticks. OK?
All right, dad.
I'll think of something.
All right.
- That's solid advice there, tugger.
- Shut up!
- Hey, guys.
- You know what, Allison, all right,
when we went to Kathy Polasik's party
and I was in the bathroom
for a really long time,
I had the stomach ache?
Will you tell Mitch
nothing else was going on in there?
He had a stomach ache.
Is that what you wanted me to say,
tugger?
Gary, this is Louise's dance stuff.
And just a reminder,
howard and I are going to sante
fe this weekend, so you go the kids.
No. No, I don't.
You have the kids 'cause
i'm taking Mitch out for his last night
out before he goes back to active duty.
I don't know what to tell you.
We bought plane tickets already.
I can watch Louise.
Aren't I old enough to baby-sit?
I don't know, honey. I mean.
Wait a minute.
We're only gonna be gone a couple hours.
What kind of legendary trouble
could he possibly get into?
Come on, I'm responsible.
Plus, Louise listens to me.
Watch.
Louise, come pick up your bag.
Why don't you pick it up?
I hear you're good at grabbing stuff.

"Gary Shoots Fish in a Barrel"
VO By :  ¤Aka¤
Team Subs-Addicts"
Curtis, are you coming out with us?
We're, having a big night
out before big brother goes overseas.
Hell yes, man.
What are we thinking about?
First I thought we'd go to the buggy
whip for some nice steaks,
then we head on over to champs
for some nonstop sports highlights.
Wait, wait. Hold on a second.
Your big send-off for him going
to the marines is cut-rate meat
and a bunch of guys
running around in uniform?
- What's wrong with that?
- That is the marines.
Let me tell you what
we're gonna do on friday night?
You and Mitch are gonna
come with me to a bar
down in the Marina called fish
in a barrel.
It is a Mecca for divorced women
n their thirties and forties
looking for nothing more
than a roll in the hay.
Well, Gary, I do love steak,
but I have to admit,
something sounds very
intriguing about guaranteed sex.
Man, you're divorced.
Do you know how many married men
fantasize about sleeping around
with a bunch of different women?
You got the golden ticket,
and you're not even entering
the chocolate factory with grandpa Joe.
I don't know. That's not my scene,
man. I'm a relationship guy.
I just want to sit on the couch
with someone who'll
let me watch whatever I want.
You've been in relationships
your entire life and they've always,
always been a failure.
You cheated on Stephanie Schaedel
and she burnt your entire
record collection.
Half my record collection. She only got
Allman brothers up to Metallica.
Then you move right onto Allison
and she takes everything you've got,
including your CD collection.
Half my CD collection.
Nirvana to Zappa.
Does any of the above
sound fun to you at all?
Dating is the fun part.
Try a few ice cream flavors with
the little spoons before you go for the
weird bubblegum one
with the chunks in it.
All right, you know what, friday night,
fish in a barrel, I'm in.
I'll even bring my little spoon.
All right,
that's what I'm talking about.
Hey, and any guy who doesn't
wake up with Rug Burns,
Claw Marks, and their name
hickied across their chest
is a loser.
We're gonna be gone a couple hours, so,
don't do anything too legendary,
like grab all that extra toilet paper
I bought and T.P
the principal's house, OK?
And I definitely hope
you're not planning
on turning to the back
of this free newspaper
and calling any of these
numbers under "Pretty Women."
Mitch, that might be
a little too legendary, OK?
Guys, don't worry about it.
I got this whole nickname
thing under control, OK.
Hey, attaboy, Tommy.
Way to grab this nickname
thing by the...
You know what, bad analogy.
Good job. Come on, let's go.
You do know the difference
between legendary and illegal, right?
Yeah. It's illegal to steal
the rival high school's mascot,
but it's legendary
to return it pregnant.
So, what's your plan, Doorknob?
Check it out, right. I found
this movie in a bag in the garage.
It's rated "R."
So?
So?
I'm gonna be the guy who gets
rated "R" movies for people, OK.
I'll be Mr. Movie.
The dirty movie man.
Pervert hoover.
The important thing is, Doorknob,
it's gonna be a thing of the past.
What's the movie? Shouldn't we watch
it so we can know your product?
I've never heard of it before, but it's
called candyman,
so kids are gonna like it.
How come the guy on the
cover has a hook for a hand?
I don't know.
Maybe he puts marshmallows
on it or something, right.
This is gonna be great.
Staff sergeant Mitchell Brooks
reporting for booty.
Now, remember, we are only here for
one-night stands. No deep conversations,
no "I feel like I've known you my
whole life," and most importantly,
no real names. You're only here for sex?
No reason to make it personal.
Look at them, I've never seen a more
pathetic group of people in my life.
They're like rescue dogs
pressing their sad faces
against the bar begging you
to take pity and take them home.
- What are you doing here?
- Needleman and I had a big fight.
And, you know,
we may have broken up, so.
Anyway, I'm meeting some friends,
and they're already inside.
Now they're only letting girls in
if they're, you know, with guys, so.
That's terrible for you.
So long.
- All right, Allison, come on.
- Thanks, guys.
This place is going on, man.
- This is gonna be like...
- Yeah, shooting fish in a Barrel.
OK, I get it.
I found my people, so listen,
since i'm not going away,
- i'll pick up the kids later.
- Fine.
And by the way,
your "free mammograms" t-shirt
is showing through your button-down.
You can read it, right?
You and I are gonna have
some sex tonight with women.
Hey, guys, please.
- Not in front of...
- Melinda.
We're gonna go dance.
Man, this bar is totally different.
She asked me if I was wearing underwear.
All right, baby,
let's see your moves here.
Got a smoking hot blonde 3 o'clock.
Hi. How you doing?
- How are you?
- I'm good. Where you from?
A really small town called lone pine.
Lone pine?
Are you kidding me?
Me and my dad used to go there
all the time and we would hike.
I'm a huge hiker.
My god, perfect day would be a long
hike, a big Italian dinner,
then settle in to a Scorse movie.
OK, before I ask you to marry me,
which Scorse movie?
- Raging Bull.
- Raging bull.
We can be in vegas in 4 hours, OK.
- What the hell are you doing?
- What, we're just talking?
OK, I need you to get like tyra
banks' hairline, and back up.
Hey, guys, what's going on?
I'm trying to get my boy here to
learn how to have a one-night stand.
A one-night stand?
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
Excuse me, can I have another
purple veiner, please?
Hey, I can have a one-night stand.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you why.
'cause you are a creature of habit.
Once sex is made available to you,
you're like a rat hitting a feeder bar.
You'll just keep doing it over
and over as long as she'll let you.
And then, god forbid,
she throws in a comfortable couch,
a full refrigerator,
and a big-screen TV. I mean,
you know, you're not going
anywhere till your heart explodes,
you eat yourself to death, or she comes
to her senses and divorces your ass.
You're wrong, OK.
I going to have sex with a woman tonight
and I will be out of there by morning.
Listen to me, Gary. If you have sex
with a woman who is willing to feed you,
they won't be able to blow you
off her couch with dynamite.
Man, these purple veiners
like really fill you up.
You can do this, man, OK.
You're my boy.
And I care about you more than anybody
in the whole world. What's good, baby?
All right, one-night stand.
I'm in, I'm out.
- Hello yourself.
- My name's...
Johnny.
Johnny Steed.
I'm Leah.
What do you do, Johnny?
I'm a painter. Fireman.
And I'm an inventor.
That is sexy.
I'm a nurse,
so I'm comfortable with the human body.
Very.
Look, Leah, before we go any further,
i'm just gonna tell you right out
i'm not looking for anything long-term.
- You want to go back to my place?
- Is my name Johnny Steed?
That's the name I told you, right?
This is really good.
Yeah, I'm really enjoying this.
You could turn it off if you want.
Why?
Are you scared?
Are you?
- That was amazing.
- You're not kidding.
Hey, listen, I have to get.
- You know, I got this thing.
- It's fine.
- You can just go.
- Really? OK. I just, as
long you're sure. I wanted to make sure
you didn't think that I was in...
What, a one-night stand?
Isn't that what it was? I mean, come on,
it's not like we were both at fish
in a Barrel for the halibut sliders.
That's true. So
if it's OK with you, i'll see you later.
And, nice to know you. Bye-bye.
Hey, are you hungry? Do you want
something to eat before you go?
What did you say?
I don't know. Are you hungry?
You want a sandwich?
Yes, I would like a sandwich.
But then I she probably leave this place
immediately after the sandwich is done.
All right.
Want a beer with that?
Yeah, that'd be what
are you trying to do?
Nothing. I'm hungry.
I thought I'd make some food.
You know, watch Taxi Driver.
All right, food,
beer, Scorse.
And you're gonna be doing all that on
this ridiculously comfortable couch?
That's the plan.
Well, then you watch out,
'cause papa bear's moving in.
So, ladies,
I have had a lot of fun tonight.
But unfortunately staff sergeant
Brooks is shipping out tomorrow.
And my turret only needs one gunner.
So, Melinda,
what do you say we get out of here?
I'm just gonna go to
the little girls' room.
Now, I do share a bunk
bed with my nephew.
So, we'll talk about
that when you get back.
All my girlfriends hooked up.
Even the kind of homely one they invited
to make the rest of us look good.
I'm sorry you had a tough night, al.
And you should see the guys
that my friends picked.
They're these grown-up
man-children who drink and
play video games
and are just looking to score.
I'm sorry they got all the good ones.
Maybe there aren't any good men left.
Kiddo, you're gonna find somebody.
All right?
You're smart.
You're gorgeous.
You're sexy.
And anybody in the world
would be lucky to have you.
That is like the sweetest
thing I have ever heard.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
No. Hey, wait.
Hold on a second. Wait, wait.
Who was that?
Just my last chance of getting
laid before I go off to war.
Gosh. Mitch, I'm,
I'm sorry.
Is there anything I can do to fix it?
Well, there is, but...
I could never look
Gary in the eye again.
Or could i?
Candyman?
Unbelievable.
Apocalypse Now and Platoon
broken up by fast times.
I mean, there's no weak link.
So, should I get dinner started,
or do you want to have sex again?
Well, how about we do both?
You know, if you keep feeding me,
this robe's gonna turn into a bra.
My parents are coming over for dinner.
I hope you don't mind.
That's terrific.
That's great news. Let me, let me go
to the restroom then and freshen up.
- Hello?
- Allison,
it's me, Gary.
I don't know what to do.
Gary, what's the matter?
Where are you?
Well, I met that girl
at the place we were at,
that fish in a Barrel thing
we came to her house and we did it
and then everything was all right, but
then I came back in for like a sandwich
and that led to beer and movies
and then more food,
and now I think her parents are
coming over for an early supper.
What? Gary,
it's like 4:00 in the afternoon.
I know.
I'm so scared.
Listen to me.
All right, I know every fiber
of your being is screaming
you to stay on that coutch eat and
have sex for the next 50 years or so...
The voices are so loud.
Think, Gary.
Think. Think. What was the last
one-night stand you had?
Really think about that.
Oh, my god, it was you.
That's right.
Now fast-forward to the nagging
and the criticizing and the,
you know, withholding of sex.
My lawyer.
That son of a bitch robbed me.
Good, good, Gary.
Go with that.
I gotta get out of here.
Thank you, Allison.
It's Bagel?
No, I can't.
OK. No, I shouldn't.
Is that monterey Jack Cheese?
I shouldn't.
I'll probably ruin my appetite.
Why do I keep reaching for these. Sorry.
- Knock-knock.
- Hi, honey.
Mom, dad, this is Johnny. He's a
painter-fireman...
Inventor.
Yeah. Hello.
But I have to go. Excuse me.
- You're leaving?
- Yes, I have to go to work.
On a saturday?
Yes, on a saturday I have to work.
I have to paint for
a Jewish family who won't
paint for themselves on Shabbat.
Hello, couch.
I love you.
I'll never leave you.
How'd it go, stud?
Good. I had a one-night stand.
I mean, well, I stayed
at her house until 4:00 in the afternoon
and I met her parents,
but, you know, hey, technically, I...
It was a one-night stand.
How about you?
How'd it go?
Well, things got interesting.
It didn't work out with Melinda,
thanks to your ex-wife.
So I drank about 10 gallons of alcohol
and took home the very last woman
sitting at the bar.
I'm not even sure if she was a woman.
She might have been like a badger
or a possum of some kind.
Tell you what, though, she was about
the best damn lover I've ever had.
Couch.
Let's see, where did we leave off?
What?
You have a cheeto for me?
I love you.
Louise forgot her dance bag again.
Yeah. How'd it go with the girl?
You getting married again?
'cause, we could always
grease you up and squeeze
you into your old tux.
It went good. I mean, I had
a one-night stand, but
I feel terrible. I had to run out of
there. It made me feel like real creep.
I told you, you're not
a one-night stand kind of guy. And
it's not just because
you're a creature of habit. It's also...
All right, here I go. Listen good
'cause I'm only gonna say this once.
You're a nice guy.
That really had to hurt.
It did, Gar.
Tom was 10 pounds, came out sideways,
and that hurt a lot less.
Hey, you're back.
- Johnny, I don't understand...
- No. My name's not Johnny. It's Gary.
- Oh, good.
- 'cause mine's Kristin.
I'm not looking for a relationship.
- Neither am i.
- That's great.
But you should know the only reason
I stayed as long as I did is cause there
a perfect combination of Scorsese,
alcohol, and food where
my butt will be on your couch
for the next 50 years.
- Yeah, I don't want that.
- I don't want that, either.
So, let's just agree
that we had a one-night stand?
- Sure.
- Cool.
- Great.
- All right.
I got you some wine.
Just to say, you know,
sorry for leaving so quickly.
This will go great with
the Manicotti I just made.
- You're blocking the door.
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.
- Sorry.
Do...
garlic bread?
- I'll see you in couple of months bro.
- All right, man. Be safe.
All right.
You take care
of that nickname, you hear?
Not a problem thanks to the kid who fell
asleep on picnic table in the courtyard.
I don't know what he was dreaming about,
but his new nickname is Sundial.
Nice.
- Well, have fun storming the castle.
- Thanks.
Hey, Gary, close your eyes.
Gary, you can open your eyes.
I just needed a prettier image
in my head than the badger.
Adios, amigos.
God bless America.
So did you talk to that woman?
Yeah. You were right.
I'm more of a relationship guy.
- One-night stands, that's Curtis thing.
- I'm in love.
- Charleen and I are moving in together.
- What?
What happened to
tasting all the flavors?
I guess I found my flavor.
Turns out it's mint chocolate chip.
She's black irish.
You guys get out of here.
Hey, do me a favor, send Mitch in.
I forgot something.
What's up, bro?
Team Subs-Addicts"
Et dans la dernière partie
de l'émission, je vous dirai
ce qu'il y a de mieux dans
le beach-volley féminin. Un indice :
ça rime avec "fichons fautillants".
Ça devrait garder les singes heureux
pendant les pubs.
Ce mec du sport, Vic,
un mot lui va bien.
Ça rime avec "connard".
Merde, ça sera pas pareil sans toi.
J'y crois pas qu'il t'ait fallu que
6 semaines pour peindre 150 m².
J'ai traîné
pour que Sacha me mette à l'antenne.
J'ai utilisé tous les trucs
du manuel de l'entrepreneur.
J'ai adoré quand tu lui as dit qu'il
fallait une couche sous la sous-couche.
C'était bon.
Et le jour que j'ai passé
à nettoyer une brosse ?
Les mecs, Curtis. On a un problème
avec la police dehors.
Et tu imagines tout de suite
que c'est à cause de moi ?
- Post-racial, mon cul.
- Non, c'est Vic, il a été arrêté.
Apparemment, il s'est exposé
en ville.
C'est... c'est horrible.
Aux animaux.
Là, c'est bizarre.
Les animaux s'en rendent compte ?
Comment un animal peut signaler ça ?
Ils ont une vidéo
de sécurité du zoo.
Il était devant la cage des gorilles
et je sais pas qui a commencé...
Pourquoi j'explique ça ?
Curtis, tu dois finir l'émission.
- On a 30 secondes.
- Sacha, laissez-moi faire.
- Désolée.
- Quoi ? Allez.
Vous avez écouté ma démo, vous savez
que je suis bon. Laissez-moi faire.
C'est pas un camp de radio fantaisiste,
on est à l'antenne.
Désolé, mec.
Je suis l'ingénieur,
celui qui connait l'émission.
C'est logique que
je prenne la relève.
Je dois le faire.
- À toi.
- Je peux pas le faire.
- Quoi ?
- Je sais pas quoi dire.
Tu sais pas quoi dire ?
T'as passé tout le matin à parler
du nombre de livres tu pourrais lancer
sur le cul de Kim Kardashian.
Sacha, laissez-moi le faire.
Bon, désolé Curtis.
Salut tout le monde,
je suis Gary Brooks.
Vic sera de retour dans deux...
mois ?
Je peux pas exactement
vous dire pourquoi,
mais disons que ça rime avec
"se basturber devant des borilles".
Bon, on va parler de sport.
J'ai lu dans le journal ce matin,
qu'une coureuse sud-africaine
a été testée positive
à des parties féminines...
et masculines, donc elle est
bannie des courses féminines.
Je pense que c'est horrible.
Elle devrait être saluée.
Si j'avais aussi des deux sexes,
je sortirais pas assez longtemps
de chez moi pour m'entraîner.
Trop d'options, désolé.
C'est comme un groupe
d'un seul homme.
T'en as marre de taper sur la batterie,
tu changes pour la flûte à bec.
C'est...
Mon nom est Gary Brooks
et c'est Le Score.
- C'était comment ?
- Merci, Gary.
Oubliez les horreurs
que j'ai dites sur vous.
- Vous ne m'avez jamais rien dit.
- "Sur vous", pas "à vous".
Attendez,
je vous ai fait une faveur.
Pourquoi ne pas m'en faire une ?
Laissez-moi finir la matinée
à l'antenne.
- Je sais pas...
- Temps mort.
Je vous ai sauvé l'affaire.
Je suis bon et vous le savez.
Je la ferme jamais
et je me suis exposé qu'une fois
à un animal, en pissant
dans un buisson abritant
un raton laveur très indigné.
D'accord, vous avez une chance.
Demain matin.
Merci !
T'avais pas peur du tout, pas vrai ?
Je t'en prie.

Team Subs-Addicts"
Ce serait génial de faire une émission
ensemble. Je croyais que ma vie
avait culminé à la découverte
des crevettes déjà décortiquées.
Ça va être comme au bon vieux temps.
Tu seras le lanceur,
moi l'attrapeur.
Je voulais pas dire ça comme ça.
Plus comme au rugby.
Tu lanceras les balles
et je les recevrai.
Pas non plus comme ça.
Les voilà.
- Comment on dit, mec ?
- Je vais à la salle de bains.
Un homme en mission, je comprends.
Papa, pour la semaine
de bénévolat à l'école,
je vais envoyer une cassette vidéo
à tonton Mitch
et aux marines de son unité.
Alors, pense à ce que tu vas dire.
Bien sûr. C'est super, chérie.
Le bénévolat fait du bien.
Et c'est des crédits en plus
et je m'intéresse qu'à ça...
Avant qu'Allison arrive, ne lui parle
pas de mon audition à la radio.
Quoi ?
Parce qu'elle dira
"pourquoi tu lâches
un bon boulot de peintre
avec un revenu fixe
pour suivre un rêve de radio
qui paie la moitié ?"
En fait, c'est un tiers.
C'est pour ça que Vic a dû prendre
un deuxième boulot au zoo.
Écoute, j'ai rendez-vous
chez le docteur demain,
je peux pas amener les enfants
à l'école. Tu peux, toi ?
Non, je peux pas, car j'ai...
pour être honnête,
j'ai d'autres projets.
Et tu ne veux pas m'en parler.
Ça veut dire quoi ?
Tu veux regarder un match ?
Tester un stand de hot dog ?
Non, je...
Et si je suivais un
cours intéressant ?
Y a la première d'un film
de zombies demain ?
Qu'est-ce que ça peut être ?
Ça doit être quelque
chose de stupide.
D'accord, j'amènerai les enfants
à l'école. Barre-toi.
Gary, encore une chose.
Je m'inquiète pour Tom. Il passe
beaucoup de temps aux toilettes
ces derniers temps et même si je sais
que c'est normal pour
son âge
de faire des choses.
Il est un peu anxieux
et sur la défensive, donc...
OK, tu veux que je lui parle ?
Parce que je suis très à l'aise
avec le corps humain.
Ouais, je l'ai compris l'été
qu'on a passé au lac.
Un mec peut pas avoir
un bronzage intégral ?
Je parlerai à Tommy.
Je lui dirai ce que mon père m'a dit,
que chaque fois que tu le fais,
une fenêtre dans l'espace s'ouvre
et des guerriers spirituels
sortent et propagent
le bonheur et la connaissance.
- Il prenait combien de drogues ?
- Beaucoup.
Je sais pas combien,
mais j'étais le seul dont le père
a transformé
une petite voiture en pipe.
Rappelle-toi les enfants demain
et j'imagine que c'est oui,
tu parleras à Tom.
Je veux pas qu'il pense
que c'est honteux
et à faire caché
dans la cabane à outils.
Tu vas faire quoi ?
Amener tes enfants à l'école
bousille ton audition.
Je vais pas amener mes enfants.
Quelqu'un le fera
car l'école a organisé
un arbre téléphonique
pour le covoiturage. Tu appelles un nom
sur la liste, s'il peut pas,
il appelle le suivant, jusqu'à ce que
quelqu'un amène tes enfants à l'école.
En quoi c'est un arbre ?
Si chaque personne appelle
la suivante,
qui appelle la suivante,
c'est une chaîne,
Une chaîne téléphonique.
Ils appellent ça
l'arbre téléphonique.
Crois-moi, si quelqu'un appelle
plusieurs personnes,
c'est un arbre, avec des branches.
Ça va t'obséder toute la journée ?
Non. Je vais me chercher une bière.
Un train téléphonique.
Un torrent téléphonique.
Un arbre est la seule chose
inappropriée.
- Sors de la salle de bains !
- Oui, une minute.
T'as dit ça y a 5 minutes.
Qu'est-ce que tu fiches ?
Peu importe ce qu'il fait,
tu veux vraiment le savoir ?
- D'accord.
- Prépare-toi pour l'école.
Ça suffit.
Allez, ton chauffeur est là.
On y va !
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe, là-dedans ?
- Je veux pas en parler.
- Tu peux te mêler de tes affaires ?
- T'es pas forcé d'en parler.
C'est pas grave.
Tout le monde passe par là.
Je suis passé par là,
ton oncle aussi.
Je passe par rien du tout.
Alors, arrête.
Du calme. Si jamais tu découvres
un nouveau passage excitant
dans ta vie,
sache que chaque homme
sur cette planète
a apprécié ce passage,
encore et encore.
Maintenant, va à l'école et console-toi
en sachant que ça finit très bien.
Michael Vick est de retour à la NFL,
et oui, il a fait son temps
en prison,
mais je pense pas que ça va
se savoir avant qu'il affronte
la ligne défensive des Pit Bulls
que quelqu'un l'insulte.
Dis aux auditeurs d'appeler.
N'oubliez pas d'appeler.
Ici Gary Brooks. Vous écoutez The Score.
Parlons un peu sport.
Tout sauf le football.
Et n'appelez pas pour me dire
à quel point c'est génial.
Vous dites toujours, "Arrêtez,
c'est le sport le plus populaire
au monde." Et alors ?
Coldplay est le groupe
le plus populaire au monde,
mais je me gênerais pas
pour brûler un CD des Nickelback
et frapper Chris Martin avec.
Un appel, ligne 1.
Allie à Marvista, qui est contrariée.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Mon abruti d'ex-mari présente
une émission de radio
et l'arbre téléphonique m'a appelée
pour me demander d'emmener
mes enfants à l'école.
C'est dingue.
Tu peux ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fiches
à la radio pendant
que les enfants attendent
leur transport ?
Je t'expliquerai, mais tu m'appelles
en pleine émission.
Désolée, je te dérange ?
Je n'ai qu'une question.
C'est quoi, cette émission ?
The Score avec Gary Brooks !
T'es la 1re à nous appeler, alors,
tu gagnes une figurine
de Kobe Bryant. Voilà pour toi.
On t'envoie ça tout de suite.
Tu vis toujours aux portes de l'enfer ?
J'en reviens pas
que tu ne m'aies rien dit.
Ta réaction est la raison
pour laquelle je ne t'ai rien dit.
J'ai qu'une chance,
et je voulais pas
que tu la gâches comme
notre mariage, le sexe
ou la fin des films.
C'est pas mon intention.
Mais une nouvelle carrière, maintenant ?
Tu gagneras autant
qu'en étant peintre ?
J'en sais rien. Certainement.
Je comprends pas.
T'as un bon travail,
tu gagnes bien ta vie.
Pourquoi tirer un trait dessus ?
Et pour info, j'ai pas gâché
la fin du film exprès.
J'ai juste deviné que Goose mourrait
à l'entraînement et Maverick survivrait.
Tu sais quoi ?
Pour une fois, dans ma vie,
j'ai le contrôle, ici,
alors, je raccroche.
Garde-la.
Les gens adorent. Le téléphone clignote
comme un sapin de Noël.
Un autre appel. Keith de Burbank.
Keith, qu'as-tu à dire ?
Je déteste quand les femmes
racontent la fin des films.
Ma nana faisait ça.
Sauf que c'était pas vraiment
ma nana, mais une inconnue.
Si je laissais la parole à Allison ?
Pourquoi vous gâchez
la fin des films ?
Arrête. La moitié de ceux
que j'aurais gâchés, Stephen Baldwin
s'en était déjà chargé.
On peut en discuter plus tard ?
J'aimerais bien.
Mais on a un autre appel.
Voyons voir.
Stu de Valencia. T'es à l'antenne.
J'ai écouté votre discussion.
Je pense que tous les deux
avez de bons arguments,
et j'ai qu'une chose à dire : Allison,
ta voix est sexy.
Tu sais quoi, Allison ?
Tu penses que mon rêve est dingue,
mais si j'essaie pas maintenant,
ce sera quand ?
Certainement plus jamais.
C'est ma chance,
on m'apprécie,
et des mecs comme Keith,
ceux qui bossent dur
pour vivre, ceux
qui se défoncent tous les jours,
savent de quoi je parle.
Toute ma vie, j'ai fait mon devoir,
et aujourd'hui, j'ai enfin la chance
de faire ce qui me plaît.
Allison, pour que je comprenne bien
ta position,
tu fais, quoi ? Du 90 B ?
Va te faire voir.
On peut avoir une conversation
d'adultes, s'il te plaît ?
Oui, c'est très mature.
Tu sais quoi ?
Pour une fois,
j'aurais aimé te parler...
Tu sais quoi ?
J'ai raison et t'as tort.
Allie de Marvista.
Ici Gary Brooks,
et vous écoutez The Score.
Mon Dieu.
Désolé. J'ignorais
qu'Allison appellerait pour tout gâcher.
C'était génial.
Vraiment ? Mon Dieu, c'est super !
Je vais devoir faire écouter ça
à mes patrons
mais je pense
que je peux le leur vendre.
Bien joué, champion.
C'était génial.
Le standard a explosé.
La plupart te soutenait,
quelques mecs
voulaient son numéro.
Et des fans de Nickelback te foutraient
une raclée s'ils étaient plus nombreux.
Et dire que ça va se réaliser !
C'est rien de le dire !
Tu vas être au top,
et je serai juste en dessous de toi.
Pas comme ça.
Bonjour, KPPQ ?
Je m'appelle Steve Karisnowski
et je vous téléphone
car j'ai vraiment adoré le mec
à l'antenne, ce matin.
Je crois qu'il s'appelle Gary Brooks.
Karisnowski.
"K"...
Comme ça se prononce.
Allô ?
KPPQ ? C'est Christopher Walken.
J'appelle à cause de ce mec
à l'antenne, ce matin.
Je crois qu'il s'appelle
Gary Brooks.
D'habitude, j'écoute pas
les émissions sportives mais...
je suis fan !
Gardez-le. Je l'aime bien.
- Salut.
- Hé, voilà ma plus grande fan !
Pourquoi t'as appelé
pendant l'émission ?
Toi, qu'est-ce qui t'a pris ?
D'un coup, t'es une star de la radio ?
Pourquoi tu m'as rien dit ?
Je savais que tu serais contre.
C'est ton job
de me pourrir la vie.
Tu prends même un malin plaisir
à pourrir mes zones inaccessibles.
Écoute, je m'excuse.
Je m'excuse d'avoir mal réagis.
T'étais à la radio, et j'ai paniqué
à me demander
comment on allait s'en sortir.
Gary, c'est une toute petite radio.
Tu gagneras autant à la radio
qu'en étant peintre ?
Pas au début.
Mais après quelque temps,
quand j'aurais mes auditeurs,
j'en serai même pas proche.
Il y a quelque chose
que je ne t'ai pas dit.
Ça fait six mois
qu'on a pas couché ensemble.
Non, tu te souviens il y a 2 mois,
on a envoyé ce dossier d'inscription
pour qu'elle intègre le programme
de l'orchestre philharmonique de LA ?
Oui, t'avais dit
que c'était super cher
et prestigieux.
Mais qu'elle serait jamais prise.
Elle l'est.
Bien sur que oui.
Elle est si douée pour tout.
Écoute-moi, ce programme musical,
ça va être lourd,
même sur ton salaire de peintre,
mais si tu arrêtes et te mets
à gagner moins,
je sais pas si on pourra le payer.
Et je sais que c'est bizarre
que je dise ça, parce que
je ne contribue pas autant,
- mais...
- tu veux dire, 0 dollar ?
Mon Dieu, Gary,
si tu veux mettre un chiffre.
Écoute, c'est... c'est horrible.
Ce truc à la radio, c'est mon rêve.
Mais je peux pas faire ça à Louise.
C'est trop important pour elle.
Il est temps de dire quelque chose
à oncle Mitch et à son unité.
Mitch. C'est ton petit frère.
Rentre vite. On t'aime.
Le lit superposé de Tommy t'attend.
Je voulais juste te remercier
toi et ton unité
pour votre engagement.
Et, faites attention à vous.
Parce que je veux te serrer fort
dans mes bras quand tu reviens.
Merci. Il va vraiment adorer ça.
Tu veux dire quelque chose à Mitch ?
Je peux avoir un peu de paix ?
Tom veut la paix, oncle Mitch.
- Salut. Ça va ?
- Salut. Allie.
Alors, écoute, on voulait te parler.
Je crois que je devrais lui dire.
C'est surement mieux
si ça vient d'un pote.
- Quoi qu'il en soit, ça a pas marché.
- Sasha a vraiment essayé, mais les mecs
d'en haut n'ont pas réagi à l'émission.
Je suis désolé.
Eh bien.
C'est tout moi ça.
C'était idiot d'avoir autant d'espoir.
Je suis désolée, Gar.
Et ils ont aussi dit,
je me fous de toi, mec.
- Ils t'ont adoré !
- Quoi ?
Ils vous ont adoré, Gary.
Félicitations. Vous êtes le nouvel
animateur sportif de KPPQ.
Vous auriez dû voir votre tête.
On aurait cru
que votre cœur s'était brisé.
Dites-lui comment ça s'est passé.
J'ai donné la cassette à la direction
et ils se sont enflammés.
Vous étiez nerveux et drôle,
vous saviez de quoi vous parliez.
Et puis, j'ai souligné que
ce serait le genre d'émission qu'hommes
et femmes écouteraient, ce qui m'a valu
d'avoir l'air d'être un génie.
Alors, qu'en dites-vous ?
Je vais devoir dire non.
Oui !
Attendez. Quoi ?
Désolé, je ne peux pas. Désolé
Attendez un peu.
Laissez-moi être directe.
Ce pour quoi vous m'avez harcelée
pendant ces 6 dernières semaines,
vous dites que vous n'en voulez plus ?
Vous êtes quoi ?
Un gamin ?
- Écoutez, je ne peux pas, désolé.
- Gary, vous devez le faire.
Pas seulement parce que j'aurais l'air
d'une cruche si je le dis à mon patron,
mais parce que
vous êtes fait pour ça.
Je n'ai jamais vu personne s'amuser
comme vous vous êtes amusé
en étant à la radio.
On aurait dit que vous brilliez.
Et je ne sais pas si j'ai déjà
ressenti ça dans ma vie.
Ma... ma fille
a l'opportunité de faire une chose
vraiment incroyable
et ça ne pourra pas marcher
avec un salaire de DJ,
alors je ne peux pas
Je suis désolé.
Je peux pas.
- Ça me fait de la peine d'entendre ça.
- Attendez. Sasha.
Gary, je peux te parler une minute ?
Quoi ?
- Tu dois prendre le boulot.
- Je peux pas.
Comment on va payer pour Louise ?
Je sais pas. Gary, On verra bien.
On fera des économies.
Je sais pas, mais tu dois le faire.
Ça te rendra vraiment heureux.
C'est un piège ?
Non, Gary. Tu n'y croiras peut-être pas,
mais je veux que tu sois heureux.
Et pas seulement
parce que tu comptes pour moi.
Mais parce que si t'es heureux,
Gary,
la famille est heureuse.
Et quoi de plus inspirant
pour les enfants que de voir leur père
faire quelque chose qu'il adore ?
On va faire en sorte que ça marche.
Oui...
Il y a écrit "piège" de partout.
Écoutez tous.
Désolé, j'ai vraiment essayé
mais il ne veut pas.
Quoi ? Il abandonne ?
C'est la chance de sa vie.
J'arrive pas à croire
qu'il la gâche.
Et c'est pour ça, que je la gâche pas.
Je me moque de vous ! Je vais le faire !
- Je suis le nouveau mec des sports.
- C'est tellement super !
N'hésitez pas à appeler autant
que vous voulez, d'accord ?
Vous pensez que vous pouvez trouver
un sujet de dispute par jour ?
Je ne sais pas.
Ça serait un peu dur, mais
on s'en sortira une fois
que la caméra tournera.
Mais y a pas de caméras.
C'est de la radio.
Je savais que t'allais dire ça.
Dès que j'ai dit le mot "caméra,"
j'ai su que t'allais me corriger
devant mes amis.
C'est... C'est parfait.
C'est parfait.
J'adore.
Bienvenue à bord.
Eh bien, félicitations, Gary.
- Enfin ton émission.
- J'ai mon émission !
Comme on avait dit.
Ça va être toi et moi.
OK ? Tu seras la saucisse
dans ma brioche. Mais pas comme ça.
Je dois te remercier.
Si tu ne m'avais pas cassé les couilles
mon rêve ne se serait jamais réalisé.
Non ! Oh, mon Dieu, c'est terrible !
Oh, mon Dieu.
Quoi ?
Ça peut pas se finir comme ça !
Quoi ?
- Chéri, tu n'aimes pas la fin ?
- Oh, mon Dieu !
Gary, appelle un médecin.
Il pleure. Il pleure.
D'accord, ça suffit là.
Tommy, je vais entrer.
Allez.
Ça suffit. Je vais...
Gary, ne rigole pas.
Ça pourrait lui faire du mal.
Oh, mon Dieu. Tu ne croiras jamais
ce qu'il faisait là dedans.
Il lit Sur la route de Madison
Je voulais que personne ne le sache.
- Chéri, c'est le livre le plus triste.
- Oui, je sais.
- Et papa a dit que ça finissait bien.
- Eh oui.
C'est un soulagement, non ?
C'est bizarre qu'il lise
ce genre de livre aux toilettes.
J'espère que quand il fera l'autre truc,
il ne le fera pas à la bibliothèque.
Team Subs-Addicts"
And in the final segment of this show,
I will tell you
the best thing about women's beach
volleyball here's a clue:
it rhymes with
"founcing foobies." Hello!
That oughta keep the monkeys
happy during commercial.
That sports guy Vic?
There's a word for him.
It, rhymes with "Jackass."
Damn it. It's not gonna be
the same without you here, man.
I can't believe it only took you
6 weeks to paint 500 square feet.
I admit I was probably stalling
cause I wanted Sasha to notice me
and put me on the air.
I used every trick in the contractor's
stalling handbook.
No, man, I loved it when you convinced
her that the primer need a primer.
That was good.
How about the day
I spent washing that brush?
Guys. Curtis, we've got
a police situation outside.
What, so you immediately assume
it has something to do with me?
- Post-racial, my ass.
- No. It's Vic. He's being arrested.
All right, apparently, he's been
walking around town exposing himself.
That's... that's terrible.
To animals.
Look, that's just weird.
Do the animals Even know?
I mean, how does an animal
report something like that?
They have him on
security tape at the zoo.
He was in front of the gorilla cage,
and I don't know who started it...
Why am I explaining this?
OK, Curtis, I need you to
get in there and wrap it up.
- We've got 30 seconds.
- Sasha, let me do it.
- I'm sorry.
- What? Come on.
You've heard my demo. You know
I'm good. Let me do it. Come on.
This is not a radio fantasy camp.
We're on the air here.
I'm so sorry, man.
It's just, i'm the engineer.
I'm the guy who knows the show.
So, it only makes sense
that I take over, you know?
I gotta do it.
- You're on.
- I can't do it.
- What?
- I can't think of anything to say.
You can't think of anything to say?
You spent all morning talking about
how many books you could
balance on kim Kardashian's ass.
Sasha, let me do it. I'll do it.
All right. Sorry, Curtis.
Hey, everybody, I'm,
well, my name's Gary.
Vic will be back in a couple of...
Months?
I can't tell you the reason why,
exactly,
but let's just say it rhymes with
"basturbating in front of borillas."
OK, so,
we're gonna talk some sports here.
I read in the newspaper this morning
that, that south African runner,
well, she tested positive
for having both male and female
parts, and now, she's banned
from competing as a woman.
I think that's terrible. They
she should be saluted. That's what...
If I had male and female parts,
I wouldn't be able to leave
my house long enough to train.
Just too many options there, I'm sorry.
It's like,
it's like being a one-man band.
You get tired of banging your drum,
you move over to the slide whistle.
That's...
Anyway, my name is Gary Brooks
and that's the score.
How was that?
Thank you, Gary.
Forget all the horrible
things I ever said about you.
- Never said anything horrible to me.
- I said, "about you," not "to you."
Wait a minute.
I just did something good for you.
Why don't you do something nice for me?
Let me finish
the morning here on the air?
- I don't know...
- Time out.
I just saved your bacon.
I'm good. You know I'm good.
You know I never shut up,
and the only time I ever expose myself
to an animal is when I was peeing
in a bush that was housing
a very indignant raccoon.
OK, you get one shot.
Tomorrow morning.
Thank you!
You were not scared at all, were you?
You are welcome.

Team Subs-Addicts"
How great will it be if we get to do
a show together? God, I thought my life
peaked when I found out you could
buy shrimp that was already peeled.
Yeah, it's gonna be
just like the old days, man.
You're gonna be the pitcher
and I'm gonna be the catcher.
I mean not like that, not like that.
I mean,
it's more like it's more like football.
You know, you'll be throwing
balls and I'm the receiver.
Not like that, either.
Hey, there they are.
- What's the word, my man?
- I'll be in the bathroom.
That's a man on a mission. I get that.
Hey, dad.
For volunteer week at school,
i'm gonna video tape greetings from us
to uncle Mitch
and the marines in his unit.
So, think of something to say.
OK, I will. That's great, sweetheart.
Yeah, it feels good to volunteer.
Plus, it's extra credit
and I'm all over that, so.
Hey, before Allison comes in, don't
tell her about my radio audition, OK?
Why not?
Because Allison will say something like,
"why are you gonna
give up a good painter's job
"with a steady income
"to follow a radio pipe dream"
that pays half as much?"
Actually, it's 1/3 as much.
That's why Vic had to take
that second job at the zoo.
Gary, listen, I have a doctor's
appointment tomorrow,
so I can't drive the kids to school.
Can you do car pool?
No, I can't because i
you know, I'll be honest with you.
I have something else planned.
Something you're not willing to tell me.
So, what does that mean?
A game you want to watch?
A hot dog stand you haven't tried?
No, I...
How do you know I'm not taking
a new interesting class?
Is there a new zombie
movie opening tomorrow?
I mean, what...
What could it be?
It has to be something,
and something stupid.
All right, I'll take the kids to school,
all right? Just get out.
Gary, just one more thing.
I'm concerned about Tom. He's been
spending a lot of time in the bathroom
lately and, even though
I know it's appropriate for
boys his age to
do things,
He's been acting a little
anxious and defensive, so.
OK, all right.
You want me to talk to him?
'cause I'm very comfortable
with the human body.
Yeah, Curtis, I got that the summer
we all spent at the lake.
OK, so, now,
a guy can't get an all over tan?
I'll talk to Tommy, OK?
I'll just tell him what my dad told me,
that every time you do it,
a window in space opens up
and spiritual warriors
come out and they spread
happiness and awareness.
- How many drugs did your dad do?
- A lot.
I'm not sure exactly how many,
but I was the only kid whose dad
made a pipe out
of his pinewood derby car.
All right, just,
just rember car pool tomorrow,
and I'm assuming that's a "Yes"
on talking to Tom.
I don't want him growing up
thinking it's something shameful
you have to hide in a tool shed to do.
What are you gonna do?
You can't go do your audition
if you're taking the kids to school.
I'm not gonna be taking my kids
to school. Someone will,
because the school has set up
a car pool
phone tree. You call one of the names
on this list. If they can't do it,
they call someone else and so on until
someone's taking your kids to school.
How is that like a tree?
I mean, if each person talks
to the next person,
and then they talk to the next person,
that's a phone Chain,
that's a phone Chain.
I don't know, they just,
they call it a phone tree.
I'm telling you,
if one person calls many people,
that's a tree, 'cause it branches out.
Stop. Is this gonna bother you all day?
No, no. I'm just...
I'm gonna get a beer, OK?
I mean, a phone train.
A phone... phone stream.
I mean, tree is the only thing
that doesn't describe it.
- Tom, get out of the bathroom!
- Yeah, I'll be out in a minute.
That's what you said 5 minutes ago.
What are you doing in there?
No matter what he's doing in there,
do you really want him to answer that?
- Fine.
- Get ready for school, would you?
Tommy, that's enough now.
Come on, your ride for school's here.
Let's go.
- What the heck's going on in there?
- OK, I don't wanna talk about it.
- Can't you just mind your own business?
- You don't have to talk about it.
But listen, it's no big deal.
Everybody goes through it.
I went through it,
your uncle went through it.
I'm not going through anything.
So, don't.
Relax. Look, if you happen
to find yourself going through
an exciting new chapter
in your life, just
know that every,
single man on the planet
has enjoyed that chapter over
and over and over again.
OK? Now, go to school, and take comfort
knowing that it has a very happy ending.
So, Michael Vick is back in the NFL
and, yeah, the guy
served his time in prison,
but I don't think this is all
gonna even out until he faces
a defensive line of Pit Bulls
and somebody snaps him a ham.
Gary, remind people to call in.
OK, everybody, don't forget to call in.
I'm Gary Brooks. This is the score.
Let's talk some sports.
All sports except for soccer.
And don't call me and tell
me how great soccer is.
You always say things like, "come on.
It's the most popular sport
in the entire world." Who cares?
Coldplay's the most popular
band in the entire world,
but that doesn't mean
I don't wanna light a Nickelback CD
on fire and beat Chris Martin
over the head with it.
You got a call on line 1.
We have allie in Marvista. She's upset.
Why are you so angry, Allie?
Because my stupid ex-husband
is doing a radio show,
and I got a call from the phone tree
asking if I could take
my own kids to school.
That's crazy.
Can you?
Gary, what the hell are you doing
on the radio while
the kids are waiting
at your house for a ride?
OK, I would explain, but you're calling
me right in the middle of my show.
I'm sorry. Am interrupting your show?
I just have one question.
What freakin' show, Gar?
The score with Gary Brooks!
And you're our first caller, so,
you win our Kobe Bryant bobblehead.
There you go.
We'll get that out to you right away.
Is your address still the gates of hell?
I can't believe you kept
this secret from me, Gary.
Allison, your reaction is the exact
reason why I didn't tell you about this.
I only get one shot at this radio gig,
and I didn't want you
to spoil it for me like you spoiled
our marriage and sex
and the endings of movies.
I'm not trying to spoil anything for you
but come on. A new career? Now?
I mean, would you make as much money
on the radio as you do painting?
I'm not sure.
Probably.
Gary, I don't understand this.
I mean, you have a good job
and you make good money.
Why would you throw all that away?
And for the record, I didn't ruin
that movie ending on purpose.
I just guessed that goose would die in a
traing mission and Maverick would live.
You know what?
For once in my life, I'm actually
in control here,
so, I am cutting you off.
Gary, keep her on.
People are loving the show. The phones
are lighting up like a Christmas tree.
OK, we got another call.
This is Keith from burbank.
Keith, what's on your mind?
Man, Gary, I hate when chicks
give away movie endings.
My girlfriend used to do that.
Except she didn't really know she was
my girlfriend, and she was a stranger.
OK. Why don't I let
allison respond to that?
Allison, why do you guys
ruin movie endings?
Please. Half those movies you said
I ruined, Stephen Baldwin
was already ruing.
Can we just talk
about this later, please?
Yeah, I'd love to, Alison.
But, we actually have another caller.
Look at this. We got Stu from Valencia.
Stu, you're on the score.
I've been listening to this whole
discussion. I think you're both
making really good points,
and I just have to say, Allison?
You sound hot.
You know what, Allison?
I know you think this dream is crazy,
but if I don't go for this right now,
when will i?
Probably never will.
This is my chance, and
guys like me
and guys like Keith out there,
guys that know what it's like
to work for a living, guys
that bust their butts day in and day out
they know what i'm talking about.
My whole life,
I've done what I've had to do,
and now, finally, I have a chance
to do what I want to do.
So, Allison, just so I can really
understand your side,
what are you?
Like, a 34c?
Bite me, Stu.
Gary? Please,
can we have an adult conversation here?
Yeah, that's real mature, Gar.
OK, you know what?
Just once,
I would like to talk to you...
You know what, Gary?
Gary, I'm right and you're wrong.
That was Allie in Marvista.
I'm Gary Brooks, and this is the score.
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry. I didn't know Allison was
gonna call in and ruin everything.
Gary, that was amazing.
Really? Oh, my gosh.
That's great.
You know,
I gotta let my bosses hear it, but
I think this is something that
I can sell to them.
Way to go, champ.
Man, that was awesome, man.
The phones were lighting up.
Most of the guys were on your side
couple of guys
wanted Allison's phone number.
And Nickelback called and said if there
were more of them, they'd kick your ass.
I believe this is actually
going to happen!
This is totally gonna happen.
You're gonna be the guy on top,
and I'm gonna be the guy
right underneath you.
Not like that, not like that.
Hi, KPPQ?
Yes, my name is, Steve Karisnowski and
and I was calling because
I really loved that guy
you had on the air this morning,
Gary Brooks was his name, I think?
Karisnowski.
"K"...
You know, just how it sounds.
Hello?
KPPQ? This is Christopher Walken, hello.
I'm calling 'cause of that boy
you had on the radio this morning.
I think his name was Gary Brooks.
Now, normally, I don't listen
to sports talk radio, but...
He made me a fan!
Keep him on the air.
I like it. I like it.
- Hi.
- Hey, there she is, my biggest fan.
What the heck were you doing
calling in to the radio show?
What were you doing? What? All of
a sudden, you're a radio personality?
Why didn't you tell me
you were doing this?
I knew you would be against it.
It's your job
to vacuum fun out of my life.
You even have special attachment to suck
fun out of all my hard to reach places.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I overreacted.
I just you were on the radio
and I got all panicked
about how we were gonna be able
to afford everything.
Gary, it's a tiny little station.
Will you make as much on
the radio as you do painting?
Not at first, OK?
But after a few years,
when I get my own following,
I still won't even come close.
Gary, there's something
I haven't told you.
Come on. We haven't had sex in 6 months.
No, do you rember a couple of
months ago, we sent in that application
for Louise to get in
to the l.A Philharmonic youth program?
Yeah, you told me it was
a super expensive
and prestigious.
But don't worry 'cause she won't get in.
She got in.
Of course she did.
She's so darn good at everything.
Listen to me, this music program,
it's gonna be a stretch Even
on your painter's salary,
but if you quit painting
and you start making less,
I don't know if we'll be able
to afford it at all.
And I know it's a little weird for me
to say this, because
I don't contribute as much financially,
- but...
- You mean, like 0 dollars?
Jeez, Gary,
if you want to put a number on it. God.
Look, this is... This is terrible.
This radio thing is like my dream.
But I can't stand in the way of Louise.
This is super important for her. Yeah.
It's time to say something to uncle
Mitch and the marines in his unit.
Hey, Mitch. It's your little brother.
Come home soon. We love you.
Tommy's bunk bed is waiting for you.
I just wanted to say thanks
to you and everyone in your unit.
For your service.
And, stay safe.
'cause I wanna give you a great,
big hug when you come home.
Thanks. He's really gonna love that.
Tom, is there anything
that you want to say to uncle Mitch?
Can I have a little peace?
Tom wants peace, uncle Mitch.
- Hey, guys. What's up?
- Hey. Allie.
So, listen, man,
we wanted to talk to you.
I think I should tell him.
It's probably better
coming from a buddy.
Anyway, it didn't work out.
Sasha tried really hard
but the guys upstairs,
they just didn't respond to the show.
I'm sorry.
Well.
That's what I get. It was dumb of me
to Even get my hopes up.
I'm sorry, Gar.
And they also said i'm
just messing with you, man.
- They loved you!
- What?
They loved you, Gary.
Congratulations.
You are the new KPPQ sports guy.
Hey, you should have seen your face.
It's like your heart was broken.
Yeah, tell him how it went down.
I gave the tape to management,
and they flipped.
You were Edgy, you were funny,
you knew your stuff.
And then, I made the point
that it's the kind of show that both men
and women would listen to,
which made me look like a genius.
So, what do you say?
I'm gonna have to say no.
Yes! Wait.
Hold on. What?
Sorry, I can't do it. Sorry.
Well, hold on a second.
Let me get this straight.
The thing you've been pestering
me to give you for the last 6 weeks,
you're now saying you don't want?
What are you?
A toddler?
- Look, I can't do it. I'm sorry.
- Gary, you have to do this.
And not just because i'm gonna look like
a giant ass to my boss if you say no.
But because you were born to do this.
I've never seen anyone enjoy
themselves doing anything
the way that I saw you
enjoy being on the radio.
It was like you were glowing.
And I don't know if I've had that
feeling doing anything in my life, ever.
My, my daughter
has an opportunity to do something
really incredible,
and I will not be able to
make that work
on a Dj's salary, so, I can't.
I'm sorry.
I cannot do it.
- I'm really upset to hear that.
- Hang on. Sasha, just.
Gary, can I talk to you for a second?
What?
- You gotta take the job.
- I can't.
How are we gonna pay for Louise program?
I don't know. Gary, we'll figure it out.
We'll save, we'll stretch.
I don't know, but you gotta do it.
It'll make you really happy.
Is this a trap?
No, look. You may not believe this
but I want you to be happy.
And not just because I care about you.
But because if you're happy, Gary,
the family is happy.
And what could be more inspiring
to the kids than seeing their dad
doing something he loves?
We're just gonna make it work.
Yeah, this... This has "trap"
written all over it.
Hey, guys, listen.
I'm sorry. I really tried,
but he doesn't want to do it.
What? He's giving this up?
This is the chance of a lifetime.
I can't believe he's turning this down.
Which is why I'm not throwing it away.
I'm messing with you! I'm doing it!
- I am your new sports guy.
- This is so great!
Please, feel free to call in
as often as you like, all right?
Do you guys think you can find
something to fight about every day?
Gee, I don't know.
It might be a little rough, but
we'll get it together once
the cameras are rolling.
But it's not cameras, Gary. It's radio.
I knew you were gonna say that.
The second I said the word "camera,"
I knew you were gonna correct
me in front of my friends.
This is... This is perfect.
This is perfect.
I love it.
Welcome aboard.
Well, congratulations, Gary.
- You finally got your own show.
- I got my own show!
Just like we said.
Man, it's gonna be you and me.
All right? You're gonna be the hot dog
to my bun. But not like that.
I gotta thank you.
If you weren't a royal pain in my ass,
my dream never would have come true.
No! Oh, my god, this is terrible!
Oh, my god.
What?
I can't believe this is how it ends!
What?
- Honey, you don't like the ending?
- Oh, god!
Gary, call the doctor.
He's crying. He's crying.
All right, that's enough now.
Tommy, I'm coming in now.
Come on.
Enough's enough. I'm com...
Gary, do lave.
That could be very damaging right now.
Oh, my gosh. You won't believe what
he's been doing in here.
He's reading "bridges
of madison county."
I didn't want anyone to know.
- Honey, that's, like, the saddest book.
- Yeah, I know.
- And dad said it had a happy ending.
- All right.
That's a relief. Isn't it?
Yeah, It's Kinda weird he's reading
that book in the bathroom.
I hope when he does the other thing,
he doesn't start doing in the library.
Team Subs-Addicts"
- Désolé du retard.
- C'est la 5e fois en 2 semaines.
Au moins, quand on était mariés,
je pouvais espérer que tu me trompais.
J'espérais aussi que tu me trompes.
Pourquoi tu crois que je payais
tes leçons de tennis avec Javier ?
Je sais que t'es débordé
depuis que t'as pris ce nouveau boulot,
mais, tu vois, tu t'en sors plus.
T'es toujours en retard,
t'as rétréci le tutu de Louise
et mangé le devoir de Tom.
Si ton devoir ressemble
à une quiche,
le laisse pas traîner
quand je me lève pour pisser.
Je sais.
Ça va, mon pote ?
- Un câlin ?
- Non.
Je parlais à Allison.
Vite, en voiture.
On va direct chez papa.
Non, je répète à l'orchestre.
Mets ton violoncelle à côté
du van, je le mettrai dans le coffre.
Amuse-toi bien. Et Tom,
dors bien, s'il te plaît,
demain il y a
ta rencontre de natation.
Merci de me le rappeler.
Je dois me raser ce soir.
Raser quoi ?
Et ces 4 poils sur le torse que
je t'ai montrés, ils n'existent pas ?
J'ai failli oublier. J'ai la facture
pour l'orchestre de Louise.
Ça a l'air cher. Je comprendrais
s'ils jouaient des trucs comme
Rush ou AC/DC ou dans le genre.
Tu savais que ce serait cher
quand elle a été acceptée.
Je sais. Ne t'inquiète pas.
Je vais avoir des rentrées.
Beaucoup de gens me demandent
de peindre.
Ça va aller. Je vais l'ajouter
sur le temps que j'ai pas.
Qui a besoin de dormir 4 heures
de toute façon ?
On ferait mieux d'aller au cinéma.
Tu vas au cinéma avec Allison ?
Je te donne un conseil.
Quand elle t'offre ses bonbons,
c'est pour de faux.
Tu partagerais tes bonbons avec moi
n'est-ce pas, mon sucre ?
Bien sûr que oui.
T'en veux combien ?
On pourrait acheter 2 boîtes.
- C'était quoi ?
- Papa, mon violoncelle !
C'est rien.
- Vous avez du scotch ?
- Mon Dieu !
Ce violoncelle vaut 2 000 $ !
Howard, tu peux nous laisser ?
- Où est ta tête ?
- Tu veux pas me lâcher ?
Je suis levé depuis 2 h du matin.
Et j'ai tué un violoncelle.
Tu vois... C'est ça le truc.
Tu te disperses trop.
Tu fais 10 choses à la fois
et t'arrives à peine
à en faire une correctement.
Content que tu l'aies remarqué.
C'est dur de maintenir ce niveau.
Écoute,
je me demandais si,
temporairement, je pourrais prendre
les enfants un jour de plus.
Pas moyen. On ne change pas
les jours de garde, OK ?
J'ai promis aux enfants
que je serais toujours là.
Je ne vais pas revenir
sur ma parole.
Je te donne aucun de mes jours.
Oublie.
Souviens-toi que
t'as plein de choses demain.
L'entrainement de Tom à la piscine
le matin à...
Attends.
Ils m'ont donné
un de ces beaux Blackberry à la radio.
Dis-moi, et je le mets
dans ce joujou.
Il doit y être pour 6 h 30,
faut l'emmener après ton émission.
Et après l'école, Louise fait
du bénévolat à la SPA
puis la rencontre de natation,
puis le récital de Louise.
C'est bon ?
Comment ça s'allume ?
Sur le dessus ?

Je suis venu aussi vite que j'ai pu.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Tu sais, la pub pour
Red Pirate Pizza que t'as enregistrée ?
- Non.
- Je t'explique.
Le mec de Red Pirate Pizza
se tenait ici.
Moi, j'étais là,
et toi, t'es pas venu.
Le mec est venu en costume.
Tu sais combien c'était gênant ?
On doit le faire maintenant.
Alors, assieds-toi.
Je suis levé
depuis 2 heures du matin, Curtis.
En plus, ça pue Red Pirate Pizza.
S'ils n'ont pas de rats, c'est
parce que les rats ont gouté les pizzas.
T'es à l'antenne.
Salut, Los Angeles. Je suis
le mec des sports de KPPQ, Gary Brooks,
et quand je suis pas au match,
je le regarde en mangeant
à Red Pirate Pizza.
Red Pirate Pizza !
Du trésor en bouche !
Vous avez faim ?
Et... c'est bon.
Une partie de mon âme vient
de me quitter.
- Signe ces communiqués.
- Et puis, je dois partir.
J'ai un autre chantier,
et un rendez-vous dans 20 minutes.
Tu devais ralentir les chantiers.
J'essaie, mais c'est frustrant.
Je vais à la banque
pour leur dire que je dois plus d'argent
que j'en gagne,
et la banque dit qu'elle a
le même problème.
J'adorerais te donner de l'argent
mais je sais que tu refuserais.
Et si tu relances mon bluff,
on va être gênés tous les deux.
J'ai surtout besoin de temps.
Allison m'a demandé hier
si je voulais changer la garde pour
qu'elle puisse avoir plus les enfants.
Après le divorce, j'ai juré que même en
voyant mes enfants la moitié du temps
je les laisserais jamais tomber.
Je serais toujours là.
On sait tous que t'es un super papa.
Et personne ne te reprocherait
un besoin de changement.
Je me suis arrangé.
Tommy a natation et,
Louise son truc d'orchestre
auquel je vais assister.
Je vais aller aux deux. Regarde.
Les mecs, juste pour vous rappeler
qu'on coorganise la soirée
Adrena Power Energy Drink.
Tout le monde doit être présent.
C'est pas ce soir.
C'est demain soir.
Ça a été avancé à ce soir.
Je vous ai envoyé un mail.
Vraiment ?
Faudrait me montrer où il est,
car je l'ai jamais reçu.
Juste là.
En dessous de "50 messages non lus."
Et vous avez pris une photo
de votre pouce par accident.
On va dire que c'est votre pouce.
Écoutez, Sasha.
- Mes enfants ont des trucs importants.
- C'est bon !
- Je suis pas obligé d'y aller ?
- Je veux dire : "Ça suffit !".
Vous allez venir
car vous faites un live d'une heure.
Mais je vous rassure.
Mon père a raté presque tous
les trucs auxquels je participais.
J'étais triste et blessée, mais
11 ans d'intense thérapie,
et je vais bien.
Curtis ?
Pourquoi t'es là si tôt ?
Je t'ai envoyé le changement d'heure.
Faut que tu lises tes mails.
Mes doigts sont trop gros
pour appuyer sur les boutons !
C'est quoi le problème ?
Ça commence pas à 18 h ?
Non, les préparations à 18 h.
T'es à l'antenne à 19 h.
Toute cette soirée repose
sur le respect du timing.
Je vais à la piscine pour Tommy,
et je reviens ici.
Je ferai mon heure.
Et j'irai à l'orchestre de Louise.
Tu vois ? Je trouve un moyen
de tout faire.
Du calme. Y a des choses que tu peux pas
faire même si tu penses le contraire.
C'est juste sympa de voir Sasha
dans ses habits de tous les jours.
Même si j'aimerais bien
la voir sans.
Je te préviens,
tu veux pas te lancer là-dedans.
Tu dois reconnaitre que c'est dur
de travailler pour un boss qui est...
J'allais dire "sexy",
mais je bâille.
- T'es crevé ?
- Oui, plutôt.
J'ai des vapeurs, là.
Tu sais quoi, mon pote ?
Faut te remettre sur les rails.
- C'est quoi ?
- Boisson énergisante Adrena.
Ça fera l'affaire.
C'est notre sponsor,
alors dis pas trop fort
que c'est dégueu.
Ça engourdit la langue.
Et si t'en renverses
sur l'entrejambe,
rince à grande eau,
et appelle le service consommateur.
Nage, nage !
Vas-y, Tommy ! T'y es presque !
Oui ! Il a gagné !
Prends ça ! Et ça, et ça !
C'est mon fils ! Il a gagné !
- Papa, ça va ?
- C'est mon fils.
On vient d'arriver. Ma course est après
le medley individuel.
Ah bon ?
Un medley c'est une course
où on nage...
Excuse-moi.
Je sais ce que c'est, d'accord ?
- Ils font 3 nages.
- En fait, c'est 4.
- Papillon, dos, brasse et nage libre.
- Je sais.
Je parlais des premiers
Jeux Olympiques,
dans la France Antique, quand il y avait
que 3 nages parce qu'ils pensaient
que la brasse était profane.
Tu nages quand ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Je sais pas. Dans 1/2 heure ?
- Quoi ? 1/2 heure ?
- Tu dois partir ?
- Quoi ? Non, pas du tout !
Ma place est ici,
à regarder mon fils nager.
C'est ça.
J'espère seulement que tu dois pas
nager contre l'autre Tom.
Ce gosse est incroyable.
 Où t'étais ?
J'ai regardé mon fils nager le 50 m le
plus lent de l'histoire de la natation.
C'était gênant.
Je t'appelais.
Je peux pas répondre.
Dès que je décroche, je tombe
sur un mec qui s'appelle Luther.
Il est sympa. Je pense acheter sa moto.
On y va !
Y a un petit changement de programme.
C'est reporté
à cause de l'arrivée imprévue
d'une star. John Stamos est là.
Ah oui ? C'est cool.
C'est qui, la star ?
John Stamos. Apparemment,
il va jouer du bongo,
c'est pas à toi avant 90 minutes.
Tu plaisantes.
D'accord. Tu sais quoi ?
Ça va marcher.
Tout ira bien.
Je vais aller au récital de Louise,
le Youth Orchestra. En espérant qu'elle
soit sur scène quand j'arriverai.
Elle me verra dans le public
pour sa première standing ovation.
- C'est mignon...
- Il me faut des forces.
Il me faut cette boisson. Je prends
tout le plateau. Merci, chérie.
- À plus ! Je reviens.
- Fais gaffe.
Allô ? Luther, ça va ?
Un convertible ? Je sais pas.
Faut que je vienne le voir.
Excusez-moi. Pardon.
Désolé.
La compétition de Tom, c'est fait.
Le concert de Louise, c'est fait.
J'ai vu les deux. Échec et mat.
Je suis toujours là pour mes gosses.
Excuses acceptées.
Ça commence quand ?
- 1 heure et 15 minutes.
- Quoi ? C'est trop long !
Pour voir Louise,
car j'ai trop hâte.
Elle joue après Rimsky-Korsakov.
C'est lequel ? Ils sont 50
et aucun ressemble à un Russe.
C'est la fille avec un sourcil ?
Rimsky-Korsakov est le compositeur,
et il est mort.
J'en savais rien, mais c'est
peut-être parce que je couchais
au lycée.
Le lycée, c'était dur pour moi.
J'étais un intello.
Et j'ai créé une entreprise dans
mon garage, revendue pour 600 millions.
J'en étais à un point
où coucher était chiant.
Vraiment ? C'est génial.
Vous allez super bien vous entendre.
Arrête de gigoter.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a, ta jambe ?
Rien du tout. Quand je suis à côté
de toi, vouloir courir est instinctif.
Ça fait 15 ans et 3 tailles de jeans
que je te connais.
Crois-moi.
Courir n'est pas dans ton instinct.
Si t'es pressé, je serai ravi
de filmer Louise pour toi.
Haute définition.
Bien tenté.
Mais je verrai ma fille coûte que coûte.
Même si je dois me taper Nimski.
C'est le meilleur moment, pas vrai ?
Je peux en avoir une autre ? Merci.
Où t'étais ?
Bizarre comme question. "Où j'étais ?"
À plein d'endroits.
Au Mexique, grottes de Carlsbad,
parc de Yellowstone, Nouvelle Orléans.
Une fois, je suis allé voir
ma grand-mère à Grand Island, Nebraska.
C'était ni grand, ni une île.
C'est un état de fou.
Tu dois arrêter de boire, d'accord ?
C'était moins une.
C'est à toi dans 5, 4, 3...
2, très bien.
Salut à tous. Vous écoutez
The Score avec Gary Brooks.
Je suis avec vous grâce
à la boisson énergisante Adrena.
Ce truc ferait passer la cocaïne
pour de l'aspirine.
C'est pas le slogan officiel.
Pas encore.
Pas encore !
C'est pas le slogan officiel.
Cette boisson est géniale.
J'en ai bu vingt.
On dirait qu'une queue
de singe me sort du cul.
Vous avez faim !
Merci une fois encore,
à mes amis Adrena Power.
Adrena Power.
Buvez-en ou dégagez de ma vue.
C'est pas le slogan officiel,
je suis Gary Brooks.
C'était The Score. Terminé.
Super. C'était incroyable.
J'ai jamais entendu quelqu'un
parler si vite.
- Je parlais vite ?
- Tu veux rire ?
T'as cité tous les joueurs
de 1re ligue en 28 secondes.
C'est vrai. Ma langue a presque fourché
sur Nomar Garciaparra,
mais j'ai tout défoncé.
Si tu descendais et te calmais ?
- Prends une minute, d'accord ?
- Pourquoi tu parles lentement ?
Assieds-toi et repose-toi.
Je vais voir John Stamos.
Il a une table VIP.
En fait, c'est juste la table
où il est assis.
On s'en fout !
Je fais la fête avec oncle Jesse !
Brooks, c'était génial.
Pourquoi vous parlez lentement ?
J'écoutais les producteurs
qui m'ont fait boire cul-sec
chaque fois que vous disiez
"Adrena Power".
J'ignore combien de fois
vous l'avez dit, mais...
Il se peut que je sois fiancée
à l'un d'entre eux.
Vous voulez danser ? Dansons !
Super. J'adore cette chanson.
Vous savez, vous êtes marrant.
Je voulais vous le dire.
Désolée d'être si coincée au boulot.
Je suis pas comme ça.
En fait, moi aussi, je suis marrante.
Je subis beaucoup de pression,
c'est tout.
M'en parlez pas.
Je sais ce que c'est.
Jolie chemise.
Vous saviez qu'on trouve
du Calvin Klein à Kiabi ?
J'ai tout fait, aujourd'hui. Tout.
Je suis allé au concert.
J'ai vu la natation, j'ai peint,
j'ai animé l'émission.
Je suis "monsieur fait tout", "grand
gagnant de la radio", "danseur marrant".
- Quoi ? J'entends rien.
- J'ai dit,
j'ai tout fait. Je peux tout faire.
Je me sens invulnérable.
Je peux tout faire, sauf, d'un coup,
j'ai mal dans la poitrine.
- Quoi ?
- Je sais pas.
Je me sens pas très bien. Mon cœur
bat fort, je le sens dans mes oreilles.
Je vais rester assis.
Il fait pas chaud et sombre ?
Je sais pas, c'est difficile à dire
car il fait chaud et sombre.
Il fait particulièrement
chaud et sombre ?
- Je sais pas.
- Je peux pas respirer.
Appelez les urgence.
- Appelez-les.
- J'ai pas mon téléphone.
- Votre Blackberry ?
- Oui, je l'ai.
J'appelle les urgences moi-même.
Allô Luther ?
Appelle les urgences !
Je passe pour le canapé.
Je suis en enfer !
Qu'ai-je fait de mal dans ma vie ?
Pourquoi je finis en enfer ?
Tu vas bien, tu es à l'hôpital.
Mais merci pour ta réaction.
Contente d'avoir sauté du lit
et traversé la ville pour toi.
J'ai fait une crise cardiaque ?
Ce n'était pas une crise cardiaque.
Je suis le Dr Greenberg.
- Greenberg ?
- Adopté.
La bonne nouvelle,
c'est que vous vous rétablirez.
La mauvaise nouvelle...
Vous pourriez nous laisser ?
Ils finiront par le découvrir,
autant leur dire.
Ce n'était pas une crise cardiaque,
mais une attaque de panique.
C'est embarrassant.
- Suivi par des gaz.
- Mec.
C'est bon,
c'est le pire, pas vrai ?
Et une diarrhée explosive.
Bon.
J'ai proposé de nettoyer la pièce.
Au moins, maintenant, je dois avouer
être relaxé et à l'aise.
C'est le valium.
Docteur, quelle est la cause
de tout ça ?
D'après votre échantillon d'urine,
qui, à propos, était
le plus gros que j'aie jamais vu.
Il aurait consommé
une importante quantité
de caféine, taurine,
glucosamine et vitamine B12.
C'est l'Adrena Power.
Ces boissons énergisantes
accélèrent le cœur,
et si vous êtes déjà stressé
ou fatigué,
l'attaque de panique
est imminente.
Je reviens.
J'imagine
que je peux pas tout faire.
J'ai une proposition qui pourrait
aider, si tu veux bien l'écouter.
Si ça implique de changer la garde,
oublie, d'accord ?
Je m'en fiche de me trimbaler
avec une bonbonne d'oxygène
et une intraveineuse d'Adrena Power,
je n'échange aucun jour.
Je garde tout mon temps
avec mes enfants.
J'en ai parlé
pour essayer de t'aider.
Arrête de penser
que tout ce que je dis est une menace.
Ou quoi ?
Je t'en prie, oublie la garde.
Voilà ma proposition.
Et si je reprenais la gestion
de ton entreprise de peinture ?
Et être ma chef ?
Mon Dieu !
Non, désolé, c'était moi.
Je tripotais les boutons.
Je crois que ma boîte les fabrique.
Non, Gary, pas ta chef.
Tu sais,
aider d'une quelconque façon.
Répartir les équipes, aller chercher
le matériel, ce que tu veux.
Je crois pas que tu comprennes comment
cette entreprise a défini ma vie,
dès que j'ai ramassé ce van pourri,
engager les équipes qui viennent pas
la moitié du temps,
respirer des vapeurs tous les jours,
avoir des clients jamais contents,
qui me crient tout le temps dessus,
la peinture qui part jamais.
En fait, tu peux le faire. Merci.
- De rien, Gary.
- Bon.
Vous savez quoi ? Je suis fatigué.
Vous pouvez sortir...
Tout le monde dehors.
Mon pote a besoin d'espace.
Curtis, tu peux...
Toi aussi, s'il te plaît.
C'est moi qui ai dû enlever
son pantalon.
- Je voulais juste...
- Oui. Allez-y.
Ça me dérange pas.
C'était très sympa...
- ce soir.
- Je me suis amusé.
- Jusqu'au moment où tu...
- Oui, je sais.
Ravie que tu ailles bien.
On se voit demain, bye.
Elle est chou.
Je sais.
- Elle est jeune.
- Je sais.
T'as eu une diarrhée explosive
devant elle.
Je sais.
Ça va ?
J'étais vraiment inquiète.
Je vais bien.
Je me sens débile, tu sais ?
Quoi qu'il arrive,
les enfants passent en premier.
Peu importe, les enfants d'abord.
Ça l'a toujours été, c'est tout.
Je sais.
Je te laisse te reposer.
Je sais qu'on ne fait
plus ça ensemble, mais...
je peux pas le faire sans toi.
Je sais. Moi non plus.
Allison, attends.
Qu'est... Allison ?
C'est quoi ce bouton ?
Allie.
T'as jamais dit...
Salut, toi.
M. Deacons, une équipe de peinture
sera là-bas à 8 h mercredi.
Je dois vous laisser,
j'ai un autre appel.
Allô ? Bonjour, Mme Anderson.
Écoutez, l'équipe a dit être tombée
accidentellement dans la piscine.
Je ne peux pas vraiment
expliquer le ballon.
Tu peux m'aider avec ces appels ?
Je suis occupé à regarder le sport.
C'est pour mon émission.
Apporte-moi une bière,
c'est bon pour mon anxiété,
selon le Dr Greenberg.
Mme Anderson ? C'est l'emploi
du temps, je n'y peux rien.
Je sais que c'est répétitif,
mais ils aiment cette musique.
Team Subs-Addicts"
- Sorry I'm late, Allison.
- That's the fifth time in 2 weeks.
At least when we were married,
I could hope you were having an affair.
I always hoped you were having one.
Why do you think I always paid for
your tennis lessons with Javier?
Look, Gary, I know you're juggling a lot
of stuff since you took the radio job,
but, you're dropping balls
left and right.
You're late constantly,
you shrunk Louise's ballet costume,
and you ate Tom's home Ec homework.
All right.
If you have homework as a Frittata,
don't leave it out on the table
when I wake up at night to pee.
I know.
What's up, bro?
- Can I get a hug?
- No.
I was talking to Allison.
Hey, guys. Quick, get in the car.
We're going right to daddy's house.
No, dad, I have youth orchestra tonight.
OK. Great. Just put your cello behind
the van ˛and I'll put it in the back?
Honey. Have fun, OK? And Tom,
please, get a good night's sleep,
'cause you got your first
swim meet tomorrow.
Thanks for reminding me.
Gotta shave down tonight.
Shave what?
So, those 4 chest hairs I showed you,
just part of my imagination? What?
I almost forgot. I got the bill for
Louise's youth orchestra.
It seemed pretty expensive. I could see
if the orchestra played a little, like,
rush or AC/DC or something.
Well, Gary, you knew it was gonna
be expensive once she got accepted.
I know. Look. Don't worry about it.
I got things coming in.
A lot of people are still
hitting me up for painting jobs.
I'll handle it. I'll just add it to the
zero time that I have.
Who needs those 4 hours
I set aside for sleep anyway?
We better get going to the movie.
You're going to the movies with Allison?
Let me give you a tip.
When she offers you her junior mints,
she doesn't mean it.
You'd share your junior mints with me,
wouldn't you, sweetie?
Of course I would.
How many do you want?
We could always get 2 boxes.
- What was that?
- Dad, my cello!
Upsy daisy.
- You guys got any tape?
- Oh, my god!
Gary, that cello cost $2,000!
Howard, can you just can
you give us a second, OK?
- Where is your head?
- Why don't you leave me alone?
It's one thing. I've been up since
2:00 am. So, I killed a cello.
Look, that... That's the thing.
You're spreading yourself to thin.
You're doing 10 things at the same time
and you're only average
when you try to do one.
Glad you noticed. It's hard to maintain
that standard all the time.
Listen,
I was wondering if maybe,
just for a while,
i'd take the kids an extra day.
No way. We're not changing
the custody schedule, OK?
I promised the kids I would
always be there for them.
I'm not gonna you know
go back on my words now.
I'm not giving you any of my days.
Forget it.
Just rember you got a lot
of stuff going on tomorrow.
OK? Tom's swim practice
is in the morning at...
Hold on a second.
They gave me, one of these fancy
Blackberrys over at the radio station.
You tell me and I'll put it
in this puppy right here.
He has to be there by 6:30 am,
so, you have to take him
there after your show.
And then after school Louise is
a volunteer at the animal shelter, and
then the swim meet, and then
Louise's Orchestra recital.
You got all that?
How do you turn this on?
Is it on the top?

"Gary Tries to Do It All"
VO By :  ¤Aka¤
Team Subs-Addicts"
I got here as fast as I could.
What's the Crisis?
Remember that endorsement spot for red
pirate pizza that recorded this morning?
- No.
- Let me refresh your memory.
The guy from red pirate
pizza was standing there.
I was standing over here,
and you didn't show up.
The guy came in costume.
You know how awkward that was?
You know what? We have to do
it right now, OK? So, sit down.
I'm sorry. Jeez,
I've been up since 2:00 am, Curtis.
Besides, Red Pirate pizza stinks.
The only reason they don't have rats is
'cause the rats have tried the pizza.
And you're on.
Hey there, Los Angeles.
This is KPPQ sports guy Gary Brooks,
and when I'm not at the game,
i'm watching with my friends
at Red Pirate pizza.
Red Pirate Pizza!
Put some treasure in your mouth!
You hungry?
And we're good.
You know,
a little piece of my soul just left.
- OK, you gotta sign these releases.
- Then, I gotta get out of here.
I took out another paint job,
and I gotta meet my crew in 20 minutes.
I thought you were pulling
back on the painting jobs.
I'm trying to, but this very frustrating
thing keeps happening. I go to the bank
and I tell them I owe more
money than I make,
and the bank says they have
the same problem.
Man, you know, I would love to give you
some money, but I know you'd say "no."
And if you called my bluff,
then we'd both be embarrassed.
What I need more than money is time.
Allison asked me last night
wanted to change the custody arrangement
so she could take the kids more.
I swore after the divorce, even though
I would only see my kids 1/2 of the time
I would never let them down.
I would always be there for them.
Everybody knows
that you're great with your kids.
But nobody would blame you if you
felt like you had to change it up.
No, I got it covered, OK?
Look, Tommy has a swim meet and,
Louise has this youth Orchestra thing
I'm gonna attend.
I'm gonna be front and center for
both of those events. You watch.
Guys, just a reminder
about the promotional event
we're co-hosting with
Adrena Power Energy Drink.
It's mandatory
that everyone be there tonight.
No, that's not tonight.
That's tomorrow night.
No, it got changed to tonight.
I sent an e-mail to your Blackberry.
Really? Why don't you show me where
in the Blackberry that is,
'cause I never got your e-mail.
It's right here.
Under where it says
"50 unread messages."
And I think you accidentally
took a picture of your thumb.
OK, you know, I am gonna tell
myself that that's your thumb.
Look Sasha.
- My kids have important things.
- Is there any way no more.
- So I don't have to go?
- No, I mean don't say any more.
You're coming to the event because
you're doing an hour live there.
But let me put your mind
at ease about something.
My dad missed almost every event
I was ever involved in.
I was sad and hurt, but
11 years of intense therapy,
and I turned out fine.
Hey, Curtis?
Why are you here so early?
I sent you an e-mail
about the time change.
Man, you gotta start checking those.
My fingers are too fat to
press the right buttons, OK?
There I said it. What's the big deal?
I thought I start at 6:00 pm.
No, set-up is at 6:00 pm
You're on at 7:00 pm.
Damn it. This whole night depends on
everything happening on time, you know?
All right, I'm gonna run over to Tom's
swim meet and then, i'll come back here.
I'll do my hour. And then I will go
to Louise's youth Orchestra thing.
See? I can figure out
a way to do everything.
Easy now. There's some things you
can't do, even if you think you can.
No, no. It's just nice to see
sasha in her out-of-work clothes.
Although, I would like to see her
out of her out-of-work clothes.
I'm telling you,
you do not want to get mixed up in that.
You have to admit, it's pretty hard,
working for a boss that's that...
I was gonna say "hot,"
but I yawn.
You are wiped?
Yeah, I'm pretty tired.
I'm running on fumes, here, Curtis.
OK, well, you know what, buddy?
We gotta pick you up, then, OK?
- What's this?
- Adrena power energy drink.
A few of these will do the trick.
They're our corporate sponsors
so don't
say too loud how nasty they are.
Kinda numbs the tongue.
And also, if you spill any
on your crotch area,
flush it with water and then,
call the number on the back of the can.
Swim, swim!
Dig it out, Tommy!
You got it!
Yes! He won!
In your face! In your face, face, face!
That's my son!
That is my son! He won!
- Hey, dad. What's up?
- This is my son.
We just got here. My race isn't till
after the individual medley.
Really?
The medley's the one
where they swim a series...
- Excuse me, needleman?
- I know what a medley is, OK, fella?
- Where they do all 3 strokes.
- It's actually 4 strokes.
- It's butter, back, breast and free.
- Look, I know.
But I'm going by the first
Olympics ever in ancient,
France, when they only had, like,
3 strokes because they thought the
breast, stroke was profane, so.
When, when do you swim?
What's going on here?
- I don't know. Maybe about 1/2 hour?
- What? 1/2 hour?
- What, do you have to be somewhere?
- What? No way.
Right here's where I need to be,
watching my, watching my son swim.
That's right.
I just hope you don't have to
race against that other Tom.
That kid was amazing.
Where were you?
I watched my son swim the slowest 50
meter in the history of water sports.
It was embarrassing.
I was calling you.
I can't answer my phone,
whenever I pick it up, I accidentally
speed dial some guy named luther.
Nice guy. I think I'm gonna buy
his dirt bike. Let's hit the Mike.
There's been a little change in the
schedule. I think it getting pushed back
because we had an unexpected celebrity
appearance. John Stamos showed up.
Really? That's cool.
Who's the celebrity?
John Stamos. Now, apparently,
he's gonna be playing the bongos,
so you're not on for another 90 minutes.
You gotta be kidding me.
All right. You know what?
This will work out.
This will be OK.
I'm gonna go, to Louise's recital,
the youth Orchestra thing. Hopefully
she'll be up right when I get there.
And she will see me in the audience
giving her her first standing ovation.
- That is sweet, man...
- I need some energy.
I need some more of these drinks. I'll
take the whole tray. Thank, sweetheart.
- See you later, Curtis. I'll be back.
- Be careful.
Hello?
Hey, Luther, what's up?
A sofa sleeper? I don't know.
I'd have to come look at it.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Sorry, lady.
Tom's swim meet, check.
Louise's concert recital, check.
Seeing both kids, check and mate.
I'm always there for my kids.
Apology accepted. What time
does the youth orchestra start here?
- 1 hour and 15 minutes.
- What? I can't wait that long.
You know, to see Louise,
'cause I'm so excited about this.
She's on after Rimsky-Korsakov.
Which one is he? There's like 50 guys up
there and none of really look Russian.
Is it that chick with the eyebrow?
Rimsky-Korsakov is the composer,
Gary, and he's dead.
I didn't know that, but,
you know, that's
just probably 'cause I got laid
in high school.
High school was tough for me.
I was such a nerd.
But then, I started a company in
my garage, sold it for $600 million.
Got to the point where getting laid,
for me, was boring.
Really? That's great. Then you guys
are gonna get along perfectly.
Just stop moving.
What's wrong with your leg?
Nothing wrong with my leg. Whenever I'm
near you, my leg's instinct is to run.
Gary, I've seen you through
15 years and 3 jeans sizes.
Trust me. Your instinct is not to run.
If you're pressed for time, gary,
i'd be happy to tape louise for you.
This bad boy is HD.
Nice try, needleman. No matter what,
I'm gonna catch my daughter.
I don't care how much
nimsky I gotta sit through.
I know. This is the best part, right?
Can I get another one of these?
Thanks a lot.
Where have you been?
That's a weird question. "Where have?"
I've been a lot of places.
Mexico, Carlsbad Caverns,
Yellowstone park, New Orleans.
Once I went to, grand Island in
Nebraska to see my grandmother.
It wasn't grand and it wasn't an island.
It's a crazy state.
OK, you gotta lay off these things.
All right? You have just barely made it.
You're on in 5, 4, 3...
2, all right.
Hey, everybody.
Welcome to the score with Gary Brooks.
Brought to you by
Adrena Power Energy Drink.
Yeah! This thing makes cocaine
look like baby aspirin.
That's not their official
slogan or anything. Yet.
Yet! That's not their official slogan.
These things are amazing.
I had like 20 of 'em today.
I feel like I got a cheetah
tail growing out of my ass.
Argh! You hungry!
Thanks, once again,
to my friends Adrena Power.
Adrena Power.
Drink it or get the hell outta my way.
That is not their official slogan either
by the way, my name is Gary Brooks.
This is the score.
I'm done.
Nice. That show was unbelievable.
I have never heard somebody say
so many words in so little time.
- I was talking fast?
- Were you talking fast?
You named every major
league player in 28 seconds.
I did. I almost got tripped up
on nomar Garciaparra,
but I just plowed through it.
OK, but why don't you
come down and relax?
- Just take a second, OK?
- OK. Hey, why are you talking so slow?
Grab a table and chill, OK?
I'm gonna hang with John Stamos
for a while? He's got a V.I.P. Table.
Well, actually, it's just a table
with John Stamos sitting at it, but.
Who cares, man?
I'm partyin' with uncle Jesse!
Brooks, you sounded great.
Right.
Why are you talking so slow?
I was listening with all the executives,
who made me do a shot of vodka
every time you said
"Adrena Power" on the air.
I don't know how many
times you said it, but!
There's a chance
I'm engaged to one of them.
Hey! You wanna dance?
Hey, let's dance.
This'll be good.
I love this song.
Hey, you know, you're Kinda fun, Brooks.
I've been wanting to tell you.
Now, I'm sorry I'm so uptight at work.
I'm really not like that.
You know, I'm actually Kinda fun.
Just under a lot of pressure, you know?
Yeah, tell me about it.
I know all about pressure.
Hey, that's a great shirt.
You know they sell
Calvin Klein at costco?
I did it all today.
I did it all.
I went to the orchestra.
I went to the swim meet.
I painted. I did my little radio job.
I'm mister do it all,
big winner radio, fun time dance man.
- What? I can't hear you.
- I said,
I did it all. I can do it all.
Like, I feel like i'm invulnerable.
I can do anything,
except, all of a sudden,
I have this pain in my chest.
- What?
- I don't know.
I don't feel so good. My heart's
pounding. I can hear it in my ears.
I gotta stay sitting down.
Is it hot and dark in here?
But I don't know. It's hard to tell
because it's hot and dark in here.
Is it especially hot and dark in here?
- I don't know.
- I can't catch my breath.
Call 9-1. Go ahead.
Call 9-1.
- Call 9-1.
- I don't have my phone.
- Do you do you have your Blackberry?
- I got my Blackberry.
I'll call 9-1-1 myself.
Hello, Luther?
Call 9-1.
I'm gonna pass on the sofa sleeper.
I'm in hell!
What did I do wrong in my life?
Why did I wind up in hell?
Gary, you're OK. You're in the hospital.
But thank you for that reaction.
I'm glad I got out of bed and ran
across town to be here for you.
What happened?
Did I have a heart attack?
It wasn't a heart attack.
Hi, I'm Dr. Greenberg.
- Greenberg?
- Adopted.
Well, the good news is
you're going to be OK.
The bad news...
Well, should we excuse everyone?
They're gonna find out anyway.
Might as well just tell 'em now.
Well, you didn't have a heart attack.
You had an anxiety attack.
That's embarrassing.
- Followed by some pretty severe gas.
- Dude.
It's OK. It's all right, Curtis.
At least that's the worst of it, right?
There was also explosive diarrhea.
All right.
For the record,
I did offer to clear the room?
At least now, I gotta be honest with you
I feel pretty relaxed and comfortable.
That'll be the valium.
Doctor, what do you think
brought all this on?
Well, from what we could tell
from your urine sample,
which, by the way,
was the largest I've ever seen, yeah!
It seems you consumed a massive amount
of caffeine, taurine,
glucosamine and vitamin b12.
That'd be the Adrena Power.
Those energy drinks
really make the heart race,
and if you're already feeling
stressed or rundown,
there's your anxiety attack right there.
I'll be back in a minute.
Well, I guess I can't do everything.
Gary, I have a proposal that might
help if you're willing to hear it.
If it involves switching up the custody
arrangement, just forget it, OK?
I don't care if I gotta walk around
holding an oxygen tank and
be hooked up to Adrena Power i V,
i'm not switching any of the days.
I'm keeping all
my time with my children.
I just brought that up
'cause I was trying to help.
You have to get past the idea
that everything I say is a threat.
Or else what?
Please, just,
can you forget the custody thing?
All right, what I'm proposing is this.
What if I take over some of
the managing of the paint business?
What? You'd be my boss?
Oh, my God!
No. Sorry. That was me. I was
just fiddling with the buttons here.
I think my company makes these.
No, Gary, not your boss.
Just, you know,
help out however I could.
Dispatching the crews, picking
up the supplies, whatever you think.
I don't think you understand how that
painting company has defined my life,
from the first time I picked
out that wreck of a van,
to hiring crews, half of the time,
they don't even show up,
breathing fumes all day, every day,
having customers that are never happy,
always yelling at me.
The paint that never comes out. You know
what? Actually, you can have it.
- You're welcome, Gary.
- All right.
You know what? I'm pretty tired.
Can you guys get out of the room...
Everybody, clear out.
My boy needs some space in here?
Curtis, could you...
You, too. Please?
I'm the one had to pull his pants off.
- I just wanted to have a...
- yeah. Go ahead.
Yeah. I don't mind.
Hey, that was,
that was really fun
- tonight.
- Yeah, I had fun.
- Up until the point where you...
- Yes, I yeah, I know.
I'm glad you're OK.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
She's cute.
I know.
- She's young.
- I know.
You had explosive
diarrhea in front of her.
I know.
You OK? You really had me worried.
I'm OK. I just feel like an idiot,
you know?
I have to make sure, no matter
what happens, I put the kids first.
No matter what, the kids come first.
Like they always have. That's all.
I know.
All right,
I'm gonna let you get some rest, OK?
Look, I know we don't, you know,
do this together anymore, but...
I can't do it alone without you.
I know.
Me neither.
Allison, wait.
What's Allison?
What's this button do?
Allie.
You never told.
Hello, happy.
OK, Mr. Deacons, we'll have a paint
crew out there at 8:00 am. On wednesday.
All right. Yeah, I gotta run.
I got another call. OK.
Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Anderson.
Yeah, listen, the paint crew said
they accidentally fell into the pool.
I can't really explain the beach ball.
Can you help me
with a few of these calls?
Jeez, al, I'm Kinda busy now
watching sports, you know?
I have to for my radio gig.
Hey, get me another beer.
It's good for my anxiety.
That's what dr. Greenberg said.
Mrs. Anderson? That's just the schedule.
I can't really do anything about that.
Yeah, I know it's repetitive,
but that's the music they like.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Tu dis toujours que je devrais moins
jouer à la console et faire du sport.
Je t'achète pas un trampoline,
Tommy.
Les seuls qui font du trampoline
sont les clowns, les pompgirls
et les mecs déguisés en gorille
qui font des dunks acrobatiques.
Comment je vais être un de ces mecs
si tu m'achètes pas de trampoline
ou de costume de gorille ?!
J'en ai vraiment marre de cette dispute
sur le costume de gorille trampoline.
OK.
Ton vœu est accordé.
Vraiment ?
Va sur Craigslist, trouve un trampoline
pour moins de 50 $,
on ira le chercher cet après-midi,
OK ?
- Papa, t'es le meilleur !
- Ouais !
J'y crois pas. Un saut, et t'es passé
à travers. Comme dans un dessin animé.
Tu l'as pris en vidéo quand même ?
Pas sûr. Ma main tremblait
tellement je riais.

Team Subs-Addicts"
Ouvre le grill, Curtis.
Et je vais faire cuire ce quartier.
Je te dis juste que c'est
pas comme ça qu'ils font dans la pub.
Dans la pub, le mec qui le vend
se fait taper dessus 50 000 fois
s'il dit qu'il est entrepreneur
ou chef.
Crois pas tout ce que
tu vois à la télé ! Mon Dieu !
J'en peux plus.
Je veux récupérer mon ancien grill.
Allison a gardé mon grill 8 fonctions
avec rôtissoire
- à brôche dans le divorce.
- Faudrait faire quelque chose.
Parce que tous nos potes
amènent des saucisses exotiques
à la fête de la saucisse !
On a déjà pensé à changer
le nom de la fête de la saucisse ?
Pourquoi on changerait
le nom de la fête de la saucisse ?
C'est une tradition de 10 ans où les
hommes se retrouvent avec de la viande.
Salut, Curtis. Bien joué, Gary,
d'avoir acheter un trampoline à Tom.
Ils vendent aussi des armes ?
Parce que ça ferait plaisir
à Louise.
Calme-toi Allison. C'était
un accident, et c'était trop marrant.
Je voudrais te parler de quelque chose,
alors si tu veux bien.
Je dois y aller de toute façon.
Je dois aller chercher les t-shirts.
Tu vas les adorer.
Il y a un mec
qui s'enfile une saucisse de 25 cm
dans la gorge.
Et c'est écrit "fête de la saucisse 09"
en dessous.
Tu veux vraiment pas penser
à changer le nom ?
T'entends quelque chose et moi non ?
Y a quoi ?
Alors déjà, Louise
a pas trop la forme en ce moment.
Apparemment, un garçon
lui plaît et c'est pas réciproque.
Pourquoi on ne l'aimerait pas ?
Le paquet est entier.
Elle est intelligente, belle.
Elle te dira si tu finis
une phrase avec une préposition.
Même si je sais pas à quoi ça sert.
En tout cas Gary,
sois super gentil cette semaine.
Moi ? Oui.
Je suis toujours gentil.
- Allez, va-t'en.
- Non. Attends.
J'ai un service à te demander.
Tu vois cette boutique de lingerie sur
Abot Kiney que tu repeins tous les ans ?
J'ai besoin que tu me présentes
à la propriétaire, Sophia.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que je trouve qu'elle est cool.
Et qu'on pourrait être amies.
T'as des amis.
Oui. Des amies mariées.
Et des amies mamans.
Et tu sais le club de lecture ?
C'était de l'arnaque.
Je suis arrivée prête à discuter
du sens et de la sensibilité.
Les femmes voulaient juste
boire et raconter des histoires de sexe.
Et grâce à toi, je n'en avais pas.
1995.
Saint Valentin.
Allez.
Ton pied à glisser du matelas, Gary,
et t'as trouvé un point que t'as
jamais pu retrouver. Je t'en prie.
Je l'ai trouvé ce jour-là, hein ?!
Allez, sors de chez moi !
Écoute, Sophia a juste l'air d'être
quelqu'un de sympa et détendue.
Un peu comme moi.
Et c'est pourquoi,
j'ai un plan très précis
sur comment l'avoir.
Phase 1, être présentée par toi.
Je déteste devoir te le dire.
Tu te fais pas des amis avec des plans
et des phases. 2 gens se rencontrent.
Ils passent du temps,
et ensuite ils deviennent amis.
Oui. Je ne veux pas
faire comme ça.
Je me suis dit
qu'avec toi me présentant,
ça enlèvera de la pression,
tu vois ?
Et nous laissera de suite
avec quelque chose en commun.
Phase 2 ou "se moquer de toi".
C'est sûrement l'idée la plus bête
que j'ai entendue. Mais comme
- je m'en fiche, je vais t'aider.
- Merci. Merci.
Ça a un prix.
Quoi ?
Je vais t'aider à être amie avec Sophia,
tu me rends le grill.
Attends. OK...
Tu peux pas me rendre service
si t'as rien en retour.
Non.
D'accord. C'est bon.
C'est dommage parce que j'ai trouvé
cette recette de boulettes de polenta.
Je veux pas savoir ce que tu fais
avec mon grill
comme toi tu veux pas savoir
ce que je fais avec ton presse-agrume !
Je dois te dire qu'être ici, avec toi
et toute cette lingerie,
c'est vraiment bizarre d'être dégouté
et attiré en même temps.
- Comment ça va ?
- Super.
On passait dans le coin.
Alors on a décidé d'entrer pour voir ce
qui se passe dans le monde des strings.
J'allais t'appeler.
C'est bientôt le moment de repeindre.
Quelle coïncidence. Voici le nouveau
patron de mon entreprise de peinture.
Mon ex-femme Allison.
Allison, mon amie Sophia.
- Contente de te connaitre.
- Moi aussi.
J'adore ta boutique.
J'y achète tous mes trucs sexys.
J'adore ton magasin.
T'as tellement bon goût.
Il y a du goût et un style bohémien
en même temps.
Merci beaucoup.
Je l'ai jamais vraiment dit à personne.
Mais, j'ai toujours voulu ouvrir
mon magasin
un jour.
Je sais pas ce que ça serait.
De la layette ou des bougies,
ou des cadres.
Comment t'appellerais ce magasin ?
"Le magasin de trucs
qu'on peut acheter ailleurs"
En fait, le magasin d'à côté
est disponible
si tu veux venir le visiter.
Super.
Tu veux bien surveiller le magasin ?
Si on m'appelle, crie après moi.
Tu veux que je surveille
ton magasin ? Beurk.
Sophia,
tu peux me dire si...
Salut.
Tout va bien. Sophia est partie. Et elle
m'a demandé de surveiller le magasin.
Super.
Tu penses quoi de ça ?
En ce moment.
Là de suite ?
Dans mon Top 4.
C'est un cadeau d'anniversaire
pour mon copain.
Je voulais lui acheter un truc sexy
et amusant. Mais je peux pas me décider.
Alors, si t'étais hétéro,
tu préférerais ça...
Ou ça ?
Tu ne dis rien du tout.
Je vais lui acheter
un jeu vidéo et oublier ça.
Non. Non. J'adore.
Quand je dis que j'adore,
je veux dire que ton copain adorera.
Parce que j'aime les hommes.
Je parie que ton copain
est trop mignon.
Est-ce que ça rend
mes seins trop gros ?
Non. Achète ça.
T'es folle.
Des problèmes ?
Ça a été assez calme.
Écoutez, j'organise une petite
fête avec du vin et du fromage
demain soir.
Vous devriez venir.
- Oui. Tout à fait. Merci.
- Super. Je vous verrai tous les deux.
Sophia, c'est toi ?
Excusez-moi.
Tu disais qu'on pouvait pas prévoir
de se faire un ami.
Eh bien, je l'ai déjà
fait rire deux fois.
On a échangé
une recette de muffin sans farine.
Et elle est d'accord sur le fait
que Matthew McConaughey
peut puer tant qu'il veut
tant qu'il reste torse nu.
Allez, j'ai retrouvé mon grill.
Alors, traçons notre route, OK ?
Il commence à y avoir du monde ici.
Je ferais mieux de rester
aider Sophia, OK ?
Hé, les filles !
Hé, Tommy, Curtis et moi
on va à cette fête.
- Il faut que tu m'aides.
- Y a quoi ?
Le coup de foudre
de Louise vient étudier ici.
Je veux que tu le surveilles.
T'inquiète pas, Papa.
S'il fait un truc louche,
il gagnera un siège
au 1er rang du stand de tir.
Dis bonjour à Smith et Western.
C'est Wesson.
C'est Wesson et Western ?
Wesson et Western.
Non. C'est... pas grave.
Quand le gamin arrive,
surveille-le, OK ?
S'il se passe un truc,
dis-lui de sauter sur le trampoline.
- Tu le connais ?
- Non, je connais le genre.
Tu sais, sûrement très populaire,
beau gosse qui se prend pour un dur.
Qui brise des cœurs.
Un peu comme moi à 12 ans.
C'était pas là
que t'as arrêté le manège
pour pouvoir descendre ?
Tu voulais tourner trop vite,
Curtis.
Le manège est censé être amusant,
pas une expérience de la NASA.
OK, le voilà.
Souviens-toi.
S'il essaie quelque chose
tu m'appelles de suite. Compris ?
- Oui ?
- Je suis Kenny.
Je viens étudier avec Louise.
Tu es Kenny ? Entre.
Comment ça va ? Le père de Louise.
Voilà les autres.
Entre. Va à la cuisine.
Fais comme chez toi.
Ce que tu veux. Si c'est trop haut,
monte sur une chaise pour le prendre.
C'est Kenny ?!
Mon Dieu.
Il pourrait aller
à un tournoi de bowling.
Pas besoin de s'inquiéter.
La seule attaque qu'il fera
sera sur un échiquier.
On dirait que je peux gérer ce dur.
Pas encore.
Je vais manger du maïs plus tard.
Je pourrais en avoir besoin
pour nettoyer mes dents.
Elle est bonne, Papa.
Ça fera beaucoup rire
quand tu seras en maison de retraite
et que t'auras pas de visites.
C'est marrant.
T'es consigné.
Alors, je crois que je vais
récupérer le grill. C'est super.
Je devrais demander d'autres trucs
que j'ai perdus dans le divorce,
comme mon fauteuil en cuir, ma chaine
hi-fi, mon coffret DVD "BJ et l'ours".
Salut !
Personne n'y avait pensé.
Et puis c'est la 1re fois en 2 ans
que les choses vont dans mon sens.
C'est dur, le divorce.
Tout ce que t'as aimé,
- tu dois le donner à quelqu'un.
- Je comprends.
Pour le 2e, c'est un peu plus facile
parce qu'il te reste plus rien.
Pour le 3e, je lui jetterai les clefs
de la Corsica et ce sera fini.
- Contente que tu sois là.
- C'est super.
Y a de l'alcool et de la nourriture
gratuite. De la lingerie sexy.
Tout ce qui manque, c'est...
Non, y a presque tout ce qu'il faut.
Hé, Soph, super fête.
J'ai une idée pour ta prochaine.
Ils font ces assiettes
avec des porte-verres intégrés
pour pouvoir porter sa nourriture
et son verre dans une main et
regarder les articles de l'autre.
- C'est une très bonne idée.
- Je sais, n'est-ce pas ?
Tu pourrais m'aider à choisir
quelque chose pour mon amie Charlene ?
Bien sûr. Elle est comment ?
Voyons voir.
Elle a de très gros seins.
Et puis une large taille.
Et puis des vraiment grosses fesses.
Laisse-moi te choisir des trucs.
Tommy, c'est Papa.
Comment ça se passe avec Kenny ?
A-t-il essayé quelque chose ?
Quoi ?
Des frites maison ?
Qui fait ça ?
C'est bizarre. Je savais même pas
qu'on avait des patates.
Non, ton papa aime faire des blagues
des fois. C'est tout, fiston.
Écoute.
Je vais rentrer bientô...ôt !
Bientôt comment ?
- Bientôt.
- C'est super.
Parce que j'adorerais qu'on sorte d'ici
pour aller boire un verre.
Et Allison ?
Et la fête ?
Tu peux pas planter ta nouvelle amie
comme ça. Tu vois ?
Je me sens mal. Mais je me vois
vraiment pas être amie avec Allison.
Tu sais, elle est envahissante
et veut tout contrôler. J'aime trop ça.
Mais j'aime les hommes
grands, sexy et beaux qui s'y
connaissent en sous-vêtements féminins.
Si aucun de ces mecs ne vient,
tu m'appelles.
J'y crois toujours pas. Une jeune femme
sexy qui tient un magasin de lingerie
t'embrasse sur la bouche
et toi tu t'enfuis
comme si elle avait soulevé sa jupe
dans cette scène de "The Crying Game."
J'étais paumé, c'était important
pour Allison de se faire une amie.
Je peux pas coucher
avec la future amie d'Allison.
Elle m'en voudrait et se vengerait.
À une fête de Noël,
mon coude s'est accidentellement
frotté au sein de sa sœur.
La nuit d'après,
Allison a utilisé mon rasoir,
pour éplucher des carottes.
Et le lendemain,
je me suis rasé et mon visage
ressemblait à celui de James Woods.
Mais Sophia n'aime pas Allison.
Tu n'empêches rien.
Allison le verra pas comme ça.
Elle va d'abord s'écraser.
Puis sera en colère. Et puis
elle me rejettera la faute dessus.
C'est pas normal.
T'as peur d'écraser Allison
et c'est toi qu'on écrase.
T'as perdu
tout ce qui comptait pour toi.
Et tu peux pas t'accorder
un petit plaisir ?
C'est pas parce que Sophia
aime pas Allison
- que je peux pas coucher avec Sophia.
- Exactement.
Donc,
je ne le dirai pas de suite à Allison.
Pas avant d'avoir le grill
vraiment en notre possession.
Quand Allison découvrira que Sophia
ne l'aime pas...
La fête à la saucisse sera terminée.
Exactement. On sera tellement gavé
de saucisses que l'idée
d'en mettre une autre
dans la bouche...
T'as raison. On devrait
penser à changer le nom.
Hé Louise...
j'ai vu que tes devoirs traînaient.
Alors, j'ai fini
tes exos de géométrie.
T'as quoi ?
La seule chose qui te fait rire
plus que quand ton père
comprend tes devoirs
c'est cette vieille vidéo
du chasseur se faisant battre par
le cerf dans "La Revanche des Animaux".
C'est ce stupide Kenny. Je croyais
qu'on s'était amusés hier.
Et aujourd'hui à l'école,
il m'a complètement ignorée.
Viens là, ma chérie.
Voilà ce qui s'est passé.
Kenny sait qu'une fille
comme toi est trop bien pour lui.
Donc, si je l'aime bien,
je dois faire le premier pas.
Non, j'ai pas voulu dire ça.
Tu dois pas faire le premier pas,
ou aucun pas. Ne bouge pas.
Et si tu bouges,
je veux jamais le savoir.
Dis-le-moi seulement si je le
demande, mais tu devras être honnête,
sauf si je veux pas savoir. Mais si
Kenny fait le premier pas, dis-le-moi,
pour que je le tue.
Donc, ne bouge pas,
et ne le laisse pas faire...
tu vois quoi.
Je crois que tu veux dire
que si j'aime bien Kenny,
je dois lui demander
de faire quelque chose
mais ensuite ne jamais en parler.
Exactement.
Tu sais qu'on peut parler
de tout, pas vrai ?
T'en penses quoi ?
C'est joli, si j'étais en plastique
et sans tête, je chercherais plus.
Tu devrais
le voir sur une vraie femme.
Vraiment ? Tu veux que...
Oh mon Dieu, je les adore... l'adore.
Notre réservation n'est pas avant
une demi-heure,
donc on pourrait y aller,
s'asseoir au bar,
apprendre à mieux se connaître.
Ça a l'air bien.
À moins
que tu préfères autre chose.
Et toi ?
Toi ?
Et toi ?
Bon, j'appuie sur la gâchette.
Mon Dieu.
C'était incroyable.
Notre réservation
n'est pas avant une demi-heure,
si tu veux, on peut
apprendre à mieux se connaître.
Je vais nous faire gagner du temps
et appuyer sur la gâchette.
Ma gâchette ne fait pas ce bruit.
C'est sûrement le gars d'U.P.S.,
bouge pas, j'arrive.
Je crois que j'ai vu ce film.
J'arrive !
Hé, j'étais dans le quartier.
Je suis trop désolée,
tu t'habilles ?
J'essayais
de la nouvelle marchandise.
Écoute, je veux pas m'imposer,
mais j'ai trouvé ces assiettes
porte-verre dont on a parlé.
Et pour t'épargner le trajet,
je t'en ai pris quelques-unes.
Et j'ai pensé qu'on pourrait
boire du vin, traîner ensemble.
C'est du Pinot Grigio ?
Je suis plutôt Chardonnay.
C'est parce que t'as pas essayé ça.
Écoute, je veux pas être impolie,
mais je...
j'ai des projets.
Désolée, non, bien sûr, c'est rien.
Je comprends totalement.
Qui s'arrête...
Tu veux des trucs pour hommes ?
Je crois que le gars d'U.P.S.
a laissé ça.
Et son nom est
Gary Brooks, et sa femme a dû mettre
son nom dans le col,
car il perdait ses chemises
à des camps de baseball imaginaires.
Écoute...
Je sais que t'es là, Gary,
sors d'ici tout de suite.
Mon Dieu.
Je pourrai jamais oublier ça.
Je devrais vous laisser seuls.
- Incroyable.
- C'était ça ou le bustier.
Il me donnait trop de poitrine.
- C'est pas drôle, t'es un con.
- Allez, c'est pas ma faute !
Comment t'as pu me faire ça ?
Tu sais ce que je ressens pour elle.
Elle m'a dragué !
Vraiment ?
C'est si difficile à croire
qu'une femme sexy me trouve séduisant ?
Je suis un homme.
Les hommes ont des besoins !
Et des fois, on pense à nos besoins.
Comment je vais faire
pour la revoir ?
C'est comme si t'avais vu
quelque chose que je voulais
et tu voulais pas que je l'aie.
Elle veut pas traîner avec toi,
elle te trouve envahissante,
autoritaire et dominatrice.
J'y crois pas. Sophia, sors d'ici,
je veux te parler !
Non merci.
Elle veut pas être ton amie, désolé.
Tu sais, c'est dommage,
je vais rentrer à la maison.
Allison, attends.
Tu veux me décrocher,
je peux pas respirer.
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Je lis "Sentiment et Sensibilité".
C'est assez drôle quand on boit.
Désolé, on peut faire le discours
- "tout est de ma faute" et en finir ?
- Écoute,
t'as tout fait juste.
Désolé, j'ai mal entendu, quoi ?
T'as rien fait de mal.
T'as pété un plomb ?
Où sont les enfants ? Ils vont bien ?
Écoute, je t'ai demandé
de me présenter Sophia.
Et tu l'as fait.
J'ai merdé en étant trop entreprenante.
Donc tu m'en veux pas ?
Juste pour le négligé.
On aurait dit Janet Reno.
Je voulais te remercier.
Tu veux me remercier ? Sérieusement,
où sont les enfants ? Tom ! Louise !
Je cherchais un ami,
et j'en ai trouvé un.
- Sophie ne veut pas être ton amie.
- Je ne parle pas d'elle.
Mais de toi.
Tu m'as dit
ce que j'avais besoin d'entendre.
Et il n'y a qu'un vrai ami
qui aurait osé
faire ça. Alors, merci.
J'ai toujours été ton ami.
- J'ai quelque chose pour toi.
- Mon grill, c'est vrai.
Laisse-moi appeler Curtis,
qu'il m'aide à le mettre dans le van.
Je portais ça quand j'étais enceinte
de Tom, et j'ai trouvé
que c'était ta couleur.
Tu rigoleras moins quand je tondrai
la pelouse avec ça.
Et aussi ton coffre
de "BJ et l'ours".
BJ et l'ours !
C'est génial,
j'emmène BJ à la fête de la saucisse,
il faut changer le nom.
- Hé, chérie, comment ça va ?
- Je suis allée au ciné avec Kenny.
- Et c'était trop génial.
- On dirait bien, regarde ce sourire.
Mais tu sais quoi ?
Je veux pas savoir.
Je sais,
mais un tout petit peu ?
Bien sûr.
Kenny m'a tenu la main.
Et j'avais tellement les papillons,
j'ai même pas pu manger mes chocolats.
Chérie, c'est génial.
J'ai aucun problème avec ça.
Mais sache quand même qu'à chaque fois
que tu tiens la main d'un garçon,
un panda pleure.

You're always saying I should play less
video games and get more exercise.
I'm not buying you a trampoline, Tommy.
The only people that use trampolines
are clowns and cheerleaders and those
guys in gorilla suits
that do those summersault dunks.
How am I ever gonna be one of those guys
if you won't buy me a trampoline
and a gorilla suit?!
I'm so tired of having this gorilla
suit trampoline argument with you.
Fine.
Your wish is granted.
Really?
You go on Craigslist, you find
a trampoline for under 50 bucks,
we'll go pick it up this afternoon, OK?
- Dad, you're the best!
- Right!
I can't believe that. One jump, you went
right through. It was like a cartoon.
You got in on video though, right?
I'm not sure. My hand was shaking
like crazy, I was laughing so hard.

"Gary and Allisons Friend"
VO By :  ¤Aka¤
Team Subs-Addicts"
OK. Open the grill, Curtis.
And I'm gonna cook the final quadrant.
I'm just saying, man, this is not
how they did it on the commercial.
On the commercial, the guy who's selling
it got punched in the face 50,000 times.
He says he's an entrepreneur and a chef.
Don't believe everything you see on TV!
Oh my God!
I can't take this anymore.
I want my old grill back!
Allison got my 8-burner
weber with a rotisserie
and a side smoker in the divorce.
We better figure something out.
Because all of our bros
are bringing exotic sausages over
for sausage-fest this weekend!
Have we ever thought about
changing the name of sausage-fest?
Why would we change
the name of sausage-fest?
It's a 10-year tradition of men
getting together with their meat.
Hey, Curtis. Nice job, Gary, buying
Tom a trampoline off of Craigslist.
Do they sell loaded guns on there
'cause Louise would have a ball
with one of those.
Now, calm down, Allison. It was
an accident. And it was hilarious.
Anyway, I gotta few things I want
to talk to you about. So, excuse me.
Bye. I gotta get going anyway. I gotta
pick up the t-shirts for sausage-fest.
You're gonna love'em, man.
They got a dude
who's shoving a 10-inch
kielbasa down his throat.
And it says "sausage-fest '09"
written underneath.
I really can't talk you
into changing the name?
Are you hearing something
i'm not hearing?
What's up?
OK. First of all, Louise has been
a little down in the dumps lately.
Apparently a boy she has
a crush on doesn't like her back.
What? Who wouldn't like Louise?
She's a total package.
She's smart. She's beautiful.
She'll tell you if you're
ending a sentence in a preposition.
Although I don't even know why
you would need to know that for.
Anyways, please, Gary,
just be extra sweet to her this week.
Me? Yeah.
I'm always sweet.
- Come on, get out.
- No, Gary. Hang on.
I have a favor to ask you.
You know that
little lingerie boutique on abbot Kinney
that you paint every year?
I need you to introduce
me to the owner Sophia.
Why?
'cause I feel like she'll cool.
And, like, we could be friends.
You have friends.
Yeah. I have married friends.
And I have mom friends.
And you know that book club I joined?
It turned out to be a bust.
I came in all prepared to
discuss "sense and sensibility".
All the women wanted to do was drink
and tell their great sex stories.
And thanks to you, I didn't have any.
1995.
Valentine's day.
Come on.
Gary, your foot slipped off the mattress
and you found a spot you never
were able to find again. Please.
I found it that one time, didn't i?!
Come on, get out of my house!
Look, Sophia just seems like
someone easygoing and laid back.
Kind of like me.
And that's why,
I have a very specific plan
on how to get her.
Phase 1 being you introduce us.
Hate to break this to you, Allison.
You don't make friends
with plans and phases. 2 people meet.
And if they hit it off,
eventually they become friends.
Yeah. That's not how I want to do it.
See, I figure with you
brokering the introduction,
it'll take the pressure off, you know?
And give us something
immediately we have in common.
Phase 2 or "making fun of you."
It's probably the dumbest idea
I've ever heard in my life.
But since I don't care at all,
I'll help you.
Thank you. Thank you.
For a price.
What?
I'll help you make friends with Sophia,
you give me my grill back.
Wait. OK, wait.
You can't do me a favor
unless you get something in return.
All right. All right. Fine.
It's a shame though because I found this
recipe for polenta-stuffed bell peppers.
Hey, I don't want to know
what you did with my grill
anymore than you want to know
what I did with your melon baller!
Gotta tell ya. Being in here
with you and all the sexy lingerie,
it's very odd to be so repulsed
and turned on at the same time.
- How are ya?
- Great.
We were just in the neighborhood.
So, we decided to pop in and see what's
happening in the world of thongs.
I was going to call you.
It's almost repainting time.
Perfect coincidence. This is the
new boss of my painting company.
It's my ex-wife Allison.
Allison, my friend Sophia.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.
I love your shop.
I get all my sexy whatnots here.
I just love your store.
I mean, you have such a good eye.
It's tasteful and Bohemian
at the same time.
Thank you so much.
I've never actually told
anyone this. But,
I've always wanted to open up
my own shop one day.
I mean, I don't know what it would be.
Baby clothes or candles
or maybe picture frames.
What would you call that store? "Stuff
you could buy at other stores" store?
Actually, the space next door
is available if you want
to pop over and check it out.
- Yeah. Great.
- Do you mind watching the place?
If anyone has a question,
you could just yell for me.
You want me to watch
your lingerie shop? Yuck.
Hey, Sophia,
can you tell me if this is...
Hi.
Everything's OK.
Sophia left.
And she told me to watch
the store while she's gone.
Great.
What do you think of this?
This moment.
Right now in my life?
Top 4.
It's an anniversary
present for my boyfriend.
I wanted to get him something
sexy and fun. But I can't decide.
So, if you were a straight guy,
would you prefer this...
Or this?
You're not saying anything.
Maybe I should just buy him
a videogame and forget it.
No. No. I love it.
When I say I love it, I mean
I know your boyfriend will love it.
'cause I love men.
I bet your boyfriend is yummy.
Does this bra make
my boobs look too big?
No. You're buying that.
You're insane.
Any problems?
It's been pretty quiet.
Listen, I'm having a little after
hours wine and cheese
reception tomorrow night.
You guys should come.
- Yeah. Definitely. Thanks.
- Great. I'll see you both then.
Hey, Sophia is that you?
Excuse me, guys.
You said you couldn't make
a friend by planning it out.
For your information,
I already made her laugh twice.
We exchanged a wheat-free muffin recipe.
And, she agrees that Matthew Mcconaughey
can smell as bad as he wants
as long as he keeps his shirt off.
Come on. I got my grill back.
So, let's hit the road. OK?
You know what?
It's really getting packed in here.
I better stick around
and help Sophia out. OK?
Hey, girlfriends!
Hey, Tommy, Curtis and I are
about to go to this party.
I need you to help me
out with something.
What's up?
You know Louise's crush
is coming over to study.
I want you to keep an eye on this kid?
Don't worry about it, dad.
If he tried anything funny,
he'll win front row seats
to the gun show.
Say hello to Smith
and Western.
It's Wesson.
It's Wesson and Western?
Wesson and Western.
No. It's...
doesn't matter.
When the kid comes over,
you just keep an eye on him, OK?
You know what? If anything breaks out,
ask him to jump on the trampoline.
- Have you met this kid?
- No. But I know the type.
You know, probably super popular,
handsome, thinks he's a badass.
Walks around breaking hearts.
Pretty much me at 12 years old.
It wasn't the year you stopped the cups
in the middle off the ride to get off?
You were spinning
the tea cups to fast, Curtis.
Tea cup ride is supposed to be fun.
Not a damn Nasa experiment.
All right, that's him now.
OK, remember.
This kid tries anything,
you call me immediately. You follow?
- Can I help you?
- I'm Kenny.
I'm here to study with Louise.
You're Kenny? Hey, come on in.
How are ya? Louise's dad.
These are some other people.
Come on in. Just go into the kitchen.
Make yourself at home.
Whatever you want. If you can't reach it
just climb up on a chair and get it.
That's Kenny?!
Oh my gosh.
That kid could pose
for bowling trophies.
You got nothing to worry about.
The only move that kid is
making is on a chessboard.
Look like I can put these bad boys away.
Not yet.
I'm having corn on the cob later.
I might need them to pick my teeth with.
That's a good one, dad.
That'll get a lot of laughs
when you're at the old folks home
and you don't get any visitors.
It's funny.
You're grounded.
OK. So, I think I'm gonna get
the grill back. This is great.
I should ask for other things I lost
in the divorce. Like my leather chair.
My stereo.
My "BJ and the bear" DVD box set.
Hello!
Remake nobody's thought of yet.
Bottom line is the first time in 2 years
things have been coming back my way.
Divorce is amazingly hard.
Everything you ever loved,
- just have to give it away to somebody.
- I hear that, man.
Second one goes down a little easier
because you ain't got nothing left.
The third one, I'll just throw her the
keys to the Corsica and be done with it.
- Glad you could make it.
- This is great.
You got free booze, free food.
Sexy lingerie.
All that's missing is...
No, you pretty much hit this one
out of the park.
Hey, Soph,
great party.
Actually I have an idea for your
next one. They make these plates
with the cup holders built right in
so you can hold your food
and drink in one hand and browse
through the merchandise with your other.
- That's a great suggestion.
- I know, right?
Hey, could you help me pick something
out for my girlfriend Charlene?
Sure. What kind of figure
does she have?
Let's see.
She got really big boobs.
But then she got a large waist.
But then she got a really big butt.
Let me pick out a few things for you.
Tommy, it's dad.
How's everything going over there
with Kenny? Did he try anything?
What?
Homemade French fries?
Who does that?
That's weird.
I didn't even know we had potatoes.
No, you're dad just likes to say things
funny sometimes. That's all, son.
Look. I'll be home soo... oon!
How soon?
- Soon-ish.
- That's great.
Because I would love for you and me
to get out of here and a grab a drink.
What about Allison?
What about the party?
You can't just walk out on your new
friend and everything. You know?
Listen, I feel bad. But I really
don't see Allison and I being friends.
I mean, she's kind of pushy and
controlling. And I'm just not into that.
But I am into big,
sexy, handsome guys who know their
way around women's underwear.
If any of those guys
don't show up, you call me.
I still can't believe it. A young,
hot woman who owns a lingerie shop
kisses you on the mouth
and then you run out of there
like she hiked up her skirt from
that scene in "the crying game."
I didn't know what to do.
This meant so much
to Allison to make a new friend.
I can't sleep with the lady
Allison want to be friends with. She'd
be mad at me. And Allison's vengeful.
One time at a Christmas party,
my elbow accidentally brushed up
against her sister's boob.
Next night
Allison takes my razor.
She starts peeling carrots with it.
So, the next morning after that,
I go to shave, the next thing I know,
my face looks like James Woods.
But Sophia doesn't like Allison.
You're not preventing anything.
That's not how Allison's going
to see it. First she'll be crushed.
Then she'll be angry. Then she'll
blame me for the whole thing.
This ain't right. OK.
You're worried about crushing Allison
and you're the one who got crushed.
You said it yourself.
You lost everything you care about.
And now you don't get to have
a little bit of pleasure?
Just because she doesn't
want to be Allison's friends,
- doesn't mean i can't sleep with her.
- Exactly.
So, now I wouldn't tell
Allison immediately.
I mean, not until we have
the grill physically in our possession.
By the time Allison figures out
that Sophia's not into her...
Sausage-fest will be over and done with.
Exactly. We will be so filled
with sausage that the thought of
stuffing another sausage in our mouth...
You know what, you're right. We probably
should think about changing the name.
Hey Louise...
I saw your homework was laying out.
So, I finished all your geometric
proofs for you.
What's the matter honey?
The only thing that makes you laugh
more than daddy
understands your homework
is the old video of
the hunter getting beaten up by the deer
in "animals fight back."
It's stupid Kenny. I thought we had a
lot of fun studying together last night.
And then today at school,
he totally ignored me.
Come on sweet girl.
Look, this is what happened.
Kenny sees a girl like you,
and he just thinks he's completely out
of his league. That's all.
So, you're saying if I like him,
I have to make the first move.
No. That's not what I'm saying.
You're not to make the first move or any
move whatsoever. Don't make any moves.
And if you do,
I don't ever want to know about it.
You can't tell me unless if I ask you.
I don't want to hear it.
But if Kenny makes the first move,
you have to tell me so I can
kill him.
So, don't make any moves,
and don't let him do...
you know what I'm saying.
I think what you're saying
is if I like Kenny,
I should ask him to go do something
but then never mention it.
Exactly.
You know we can talk
about anything, right?
What do you think?
It's nice. If I was a headless plastic
man, my search would be over.
Maybe you should see it on a real woman.
Really? You want me to just...
Oh, my God. I love those... it.
Look our reservation isn't for
another half hour,
so we can go over there,
sit at the bar,
get to know each other a little better.
Sounds great.
Unless there's something
else you'd rather do.
Do you?
Do you?
Do you?
I'm just going to pull the trigger here.
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, that was incredible.
Look our reservation isn't for
like another half hour,
if you want we could get to know
each other a little better.
No, I'm just going to save us some
time and pull the trigger here.
My trigger doesn't make that noise.
It's probably the U.P.S guy.
Don't move. I'll be right back.
I think I've seen this movie.
Coming!
Hey, I was in the neighborhood.
God. I'm so sorry.
Are you getting dressed?
I was just trying on some
of our new merchandise.
Listen. I don't mean to barge in. But
I found some of those plates with
the cup holders we were talking about.
And I figured I'd save you the trip.
I got you a few. And then
I thought we could have some wine.
You know maybe! Like that!
Is that Pinot Grigio?
I'm more of a Chardonnay girl.
Well, that's because
you haven't tried this?
Listen, I don't mean to be rude.
But it's just that
I have plans.
I'm so sorry. No.
Of course. It's no big deal.
I mean, I totally get it.
Who likes to drop by...
Are you selling guy's stuff now?
I think the U.P.S guy left that.
So, the U.P.S guy's name
is not only Gary Brooks.
His wife had to write his name
inside his collar
'cause he kept losing
it at fantasy baseball camp!
Allison, look...
I know you're in here, Gary.
Get out here, right now!
Oh, my God.
I can never unsee that.
Maybe I should leave you two alone.
- Unbelievable.
- It was either this or the bustier.
And I thought it made
me look too chesty.
- It's not funny. You're a Jerk.
- Come on, Allison. It's not my fault!
How could you do this to me?
You know how I felt about her.
She came onto me!
Really?
It's so hard to believe that a sexy
woman would find all this attractive?
Look, I'm a man, Allison.
Men have needs! And sometimes,
men, we think with our needs.
How am I supposed to
hang out with her now?
I mean, it's like you saw
something that I wanted.
And you just didn't want me to have it.
She doesn't want to hang out with you,
She thinks you're pushy,
bossy, and controlling.
I don't believe that. Sophia,
get out here! I want to talk to you!
No thank you!
She doesn't want to
be your friend. Sorry.
Well, you know, that's too bad.
I'm just gonna go home.
Allison, wait.
Just wait.
Would you unhook me?
I can't breathe in this thing.
What you doing?
Reading "sense and sensibility."
It's actually kind of
funny when you drink.
I'm sorry. Can we just
do the whole it-was-all-my-fault
- speech and just be done with it?
- Look, Gary.
You did everything right.
I'm sorry.
I think I misheard you. What?
You didn't do anything wrong.
Have you snapped? Where are the kids?
Are the kids safe?
Gary, look I...
I asked you to introduce me to Sophia.
And you did. I mean,
I blew it by coming on too strong.
OK. So you're not blaming
me for any of this?
Well, maybe just the negligee.
I mean, you looked like Janet Reno.
Actually, I wanted to thank you.
You want to thank me? OK, seriously,
where are kids? Tom! Louise!
Look, I was looking for a friend.
And I found one.
- Sophia doesn't want to be your friend.
- I'm not talking about her.
I'm talking about you.
You told me things
that I needed to hear.
And only a real friend
would have the guts
to do that. So, thank you.
I've always been your friend, Allison.
- I got something for ya.
- My grill. That's right.
Let me get curtis over here, because I'm
gonna need help putting it in my van.
I wore this when I was pregnant...
With Tom.
And I thought it was your color.
You laugh. But if you think I'm not
mowing the lawn in this, you're crazy.
And also your "BJ and the bear" box set.
BJ and the bear!
This is great.
I'm bringing BJ to sausage-fest
we gotta change the name.
- Hey, honey. How's it going?
- I went to the movies with Kenny.
- And it was so great.
- It must have been. Look at that smile.
But you know what?
I don't want to know.
I know. But
can I tell you a little?
Of course.
Kenny held my hand in the movie.
Ani had such butterflies
I couldn't even eat my milk duds.
Sweetie, that's great.
I have no problem with that.
But just so you know, every time
you hold ands with a little boy,
a panda cries.

Bonne nouvelle !
Je viens chez toi pour Thanksgiving.
Génial. Mais tu devais pas aller
chez les parents de Charlene ?
Je suis plus vraiment le bienvenu
depuis que j'ai joué au Pictionnary
avec son père.
Désolé, mais comment on dessine
un cacatoès ?
Je sais ce que c'est.
J'ai dû dessiner un regard.
Attends. Quand tu viendras,
tu pourras réparer mon auto-radio ?
Bosser à Thanksgiving ?
Je pourrais te taxer 50 $
pour la bouffe.
Je viendrai à 14 heures
avec mes outils.
- T'es affreuse.
- Pardon ?
Tout le monde complimente
une femme dans une jolie robe.
Je suis fier de sortir du lot.
Cette stratégie marche ?
Vu ta tête, faut croire que non.
Désolée. Je suis préoccupée.
La copine qui devait m'accompagner
à cette soirée vient d'annuler.
Elle serait en observation
à l'hôpital.
Ce qui veut dire nouveaux nichons.
Je pourrais venir. Suffit de rafraîchir
le costume dans mon van.
Merci. Mais tu risques de t'ennuyer.
C'est l'association d'anciens élèves
de ma fac,
c'est que du blabla universitaire.
Pourquoi tu penses
que je serais mal à l'aise ?
Parce que je suis né
à l'arrière d'une voiture,
qu'on m'a nourri au beurre de
cacahuètes et que je nageais en jean ?
Désolée.
Je voulais pas paraître si critique.
Tu vas pas t'amuser.
J'en ai marre des stéréotypes
sur les ouvriers,
des cols bleus, comme moi
qui aiment pas l'art,
la littérature,
la peinture ou les livres.
Merci. Mais c'est plus simple
que j'y aille toute seule.
D'accord ? Je prends mon manteau.
Si un jour on sort après le boulot,
prendre un verre,
pour mieux se connaître,
tu verras que tu te trompes sur les gens
comme moi. Par exemple,
tu serais surprise d'apprendre
que j'en connais un rayon en vin.
Mon Dieu.
Ce petit a un...
Joli. Un soupçon de prune.
Il est fort et charnu.
Mon Dieu.
J'ai fait une dégustation de vins
avec Allison, il y a quelques années.
Ça t'étonne, hein ?
Je voulais dire, mon Dieu,
t'as ouvert le Bordeaux à 800 $
que je devais apporter
aux enchères, ce soir.
Mon Dieu.
Je vais le recracher.

Y a pas de juste milieu
avec Sasha. Si tu sors pas d'une
école de riches,
t'es un bon à rien dans "Cops"
qui jette des boîtes de conserve
sur le pare-brise du voisin
parce qu'il t'accuse d'avoir volé
son boa constrictor.
Pourquoi les blancs sont
toujours torses nus
quand ils se font arrêter ?
Tu te fais plaquer sur la pelouse,
t'as de l'herbe partout
et en prison, ça te démange.
Si tu veux enfreindre la loi,
habille-toi. Un peu de fierté !
Très juste, Curtis. Écoute,
J'ai entendu que Sasha faisait rien
pour Thanksgiving, alors je vais
l'inviter chez moi pour lui montrer
que j'ai beaucoup de classe et d'humour.
Non, sérieusement.
C'est mon plan.
Pardon. Bonne chance, mon pote.
Je crois en toi.
Inutile de t'excuser encore.
Allez. T'as reçu tous mes mails ?
Sauf si y a
un autre "Garylicious71",
- je les ai reçus, merci.
- Tu fais quoi pour Thanksgiving ?
Tu veux venir chez moi ? Y aura Curtis
et les enfants. T'en dis quoi ?
En fait, ma grand-tante m'a invitée
avec ses copines de bridge.
Ce sera comme dîner
avec les acteurs de Cocoon,
mais elle fait un osso buco d'enfer,
c'est mon plat préféré.
L'osso buco, tu veux rire ?
Qu'est-ce qui a deux pouces
et est le roi de l'osso buco ?
Ce mec.
Je fais le meilleur osso buco.
Allez. Viens chez moi.
Ça sera génial.
Tu... D'accord,
tu vas faire un osso buco ?
J'ai déjà acheté le buco et tout.
Allez. Alors ?
- Je crois pas.
- Une seconde.
Peut-être...
Ça te fera peut-être changer d'avis.
- Mon Dieu
- Eh oui.
T'as remplacé mon Bordeaux ?
Je connais sa valeur
et ton salaire, et,
c'est à peu près la même somme.
Alors, tu dis quoi ?
Tu viendras ?
D'accord, je viendrai.
- Bien.
- Merci.
De rien.
T'as dépensé 800 $ pour du vin
et tu peux pas me rembourser les 10 $
que je t'ai prêté pour avoir
ton prénom sur un grain de riz ?
C'est pas du vin à 800 $.
D'accord ?
J'ai acheté une bouteille à 15 $
et j'ai mis l'étiquette dessus.
Pas con.
T'as dépensé 800 $ pour du vin
et tu me rembourses pas les 10 $
pour avoir ton prénom
sur un grain de riz.
Le mec a fait n'importe quoi.
Il a oublié le "r" de mon prénom.
C'est écrit "Gay" sur mon grain de riz.
Tommy, prêt à passer le week-end
avec ton père ?
C'est un beau bébé.
J'aurais pas dû laisser ta mère
te parler de sexe, vu que c'est le sujet
qu'elle déteste le plus.
En fait, c'est son devoir
pour son cours de santé.
Et comme je pars avec Howard, tu dois
t'assurer qu'il ne le néglige pas.
C'est informatique et ça enregistre
tout ce que je fais 24 h sur 24.
Oui, j'ai connu ça.
Et j'ai eu ma propre maison.
Louise, tu as encore Gandhi.
Tu lui as pas trouvé de maison ?
Pas encore. Et je voulais pas
le laisser au refuge.
Mais ça va, sauf quand il fait pipi
par terre.
Oui, j'ai connu ça, chérie.
Et j'ai eu ma propre maison.
Prenez vos affaires,
venez chez papa pour Thanksgiving.
- Louise, tu m'aides ?
- Bien sûr.
Prends ça... voilà.
Je devrais annuler
mon voyage, demain ?
Je pourrais rencontrer la famille
d'Howard une autre fois.
J'ai jamais passé Thanksgiving
sans les enfants.
Culpabilise pas.
T'as élevé deux gosses géniaux
et t'as fait tout ça
sans te laisser aller.
Tu t'es bien entretenue,
t'as une jolie peau.
- De beaux yeux.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux.
- Tu veux quoi ?
- Quoi ?
Tu veux que j'achète le CD de Michael
Buble pour qu'on te voie pas l'acheter ?
T'es sérieuse ?
Il a sorti un nouvel album ?
J'ai un autre problème. Assieds-toi.
Écoute, ma patronne... Sasha,
a tendance à penser que je suis
un bouffon de classe inférieure.
C'est ça le problème.
Et je voudrais
l'impressionner pour Thanksgiving
en faisant de l'osso buco
et il faut que tu m'aides.
Faudrait aussi que tu me dises
ce qu'est l'osso buco.
Je sais pas et Curtis m'a dit
que c'était le centre des Jets.
L'osso buco,
c'est du jarret de veau et je ne peux
pas. J'ai plein de choses à faire
avant d'aller à San Francisco avec
Howard. Et je te le disais au lit,
ne promets jamais
une chose que tu ne peux tenir.
Et comme je te disais au lit, ne
t'inquiète pas, je vais y arriver seul.
C-U-M-I-N.
Ça ne peut pas se prononcer
comme c'est écrit.
- Le voilà.
- Hé, papa !
Tu m'as manqué, mon Dieu.
Où t'étais ?
Je faisais de la randonnée
dans la Sierra.
Avec juste mes vêtements sur le dos
et mon
petit sac de ce que j'appelle
mon "extenseur d'esprit baja."
Formidable.
Laisse-moi t'offrir une bière.
Tu dois avoir soif.
Écoute, ma patronne va venir.
C'est une jolie fille.
Rends-moi service,
comporte-toi au mieux.
Pas de problème.
J'ai même un dessert.
Un dessert ?
Des brownies.
- On ne va pas planer cette année.
- C'est pas ce que tu penses.
- C'est du peyotl.
- Du peyotl ?
Allez, mets ça de côté.
Finis ta bière.
Je vais dire aux enfants que
ce qui reste de leur grand-père est là.
Votre grand-père est là.
Oh mon Dieu.
C'est le bordel ici.
Je vous avais demandé de m'aider.
- Y a eu quoi ?
- Tom a laissé son bébé pleurer
pour jouer à la console
et j'ai dû le promener.
- Tu m'as appelé ?
- Tom a eu un bébé ?
Ça fait si longtemps ?
Salut papi.
Tom est censé s'occuper de ce bébé.
Louise, voudrais-tu rendre le bébé
à son propriétaire ?
OK.
Je supporte pas que ça pleure.
Ramasse le bébé, Tom.
C'est trop dur, je peux pas m'amuser.
Je dois maintenir ce truc stupide
en vie toute la journée.
Si tu voulais pas de la responsabilité,
t'aurais dû te retirer. Du devoir.
Allez, nettoyez la maison.
Je dois finir l'osso buco.
Pourquoi pas de la dinde ?
C'est Thanksgiving.
De la dinde ? Ma patronne vient.
Faut que ce soit plus que spécial.
Papa, j'y ai réfléchi et je ne veux pas
manger un animal qui a été élevé
dans une toute petite cage toute sa vie
parce que tu craques pour ta patronne.
T'es pas obligée.
Grand-père a amené des brownies.
Tu vas adorer cette stéréo.
Elle est trop puissante.
T'es prévenu...
Arrêté au feu rouge,
on va te lancer des regards mauvais
et des commentaires méchants
à son sujet.
C'est bien.
Attends qu'ils voient que je suis vieux,
blanc et que j'écoute Michael Buble.
Je suis à la bourre,
Sasha sera là dans une heure.
J'ai tellement de retard.
J'ai tous ces trucs qui font "classe".
Regarde ça...
Une bougie parfumée...
Un CD de jazz,
qui dit même "Jazz de soirée."
Et des magazines intelligents.
Je vais les mettre dans la maison.
Elle pensera que je les lis.
Ils sont vraiment classes.
Les BD sont même pas drôles.
Laisse-moi te montrer
"la pièce de résistance". Et voilà.
Osso buco "à la Brooks".
J'ai trouvé la recette sur internet.
C'est la première fois
que tu cuisines sans
Buitoni, Knorr,
ou ce gant blanc qui parle.
Vas-y goûte.
T'en penses quoi ?
- Oh mon Dieu.
- C'est bon, hein ?
T'as mis combien de sel ?
Je sais pas.
Ça fait 2 cuillères à café, non ?
- Pourquoi, y en a trop ?
- Pas si Sasha est en partie chèvre.
Oh mon Dieu ! Je peux pas servir ça.
On dirait de l'eau de mer à la viande.
Oh mon Dieu.
Sasha sera là dans 59 minutes.
Tu sais quoi ? Il est temps de
sortir la grosse artillerie. Tes clefs.
Gary ! Tu fais quoi ici ?
- J'ai besoin d'aide, une urgence.
- T'avais pas la recette ?
Si, mais je peux m'en servir que pour
décorer des verres de margarita.
Quoi ?
Ça s'est mal passé,
j'ai besoin d'aide.
Désolée, je peux pas.
Mon vol part dans quelques heures.
- Je dois finir de me préparer.
- Je t'en supplie !
Sinon le dîner avec Sasha
est foutu !
- Gary, je ne peux pas !
- D'accord, ça va.
Je croyais que ça se passerait bien.
Je dois sortir le grand jeu alors.
Mets-toi là un instant.,
je vais détourner tes bagages.
Vraiment ?
Vraiment, Gary ?
Je pars 2 nuits. Je pourrais
prendre que ça s'il le fallait.
Je ne voulais pas le dire,
mais Tom et Louise
veulent vraiment, vraiment
te voir avant que tu partes.
C'est Tom qui est venu me voir
les yeux mouillés pour me dire, "papa,
"comment savoir combien
de Thanksgiving il nous reste ?"
Et je me suis dit,
la sagesse des enfants.
Tu me feras pas culpabiliser.
On verra.
Merde.
La maison est propre, Curtis a presque
fini avec le van. Comment va l'agneau ?
Bien. Tu sais, on a vraiment
de la chance d'en avoir trouvé.
Ça sent bon, ça ressemble à quoi ?
Mon Dieu, ça a l'air super !
Tu m'es vraiment redevable pour ça.
Je pensais à une carte de remerciement,
mais OK, faisons ça vite.
Mon Dieu ! Ne me donne pas la nausée,
j'ai un avion dans une heure.
Et pourquoi t'as enlevé ça alors ?
Quoi ? Je vais commencer les tartes,
je veux pas de farine sur ma robe.
Super, tu fais des tartes.
Continue.
Ce soir doit être spécial. Merci.
J'arrive pas à croire
que tu craques sur Sasha.
Ça va être comme La Belle et la Bête,
sauf que quand elle t'embrasse,
ça ne changera rien.
- Tu veux bien faire tes tartes ?
- 10 minutes.
Finies ou pas, je pars me préparer.
10 minutes, ça me va.
C'est super.
Elle partira pas sans ça.
Papa, allons.
Le chauffe-eau est vieux. Tu peux pas
prendre de douches si chaudes.
J'ai pas pris de douche.
Oh mon Dieu !
Oh nom de Dieu !
Tu vas nous faire arrêter !
Mets des vêtements.
Ma patronne vient. Et des coquillages,
ça remplace pas une chemise !
Oh mon Dieu !
Le chien a pissé sur le canapé !
Tom, Louise, je croyais que Gandhi
était un chien non violent.
Y en a partout sur mon canapé !
Pourquoi tu cries comme ça ?
Papa,
faudrait que tu rassembles ces tables,
que tu mettes des glaçons
dans les verres,
et que t'enlèves le sel et le poivre
des ballons de foot en céramique
pour les mettre dans la salière
et le moulin à poivre, OK ?
Oublie.
- J'ai compris.
- Merci !
Tu dois t'occuper du bébé,
c'est ta tâche.
- T'assures mieux.
- Parce que je suis une femme ?
Quand es-tu devenu
si patriarcal, Tom ?
Depuis toujours,
en quoi c'est mal d'aimer son pays ?
- C'est quoi ?
- C'est Ratt !
Et c'est beaucoup trop fort !
Y a un court-circuit.
Je peux pas éteindre la musique.
Tu dois ! Le voisin, M. Biscazzi,
a la gâchette facile avec le 911.
Tu dois l'éteindre !
J'aimerais, mais j'ai enfermé
les clés dans le van.
Bon, il va falloir
forcer la serrure.
Louise, prends le chien en haut.
Tom, aide ta mère.
Rends-moi un service,
aide-moi à sortir ce canapé.
Fais attention,
il est couvert de pisse.
Comment passer ce truc énorme
dans ce petit trou ?
Laisse-moi appeler Charlene.
- Elle travaille à Ikea !
- Vas-y.
Comment tu peux ne pas savoir
installer une stéréo ?
T'es ingénieur du son !
C'est ton van.
Ton système électrique est bricolé.
Les essuies-glaces
sont connectés aux phares
connectés à la clim.
Si tu veux faire marcher le klaxon,
tu dois reculer le siège passager.
Trouvons une solution, je t'en prie,
Sacha va arriver d'ici une seconde.
Génial.
Je vous l'ai dit,
je ne tolèrerai plus tout ce bruit.
Désolé, M. Biscazzi,
on essaie de l'éteindre.
Eh bien, c'est trop tard.
Ça a dégénéré.
- Les flics sont en chemin.
- Quoi ?
- Pas la police !
- Je crois que c'est bon !
Merde ! Au feu !
- Je vais chercher un extincteur.
- J'ai la jambe cassée !
Et si c'était un vrai bébé ?
Je serais heureux,
ça voudrait dire que j'ai quelqu'un.
Rapprochez les tables,
glaçons dans les verres !
Allez, fais des tartes, dépêche !
- Où est ma robe ?
- Continue de faire des tartes !
Glaçons, salière...
Et police. Parfait.
M. l'agent,
on essaie d'éteindre la musique.
Posez l'extincteur.
J'aimerais bien,
mais ça fume à côté de vous.
Posez-le où vous êtes
et levez les mains.
Et tournez-vous.
Sasha, salut, bienvenue.
- Tu dois prendre la responsabilité.
- Je le voulais pas à la base !
- Gary, où est ma robe ?
- Tais-toi, Allison.
Me taire ? J'ai trimé pour ce repas
et c'est comme ça que tu me remercies ?
Quelqu'un a volé ma beuh.
C'est un mauvais moment ?
- Voilà l'histoire...
- Les mains en l'air.
Vous devez parler dans le mégaphone ?
On est à 2 mètres.
Désolé que ça a pris si long.
J'ai dû donner mes papiers
et il y a eu une toute petite petite
petite fouille corporelle.
L'agneau est brûlé.
C'est la cata.
Je devrais te dire
que c'était le truc
le plus génial que j'ai vu !
Je suis pas un de ces gars
dans Cops> qui se fait baisser les frocs
par le chien de flic ?
Bien sûr que non !
Même s'ils ont attendu longtemps
avant de rappeler le chien.
Mais allez,
tu dois voir le côté drôle.
Tu sais combien de fois
je me suis demandé
qui ces hélicoptères de la police
éclairaient ?
C'était nous ! On était eux !
- Tu veux rester pour dîner ?
- Le dîner est prêt.
On a de la purée de patates
fait maison et super croustillante,
des épis de maïs.
Et ils ont rajouté un gâteau au chocolat
puisqu'on était leurs seuls clients
à Thanksgiving.
T'en dis quoi ?
Tu restes pour souper ?
J'adorerais.
Et pas seulement à cause du poulet frit.
Mais c'est un bon argument.
Bienvenue à Thanksgiving
dans mon pays.
Tu détesterais Thanksgiving chez moi.
C'est si coincé.
Ta famille
crie et rie et raconte
des histoires.
Et j'y crois pas que je vais dire ça,
mais j'ai toujours un peu faim.
C'est peut-être la beuh. Papa !
Si tu dois fumer,
va derrière la maison !
Je suis derrière la maison !
Tu t'es bien amusée ?
Je sais pas à quel point
tu connais les femmes, mais
un gars qui fait un effort,
c'est très important.
Je t'ai amené quelque chose.
C'est le vin que tu m'as acheté.
Vin spécial pour occasion spéciale.
Je suis pas sûr
qu'il soit vraiment spécial.
Tu rigoles ? C'est une super bouteille
de vin. T'as un tire-bouchon ?
On n'en aura pas besoin,
ça se dévisse.
J'ai collé l'étiquette
par-dessus, elle était pas chère.
Joli !
J'ai pas dit
pour quoi j'étais reconnaissante.
Je suis reconnaissante
de travailler avec quelqu'un
assez généreux pour
m'inviter chez lui
parce que j'avais rien à faire...
et...
qui s'est donné de la peine
pour que je passe un bon moment.
Très classe.
Je suis ta chef.
C'est ça qui est si sexy.
Coucou.
Mince.
Merci de m'avoir laissé rester.
Je peux pas quitter
les enfants pour les fêtes.
Mais je sais pas comment rentrer
à la maison. Même si ton père
m'a proposé de m'emmener
sur son tapis volant.
Il y a un arrêt de bus à deux rues.
Vous savez, Allison,
je peux vous ramener.
Vraiment ? Merci.
Il se fait tard, donc, je...
- On se voit lundi.
- D'accord.
Allison, attends une minute.
Tu m'as vraiment sauvé ce soir.
Vraiment. Et je veux te donner
- cette bouteille de vin.
- Oh mon Dieu.
Gary, merci, c'est une
bouteille incroyable, t'es sûr ?
Ouais, j'en suis sûr.
Elle est aussi très chère.
C'est Thanksgiving
et c'est le moins que je puisse faire.
Merci.
Tu sais quoi ? J'ai oublié,
j'ai ton CD de Michael Buble...
Sasha regarde. Pas maintenant.
Sasha... attends qu'elle se tourne.
Attends...
Elle regarde en bas, donne-le-moi.
C'est celui avec les chansons bonus !

Good news! I'm coming to
your house for Thanksgiving.
That's fantastic. What happened to you
going to Charlene's parents' house?
Yeah, I'm not really
welcome there anymore
since I was Charlene's dad's
Pictionary partner.
I'm sorry,
but how would you draw a cockatoo?
I've been there, man.
I had to draw manhole.
Curtis, hold up. When you're at my house
will you fix my car stereo?
You want me to work on Thanksgiving?
I could charge you $50
for turkey and beer.
I will be there at 2:00 with my tools.
You look awful.
Excuse me?
Anybody can tell a woman in
a beautiful dress how pretty she is.
I pride myself in standing
apart from the pack.
How's that strategy working out for you?
Judging by the look on your face,
oh and one.
I'm sorry.
I'm distracted.
The girlfriend I was supposed to go
to this event with canceled on me.
Apparently,
she's in the hospital for observation.
Which means new boobs.
I could go. I've got a suit jacket
in the back of my van I could febreze.
Thanks. I just don't think
you'd have a good time.
You know, it's an alumni thing
for my college, so
it's just a bunch
of Chatty Academic types.
What makes you think I wouldn't
fit in with that crowd?
Just 'cause I was born in the back
of an el camino and I
grew up eating fluffernutter and I wore
a bathing suit that used to be jeans?
Gary, I am sorry.
I didn't mean to sound judgmental.
I just don't think you'd have fun.
I'm just tired of the stereotype,
that working-class guys,
blue-collar guys like me
don't enjoy the arts or literature or...
paintings or books.
Look, I really appreciate the offer.
It's just easier for me to go by myself.
OK? I'm gonna grab my coat.
You know, if you and I ever get to hang
out after work, you know, have a drink,
get to know each other,
you're gonna know how wrong you are
about people like me. For example,
you might be surprised to learn
that I know quite a bit about wine.
Oh, my God.
This puppy right here has a,
that's nice. Hint of plum.
Nice kick to it. Good legs.
Oh, my God.
Allison and I took a wine tasting
class a few years back.
I bet you're surprised.
I meant,
oh my God,
you just opened the $800 Bordeaux
I was supposed to bring
to the silent auction tonight.
Oh, my God.
Here. I'll spit it in the hole.

It's like there's no gray area with
Sasha. If you didn't go to some
Fancy prep school
then you're some lowlife on "cops"
who threw a can of pork and beans
through his neighbor's windshield
'cause he thought that
you stole his boa constrictor.
How come white people
always have their shirts off
when they're about to get arrested?
I mean, you get tackled in the lawn,
and then you got grass all over you,
and you gotta go to Jail all Itchy.
If you're gonna break the law,
put clothes on. Have some pride.
That's an excellent point,
Curtis. Listen,
I overheard Sasha saying she has
no plans for Thanksgiving, so I'm going
to invite her to my house show her I'm a
classy guy with a great sense of humor.
No, I'm being serious.
I'm having... that's my plan.
I'm sorry, my man.
Good luck, buddy. I believe in you.
You don't have to apologize again.
Come on.
Didn't you get all my e-mails?
Unless there's another
"Garylicious71" out there
- yes, I did, thank you.
- What are you doing for Thanksgiving?
You want to come to my house? Curtis
is coming over. The kids will be there.
Actually my great-aunt invited me over
with her and all her bridge friends.
It's like eating with the cast
of "Cocoon," but
but she does make a killer Osso Buco,
which is my favorite thing ever.
Osso Buco, are you kidding me?
Hey, what has 2 thumbs
and iss the king of Osso Buco?
This guy.
I make the best Osso Buco in the world.
Are you kidding me? Come on.
Come to my house. It'll be fantastic.
You... OK,
you are going to make Osso Buco?
I already bought
the buco and everything.
Come on. What do you say?
- I don't think so.
- Well, hold on a second.
Maybe...
Maybe this will change your mind.
- Oh, my God.
- That's right.
Gary, you replaced my Bordeaux?
I know how much this costs
and how much I pay you, and,
I think it's the same number.
So what do you say?
Will you come?
Fine.
I'll be there.
- All right.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
You spent $800 on a bottle of wine,
and you can't pay me back the $10
you borrowed from me on the boardwalk to
get your name written on some of rice?
It's not an $800 bottle of wine.
OK? It's a $15 bottle of wine
that I bought at the drugstore,
and I just put the label on top.
That's pretty smart.
You bought a $15 bottle of wine, and you
won't pay me back the $10 you owe me
for putting your name
on a piece of rice?
The guy didn't even do good job
with the grain of rice.
He didn't spell my whole name
he left the R out.
I own a grain of rice that says "gay."
Tommy boy. You ready to spend
the Holidarayri ed with your dad?
That's a cute baby.
I should not have let your mom
give you the sex talk, considering
it's her least favorite subject.
Actually, it's his assignment
for health class over the holiday.
And while I'm away with Howard, you have
to make sure that he doesn't neglect it.
Yeah, it's computerized, and it monitors
everything I do 24 hours a day.
Yeah, I've been there.
But then I got my own house.
Louise, you still got gandhi.
Did you find a home for him yet?
Not yet. And I don't want
to leave him at the shelter.
But it's not so bad,
except for when he pees on the floor.
Yeah, I've been there, honey.
But then I got my own house.
You guys get all your stuff together and
come on over to dad's for Thanksgiving?
- Louise, help me out for a second.
- Yeah, sure.
Grab this... all right.
Look, should I just
cancel my trip tomorrow?
I mean, I could meet
howard's family another time.
I've never spent Thanksgiving
away from the kids before.
Don't feel guilty about it, Allison.
You've raised 2 great kids,
you know, and you've done it all while
keeping your sense of perspective.
Your body's fit and toned,
your skin is clear.
- You've got nice eyes...
- What? What do you want?
- What do you want?
- What do I want?
Do you want me to get you a new Michael
Buble CD so no one see you buying it?
Are you serious?
Did another one drop?
- I got another problem. Have a seat.
- All right.
Look, my boss... Sasha,
she tends to think I'm like
this low-class buffoon.
That's it.
That's the problem.
So I...
I want to impress her for Thanksgiving
by making Osso Buco,
so I need you to help me with that.
I would also like you to tell me,
what is Osso Buco?
I don't know, and Curtis told me
he was the center for the jets.
Osso Buco is a Veal Shank,
Gary, and I can't.
I got a million things to do before
I go to San Francisco with Howard.
And like I used to tell you in bed,
you should never promise
something you can't deliver.
And like I used to tell you in bed,
don't worry. I'll finish this myself.
C-U-M-I-N.
That cannot be pronounced
the way it's spelled.
- There he is.
- Hey, dad!
Hi! I missed you, gosh.
Where the heck have you been?
I've been hiking in the high sierras.
Nothing but the clothes on my back,
and, well, my
baggie of what I like to call
"baja mind-expander."
Terrific.
Let me get you a beer.
You look thirsty, OK?
Look, my boss from work
is coming over. She's a pretty gal.
Do me a favor.
Just be on your best behavior, OK?
Hey, no problem with that.
I even got dessert.
Dessert?
Brownies.
- That's not going to fly this year.
- No, this is not what you think.
- It's peyote.
- Peyote?
Come on.
Put that away.
Finish your beer. I'll tell
the grandkids what's left
of their grandfather is here, OK?
Your grandpa is here.
Oh, my gosh.
This place is a mess.
I asked you guys to help me clean up.
What happened?
Tom left his baby crying while he was
playing video games so I had to walk it.
- Call me, dad?
- Tom had a baby?
How long have I been away?
Hi, grandpa.
It's Tom's baby.
He's supposed to be taking care of it.
Louise, would you please give
the baby back to its rightful owner?
Fine.
I can't take this thing crying. Please,
Tom, pick the baby up, would you?
It's too tough OK?
I can't have any fun.
I have to keep this stupid
thing alive all day.
You didn't want the responsibility
you should have pulled out.
Of the assignment.
Come on, you guys. Clean up the house?
I gotta go finish the Osso Buco.
Well, why aren't we having turkey?
It's Thanksgiving.
Turkey? Tom, my boss is coming over.
It's gotta be extra special.
Dad, I have thought about this, and I
don't want to eat an animal that's been
kept in a tiny cage its whole life just
because you're crushing on your boss.
You don't have to.
Grandpa bought brownies.
You're gonna love this stereo.
You're not going to believe
how loud this thing is.
Be warned...
When you stop at a red light,
you are going to get some dirty looks
and some nasty comments
about this thing.
That's all right.
Wait till they find out I'm old, white
and rocking out to Michael Buble.
I'm running late. Gosh,
Sasha's going to be here in an hour.
I am so far behind.
I got all these things that says class.
Look at this...
Scented candle right there
Jazz CD.
It even says "evening Jazz."
And very fancy, intelligent magazines.
I going to spread the across the house.
She'll think that I read them. And like
real fancy. The cartoons
aren't even funny, you know?
My man, let me show you
the piece de resistance. Here we go.
- Osso Buco 'A la Brooks'.
- I got the recipe off of a website.
This is the first time you've ever
cooked yourself without the aid of
boyardee, butterworth,
or that white talking glove.
Have a taste there. What do you think?
Oh, my God. It's pretty good?
How much salt did you put in this?
I don't know, I ballparked it.
This is about 2 teaspoons, right?
Just...
- Why, is it too much?
- Not if Sasha's part deer.
Oh, my God! I can't serve this.
It's like beefy seawater.
Oh, my gosh.
Sasha's going to be here in 59 minutes.
All right, you know what? Time to bring
in the big guns. Give me your keys.
Gary! What are you doing here?
I need your help with dinner. It's an ER
I thought you found a recipe.
But I can only serve it if I'm going
to use it to rim Margarita glasses.
What?
It went horribly wrong.
I need your help. Help me.
I'm sorry. I can't. My flight
to San Francisco leaves in a few hours.
- I gotta finish getting ready.
- I'm begging you, Allison!
Otherwise my dinner
with Sasha is ruined!
- Gary, I can't do it!
- OK, that's fine.
I thought we were going to do this the
easy way. We'll just do it the hard way.
You just go over there for a second.
I'll, Hi Jack your luggage.
OK. Really?
Really, Gary?
You know, I'm going for 2 nights.
I could just wear this if I had to.
I didn't want to say this, Allison,
but Tom and Louise,
they really, really
wanted to see you before you leave,
and it was tom who came to me today
with tears in his eyes saying, "dad,
"how do any of us know how many
Thanksgivings any of us even have left?"
And I thought, the wisdom of kids.
You're not going to guilt me into this.
We'll see.
Crap.
The house is clean. Curtis is almost
done with the van. How the lamb coming?
It's fine. You know, we're really lucky
we found a rack of lamb at this hour.
Smells good. How's it look? Oh, my gosh!
That looks amazing!
Gary, you really owe me on this one.
I was thinking of a thank-you card,
but all right, let's make it quick.
God, please! Don't make me nauseous.
I gotta fly in an hour.
Then what the heck did
you take this off for?
What? I'm getting started on the pies.
I don't want to get flour on my dress.
Great. You're making pies.
Good. Keep helping.
I really need tonight to be special.
Thank you.
I cannot believe you
have a crush on Sasha.
It's going to be like beauty and
he beast, except when she kisses you,
this won't change back.
- Would you just make pies?
- Look, 10 minutes.
Finished or not, I am out
the door getting ready for my trip.
10 minutes, that's all I need.
That's great.
OK, let'cbs ssee her fly without this.
Dad, come on.
The water heater is ancient.
You cannot take showers that hot.
I haven't showered yet.
Oh, God!
Oh, my goodness!
You're gonna get us all arrested!
Put some clothes on.
My boss is coming over.
And puka shells do not count as a shirt!
Oh, my gosh!
The dog peed on the couch!
Tom, Louise, I thought gandhi was
a nonviolent dog, look at this!
It's all over my couch!
What is all the shouting about?
Hey, dad, I need you to
push these tables together.
I need you to put ice in the glasses,
and I need you to take the salt
and pepper out of the ceramic footballs
and put them in the good salt
and pepper shakers, OK?
Forget it.
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you! OK.
No, you have to take care of the baby.
It's your assignment.
- You're better at it.
- What, because i'm a woman?
When did you get so patriarchal, Tom?
Since forever.
What's wrong with loving your country?
- What is that?
- It's ratt!
And it's way too loud!
OK, there's a short in the electrical
system. I can't turn the music off.
You have to. Mr. Biscazzi next door
has a real itchy 9-1-1 finger, OK?
You gotta figure out
a way to turn it off.
I would love to, but I kind
of locked the keys in the van.
All right, we'll have to
Jimmy the door open somehow.
Louise, take the dog upstairs.
Tom, help your mom.
Hey, do me a favor, Curtis.
Help me take this couch outside.
But be careful, it's covered in pee.
How are we going to get this huge
thing through that tiny opening?
Hang on a second. Let me call Charlene.
- She works at Ikea!
- Go on. OK, go ahead.
How do you not know how
to install a stereo?
You're a professional sound engineer!
It's your van, man.
Your whole electrical system
is Jerry-rigged. You got the wipers
connected to the headlights
connected to the air conditioning.
If you want to honk the horn,
you gotta move the passenger seat back.
Let's just figure it out. Please.
Sasha's going to be here any minute.
Great.
I told you. I'm not going to
tolerate with any more of this noise.
Sorry, Mr. Biscazzi.
We're trying to turn it off.
Well, it's too late.
This has escalated.
- The cops are on their way.
- What?
No cops! We don't want cops.
OK, I think I got it.
Jeez, Louise! Fire!
- I'm getting a fire extinguisher.
- I got a broken leg here!
What would you do
if this was a real baby?
I'd be happy, 'cause that
would mean I was getting some.
Push the tables together
put ice in the glasses!
Hey! Come on.
Make pies, would you?!
- Where's my dress, Gary?
- Just keep making pies!
Hey, ice cubes, saltshakers...
And police.
Perfect.
Hey, officer, we're trying
to get the music turned off.
<i>Put down the fire extinguisher.</i>
I would, but it's still
smoldering right next to you.
<i>Drop where you are
and put your hands up.</i>
<i>And turn around.</i>
Sasha, hi. Welcome.
- You have to take responsibility!
- I never wanted it in the first place!
- Gary, where the hell is my dress?
- Shut up, Allison.
Shut up? I slave over this dinner for
you, and that's the way you talk to me?
Someone stole my weed.
Gary, is this a bad time?
- Sasha, here's the thing...
<i>- Hands up.</i>
Do you have to speak through the PA?
We're 5 feet from each other.
Sorry that took so long.
They had to run my ID,
and then there was a tiny, tiny,
tiny, tiny complete body search.
The lamb's burned.
This is a mess.
Look, Gary,
I should probably tell you
that was the most awesome
thing I have ever witnessed!
You don't think I'm one of those guys on
"cops" that gets his pants pulled down
by the police dog?
Of course I don't think
you're one of those guys.
Though they did wait a long time
before calling that dog off.
But come on, Gary.
You have to see how funny this is.
Do you know how many times
I've wondered who those
police helicopters
were shining their lights on?
OK, that was us!
We were those people!
- Do you want to stay for dinner?
- Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
We got original, extra crispy,
mashed potatoes,
corn on the cob.
And they threw in a chocolate cake
because we were their only
customers on Thanksgiving.
What do you say?
Will you stay for dinner?
I would love to.
And not just because of the fried
chicken. But, that's a big draw.
Welcome to Thanksgiving in meth country.
You would hate Thanksgiving at my house.
It's so uptight.
Your family
yells and laughs and tells stories.
And I can't believe i'm going to say
this, but, I'm still Kinda hungry.
That actually might
be the munchies. Dad!
If you're going to smoke,
go behind the house!
I am behind the house!
So you really had a good time?
Gary, I don't know how much
you know about women, but
a guy who makes an effort,
very important.
Hey, I brought you something.
It's the wine you bought me.
Special wine for a special occasion.
I'm not sure how special it really is.
Are you kidding? This is a primo bottle
of wine. Do you have a corkscrew?
We're not gonna need it.
It's a screw top. Look.
I just glued another
label on top of the cheap one.
Smooth.
I haven't said what
i'm thankful for yet.
I'm thankful that I work with someone
generous enough to
invite me into his home when
he knew that I had nothing to do...
and
who went to a lot of trouble
to make sure I had a good time.
Pretty classy.
I'm your boss.
That's what makes it so hot.
Hey, kids.
Man.
Gary, thank you for letting me stay.
I don't think I'm ready to
leave the kids on a holiday.
But now I've got no way of getting
home, although your dad
did offer to take me
on his magic carpet.
There's a bus stop like 2 streets away.
You know, Allison, I can take you.
Really?
Thank you.
It's getting late, so I'll,
- I'll see you monday.
- All right.
Hey, Allison, wait a second.
You really saved me tonight.
I mean, you really saved me.
And I want you to have this
special bottle of wine.
Oh, my God.
Gary, thank you. This is
an incredible bottle. Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
It's very expensive, also.
And, it's Thanksgiving,
and it's the least I could do.
Thank you.
You know what? I forgot.
I got you that Michael Buble CD...
Sasha's looking.
Don't do it right now.
Sasha's... wait till she turns.
Wait till...
OK, she's looking down, give it to me.
Yes! This is the one with bonus tracks!

Super. Je te surprends
en plein bricolage.
J'avais peur de t'interrompre
en train de manger ou faire la sieste.
Je fabrique un casque pour mes oreilles.
La voirie éventre la rue.
Il existe une chose
plus énervante que ta voix.
Très amusant.
Mais, tu sais, c'est moi qui...
C'est pour ça que je faisais semblant
9 fois sur 10.
Je savais pas
qu'il y aurait des travaux.
Comment vais-je faire mes devoirs
avec tout ce bruit ?
C'est pour ça
que j'ai pas ramené les miens.
Ils sont tout à toi.
Et ton fils, Tom, est consigné.
C'est à cause des feux d'artifice ?
- Non...
- Quoi ?
Quoi ? Quoi ?
Il a dit un gros mot.
- Qu'est-ce que je t'ai dit ?
- Je sais.
Vérifie s'il y a des parents,
des profs, des prêtres ou des flics.
Apprends-le bien.
Que ce soit naturel.
Quel mot a-t-il dit ?
C'était le mot
que j'ai dit à notre 1er rencart quand
t'as demandé ce qu'on devrait faire.
C'était le mot que mon père a dit dans
sa barbe quand t'as dit "Je le veux."
- Je ne le laisserai pas sortir.
- Merci.
Et tu seras fier de savoir
que Louise
a été invitée à la fête
de Jenny Stevens rollerama.
Louise ! Enfin !
Tu fais partie des filles populaires.
C'est super.
Tu ne m'as pas laissé finir.
Louise a décliné l'invitation.
Elle n'a pas besoin de suivre
les gens populaires.
J'ai élevé une jeune fille indépendante
qui pense et agit par elle-même.
Tu veux dire que "nous" avons élevé.
"Notre" fille est indépendante,
non ?
T'as raison. C'est toi qui as oublié
d'aller chercher Louise
à la bibliothèque
quand elle avait 8 ans,
ce qui lui a permis de tout savoir
sur la circulation.
Au revoir.
Je vais à cette fête.
- Tu viens de dire que t'y allais pas.
- Maman vient de dire ça.
Elle te fait ça aussi ?
Je veux y aller.
Mais pas lui dire.
Elle est si fière que je ne cède pas
à la pression des autres.
Mais juste cette fois,
je veux y succomber.
On peut ne pas lui dire ?
Je sais pas ce que "succomber"
veut dire, tu dois avoir raison.
Mais pour le cacher à ta mère,
on a passé un accord lors du divorce
qu'on se dirait tout.
Je suis désolé.
Allez, c'est enfin ma chance
de rentrer dans le moule.
Maman ne comprend pas.
Une fille ne peut pas avoir
un secret avec son papa ?
Tu sais que je peux pas dire non à
ce regard. C'est celui qui m'a fait
t'acheter ce hamster.
Qui, à ce jour,
je le jure, est entré dans l'aspirateur
tout seul.
- Oui ! Merci papa.
- De rien, ma chérie.
Et il me faut un jean serré,
un débardeur et de belles chaussures.
OK. C'est bon.
C'est bon.
Il y a des mots auxquels
je ne résiste pas...
"papa" et...
"petit-déjeuner tout le jour".
Des potes pensaient aller
au cinéma ce soir.
Y a une chance
que je puisse y aller ?
Papa ?
T'es sérieux ?
Petit-déjeuner tout le jour.

Louise a dit qu'elle voulait
un jean serré, mais sur ce site,
ils ont tous l'air serrés.
Ça existe les jeans larges ?
Google-le.
Pas maintenant.
Ça peut pas être légal.
Rends-moi service,
marque-moi la page.
Je suis dépassé, là.
Je suis en territoire maternel...
Des jeans de petites filles, des fêtes.
Tu sais qui pourrait aider.
Demande à Sasha ?
- Elle est pas mère.
- Mais elle est faite comme une maman.
Elle est juste...
un peu plus ferme qu'Allison.
- Tu parles de mon ex-femme.
- Désolé.
Et j'aime ça !
Pourquoi pas demander
à Sasha de t'aider ?
Je sais pas. Après Thanksgiving,
elle a vu tout mon passif,
la folie de ma famille. Et puis
ce baiser. Tout est devenu bizarre.
Oh mec, les blancs.
Vous compliquez
tellement les choses.
Il te faut une femme
pour choisir des vêtements.
Il y a une femme à 3 mètres.
Demande-lui de l'aide.
Et cette fois,
résiste à ton besoin de la lécher
comme si c'était
la dernière goutte de jus de raisin.
Jus de raisin.
Les noirs.
Pas cool.
- Mais j'aime ça.
- Oh, mec !
Oui ?
On dirait que je me suis
un peu mis dans le pétrin.
J'ai un problème
et si tu as du temps libre...
Je sais où tu veux en venir
et je garde pas de chiens,
ne fais pas de déménagements,
et n'aide pas à mettre des choses
là où ils n'y arrivent pas.
Ma fille a été invitée
à la fête d'une gamine populaire.
Elle a rien à se mettre.
Faut que tu m'aides à faire du shopping.
- Tu peux faire ça pour moi ?
- Tu plaisantes ?
Tu me demandes si je veux aller
faire du shopping ?
La réponse est oui.
Il y a un magasin vraiment bien qui
s'appelle "Diva Station" sur la 3e rue.
On s'y retrouve à 3 h ?
- Je pensais qu'après Thanksgiving...
- Ne t'inquiète pas pour ça.
C'est une fête tellement folle.
Il y a des marshmallows
sur des patates.
Tu enfonces ta main dans une dinde.
Vraiment, ça va.
C'est que du shopping.
- On se retrouve à 3 h.
- Parfait.
T'as aussi chaud que moi là ?
- Excuse-moi ?
- À tout hasard. On se voit à 3 h.
- Et celle-là ?
- Tu l'as pas déjà mise celle-là ?
Non, papa.
Je portais celle-là.
Je les différencie pas.
Elles se ressemblent trop.
C'est comme le jeu des différences
dans les journaux.
Peut-être qu'avec une moustache,
je serais meilleur pour ça.
Je vais aller essayer quelque chose.
Ce que tu veux.
Je vais avoir des ennuis ?
Oui. Premier avertissement,
après on amène Avril Lavigne.
J'aurais été prévenu.
Je vous ai regardés, vous
et votre fille, et vous êtes adorables.
Vous parlez de la façon dont
elle me parle, comme si j'étais idiot ?
Vous devez vous évanouir.
Il y a une Mme "mec mignon
qui fait du shopping avec sa fille " ?
Non, mais il y a ma patronne
qui pourrait arriver à cette porte
d'une seconde à l'autre
et j'aimerais sortir avec elle.
C'est dommage,
parce qu'on fait des soldes sur
"les vendeuses célibataires
qui veulent faire des choses avec toi
derrière la machine à bretzel."
Je peux avoir un bon ?
J'ai pas trouvé les jeans
chez Diesel ou Justice,
mais ils sont peut-être
au Beverly Center.
- Vous avez trouvé quelque chose ?
- Non, elle a tout essayé 2 fois.
J'ai lu tous les magazines.
Apparemment,
les gosses de High School Musical
s'amusent beaucoup à Hawaï.
Et, d'après le quiz, je suis un flirt
en dessous de la moyenne.
- Essaie ça. Ma nièce les adore.
- Voilà le truc,
ma fille les a essayés
il y a 5 minutes.
Tu les as trouvés où ? Trop chou !
Comment tu fais ?
C'est la chose la plus ennuyeuse
que j'ai faite.
Voilà une question pour toi.
Ton record de temps
chez M. Bricolage ?
Mon record est
de 4 heures et 22 minutes.
Il y avait des soldes sur les scies.
- Je m'ennuie.
- Quoi ?
Tu peux pas t'ennuyer,
je parle d'outils ! C'est génial !
C'est comme ce que tu ressens
quand tu choisis la tenue parfaite.
Et tu sais que quand
tu passeras la porte,
la personne pour qui tu l'as achetée
tournera la tête et fera "wow".
- Alors, vous en pensez quoi ?
- Chérie, je sais pas.
Je suis un mauvais juge,
parce que tout a l'air mieux sur toi.
Sacha ?
J'adore. Ajoute un bandeau
et tu es parfaite.
Je peux ?
- Oui, tout ce que tu veux.
- Merci ! Je vais l'enlever.
Merci de m'aider,
tu me sauves la vie.
Pas de problème, c'est sympa.
Prête ?
Non, il me faut des chaussures.
Des chaussures ?
Il nous faut des chaussures,
tu peux aider ?
Je sais exactement où il faut aller.
Payez pour les habits et on y va.
Tu me sauves la vie et je te rendrai
la pareille. S'il te faut un outil,
je suis ton homme.
Y a rien de plus sexy qu'un père
qui prend soin de sa fille.
À fond.
J'ai eu chaud toute la journée.
Je pensais que c'était le chinois.
Si t'étais pas entrée, je l'aurais pris
sur un tas de bretzels chauds.
Quoi ?
Et je bousille ta batterie !
C'est pas juste,
tu t'es entrainé pendant l'école.
Il faut faire des choix dans la vie.
On vient me chercher
dans quelques minutes.
- De quoi j'ai l'air ?
- Tu es adorable !
Papa, c'est important,
il me faut un avis honnête.
De quoi j'ai l'air ?
Comme toutes les filles à l'école.
Vraiment ? Merci !
J'entends la voiture anti-fun
de ta mère se garer.
Sors d'ici, t'es trop bien habillée.
Monte et je retiens ta mère.
Ça peut impliquer un baiser
avec la langue, tu fermeras les yeux.
Quand vont-ils finir ?
Je veux aller dire au gars qui tient
le signe "ralentir" qu'on sait !
Attends, pourquoi Tom
joue à la console ?
Tu sais que puni
veut dire pas de console.
Je savais, mais pas Papa,
j'ai pas eu le cœur de lui dire.
Bon, d'accord.
J'ai le livre de géométrie
de Louise pour ce soir.
Bien, je lui dirai
que tu l'as amené.
Où est-elle ?
Je veux lui dire au revoir.
Elle dort. Elle a cherché
le "x" pendant 3 heures
et son immense tête
remplie de cerveau s'est effondrée.
Elle s'est évanouie, elle ronfle.
- Tu agis très bizarrement...
- Maintenant, Tom !
Mon Dieu, Gary !
C'était dégoûtant !
C'était comme avoir
un poulpe chaud dans ma bouche.
C'est bon ?
C'est bon, allons-y.
C'était un bon spectacle.
On a établi que la course de chevaux
c'est pareil que la F1, mais en plus
lent et avec des crottes.
Je suis Gary Brooks
et c'est "Le Score".
Pas cool, on a fait 5 minutes
de plus et tu sais que j'aime partir
- à 6 h le vendredi.
- Comment je le saurais ?
Tu m'as déjà vu ici
le vendredi vers 6 h 15 ?
Parce que le vendredi, je pars à 6h,
à part aujourd'hui
parce que je te parle
de ce que je devrais faire
c'est-à-dire partir.
Pourquoi on finirait pas
cette discussion autour d'un verre ?
GGCV. Goute la Guinesse,
C'est Vendredi.
Je viens d'inventer ça, allez, mec.
Désolé, c'est le moment de Curtis.
J'invente un jingle
et tu me repousses ?
- Tu disparais où tous les vendredis ?
- Je peux pas dire.
La première règle du moment de Curtis :
Ne pas parler du moment de Curtis.
- Bonne émission, Gar...
- Merci, Sash...
De quoi avait l'air
Louise avant sa fête ?
Comme un million de dollars...
En fait, comme 264,15 dollars.
Je dois dire que
j'ai passé un très bon moment
avec vous deux aujourd'hui.
Donc, dis-moi si tu veux refaire
quelque chose, une fois.
D'après... Mon agenda est assez...
Mon premier moment
de libre c'est... maintenant.
Tu veux sortir ?
D'accord, avec plaisir.
- Super, un rendez-vous.
- Si on disait un verre ?
On peut dire Fernando,
je m'en fiche, allons-y.
C'est mon téléphone. Prépare-toi pour
notre Fernando pendant que je réponds.
C'est ma fille Louise.
Chérie ! Tu t'amuses bien ?
Papa, ces filles sont trop méchantes,
elles se moquent de moi.
Je veux rentrer.
Tu viens me chercher ?
Tu pourrais peut-être
rester un peu, non ?
- Je vais appeler maman.
- Non, pas maman.
Reste tranquille,
je viens te chercher.
Sois cool, le dis pas à maman.
J'arrive, je t'aime.
T'es prêt ?
T'as entendu parler
de ce Martini-bar très cool ?
Rick's, sur Ventura Boulevard ?
Ouais, ils en parlent
dans le LA Magazine.
- Le meilleur bar de la ville.
- C'est clair.
Ça te dirait d'aller
au rollerama à côté ?
Je dois aller chercher ma fille,
tu viens avec moi ?
- Ouais.
- Bien, ça sera marrant.
On aura des bleus partout, mais
pas pour les raisons que j'espérais.
Ce sera pas long,
on récupère Louise,
on la dépose et
on va boire un verre, d'accord ?
Papa ! Tu fais quoi là ?
- Tu me fous la honte.
- Tu m'as appelé
pour venir te chercher,
parce qu'elles se moquaient de toi.
Mais tout va bien maintenant.
Maintenant, tu veux rester ?
Oui et je veux pas être
la seule à avoir son père ici.
On va aux jeux, ne nous suivez pas.
C'était quoi ça ?
Une fille de 12 ans.
Je sais ce que c'est,
mais c'était quoi ça ?
Elles changent d'avis.
Une seconde, elles aiment les fleurs
et les licornes. La suivante,
elles ont les tétons percés et gagnent
un concours de t-shirt mouillé à Cancún.
3 années d'affilée.
Je dis ça comme ça.
Normalement, ça serait très sexy.
Mais je suis son père, c'est la chose
la plus horrible que je puisse imaginer.
Sauf ça !
Mon Dieu.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
- Exact.
C'est comme ça que je passe
le moment Curtis.
Je m'éclate en dansant.
Pourquoi tu m'as pas dit
que les vendredis
tu t'éclates en dansant
au rollerama.
Je t'aurais prêté mon k-way en satin
et mon short assorti avec des dauphins.
Excusez-moi, je dois
m'entraîner pour le patin en couple.
Alors...
Alors, on y va ?
Je peux pas partir.
Si elle change d'avis ?
Une seconde, elle me demande
de l'aide.
La suivante, elle veut rester.
La fête finit dans une demi-heure.
On va attendre,
je la ramènerai. Désolé.
Tu dois t'ennuyer.
Non, tu plaisantes ?
Le fait que tu tiennes autant à elle
te fait gagner
50 bons points.
50 bons points ?
Si tu veux de la compagnie,
je serais ravie de rester.
Tu fais quelle taille ?
J'ai jamais eu à me plaindre.
Je parlais de tes pieds.
Si on reste, autant faire du roller.
Je fais du 45.
Prenons des rollers.
Je te préviens. Y a quelques années,
j'étais l'homme à roulettes.
Je m'éclatais aussi en dansant.
Gary, mets ta jambe ici.
- J'essaie, mais je fais le grand écart.
- Je te tiens, je tire.
Appuie sur ma poitrine !
- Voilà.
- On est bons.
J'ai trouvé ton tee-shirt
"Je suis avec un idiot".
Ironiquement, il était pas avec toi.
Mon... orteil !
Eh bien, eh bien.
Qu'est-il arrivé à, et je cite,
"Ce langage ne convient
qu'aux marins,
aux criminels et à cette traînée
dans Sex in the city" ?
Écoute.
Il y a de rares occasions,
dans des circonstances très spécifiques
qui impliquent une douleur
sévère et soudaine
où on peut utiliser ce mot.
Et tu étais là
la seule fois où je l'ai dit.
Et la fois où tu t'es mordu la langue
au Mac Do ?
OK, deux fois.
Et la fois où le policier
t'a arrêtée ?
Tu te souviens de toutes les fois
où j'ai juré mais tu te souviens pas
d'effacer ton historique
avant que ta mère n'aille sur Internet ?
Et au passage, si elles ont
une cicatrice d'une césarienne...
je comprends pas pourquoi
elles s'appellent "femmes parfaites".
Mais ça va.
T'es pas puni pour ça
mais tu devrais. C'est dégoûtant.
Bref, où est Louise ?
Je dois lui donner son sac à dos.
Papa est parti la chercher
au rollerama.
Elle a appelé, elle pleurait.
Les filles se moquaient d'elle.
Y avait autre chose
que je devais te dire.
C'était très urgent.
Ne pas te le dire.
Merci. Je vais retourner à ma voiture
avant de redire ce mot.
Je suis encore puni ?
Oui.
- Tu viens de prendre un jour de plus.
- Quoi ?
Allez. Tu peux le faire.
Tu fais vraiment...
des progrès.
Encore un peu... voilà.
C'est 10 centimètres de mieux
que la dernière fois.
T'es bonne joueuse. C'est sympa d'avoir
attendu. Quand je t'ai proposé un verre
t'ignorais que ce serait dans un snack
et que ta langue deviendrait bleue.
Je raconterai que j'ai passé une nuit
de folie avec le Grand Schtroumpf.
- J'ai passé une très bonne journée.
- Je m'amuse bien, aussi.
La fête est finie. Sors-moi d'ici.
Je dois partir. Je m'amuse plus.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Non, Allison. Quoi ?
Ils se préparent
pour le "hokey-pokey,"
- et il y aura le patin en couple.
- C'est pas drôle.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Mon Dieu.
Ça, c'est très drôle.
Écoute, Gary, sérieusement,
où est Louise ?
Tom a dit qu'elle pleurait.
Et pourquoi elle est là ?
Elle savait que tu serais contre
et que tu dramatiserais.
Quand on a divorcé,
on s'est promis de ne rien se cacher
concernant les enfants.
Désolée. Sasha, tu pourrais...
nous laisser seuls ?
C'est personnel.
- D'accord.
- Non.
Je vais rejoindre Curtis
pour la chenille.
Oui, d'accord.
- Non, elle peut pas partir.
- Pour l'amour de Dieu !
- Voilà.
- Voilà.
Je tiens debout.
Laisse-moi tranquille.
La pression de groupe est importante
à son âge.
Et un jour ou l'autre,
je devrai lui en parler.
D'accord, mais pas ce soir.
Elle s'amuse, elle a 12 ans.
Un jour, elle sera
une fille populaire.
Le suivant, elle sera une rebelle.
Mais elle n'ira jamais à Cancún, d'acc ?
D'accord.
Je me fais du souci, c'est tout.
- Je veux pas qu'elle souffre.
- Je m'inquiète aussi.
Mais tu peux pas y aller
et gâcher sa soirée. Pas ce soir.
Juste cette fois, laisse-nous, Louise
et moi avoir ce secret, d'accord ?
D'accord. Mais cette discussion
est pas finie.
Bien, parce que j'avais pas fini
de faire semblant de t'écouter.
- Amuse-toi bien.
- D'accord.
Attends. Me pousse pas.
Mon Dieu.
On va où ?
Désolé de la tournure de la soirée.
J'avais vraiment hâte de sortir
avec toi hors du travail.
J'ai pas mal réfléchi
quand j'étais assise dans le coin.
Où Allison m'a dit de m'asseoir.
Et...
j'ai compris que...
ta vie, c'est pas seulement
acheter des jolies tenues
pour ta fille.
Te méprends pas.
Aujourd'hui, c'était super.
J'ai adoré passer
du temps avec Louise et toi.
Et puis Allison et toi
vous êtes disputés...
Il se passe beaucoup de choses.
J'imagine que notre verre...
notre rencard... notre Fernando...
Fernando est raté.
La nuit commence.
Et y a le patin en couple.
Je le fais si tu le fais.
T'es sérieuse ?
- On peut essayer ma nouvelle idée.
- Tu feras attention ?
Très bien.
Je dois être franc.
Ça fait toujours bizarre.
Faudra t'habituer
mais ça sera plus facile.
On dirait que le sol bouge, Sasha.
Très bien.
Doucement. Bien.
Ouais, ça va.
Team Subs-Addicts"
Great. I caught you in the middle
of arts and crafts.
I was afraid i'd interrupt
you during snack or nap time.
I'm making headphones for my ears.
The DWP is tearing up the street.
You know there's actually something more
annoying than the sound of your voice.
That's very funny, Gary.
But, you know, i'm the one who...
Which is why
I faked it 9 out of 10 times.
I didn't know there was going
to be construction going on.
How am I supposed to get
my homework done with all this noise?
I agree.
That's why I didn't bring mine home.
Well, they're all yours, Gary.
And your son Tom is grounded.
Oh, my gosh.
Is this about the fireworks?
- Hey, no...
- What?
What? What?
He said a bad word.
- What did I tell you about swearing?
- I know.
Check for parents,
teachers, preachers, and cops.
Learn it.
Know it.
You gotta live it, man.
Hey, what word did he say?
Was it the
same word I said on our first date when
you asked, "what should we do next?"
It was the same word that my dad said
under his breath when you said, "i do."
- I'll make sure he stays in, OK?
- Thank you.
And you'll be proud to know that Louise
was invited to Jenny Stevens'
roller-skating party this weekend.
Louise! Finally!
Yeah! You're one of the popular girls.
That's great.
Gary, you didn't let me finish.
Louise declined the invitation.
She doesn't have to conform
to the popular crowd.
I have raised an independent young
lady who thinks and acts for herself.
Yeah. I think you mean "we" have raised.
"Our" daughter is independent. Right?
You're right, Gary. I mean,
it was you who forgot to pick up Louise
at the library when she was 8 years old,
which taught her all
the ins and outs of city transit.
Bye, mom!
I'm going to that party, dad.
- You just said you were not gonna go.
- No. Mom just said I wasn't.
She does that to you, too?!
I want to go, but I can't tell mom.
She's so proud I'm not the kind of
kid who succumbs to peer pressure.
But just this once,
I want to succumb.
Can we just not tell her?
I don't know what "succumb" means,
so you're probably OK on that.
But as far not telling your mother we
made an agreement when we got divorced
that we would tell each other everything
all the time. I'm sorry, Louise.
Please, daddy. This is finally
a chance for me to fit in.
Mom just doesn't understand.
Can't a daughter just have
one secret with her dad?
You know I can't say no to that look.
It's that same look that made me buy
that hamster for you. Which, to this day
I swear to god, he walked directly
into the vacuum cleaner by himself.
- Yes! Thank you, daddy.
- You're welcome, sweet girl.
And I need to get some skinny jeans,
a tank top, and some cute shoes.
Yeah. You got it.
You got it.
There are some words, Tom,
I have no defense for...
"daddy" and...
"breakfast served all day."
Hey, some of the guys were thinking
about hitting a movie tonight.
Any chance I could go?
Daddy?
Are you serious?
Breakfast served all day.

Louise said she wanted skinny jeans,
but on this website,
every pair of jeans looks skinny.
Is there any such thing as fat jeans?
I don't know. Google it.
Come on, now.
That can't even be legal.
Do me a favor. Bookmark that, though.
Just... Just asking.
I'm in over my head here.
I'm in, like, mommy territory...
Little girl jeans, popular girl parties.
You know who might be able to help.
Why don't you ask Sasha?
Sasha's not a mom.
Yeah, but she's got all the mommy parts.
They're just a little...
Firmer than Allison's.
- My ex-wife you're talking about, man.
- I'm sorry.
And I like it!
Why don't you just
ask Sasha to help you out?
I don't know. After Thanksgiving,
she saw all the baggage,
how crazy my family is. Plus we had that
almost-kiss. Everything got weird.
Man, white people.
Y'all make everything so complicated.
Look.
You need a woman to help
you pick some clothes out.
There's a woman 10 feet away.
Just ask her for help.
And this time, please
resist the urge to suck her down
like she's the last drop of grape soda.
Grape soda.
Black people.
Uncool.
- But I like it.
- Man!
What's up?
I seem to have found myself
in a bit of a pickle.
I have a problem,
and if you have any free time...
Look, I know where this is going,
and I do not help people dog-sit,
move, or pop things in an area
they cannot reach themselves.
My daughter,
she got invited to a cool kid party.
She doesn't have the right clothes
to wear. I need your help shopping.
- Could you do that for me?
- Are you kidding me?
Are you asking me if
I want to go shopping?
The answer is yes.
There's a really great store on
third street called diva-station.
Want to meet there at 3:00?
- I just thought after Thanksgiving...
- Please. Don't even worry about that.
Thanksgiving is such a crazy holiday.
You've got marshmallows on potatoes.
You're jamming your hand
inside a turkey tush.
Really, we're good.
It's just shopping.
- So, I'll meet you at 3:00.
- Perfect.
Are you as hot as I am right now?
- Excuse me?
- Stab in the dark. See you at 3:00.
- How about this one?
- Weren't you just wearing that one?
No, dad.
I was just wearing this one.
I can't tell these outfits apart,
Louise. They look too much alike.
It's like that "spot the difference"
game in the newspaper.
Maybe if one of them had a mustache on,
I'd be better at it. You know?
OK, I'm gonna go try something else on.
Whatever you want.
Am I in trouble?
Yes. That's strike one. Strike two,
we turn up the Avril Lavigne.
Well, I've been warned.
I've been watching you and your
daughter, and you guys are so adorable.
You mean, the way she talks
to me like I'm an idiot?
Yeah. You must be swooning.
So, is there a Mrs. "Cute guy
who's shopping with his daughter"?
No, but there's a boss of mine
that might come through the door
in about a second
that I'm hoping to have a date with.
That's too bad, because we're having
a sale on "single sales girls
who want to make out with you behind
the wetzel's pretzels dumpster."
Maybe I could get, like, a coupon?
I couldn't find the jeans
at Diesel or justice,
but there's a place at the Beverly
center I think we could hit.
- Did you have any luck here?
- No. She's tried on everything twice.
I read every magazine in the store.
Apparently,
the kids from "High School Musical"
are having a great time in Hawaii.
And, according to the quiz,
I'm a below-average flirt.
- Try these. My niece loved them.
- OK, here's the thing.
My daughter just tried these on,
like, 5 minutes ago.
Where did you find those?
So cute!
How do you do this shopping?
It's the most boring thing
I've ever been a part of in my life.
OK, let me ask you something.
What is the longest amount of time
you've ever spent in home depot?
Home depot?
My world record is 4 hours, 22 min.
They were having a sale on skill saws.
One was...
- And I'm bored.
- What?
You can't be bored. I'm talking
about tools! Tools are awesome.
So is that feeling you get when
you've picked out the perfect outfit.
And you know the minute
you walk through the door,
the person you bought it for
is gonna turn their head and go, "wow."
- So, what do you think?
- Sweetie, I don't know.
I'm a terrible judge,
'cause you make everything look better.
What do you think?
I love it. Add a matching headband,
and you're good to go.
Can I get it?
- You can get it. Whatever you want.
- Thank you! I'm going to wear it out.
Thanks for helping me out.
You're a lifesaver, OK?
It's no problem.
It's actually kind of fun.
You ready?
I can't go home.
I still have to get shoes.
Who needs shoes? We're...
All right, we need shoes.
Can you help me with the shoes?
I know just the place. Listen, you guys
pay for the clothes
and then we'll head over there.
You're a lifesaver. And I will return
the favor. If you ever need a tool,
i'm... I'm your guy.
There's nothing sexier than a daddy
taking care of his little girl.
It's hot, right?
I've had this flushed feeling all day.
I thought it was the chinese food.
Hey, if you hadn't walked in, I would
have had him on a pile of warm pretzels.
Wait. What?
I am killing your secondary!
It's not fair. You've been
practicing while I'm at school.
Hey, life's full of choices, Tom.
OK. I'm getting picked
up in a few minutes.
- How do I look?
- You look adorable!
Dad, this is important.
I need an honest opinion.
Tom, how do I look?
Like every other girl at school.
Really? Thank you!
I hear your mom's
anti-fun bus pulling up.
Girl, you gotta get out of here.
You're dressed all fancy.
Look. You go up there,
and I'll stall your mother, somehow.
It might involve a tongue kiss.
I might ask you to close your eyes. OK?
When are those guys gonna finish?
I just want to go up to the guy holding
the "slow" sign and say, "we know!"
Wait. Why is tom playing video games?
You know grounded means no video games.
Yeah, well, I knew, but dad didn't.
I didn't have the heart to tell him.
All right. All right. Look,
I've got Louise's geometry
book for her study date tonight.
Good.
I'll tell her you brought it by.
Where is she?
I want to say good-bye before I leave.
She's sleeping, Allison.
She was solving for "X" for, like,
3 hours, and then her giant,
brain-filled head just keeled over.
She passed out. She's snoring.
- Look, you're acting very strangely...
- Look, I... All right. Now, Tom!
My God! Gary!
That was disgusting!
It was like having a warm
scallop in my mouth.
Is it over?
We're good. Let's go.
All right, this has been a good show.
We've established that horse racing
is the same as Nascar
but slower and with poop.
I'm Gary Brooks, and that's the score.
Dude, that is not cool. We are 5 min
over, and you know I like to leave
- right at 6:00 on fridays.
- Why would I know that?
Have you ever seen me here on a friday,
say around 6:15?
Because on fridays, I leave at 6:00,
except for today, when I'm gonna leave
cause I'm talking to you about
the very thing I should be doing
which is leaving. See my quandary?
Curtis, why don't we finish
this argument over a drink?
TGIF... taste guinness.
It's friday.
I just made that up, man. Come on.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
It's Curtis time.
I just made up a jingle.
You're turning me down?
- You disappear to every friday?
- I can't respond to that.
The first rule of Curtis time is
do not talk about Curtis time.
- Hey, great show today, Gar...
- Hey, thanks, Sash...
So, how did Louise look
when she left for her party?
Like a million bucks...
Actually, like 264 bucks and 15 cents.
I have to say, i,
had a really good time hanging
out with you and your daughter today.
So, you know, let me know if,
you want to do something again sometime.
Yeah. Well, you know, according...
well, my calendar is kind of,
I mean, the first thing I have
open is right now.
You want to go out?
OK. Yeah. Sure.
- All right. It's a date.
- How about we call it a drink?
Hey, we can call it Fernando
for all I care. Let's get out of here.
That's my phone. You go get ready for
our Fernando while I get this, OK?
It's my daughter Louise.
Hi, honey!
You having a good time?
Dad, these girls are so mean.
They're making fun of me.
I want to go home.
Will you come pick me up, daddy?
Maybe you could just, like, stick it out
for little while. You know what I mean?
- I'll just call mom.
- No. Don't call mom.
Do me a favor. Sit tight. I'm gonna
come get you. Daddy will save the day.
Just be cool. Don't tell mom.
I'm coming. I love you.
You ready?
Hey, I don't know if you've heard
about this really cool Martini bar...
Rick's? It's on Ventura boulevard.
I actually just read
about it in "LA magazine."
- It's the hottest bar in the city.
- It sure is.
How would you like to go to
the roller rink right next-door?
I have to pick up my daughter.
Will you come with me?
- Yeah, sure.
- All right. It'll be fun.
We'll have bruises all over our bodies,
but not for the reasons I had hoped.
This won't take long, you know?
I'll grab Louise, we'll pick her up,
we'll drop her off, and then you
and I will go out for our drink. OK?
Dad! What. What are you doing here?
- You're totally embarrassing me.
- You called me
told me to come pick you up. You said
all the girls were making fun of you.
But everything's fine now.
What, so now you want to stay?
Yes, and I don't want to be the only
girl at the party with her dad here.
We're going to the arcade now.
So, don't follow us!
What the heck was that?
That's a 12-year-old girl.
I know literally what it is. What I
meant was, what the heck was that?!
They change their minds, Gary.
One minute, they like flowers
and unicorns. The next minute,
they're piercing their nipples and
winning wet t-shirt contests in Cancun.
3 years in a row.
Just sayin'.
Ordinarily, that would be very hot.
But considering i'm her father, that's
the most disturbing thing I can picture.
Except for that!
Oh, my gosh.
- What the heck are you doing?
- That's right.
This is how I spend Curtis time.
I rock the boogie.
Why didn't you tell me
on friday nights you rock
the boogie by coming
to the roller-skating rink?
I would have lent you my satin
windbreaker and matching dolphin shorts.
If you'll excuse me, I got some moves
I gotta work out before "couples skate."
So...
So, should we go?
No, I can't leave.
What if she changes her mind again?
You know, one second,
she's asking me to help her.
The next second, she wants to stay.
The party's gonna end in a half-hour,
anyway. We'll hang out.
I'll take her home. I'm sorry.
I know this is probably a drag for you.
No. Are you kidding me?
The fact that you care so much about her
just raised you up about
50 notches in my book.
50 notches?
So, listen. If you want some company,
I would be happy to stay.
What size are you?
I never had any complaints.
I am talking about your feet.
If we're gonna stay,
we may as well skate.
Yeah. I'm an 11.
We'll get skates.
But I should warn you, back in the day,
I was quite the wheel man.
I used to rock the boogie, too.
Gary, get your leg up here.
- I'm trying, but I'm doing the splits!
- I got you. I'm pulling.
Pull up on my boobs!
- There you go! There you go!
- We're good.
I found your "i'm with stupid" t-shirt.
Ironically, it wasn't with you.
My... toe!
Well, well.
What happened to, and I quote,
"that language
is only suitable for sailors,
criminals, and that tramp
from'sex in the city'"?
Look.
There are some rare occasions
under very specific circumstances
usually involving severe
and sudden pain
when it's OK to use that word.
And you were just
here that one time I used it.
OK, what about that time
you bit your tongue at burgeroos?
OK, twice.
And that time that cop pulled you over?
Fine, Tom. So, what, you can remember
every time I've sworn, but you can't
remember to clear your browser history
before your mom goes online?
And by the way...
if they have a cesarean scar, I mean,
I don't know where they get off
calling themselves "barely legal."
But it's all right, Tom.
You're not grounded for that,
but you should be. It's disgusting.
Anyway, where's Louise?
I gotta give her her backpack.
I think dad went to go pick
her up at the skating rink.
She called and she was crying.
All those kids were making fun of her.
There was something else, too,
I was supposed to tell you.
It was really urgent.
Not to tell you.
Well, thank you, Tom. I'm gonna go to
my car before I say that word again.
Hey, am I still grounded?
Yeah, yeah.
- You just bought yourself another day.
- What?! Yeah.
OK. Come on.
You can do it.
You are definitely...
Improving.
Just a little... You got it.
That was a good 5 inches
further than last time.
You're a good sport. I'm glad you're
hanging out. I asked you for a drink
you didn't think it was gonna come from
a snack bar and turn your tongue blue.
Hey, I'm just gonna tell people
I had a wild night with papa smurf.
- I had a really fun day.
- I'm having a great time, too.
Fun time over.
Get me out of here.
Gotta go.
I'm not having fun anymore.
- What is going on? What is going on?
- No, Allison. What?
They're gonna set up
for the "hokey-pokey," and there's
- gonna be a "couples' skate."
- You know what? That's not funny.
- Hey, girl! What's going on?
- Oh, my God.
That is very funny.
Look. Gary, seriously,
where is Louise?
And, I mean, Tom said she was crying.
And why is she even at this party?
She knew you would disapprove
and you'd completely overreact about it.
Gary, when we got divorced,
we agreed to tell each other
everything then it came to the kids.
I'm sorry. Sasha, could you...
Can you give us a second?
It's kind of personal.
- OK.
- No. Let's...
I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna
go join Curtis' congo line.
OK. Yeah.
All right.
- No, she can't leave.
- For god's sakes, Gary!
- There you go.
- Here we go.
I'm up! I'm up!
Leave me alone. I'm up.
Peer pressure is a big deal at her age?
And at some point,
I'm gonna have to talk to her about it.
OK, but not tonight, OK? She's having
a good time. She's 12 years old.
You know, one week,
she's gonna be the popular girl.
Another week, she's gonna be the rebel.
she's never going to Cancun, OK?
All right.
Gary, I am just concerned.
- I don't want her getting hurt.
- I'm concerned too. Believe me.
But you can't go out there
and ruin her good time... not tonight.
Please. Just this one time, Allison, let
me and Louise have this one secret. OK?
All right. But you and I are not
done talking about this.
Great, 'cause I wasn't
done pretending to listen.
- Well, have fun.
- All right.
Wait. Don't push me.
Don't... I'll give you a little, god.
Where are we going?
Sorry this night turned
out the way it did.
I was really looking forward to hangin
out with you outside of work.
Though, I had some time to think
when I was sitting off in the corner...
Where Allison told me to go...
And...
I realized there's just...
your life is a lot more
than just picking up cute
outfits for your daughter.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
Today was great.
You know, spending time with
you and Louise... I loved it.
But, then you and Allison
got into it, and...
There's just a whole lot more going on.
So, I guess our drink... I mean,
our date... our Fernando...
Our Fernando was a bust.
The night's not over.
And it is "couples' skate."
All right, well, I'm game if
you're game. Are you serious?
- Yeah. We can try my new idea.
- You gonna be careful? Steady.
- OK. So...
- All right. It...
I gotta be honest with you.
It still feels pretty weird.
It's gonna take some getting
used to but it'll get easier.
Feels like the ground's moving, Sasha.
All right.
Gentle.
All right.
Yeah, I'm all right.
Team Subs-Addicts"
J'ai une question.
Charlene est en déplacement
et je garde sa nièce Michaela.
Qu'est-ce qui intéresse
une fille de 13 ans ?
Emmène-la chez Pepe's Pizza.
C'est top.
Y a des jeux vidéo et des pizzas.
Ils servent même de la bière.
Je viens avec vous.
Vous y allez à quelle heure ?
Bonjour.
- Je mets la clim, j'ai trop chaud.
- Pas étonnant.
Tu portes un pull
alors qu'il fait 21 °C.
Les pulls me manquent.
Y a pas de saison, ici.
Los Angeles en hiver,
c'est des gens en tongues
qui planchent sur des scénarios
à la terrasse du Starbucks.
D'abord, c'est une mini-série.
Je crois que j'ai le mal du pays.
Pour te remonter le moral,
je t'emmène dans mon resto favori.
Tu parles de ce grill ?
Je sais pas trop.
Y a une truie avec un haut-de-forme.
Ça me fait peur.
Je vais te dire,
une truie en tailleur,
ça, c'est la classe.
Je parlais de Chez Leo.
Ce serait notre premier rencard.
Justement, je voulais t'en parler.
On va dans mon bureau ?
Oui, Mme la principale.
J'ai mérité une grosse punition.
Je parle trop.
Je t'apprécie, Gary.
Je me demande si le contre
ne l'emporte pas sur le pour.
On travaille ensemble.
Et l'idée de sortir avec un divorcé
me fait peur.
Après le divorce de mes parents,
mon père est sorti avec d'autres femmes
il ne s'est jamais investi.
Entre les week-ends avec nous
et les disputes avec ma mère,
il leur consacrait peu d'attention.
Ça arrivera pas avec moi,
je te donnerai toute mon attention.
- Gary, viens voir ça.
- Quoi ?
C'est le parfait exemple
de ce qui n'arrivera pas.
Je suis navrée,
mais ça marchera pas.
Je ne t'ai pas dit
que face aux défis insurmontables,
rien ne m'arrête.
Je changerai pas d'avis.
J'aurai essayé.
- Ça a intérêt à être cool.
- Ça l'est. Regarde.
Quelqu'un écrit un scénario minable
sur ton ordinateur.
Ça va pas ?
J'avance bien avec Sasha.
Mais j'ai un problème.
Elle pense qu'elle ne sera pas
ma priorité.
Désolé.
Tiens, voici un antidote.
Je veux pas entendre
une de tes histoires.
Un antidote, pas une anecdote.
Une solution à ton problème.
Une fille comme Sasha
a tous les hommes qu'elle veut.
Elle a dû goûter
plusieurs fruits défendus.
Viens-en au fait.
Elle doit se sentir unique.
Fais quelque chose
pour qu'elle se sente spéciale.
Ça réglera ton problème.
Emmène-la dans ton resto préféré.
Je peux pas.
Une truie a tout gâché.
La truie du grill
avec un haut-de-forme et un tailleur.
Tu rigoles.
Une truie en tailleur.
Ça, c'est la classe.
Épisode 2x10

Rends-moi le double
de mes clés de voiture.
Maman en a besoin,
elle change son break
pour une coccinelle décapotable jaune
qui sera à moi plus tard.
Mais c'est une voiture de filles !
J'aurai mon permis avant Louise.
Je vote pour un monospace.
Y a dix porte-gobelets
et une clim individuelle à l'arrière.
Ce sera ma voiture.
Celle que j'aurai choisie,
toute seule.
Sans qu'on m'embarrasse
avec des marchandages stupides.
Grâce à moi,
on a économisé des milliers de dollars.
Tu ne négocies pas.
Tu deviens arrogant
et tu agaces le vendeur.
On est les seuls
dans l'histoire de la vente automobile
à être repartis
avec du café et des donuts.
Salut.
Voici Michaela.
Ça va ?
On s'est vraiment éclatés
à Pepe's Pizza.
On a joué aux hamsters dans une roue.
C'était bien, hein ?
Elle est timide.
Tu veux venir avec nous ?
C'est mieux que de le voir jouer 1 heure
dans une piscine à balles.
J'ai joué cinq minutes
et j'en ai mis 55
pour retrouver mon portefeuille.
Vous auriez vu
le nombre de mollards au fond.
J'en fais quoi ?
Elle aime pas s'amuser.
On est allés au musée,
elle a pas aimé.
Croyez-le ou non.
Elle peut venir voir Tom et Louise
demain soir, si ça peut t'aider.
- Sois bénie.
- Je t'en prie.
Demain, j'achète ma nouvelle voiture,
et sans Gary.
Fais-toi bien baiser.
Oui, ça c'est sûr,
tant que t'es pas là.
Viens, je t'offre une bière.
T'as trouvé une idée
pour séduire Sasha ?
Pas encore.
Tu as de la chance,
j'ai eu un éclair de génie.
J'ai vu un chien violet
qui jouait du piano dans un groupe.
Banjo.
Non, du piano.
Je sais.
Banjo, c'est son nom.
Il devrait jouer du banjo.
C'est ridicule.
Tu crois plus
aux animaux troubadours ?
Bref, mon idée, c'est les chiens.
Surtout, les chiots.
Pour les sept ans de ma nièce,
on a organisé une fête de chiots.
Un truc pour les gosses.
C'est surtout les parents
qui adorent ça.
Je me souviens d'un chiot
qui se cachait derrière ses pattes,
comme ça.
Quel chiot idiot.
Je te vois encore.
Je devrais organiser ça pour Sasha ?
Quand elle verra les chiots,
elle te laissera manger sur son ventre.
Comme Charlene et moi,
dimanche dernier.
On a mangé des pancakes,
du pain perdu,
des saucisses,
de la salade de fruits,
du sirop d'amandes
et du coup,
elle avait les miches collantes.
Le sirop avait dégouliné
sur ses flancs
et vers la forêt noire...
Tu sais quoi ?
J'aime bien ton idée.
Merci.
Elle arrive.
Ça te dérange pas
que je regarde la magie s'exercer ?
Non, mais éloigne-toi,
car elle va se jeter sur moi.
Ma mère a appelé.
Ils ont fait piquer notre chien.
T'as raison, je vais m'éloigner.
À plus tard.
Je vais dans mon bureau,
pour être seule.
Non, rentre chez toi.
Tu as eu une journée éprouvante.
Prends-toi un jour de congé.
J'apprécie que t'essaies
de me réconforter.
- Mais il faut que je travaille.
- N'entre pas.
Avant d'entrer,
laisse-moi m'excuser.
Dans quelques années,
on rira de ce moment,
mais ça va pas être tout de suite.
Si tu veux bien m'excuser,
je vais emballer mes effets personnels.
J'avais pensé à des ballons,
mais j'ai changé d'avis.
Toujours se fier
à son instinct premier.
Qui a mis là ces chiots ?
Il est vraiment trop mignon.
Curtis n'y est pour rien.
C'est moi qui les y ai mis.
Je suis triste à cause de Bucky.
Mais quand je vois ces chiots...
Comment peut-on être triste
avec un chiot si mignon ?
Je dois le rendre avant 16 h.
Comment tu savais ?
Tu as eu une intuition pour mon chien ?
En fait, j'ai un 6e sens
concernant les animaux.
Par exemple, quand j'ai vu
<i>Chiens des neiges</i>,
j'ai pressenti que c'était
la fin de carrière de Cuba Gooding Jr.
Tu t'es donné tant de mal
pour me rendre heureuse.
Sortons ensemble.
Je te prends à 19 h.
Mais avant, prends la pelle et un sac.
Y en a partout.
J'ai fait que changer le 11 en 14,
et ce bon de réduction
est encore valable pour le chinois.
Ça existe pas, le 14e mois.
Tu as faim ?
Alors, me fais pas chier.
Tu fais quoi ?
Je vais à une fête. Venez.
C'est dans une maison de riche.
- On peut ?
- Tous les gens cool y seront.
C'était trop beau pour être vrai.
On n'est pas cool.
Pourtant,
j'ai jeté mes pyjamas Bob l'éponge.
Si on y va,
on s'attirera des ennuis.
Vos parents sont divorcés, comme moi.
Vous avez qu'à vous en servir.
Prenez l'air triste et dites :
"C'est vraiment difficile
d'être un enfant du divorce."
C'est trop génial.
Pourquoi on n'y a pas pensé avant ?
Allez, on y va.
J'ai reçu mon argent de poche.
On prend le bus.
D'accord, on y va.
Je prends mon violoncelle au cas où.
Il y aura de la musique.
Et aussi deux nerds.
Super.
On pourra se moquer d'eux.
Désolé que ça ait été aussi long.
Le serveur voulait m'arnaquer
avec la mousse.
Je suis pas né de la dernière pluie.
Tu lui as fait tasser le pop-corn
pour qu'il y en ait plus.
Tu parles.
Si je veux de l'air, je respire.
On aurait pu choisir un film
que t'as pas vu.
Il est bien.
Et je sais combien tu...
<i>d)</i> Ben Affleck !
Désolé.
J'aime le quiz du film.
Ne crie pas les réponses.
Ou, au moins, réponds correctement.
C'est <i>c)</i> Linda Hunt.
C'est qui ?
Elle rêve.
C'est mon ex-femme Allison.
Mais je décrocherai pas,
car ce soir t'est réservé.
Fiche-moi la paix, Allison.
C'est peut-être une urgence.
Quoi ?
T'es où ?
Pas maintenant.
J'ai un rencard.
Dis-lui qu'il devra
regarder le film tout seul.
Tu dois venir signer le crédit
pour la voiture.
Ma carte est bloquée,
ça fait 3 ans que tu as une vidéo louée.
Ramène-toi.
<i>Je la veux.</i>
J'ai vendu ma voiture
et on a conclu sur un prix.
Comment t'as fait pour obtenir
un bon prix si rapidement...
Tu sais quoi ?
Désolé, tu te débrouilleras seule.
- Ça va ?
- Quoi ? Oui, ça va.
Je vais bien.
Elle y est depuis 30 minutes
et ils ont déjà conclu sur un prix.
Donc, elle a dû se faire avoir,
ce que je pige pas sachant...
Oublie ça.
Je veux plus en parler.
Je préfère me focaliser sur nous
et notre rendez-vous.
Vas-y.
On dirait Robin Williams.
T'es d'accord ?
Ce sera rapide.
Et après, on ira dîner.
D'accord, on dînera après.
T'es sûre ?
T'es la meilleure.
Eric Stoltz !
Le quiz est terminé.
Non, ce gars,
il ressemble à Eric Stoltz.
Le voilà.
- Alors ? Je suis pressé.
- On a un petit problème.
Vous en avez un plus gros.
Un ours échappé d'un zoo.
Il tient un pancarte "Taux à 0 %".
C'est quoi, le problème ?
T'as loué <i>Strange Brew</i> avec ma carte
et tu l'as jamais rendu.
Moi ?
Le film parle d'un gars
tombé dans une cuve à bière.
Il est obligé de la boire
pour éviter la noyade.
C'est juste une scène du film.
Je voulais m'acheter une voiture.
Sans toi.
Tu as tout gâché.
Signez et Allison aura sa voiture,
et vous pourrez repartir.
Bien, j'ai un rencard,
faut que je parte.
- C'est pas un peu cher ?
- Signe.
C'est 1 500 dollars trop cher.
Et tu n'as que le pack standard.
On n'achète pas à ce prix.
Vous avez raison.
On ne l'achète pas.
Mais elle, oui.
Je paie une pension alimentaire
à mon ex-femme.
Donc, ça me touchera, moi,
si elle prend une mauvaise décision.
C'est mon affaire, d'accord ?
J'en prends l'entière responsabilité.
Signe.
Une extension de garantie ?
Elle en a déjà une.
C'est inutile.
Retirez-la.
Et si le moteur explosait
après l'expiration de la garantie ?
Vous vendez un produit
dont le moteur va exploser ?
- Alors, retirez-la.
- Mais il pourrait.
- Il n'explosera pas.
- Ça peut arriver.
- Soyez gentil, retirez-la...
- Attends.
Contente-toi de signer.
Je t'en prie.
Allison s'en sortait très bien
sans vous.
Vous devriez signer
et profiter de votre soirée.
Le prêtre m'a dit la même chose
et j'ai fini avec cette caisse pourrie.
Les airbags ont explosé
dès que j'ai quitté le parking.
Et pourquoi ?
T'en finissais plus de les tripoter.
C'est trop cool.
On aurait déjà dû faire ça.
C'est mon 5e panaché.
Je sais même pas ce que ça me fait.
Tout se passe bien,
je vous l'avais dit.
Je kiffe tes béquilles.
Tu veux danser ?
Quoi ? C'est qui ?
C'est les amis du grand frère
du gamin qui fait cette fête.
J'y crois pas.
Parce qu'ils sont vieux ?
Je croyais qu'ils étaient encore
en détention.
T'inquiète, s'ils te cherchent,
je les égorge.
Je te crois sur parole.
J'ai vérifié cinq fois
avec le directeur.
Il descendra pas plus bas.
Je veux parler à l'ours.
Où il est ?
Je t'en prie, signe.
Oublions que tu as épuisé
mon crédit.
Je me fous de trop payer.
Et j'ai pas besoin d'ABS,
car après tout ça,
rien ne m'empêchera
de t'écrabouiller.
Allez, signe !
Ou je vais perdre la boule.
Tu peux le faire pour moi ?
- D'accord.
- Bien.
Ne t'énerve pas.
M. Hosenballs ?
Vous avez oublié de dater.
J'essaie de t'avoir un bon prix.
J'ai délaissé une belle femme pour ça.
Tu peux le comprendre ?
Voilà ce que je pense.
Tu m'aimes encore.
Attends, quoi ?
Pourquoi tu délaisserais
une belle femme
pour passer deux heures
à aider ta bien-aimée ex-femme
à obtenir un bon prix
pour sa voiture ?
- Ça fait deux heures ?
- Oui, il est 22 h 15.
Je dois te dire.
C'est plutôt romantique.
Merci, mon coeur.
Je dois y aller.
Je signe à côté
ou les initiales suffiront ?
Allez, Roger.
- C'est ton tour.
- J'ai des clients.
Chris, viens, on est ici.
C'est pas cool.
Vous avez merdé.
C'est bien d'avoir appelé.
Où est Michaela ?
- Prends tes affaires, on y va.
- J'essaie de m'amuser.
Tu n'es pas mon père.
Dur d'être un enfant du divorce.
Je suis pas ton père,
mais ce soir, je te garde.
Oublie ton truc de parents divorcés,
ça marchera pas.
Elle a envie de rester.
Pourquoi tu te calmerais pas, le vieux ?
Tu devrais déguerpir, neuneu.
Sinon tu vas
te faire botter les fesses
par un acteur de la comédie musicale
<i>Un violon sur le toit</i>.
On y va.
Tout de suite.
Je dois les ramener.
À plus.
Tu m'as dit de pas venir.
Je dois m'excuser,
tout est allé de travers.
C'est de ma faute.
C'est la faute de personne.
Tu es un mec extra.
Je sais exactement
ce que j'attends d'une relation.
Et ça n'inclut pas
de partager mon pop-corn
avec une femme obèse.
On peut pas se quitter
sur cette fausse note.
Alors, laisse-moi t'emmener chez moi
et te montrer quelque chose.
Je suis déjà tombée dans le panneau.
Je t'invite à boire un café.
Plein de bonnes intentions.
Je sais pas.
Quoi de mieux
qu'un café bien chaud en hiver ?
De quoi tu parles ?
Il fait 21 °C.
Ah oui ?
Les saisons te manquent.
Alors, je me suis dit que, ce soir,
les saisons viendront à toi.
J'ai fait tourner la clim
toute la journée.
J'étais pas sûr de ta religion,
donc j'ai mis un peu de tout.
C'est la plus belle chose
qu'on ait faite pour moi.
Oublie pas ton gilet.
Voilà.
Tout à l'heure,
j'ai parlé de ce que j'attendais
d'une relation.
C'est ça.
On a trop assuré, ce soir.
Tu es une rebelle.
Toi aussi.
Tu l'as embrassée devant son copain.
Plus de marshmallows ?
- À quoi vous pensiez, ce soir ?
- C'est pas de notre faute.
- On ne voulait pas...
- On est des enfants du divorce.
Vous avez laissé vos vélos
devant le garage.
J'ai failli abîmer
ma nouvelle voiture.
Vous pourriez faire plus attention.
D'accord.
T'as mis du parfum ?
Un essai.
- Ne veillez pas trop tard.
- Je t'aime.
Bonne nuit.
Tu es perfide.
Toi aussi.
Curtis: Hey, gar.
Now let me ask you
something.
Charlene's out of town
for a few days
And I'm watching
her daughter michaela.
Any ideas how to entertain
a 13-year-old girl?
Oh, why don't you
take her to, like,
pepe's pizza?
That place is cool.
They got video games,
they serve pizza.
Heck, they even serve
beer over there.
You know what?
If you go, I'll go
with you. What time
do you want to go?
Morning, guys.
Hey, could we turn on
the air? I'm boiling.
Of course
you're boiling.
You're wearing
a sweater.
It's 75 degrees out.
I just miss
wearing sweaters.
You know, you guys have
no change of seasons here.
Winter in l.A. Is blond guys
in flip-flops sitting
outside starbucks
Working on
their screenplay idea.
Ok, first of all,
it's a miniseries.
I guess I just miss home.
Hey, I know
what'll cheer you up.
Let's go out to dinner
at my favorite restaurant.
Oh, that barbecue place?
Oh, I don't know.
There's a picture of
a pig wearing a top hat.
It weirds me out.
Let me tell you something.
Anytime you see a pig
wearing formal wear,
That's class.
Besides, we're going
to my other favorite
restaurant--leo's.
Come on. What do you say?
It'll be like our first date.
Oh, gary, I actually
wanted to talk to you
about that.
Can I see you
in my office?
Oh, yes, principal warden.
I've been a very bad boy.
Maybe you can give me an "f".
I talk too much.
Look, I like you,
gary.
It's just I'm
wondering if we have
Too many things
stacked against us.
I mean,
we work together,
And just the thought
of dating a divorced guy
really scares me.
You see, um,
it's just
When my mom and dad
got divorced,
My dad went through
this whole string
of women
And he wasn't
really there
for any of them.
Between weekends
with us and all the
fighting with my mom
They just got
the last scraps
of his attention.
Look, if you and I date,
that's not gonna happen
'cause I'm gonna give you
my full attention.
Curtis: Gary,
you got to see this.
What is it?
That...That's an example
of something
That will never happen
once we start dating.
Look, gary, I'm sorry.
I just don't think
it's gonna work.
Well, I should let you know,
I'm the type of guy,
When I'm faced
with insurmountable odds,
I have a can-do attitude.
I'm sorry, gary.
The answer's no.
Well, there's
nothing else I can do.
What is it, curtis?
It better be good.
It is, man. Check this out.
Somebody has been writing
a horrible screenplay
on your computer, man.
What is wrong
with you, gary?
I'm making all
this headway with sasha,
But, you know,
here's the problem:
She thinks that if we date,
I'm not gonna make her
my top priority.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Hey, look, let me
give you an antidote.
I don't want another one
of your long stories, curtis.
Not an anecdote,
an antidote--
A corrective
countermeasure
That will remedy
your situation.
See, with a girl
that looks
like sasha,
She could basically
have any man
that she wants, ok?
I mean,
she's no fool.
She has sampled
the wares--
plenty, I am sure.
All right, ok.
Just get to the point.
You need to let
sasha know that she's
the only one for you.
Make a unique gesture.
Make her feel special.
That'll take care of
all that priority stuff.
Trust me.
Yeah.
You know, just to start,
why don't you take her
To your favorite
restaurant?
I can't.
The pig ruined it for me.
Allison?
No.
An actual pig.
The barbecue place?
The pig's wearing
a little top hat and a tuxedo?
Oh, come on. You got
to be kidding me, man.
A pig in formal wear?
That's class.

Allison: Gary, I need
the extra key
for my car.
Mom needs the spare key
because she's trading in
her station wagon
For a yellow convertible bug
that I'll be driving
in a few years.
No way. That's a girl car.
I'm gonna be driving
before louise.
I say minivan, ok?
Those things got, like,
10 cup holders.
The people in the back
control their own
air conditioning.
Allison: Ok.
Look, this is
gonna be my car,
all right?
The one that
I pick out alone,
Without someone
embarrassing me
At the dealership
with his stupid
haggling.
But it's not stupid.
My negotiations
have saved this family
thousands of dollars.
Ok, gary,
you don't negotiate.
You get mad,
you get obnoxious,
And then you piss
the sales guy off.
We are the only people
in the history
of car sales
Who had complimentary
coffee and doughnuts
taken away.
Hey, everybody.
This is michaela.
Hi.
Gary: Hi, michaela.
How are you?
Well, we just had
a great time at
pepe's pizza arcade.
Wasn't that great
when we pretended
to be hamsters,
Just running around
through those big
plastic tubes?
No.
She's shy.
Want to go hang out
with me and tom?
It has to be better than
watching a grown man play
in the ball pit for an hour.
You know what?
5 minutes of playing,
55 minutes of looking
for my wallet.
You cannot believe
how many lugies were at
the bottom of that thing.
Oh!
And what the hell
am I supposed to do
with this kid?
She doesn't like fun.
I took her
to ripley's museum
And she didn't have
a good time,
Believe it or not.
Well, she could hang out
with tom and louise
Tomorrow night
at my house, if you
think that'll help.
God bless you, woman.
Sure, sure,
it's not a problem.
I'm going car-shopping
without gary for
the first time.
Oh.
Have fun getting screwed.
Ah!
As long as you're
not part of it,
I'm sure I will.
Hey, come on.
Let's go get a beer.
All right.
Hey, you have
Any luck coming up
with an idea
to charm sasha?
Not yet.
Well, you are
in luck, sir,
Because I had
a brainstorm.
At pepe's
pizza arcade,
I was watching
that purple dog
Who plays the piano
in the band?
Banjo.
No, no,
the purple dog
plays the piano.
No, I know he plays the piano.
That's his name--banjo.
Well, then he should
play the banjo.
That's ridiculous.
Is that where the
country critter band loses
credibility for you, curtis?
Anyway, I'm talking
about the idea
I had--dogs,
Specifically
puppies.
My niece had
her 7th birthday,
And we threw her
a puppy party.
That sounds like it's
for kids, though.
Yeah, but that's
where you're wrong.
See, the parents
liked it more
than anybody.
See, there was
this one puppy--
He would put
his paws over
his eyes
Like he was hiding,
like this.
Silly puppy.
We can still
see you.
So you think I should do
the puppy party for sasha?
You put puppies
in her office
and she walks in,
She will let you
eat breakfast
off her stomach.
[indistinct]
That's what me
and charlene did
on Sunday.
Yeah, we had
pancakes,
French toast,
sausage,
Fruit salad,
Almond...,
and she had
sticky buns.
That's 'cause the
sugar had gone down
around the sides,
And the sugar was
around her buns
and all,
And it got
all entrapped
down there...
Gary:
Hey, you know what?
I think this puppy party
is really going
To put me over the top
with sasha.
Thanks, man.
You're welcome.
Hey, here she comes.
You don't mind if I stand
here and watch the puppies
work their magic, huh?
No, but, look,
don't crowd me, ok?
'cause I don't want her
bumping into you
When she throws her arms
around me to hug me.
My mom called.
They just put
our family dog to sleep.
[crying]
You know, I feel
like I'm crowding you.
I'll see you later.
Oh, I'm just gonna go
in my office and
be alone for a while.
No, no! No, no, no!
Don't go in your office.
Go home.
You've had a very
traumatic day.
Just go home
and take the day off.
No, gary, really.
I really appreciate
You trying
to cheer me up,
I just--I should
start my day.
Ok, don't,
don't.
Ok, before you
open the door
to your office,
Let me just say
I'm sorry.
Maybe many years
from now,
We'll look back
on this day
and we'll laugh,
But I'm sure
that won't happen
for quite some time.
Now, if you'll
excuse me, I'll go
pack up my things.
Oh, my god!
And you know what?
Balloons were my first idea,
And I second-guessed
myself. Always go with
your first instinct.
Who put
these puppies
in my office?
Curtis.
This is the cutest thing
I've ever seen in my life!
Curtis had nothing
to do with it.
I put the puppies
in your office.
It's like I'm sad
about bucky,
But then I saw
all those puppies,
And, I mean,
how can you be sad
when you got
A little guy like this
in your ear?
Well, he's got
to be back by 4:00.
[giggles]
Gary, how did you
know to do this?
Did you have a sense
about my family dog
or something?
Uh, yeah, actually.
I've always had a bit
Of a sixth sense
when it comes to animals.
For instance, when I saw
the movie "snow dogs,
I just sort of knew
that was the end
Of cuba gooding, jr.'s
career.
Gary...
You go through
so much trouble
to make me happy.
We should go out.
Let me pick you up
at 7:00.
Ok.
All right?
[giggles]
now grab a dust pan
and a plastic bag
'cause it's
ankle-deep in here.
Curtis: See?
All I did was change
this 11 to a 14,
And this
once-expired coupon
is now our ticket
To a tasty tray
of mongolian beef.
But there's no 14th month.
Are you hungry?
Yes.
Then don't
piss me off.
What are you doing,
michaela?
I'm going to a party.
You guys should come.
It's at this
rich kid's house.
Really?
All the cool people
will be there.
Oh.
[sighs]
I knew it sounded
too good to be true.
Tom and I aren't cool.
Well, hey,
If I'm not cool,
then how come I threw away
my spongebob pajamas?
Besides, if we went,
we'd get in huge trouble.
You guys are
divorce kids like me,
So if we get in trouble,
just blame it on that.
You just look at them
with sad eyes and say,
"you don't know how hard
it is being a child
of divorce."
My god, that's genius.
How have we not
tried this before?
Ok, I say we go.
Cool. My mom gave me
money for the weekend.
We take the bus.
Ok, let's do it.
I'll bring my cello
in case they don't
have music.
They'll have music there.
They'll have everything,
Including a couple
of nerds.
Great. We'll have someone
to make fun of.
Ok.
All right.
Sorry I took so long
with the sodas.
The guy tried
to hand it to me before
the foam went down.
It's not my first rodeo.
I liked how you also
made him mush down
the popcorn
With the scoop
so you could get
more in.
You're damn straight.
If I want air,
I'll breathe.
[giggles]
You know, we could
have gone to a movie
you hadn't seen yet.
No. You know,
I really liked it,
And I know how much
you wanted to--
"d"--ben affleck!
Sorry. It's all right.
I love the movie quiz.
Yeah, I don't think
you're supposed to shout
out the answers, though.
And if you do, shout
them out correctly.
It's "c"--linda hunt.
No.
[cell phone vibrates]
Who's this?
Mm-mmm.
Don't think so.
That's my ex-wife allison
trying to call me,
But I'm not answering
because tonight is
all about you
And you are my priority.
[cell phone vibrates]
oh, gosh.
Leave me alone,
allison.
Now, gary, it might
be an emergency.
[cell phone vibrates]
What?
Gary, where are you?
I can't talk right now.
I'm on a date.
Tell your date
he's gonna have to watch
the movie by himself.
You have to get down
to the car dealership
to co-sign for my car.
Why?
Because my credit
is screwed up
Because you rented a movie
3 years ago on my card
And you never returned it.
Now get down here.
This has to happen tonight.
I already turned in my car
and agreed on a price.
Why would you agree
on a price if you just
got to the dealership?
It doesn't even--
You know what, allison?
Sorry.
I'm not getting involved.
Heh!
Are you ok?
Yeah. What?
Oh, I'm good.
I'm--I'm fine.
Ok.
Yeah. Just...
She's only been
at the dealership
for a half-hour and she said
She agreed on a price,
which means she probably
got taken advantage of
Which I don't understand,
consider--you know what?
Forget it. I'm ok.
I don't even want to talk
about that stuff anymore.
I just want to concentrate
on you and me and the
great time we're gonna have.
[straw squeaking]
Ok, gary, why don't
you just go?
I feel like
I'm sitting next
to robin williams.
You want me to go?
You know what?
Listen,
It's just gonna take
a little while.
Go quick, come back,
we'll go to dinner.
Ok. Then we go to dinner
when I come back.
Absolutely.
You sure?
Yes.
Oh, you're the best.
Eric stoltz!
Gary, the movie quiz
is over.
No, that guy
looks just like
eric stoltz.
Ah! Here is my co-signor.
All right.
What's going on?
I'm in a hurry.
Well, we have
a little
problem.
You got a big problem.
A bear escaped from
the zoo, and he's standing
Outside your dealership
holding a sign that says
"0% financing."
What's the credit issue
there, handsome?
Ok, look, you rented
the movie "strange brew"
On my mastercard
and never returned it.
It went to
a collection agency.
How do you know
I rented it?
Well, it's a movie
about a guy
Who gets locked
in a beer vat
and avoids drowning
By drinking the beer
as it gushes in.
That's just one scene.
That's not what
the movie's about.
Ok, gary, thank you.
I was really looking
forward to buying
a car on my own
For the first time,
and you wrecked it.
Look, if you just sign
this form,
Allison will get her car
and you can be
on your way.
Fine. I'm on a date anyway.
I got to get out of here.
Isn't this
a little high?
Gary, just sign the form.
This is, like, $1,500
over the sticker
And you only got
the standard package.
We're not buying the car
at this price. No.
Well, you're right.
We are not buying
the car.
She is.
Oh, ok.
She is my ex-wife,
who I pay alimony to,
So if she makes a poor
financial decision,
it affects I.
Ok, you know what?
Gary, this is my deal,
all right?
I accept
full responsibility,
ok? Just sign it.
I don't know.
Extended warranty?
The car already comes
with a warranty.
You don't need that.
Take it off.
Well, what if
the engine blows
After the factory
warranty expires?
Allison: Yeah.
You just told me you're
gonna sell a product where
the engine's gonna blow?
No.
All right.
Then take it off.
We don't need it.
But it could blow.
But it won't.
You never know.
Sometimes they blow.
All right,
do me a favor.
Take it off...
Wait. Gary? Gary?
Gary, just sign
the paper!
Please sign
the paper, gary!
Allison was doing
just fine before
you got here.
Maybe you should
sign the paper
And get on
with your evening.
That's what the priest
said and I wound up
with this clunker.
Let me tell you
something.
The air bags broke
the second I took it
off the lot.
Maybe the air bags
didn't work
'cause you never hit
anything hard enough.
[dance music playing]
This is so great.
We should've
started breaking rules
A long time ago.
I know.
I'm on my fifth
root beer.
I can't even describe
the feeling.
Ha. Ha. Ha.
I told you guys
there was nothing
to worry about.
I like your crutches.
You wanna dance?
Yeah. Ok.
Oh, right here.
Yeah. Well.
Ha ha.
[dance music playing]
Uh-oh.
What? Who are
those people?
They're friends
of the brother
of the kid
Who's having
this party.
I can't believe
they're here.
Because they're
so much older?
No. Because
I thought they were
still in juvie.
Don't worry. If any
of those kids
Try to mess with
you, I'll cut them.
Oh, wow.
I believe you.
Ha ha.
Sir, I have checked
with the manager now
5 times.
This is the only
price he is going
to approve.
All right,
I want to talk
to the bear.
Is the bear around?
Gary. Gary!
Gary, for god's sake,
just sign the paper.
Look, look, you have
ruined my credit.
I can ignore that,
all right?
But I don't care if
I'm paying too much
And I don't want
power-assisted brakes,
Because after
we're done here,
I don't want anything
to keep me
From running your ass
over, all right?
Ok, so just
sign the paper
Before I lose
my mind completely.
Can you do that
for me, please, gary?
Fine.
Good.
Getting a little
excited over it.
Uhh.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Uh, mr. Hosenballs?
You...You forgot
to date this.
Gary?
Allison, I'm just
trying to get you
the best deal possible.
I left a date
with a beautiful woman
to do that.
Don't you understand that?
You know what I think?
I think you're still
in love with me.
Ha ha ha.
Wait, what?
Yeah.
Why else would you
leave your date
With a beautiful,
young woman
To spend two hours
haggling to get your
beloved ex-wife
A good deal
on her new car?
I've been here
two hours?
Yeah. Yeah.
It's quarter after 10.
I gotta tell you, gary,
it's downright romantic.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Oh, my gosh.
I gotta get out of here.
All right.
Can I sign next to it
Or do I need to
initial the hosenballs?
Ok, roger.
It's your turn
in the bear suit
I'm in the middle
of a deal, carl.
[dance music playing]
Chris, chris,
over here.
Over here.
All right,
this is not cool.
You kids blew it.
I'm glad you called.
Where's michaela?
Hey, michaela.
Get your stuff.
You're leaving right now.
I'm just trying
to have some fun.
You're not my dad.
You don't know
how hard
It is being
a child of divorce.
You know what?
I may not be your dad
But I'm the guy who's
in charge of you tonight,
So you can cut
the divorced parents crap.
I'm not buying it.
She wants to stay.
Why don't you
cool out, old dude?
You know what?
I think you need
to step back, chump,
Unless you want
your homies here
To see you get
your ass kicked
By the guy
who played tevye in
the alhambra playhouse
Production of
"fiddler on the roof."
Let's go. Now.
I gotta give my friends
a ride home, so...
[kiss]
Later.
Later.
Sasha. Look,
I know you said
on the phone
Not to come over
and apologize,
But I have to because
everything I said
Wouldn't happen, happened,
and it's all my fault.
Gary, it's
no one's fault.
Look, you are
a great guy.
It's just I've always
had this vision
Of what a relationship
should look like,
And it doesn't look like
me sharing my popcorn
With a large
latina woman.
I can't let
this night end
Without doing
something right, ok?
So, do me a favor.
Why don't you just
come with me to my house
And let me
show you something?
Ha. I have fallen
for that before, gary.
So, no. Thank you.
Come on.
How about just
a nice cup of coffee?
We'll get a cup
of coffee.
It's chock full o' gary.
Come on.
I don't know.
What could be better
than a hot cup of coffee
On a cold
winter's night?
What are you
talking about?
It's 75 degrees outside.
Is it?
I know you said
you missed the seasons,
So I figured maybe
just for tonight,
I could bring
the seasons to you.
Oh, my god.
I've had
the air conditioner
cranked all day.
I wasn't sure
what your religion was,
So I just hedged my bets.
Gary, I--this is
the sweetest thing
Anyone has ever
done for me.
Don't forget
your sweater.
There you go.
Ha ha.
You know when I said
I have a vision
Of what I want
a relationship
to look like?
This is it.
Huh.
Ha ha.
[kiss]
Did we rock it out
tonight or what?
You're a rebel.
You're a rebel.
You kissed that girl
Right in front of
her boyfriend!
Oh, yeah.
More marshmallows?
Ok. Would you two
like to tell me
What you guys were
thinking tonight?
It wasn't our fault.
We don't want--
We're children
of divorce.
What? No.
You left your bicycles
In the middle
of the driveway
And I almost ran them over
and scratched my new car.
Could you be a little more
responsible next time, please?
Mwah.
We will.
All right? Ok.
Yeah.
What's that smell?
Perfume?
Oh, I was just
trying something.
All right, well,
don't stay up
too late, guys.
Ok.
Good night.
You're dangerous.
You're dangerous.
Ha.

Voilà leurs affaires.
Merci de les garder ce soir.
Curtis et moi,
on va fêter mon augmentation.
Vous allez où,
vu que le <i>Chippendales</i> est fermé ?
On va dans un nouveau bar
où les slips banane sont plus petits.
Et on jette les bananes.
Ça pose pas de problème.
Howard revient de Hong Kong.
Donc, je sors pas ce soir.
Pour tout te dire,
il me manque vraiment.
C'est tôt,
mais je pense qu'on ira loin.
Tant que c'est loin de moi.
On va passer à table.
J'ai pas très faim.
Ni l'envie de vivre.
Pourquoi ?
Tu te souviens de Melissa,
la fille de la piscine ?
Je pensais qu'elle craquait pour moi,
mais elle est sortie avec Jerrod Pinsky.
Il est répugnant.
La soeur de Danielle
est dans sa classe.
Elle dit
qu'il a plein de pellicules.
C'est pas très gentil de dire ça.
Elle a raison.
Il peut avoir une maladie.
Tu dois montrer
un peu de compassion.
Alors, comment ce pelliculeux
a fait pour l'avoir ?
Je voulais l'impressionner
avec ces chaussures.
Il se trouve qu'il a les mêmes.
Et son père a le bateau qui va avec.
Ils vont se balader ce week-end.
Un bateau ?
Ça va être dur de faire mieux.
T'aurais pu dire
que j'étais animateur radio.
Ou bien qu'il y a de la moquette
sur le plafond de mon van.
Ou bien
qu'il peut mettre sept oeufs durs
dans sa bouche.
Tu en as de la chance.
Pourtant, ce jour-là,
tu as fait comme si de rien était.
Épisode 2x11
<i>Gary is a boat guy</i>
Jibes Team - La Fabrique
www.sous-titres.eu
On a bu toute ton augmentation ?
J'aime pas la vodka.
Ni la gelée.
Mais ensemble, j'avale d'un trait.
T'es prêt pour une autre tournée ?
On devrait faire une pause.
- On va faire une pause.
- Oui, on devrait sans doute faire ça.
Ça y est ? C'est bon ?
On a prouvé qu'on pouvait le faire.
Je suis désolé pour Tommy.
Une fille lui a échappé.
Tout ça parce qu'un type
possède un bateau.
Ça coûte combien, un bateau ?
C'est trop cher pour toi.
Ce Jerrod a volé la petite amie de Tommy
grâce à une chose.
Son père a un bateau.
Ce garçon avait un atout.
Marre de ces mecs.
Tu crois que mon père avait un bateau ?
Certainement pas.
Tu sais ce qu'il avait ?
Un baril de pétrole vide.
Un jour, il l'a apporté à la maison.
Et tu crois
que c'était un atout pour moi ?
Tu n'as pas eu l'atout du baril.
Toi, c'était plutôt :
"Mon père a de la beuh."
Regarde, y a un voilier sur eBay.
Voilier d'occasion, 5 m, 600 dollars.
C'est pas vrai !
Il a un trou ?
Pourquoi il est pas cher ?
Laisse-moi voir.
Il est beau.
Attends !
Tu vas acheter un bateau ?
Peut-être.
Tu vas surenchérir ?
Non, je vais l'acheter
immédiatement.
C'est du sérieux, là.
- Je suis sérieux.
- Alors, achète-le !
Je l'achète.
- J'appuie et c'est bon.
- Vas-y.
Je vais le faire.
Achète-le !
C'est fait !
On a acheté un bateau !
- C'est moi qui l'ai acheté.
- Quoi ?
Je l'ai acheté.
Tu te rappelles, au lycée,
quand les flics nous on arrêtés ?
Tu as dit :
"Avale ou on va avoir des ennuis."
Le bateau est à nous.
On aurait dit un bateau.
Vous avez entendu ?
Non.
C'est arrangé avec Melissa.
Elle craque pour moi.
Le bateau ?
Ouais, je l'ai abordée de façon cool,
comme d'habitude.
"Salut, Melissa.
Quoi de neuf ?
"Mon père a un bateau.
Si tu veux faire une balade..."
Tenez-vous bien, elle a dit :
"T'es trop génial !"
C'est drôle.
Je m'en souviens pas comme ça.
J'ai tout vu.
Il l'a poursuivie frénétiquement.
Puis tu as perdu une pompe et hurlé :
"Mon père a un bateau, tu veux venir ?"
Maintenant que c'est clair,
elle a accepté
et c'est tout ce qui compte.
Le bateau !
Soyez cool.
Comme si c'était pas
la première fois.
Un petite signature,
s'il vous plaît.
On est enfin de vrais marins.
Et voilà.
Bonne journée.
Je pige pas.
Ouvre.
Ça doit être les clés du bateau.
Si ce sont les clés,
le bateau doit être immense.
Voilà.
Ça doit être la maquette du bateau
pour qu'on se familiarise avec.
Je ne pense pas.
Ça me tue de le dire,
mais c'est ton bateau.
Tu as acheté la réplique
d'un voilier de 5 mètres.
Quoi ?
Impossible.
J'étais bourré à ce point ?
Je dis quoi à Melissa ?
Que tu as un bateau.
Qu'on va le mettre au port.
Elle le verra petit
parce qu'il est loin.
Où est le bateau ?
Il a l'air petit
parce que je le vois de loin.
Arrête.
Tu sais que c'est une maquette.
Regardez les détails.
Y a les cordes des voiles,
les gonds des écoutilles.
Y a même un gars à l'intérieur !
Je vais dire à Melissa
que c'est foutu.
On va trouver un truc.
Le copain de ta mère a un bateau.
Tu penses à Needleman ?
Je suis prêt à solliciter
quelqu'un qui me débecte
si ça concerne mes gosses.
T'as croisé Bronson Pinchot
et tu lui as pas demandé
un autographe pour moi.
Il était en plein tournage.
Bienvenue à bord du <i>Needlefish</i>,
messieurs.
Super bateau, Needleman.
C'est un yacht.
Peu importe, c'est pas grave.
J'apprécie ton geste.
Merci pour Tommy.
C'est un chouette gosse.
Je le considère comme mon fils.
Pas question.
C'est un GPS, ça ?
Il a tout, ce bateau.
T'as tout sur ce bateau.
C'est un yacht.
Peu importe, c'est pas grave.
Là, c'est l'aide à la navigation.
Et là, le système
de vidéosurveillance.
Je me suis lâché, j'ai un solarium.
Parfois, c'est nuageux.
Vous voyez.
Je me contenterais d'un bateau
résistant à l'attaque d'une sardine.
Peu importe l'équipement du bateau,
du moment
qu'il vous emmène au large.
Les marins forment un clan.
Ils sont solidaires.
Bienvenue à bord.
Maintenant, je vais vous montrer
comment gober le merlan.
Merci pour le bateau,
mais j'ignorais la contrepartie.
J'admire ce que tu fais pour Tom.
Je comprends
qu'un père veuille
ce qu'il y a de mieux pour son fils.
Mon fils aura tout ce qu'il veut,
donc je vois pas trop.
Mais je comprends le concept.
Excusez-moi.
Pas de problème.
Il a viré loufedingue.
Si on avait eu ça au lycée !
Ça en jette plus
que les rouflaquettes.
On aurait chopé des gonzesses
à bâbord et tribord.
Il sert à quoi, ce bouton ?
C'est joli.
Tu ferais mieux d'éteindre,
les bulles vont tacher le tissu.
C'est de la laine d'agneau
bouclée à la française.
On pourrait avoir à s'en servir.
Quelqu'un s'en est déjà servi.
C'est à Allison ?
Non, Allison ne porte pas de string.
Elle met toujours des caleçons.
Ça me manque, d'ailleurs.
J'avais beau la haïr,
mais elle avait de belles fesses.
Elle est trop maigre.
Je préfère les femmes qui,
devant une vitrine,
ont leur cul qui met 4 à 5 secondes
à se stabiliser.
Elle entre alors
dans ma ligne de mire.
Ça, c'est sûrement pas à Allison.
Tu crois que Needleman
s'offre des extras ?
Où emmènerais-tu une petite amie ?
Au Raintree Lodge, sur Riverside.
Câble et piscine chauffée.
Que faites-vous ?
On visite ton bateau
et on tient de la lingerie.
C'est à Allison.
Elle a dû les oublier.
Essaie encore.
On sait tous que quatre de ses seins
ne rempliraient pas un de ces bonnets.
D'accord,
j'ai peut-être fait un petit écart.
Ça ne représentait rien pour moi.
Mais tu l'as dit à Allison.
Si je ne lui ai pas dit,
c'est parce que
ça va la rendre furieuse.
J'ai commis une grosse erreur,
mais j'aime Allison.
Je pense l'épouser,
je veux pas tout gâcher.
On est entre marins !
Un marin dénonce pas un marin.
Ça, c'est jet-skieurs.
Mais tu lui diras.
Non, et toi non plus.
Ça annulerait immédiatement
ton statut de marin.
J'ai peut-être pas envie
d'être un marin.
Je vous ai avoué la vérité
parce qu'on partage
cette passion du bateau
et pour que nos relations
s'améliorent.
On t'a chopé, oui.
Peu importe.
J'aimerais que ça reste entre nous.
Si tu veux tout gâcher
entre Allison et moi,
c'est la guerre.
Et je gagnerai.
Super.
Tu gagneras une femme
qui comprendra jamais
comment gober le merlan.
- Allison, il faut que je te parle.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
J'ai beaucoup réfléchi, c'est rapide.
Mais veux-tu m'épouser ?
Ça va, Gary ?
Oui, je veux t'épouser !
Plus tard.
Ça peut pas attendre,
c'est important.
T'as pas dû voir la bague.
Il te trompe !
Il y avait de la lingerie sur le bateau.
C'est normal.
Je loue le yacht le week-end.
Allie le sait.
C'est dingue ce que je retrouve
sur ce bateau.
J'ai même trouvé une balançoire sexuelle
dans la chambre.
Arrête, Needleman.
Dis-lui la vérité.
Gary, ne fais pas ça.
Je sais que c'est précipité,
mais c'est ce que je veux.
C'est sûrement dur à avaler,
mais on savait que ça arriverait
pour l'un de nous.
Je pensais que tu serais le premier.
C'est un peu triste.
Et plutôt drôle, en fait.
Je m'inquiète pour toi.
Tu dois me croire.
Howard, tu me trompes ?
Non, Allison, je ne te trompe pas.
Ça me suffit.
Tu te moques de moi ?
Tu me connais depuis 20 ans,
et lui, depuis six mois.
Je vais prendre parti
et croire mon fiancé.
Quand il te brisera le coeur,
ne viens pas gémir,
car je t'aurai prévenu.
Gary, sans rancune.
Je sais que tu veux toujours emmener Tom
faire un tour sur le <i>Needlefish</i>.
Il est à toi.
Je le ferai pour lui.
Mais je lui dirai qu'être marin,
c'est tromper et mentir.
Pigé. Amusez-vous !
Les noms des bateaux
sont trop drôles.
La <i>Coquenenbourg</i>.
Comme la bière,
mais avec "coque" au lieu de "Kro".
La <i>Morue joyeuse</i>.
C'est un bateau de pêche, tu piges ?
Et celui-là.
Le <i>À voile et à vapeur.</i>
Y a deux types sur le pont.
Je devrais pas regarder !
Comment elle voit pas ses mensonges ?
Elle voyait toujours les miens.
Quand je rentrais, je devais lui dire
combien j'avais dépensé au bar.
Et si j'avais regardé la voisine
tondre sa pelouse en bustier.
- Tu vas faire quoi ?
- Tommy, viens voir ici !
Si la lingerie du bateau
ne l'a pas convaincue,
je dois trouver
quelque chose de plus convaincant.
Je vais chercher.
Tu veux tenir la barre ?
- Sérieux ?
- Bien sûr. Assieds-toi là.
Melissa, tu peux faire son second.
Super.
Tu t'alignes sur le phare.
Si tu as besoin de moi,
appelle-moi par l'interphone.
On descend faire...
Un truc privé.
On y va, vieux.
Tu es le plus mignon
des minicapitaines.
Le <i>À voile et à vapeur</i>, c'est drôle.
Y a deux mecs...
Faut pas regarder !
J'ai fouillé la cabine
et la salle de bains.
Rien de compromettant.
Il a dû faire un grand ménage,
depuis la dernière fois.
Je sais pas ce qu'il a utilisé,
mais j'ai glissé du solarium.
Cherchons encore.
Peu importe.
Depuis le coup de la bague,
c'est l'homme de sa vie.
Il a un atout !
Lève-toi de là !
Il faut qu'on dégotte un truc.
Je vais me venger en vidant son bar.
Du scotch, 17 ans d'âge.
Il n'atteindra pas l'âge de voter.
Allez !
Un agenda, du rouge à lèvres,
une pute morte ou autre.
T'as trouvé une pute morte ?
Mieux.
Une pute vivante ?
Les voilà.
Entrez.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Tu veux que je trouve
le début du cellophane ?
C'est transparent,
comment je trouve le début ?
Je vous ai fait venir
parce que vous aviez raison.
Je m'excuse,
je me suis conduit en abruti.
Je l'ai vu te passer la bague au doigt
et j'ai pété un plomb.
Ça a été un choc énorme.
Comme j'étais surpris,
j'ai laissé mon esprit
se réfugier dans le côté obscur.
L'esprit, c'est sournois.
Et dans cette situation,
j'ai juste voulu nuire à Needleman.
Des mots dégoûtants.
Alors ?
De marin à marin, je suis navré.
Tu admets m'avoir accusé à tort
de tromper Allison ?
- Excuses acceptées, vieux.
- Super.
Vraiment ?
Comme ça, d'un coup,
tu t'embarques là-dedans.
Tout le monde à bord !
Tout va bien, d'accord ?
Désolé, je file dans la cuisine.
Félicitations, Allison.
J'apprécie tes excuses.
Donc, on va s'en aller.
Pas encore parce que...
j'ai un cadeau spécial
pour tes fiançailles, Needleman.
Tu m'offres quelque chose
pour mon yacht ?
En fait, quelque chose de ton yacht.
T'as un super système
de vidéosurveillance.
On regarde ?
En fait, non.
On devrait y aller, Allie.
- Pourquoi ?
- Rien.
J'ai laissé le four allumé
dans ma maison à Aspen
que tu ne connais pas.
Et j'aimerais t'y emmener maintenant,
dans mon jet.
Avoue
et personne n'aura à voir cette vidéo.
Voir quoi ?
Vous parlez de quoi ?
Rien, Allison.
Gary re-pète un plomb.
Allison, regarde-moi.
Je suis en train de péter un plomb ?
Pas vraiment.
Je veux regarder le DVD.
Très bien, je vais y aller.
Assis.
Fais voir.
Allez, assieds-toi.
Bon spectacle, Needleman.
- <i>Ton bateau est génial.</i>
- <i>Yacht, peu importe, c'est pas grave.</i>
C'est qui, la salope ?
Je sais pas, c'est pas moi.
<i>Viens là, Howard Needleman.</i>
Je le jure, j'allais t'en parler.
<i>On emportera ça dans nos tombes.</i>
La ferme, Needleman !
J'en ai vu assez.
Tu peux éteindre.
Je suis désolé.
Je ne voulais pas te le montrer,
mais tu ne m'as pas cru.
Parlons-en au cours d'un coûteux dîner
dans mon train privé.
Tu sais quoi, Howard ?
Je ne veux pas dîner avec toi.
En fait, je veux plus ta sale tronche.
Dégage.
- Enfin, Allison.
- Je suis sérieuse, dégage.
Je vais te dire un truc.
De marin à marin.
Dans cinq secondes,
je lâche l'ancre sur ta tronche.
Et emporte ça !
C'est un diamant de trois carats !
Ça n'a pas de rapport,
mais il faut que je prenne l'air.
- Prête pour la suivante ?
- Attends.
Envoie.
C'est pour toi.
Et si on passait
à la mise à l'eau du voilier <i>Gary</i> ?
Tu es prête ?
À toi l'honneur.
Magnifique.
C'est parti !
Il est parti !
Le vendeur va se prendre
plein de commentaires négatifs.
Je sais que tu voulais me protéger.
Pas besoin de le dire.
Tu allais t'excuser ?
Vas-y, dis-le.
Désolée de ne pas t'avoir cru.
Pas de problème.
Et la bague ?
Elle était dans la gamelle
du chien du voisin.
Maintenant, elle est dans le chien.
On fait quoi ?
Y a qu'une seule chose à faire.
Attendre.
Hey, allison. Here's the
rest of the kids' stuff.
Thanks for watching 'em tonight
While curtis and I go out
and celebrate my new raise.
Oh. Where you gonna go now
that chippendales closed?
Actually we're going to a new place
Where they have much
smaller banana hammocks.
And...We're done with the bananas. Ok.
It's not a problem taking the kids.
Howard's coming home from hong kong tonight.
So, I'm going to be home anyway.
Gotta tell ya, I really miss him
when he's not here, you know.
And I know this is kind of soon,
but I feel like he and I
Might just go the distance.
Great. As long as that
distance is really far from me.
Hi, mom.
Oh, hey! Hey kids. You ready for dinner?
Yeah.
Yeah. I don't really have an appetite.
Or a will to live.
What's wrong, son? Well,
you know that gir, Mellisa?
Well, I thought she was into me.
But then I found out she went to
parabid lake with jerrod pinsky.
Jerrod pinsky is gross my friend danielle's
sister sits behind him in history class.
She said he gets dandruff all over her desk.
Oh, honey, that's not nice to talk
about people behind their back.
Your mom's right, honey.
The guy could have, like,
a medical condition or something.
You gotta show people a little compassion.
Ok? So, how'd this snowman
freak steal your old lady?
You know how I said I could impress melissa
with those shoes that you bought me?
Mm-hmm.
Well, turns out jerrod had
those same exact shoes.
And unfortunately, underneath his
shoes was his dad's 20-foot ski boat
That they're going out on this weekend.
Ski boat?!
That's a tough one to beat my man.
You could have said, "hey,
my dad's got his own radio show."
Or "hey, my dad's got a van
with carpeting on the ceiling."
But if you ever need, your dad can
fit 7 hardboiled eggs in his mouth
At the same time. You're golden.
Now you remember?! But when I
did it at the cocktail party,
You acted like it wasn't happening.

[stammering] you think-- you think-
-you think we drank your whole raise yet?
You know, I don't like vodka.
I don't like jell-o.
You put 'em together and
I can have a whole tray.
Hey, man, you-- you ready for another one?
I don't know. Maybe we should--
Maybe we should take a break.
We gotta take a break, curtis.
We prob--we probably
should just take a break.
Whoo. That's good for you?
We proved we could do it.
All right.
There you go.
I feel bad for tommy.
I can't stop thinking about how
he lost a girl that he likes
'cause his dad's some stupid boat guy--
Owns a boat.
How much-- how much is a boat cost?
A boat costs more than you got.
The only reason that jerrod kid was able
to steal tommy's girlfriend away from him
Is 'cause his dad had a boat.
Yep. The kid had an edge.
Tired of guys with edges.
You think my dad had a
boat in the driveway?!
No, I do not.
You know what my dad had?
He had an empty oil barrel.
Just rolled it home one day.
Left it in the driveway.
You think that barrel gave me an edge?!
No. You did not have an oil barrel edge.
I think your edge was, "hey,
my dad always has pot!"
Hey, curtis, look at this.
There's a sailboat on ebay.
Used 14-foot catalina.
600 bucks. Oh my gosh.
You kidding me? What? It's got a
hole in it? Why is it so cheap?
Let me see this here.
Oh, that--that is nice.
Wait a second!
You thinking about buying a boat?!
Maybe I am.
Well, how much are you going to bid?
I'm not going to bid anything.
I'm just gonna click "buy it now."
Hey. Hey. That's a serious move, baby.
I'm a serious man.
Get that boat!
I'm getting the boat.
I press the key, and it's done.
Do it.
I'm gonna do it.
Buy the boat, baby!
I bought the boat!
Yes! We got a boat!
âTª we bought a boat! We bought a boat! âTª
âTª we bought a boat! We...
Bought...A boat! âTª
âTª we bought a boat! We bought a boat! âTª
âTª we bought a boat âTª
No, I bought a boat.
What?!
I bought a boat.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Hey, remember in high school when we got
pulled over by the cops and you said,
"hey, swallow this or we got a problem."
Well, now we got a boat.
Hey, that sounded like a boat.
Did you guys hear a boat?
That--
No, not yet. But, hey,
I got it all lined up with melissa.
She's totally into me again.
You told her about the boat?
Yeah, yeah. I just walked up to her
before school all cool and casual.
And I was like, "hey, melissa, 'sup.
"my dad just got this cool boat.
And if you want to go for a ride, whatever."
Get this. She's like, "oh, my god, tommy.
You're so awesome."
It's--it's funny how you
remember it that way.
I saw the whole thing.
He chased melissa down the hall
With junk falling out of your backpack.
Then one of your shoes flew off,
and you shouted,
"my dad got a boat!
And you wanna go on my dad's boat?!"
Well, after we cleared that up...
She said yes. And that's all I care about.
[doorbell]
The boat! The boat! The boat!
Be cool! Be cool!
Act like you've been there before!
Gary brooks?
Yes!
Could you sign for a delivery, please?
Oh my gosh. True craft marine. This is it.
Here you go.
Have a good one.
I don't get it.
Well, open it.
Maybe the keys are inside
the box for the boat.
Hey, if the keys are this big,
the boat's gonna be huge.
Ok. Here we go.
Ok.
You know what? This is probably
a model to familiarize yourself
With the real boat when you get it.
Yeah. I don't think so, dad.
Dad, I hate to tell you.
But this is your boat.
You bought a collector's
replica of a 14-foot catalina.
What?!
That's impossible. I must
have been so drunk--careless.
Hey, dad, what am I
supposed to tell melissa?
You tell melissa you got a boat.
We're gonna put that in the harbor.
You just tell her it's really far away.
Is the boat here? Where's the boat?
Maybe it is so small,
because I am so far away.
Knock it off, curtis.
It's a model. You know it.
Wow. Look at the detail.
Got little strings for the sails.
Little tiny hinges on the hatches there.
Oh, there's a little dude
driving it inside there.
I'm gonna go call melissa and
tell her this whole thing's off.
Don't. We'll think of something, you know?
It's--hey, your mom's boyfriend has a boat.
What? You're gonna ask needleman?
Yeah. I don't care.
I'll ask someone that makes
me physically sick for a favor
If it involves my kids.
Ok. But you see bronson
pinchot at the shakies,
And you can't ask him
for an autograph for me?
The man was in the middle
of a shift, curtis.
Welcome aboard the u.S.S.
"needlefish," gentlemen.
Wow, you got a great boat here, needleman.
It's a yacht. Whatever. Doesn't matter.
I really appreciate you
letting me use it for tommy.
Oh, no problem, buddy. He's a good kid.
I'm starting to think of him like a son.
Ha. Yeah, don't.
Hey, man, is this gps right here?
Yeah. This boat's got everything.
Man, you got everything on this boat.
It's a yacht. Whatever. Doesn't matter.
Check it out. You got state of
the art navigation right here,
24-hour surveillance system right here.
I may have gone a little bit
overboard with the tanning bed,
But some days it gets a little
cloudy out here. So, you know.
I'd be happy with a boat that wouldn't
get sunk if it got rammed by a goldfish.
You know, guys, it doesn't
matter what you have on your boat
As long as you're drawn to the sea.
Boat guys are a special breed.
We stick together.
Welcome aboard, hombres.
Now, why don't I take you guys down below.
I'll show you how to work the head.
I appreciate you letting us use the boat.
But I didn't know there
would be strings attached!
You know, I really admire
what you're doing for tom.
I completely understand how a father
would want his son to have more than him.
Although my son will
never want for anything,
So, I can't actually relate to it,
But I do understand it as a concept.
[cell phone rings] oh!
Excuse me. Yes?
Uh, no.
Yes.
Excuse me guys. Excuse me just a second.
Yeah, no problem, man.
Boy, he got squirrelly all of a sudden.
Look at this place. Can you imagine
if we had this in high school?
This is way better than sideburns.
Man, we'd be getting
chicks port and starboard.
What's this button even do?
[soft piano music plays]
Ohh.
Oh, that's pretty.
Whoo!
Hey, man, you better turn that off
'cause you don't want that soap
getting on this lambs wool over here
That has been woven in
the french boucle style.
What I mean by that is you
can get busy on this stuff.
And whoa. Seems like somebody already did.
Allison's?
No. No. Allison never wore thongs.
She, uh, she always wore these
things called boy shorts.
It's one thing I do miss about allison,
For all the times I hated her guts,
She did have a perfect rear end.
She's a little too skinny for me, brother.
Like, when I'm at the mall and I see
a woman stop in front of a window
And it takes, like, 4 or 5 seconds for
her butt to stop moving and get still...
Then she's in the curtis zone.
All right, these are
definitely not allison's. Ok.
You think needleman's getting a
little something on the side?
If you had a girlfriend,
where would you take her?
Raintree lodge on riverside.
Free hbo and heated pool.
What's going on in here?
We're just checking out your
boat and holding underwear.
Well, those are allison's.
She must have left them here.
Ha. Guess again, needleman.
We all know 4 of allison's boobs
Wouldn't fit in one of those cups.
Ok. Look guys, I may have
had a little indiscretion.
But it was no big deal.
It didn't mean anything.
But you told allison about it, right?
No. But the only reason I didn't tell her
Was because I thought it would
make her really, really upset.
Now, look guys.
I know I made a terrible mistake.
But I love allison.
And I may even ask her to marry me.
I don't want this to screw everything up.
Come on, we're boat guys.
Boat guys don't rat out other boat guys.
That's jet ski guys.
All right, but you are going to tell her.
No. I'm not. And neither are you,
Because that would immediately
negate your boat guy status.
Ahh. Maybe I don't want to be a boat guy.
Look guys, the reason I came clean with you
Is because we're sharing
all this boat stuff,
I thought we were taking our
relationship to a cool new level.
You came clean with us
because we caught you.
Ok. Well, however it happened,
I would like to keep this between us.
Ok? And gary, if you're gonna go ahead
And screw everything up for me
and allison, then it's game on.
And I'm gonna win.
All right, great. Just keep in mind,
you're gonna win a woman
That will never really
understand how to work the head.
Allison, I gotta tell you something.
What's going on?
Well-- allison.
Listen, I've given a thought of thought.
And I know it seems soon, but I love you,
And I want you to be my wife.
Hey, what's up, gary?
Oh. Oh. Yeah. Oh my god! Yes,
I'll marry you.
Hey, can your thing wait?
No. No, it can't wait.
I have to tell it to you. It's important.
Maybe you didn't see the ring.
He's a cheater, allison!
I found women's underwear on his boat.
I'm not surprised. I rent out
the yacht almost every weekend.
Allie knows that. Yeah.
You would be amazed by some of the things
I found on the boat.
One time I found a sex
swing hanging over the bed
In the master bedroom.
Knock it off, needleman.
Tell her the truth right now.
Ok. Gary, please. Please don't do this.
Ok. I know it's a fast engagement,
but it's what I want.
I know this may be hard for you to process,
But we both knew this day was
going to come for one of us.
And the fact that you thought it
was going to come for you first,
Is, well, sad and a little funny actually.
I'm looking out for you, allison.
You gotta believe me.
Howard, are you having an affair?
No, allison, I'm not.
Well, that's good enough for me.
[gasp] are you kidding me?
Who you going to believe?
Me--the guy you've known for 20 years
Or the guy you've been dating for 6 months?
I think I'm gonna go ahead
and go with my fiance.
Wow. All right, well, when he breaks your heart,
don't come crawling to me
'cause I'll just have to tell you,
I told you so. All right?
Gary, hold on. No hard feelings.
Look, I know you still want to take tom
out for a spin on the old "needlefish."
So, she's all yours.
I will for tom's sake.
But I am going to tell my son
That if being a boat guy
involves lying and cheating,
It's not worth it.
You got it, buddy. Have fun!
Man, these boat names are hilarious.
Look at this, the "boatweiser."
You get it? It's like
the beer except a boat.
Look at the "happy hooker."
'cause it's a fishing boat, see?
Oh, well look at this over here.
The "blow the man down."
Look, it's 2 dudes on deck there that--
Oh, I shouldn't be seeing that!
Ok. [indistinct]
I can't believe allison doesn't
know that needleman's lying.
She always knew when I was lying.
And it got to the point where I would
come home and I would have to tell her
How much money I spent, how much I drank,
And how long I starred at the hot
neighbor mowing the lawn in her tube top.
So, what are you going to do?
Tommy, come on up here!
Hey, if the underwear in the boat
wasn't enough to convince her,
I gotta find something else
that will convince her. Ok?
I'm gonna go look around. Hey, tommy.
Yeah?
Come on, you want to steer the boat?
Well, yeah. Are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious. Come on up here, fella.
And melissa, you can be
his special navigator.
Cool. Yeah, cool.
You just keep it pointed
at the lighthouse, ok son.
And if you need me,
you just call me on the intercom.
Ok.
Curtis and I are gonna go
down below and do some real,
You know, kinda private business.
All right. Ok.
Let's  pal
You're the cutest little captain ever.
Aw, thanks.
Hey, look at that "blow the
man down." that's funny.
Hey, there's 2 dudes-- ok,
we shouldn't be seeing this.
I searched the staterooms and
the bathrooms, top to bottom,
Nothing incriminating in there.
It's no use. Once we found the underwear,
Probably came back and
cleaned the entire ship.
Oh, no. He definitely did. I don't know
what he used to clean that tanning bed
But I slid right off.
We gotta keep looking, curtis.
It doesn'tattewhat we find.
Once that rock went on allison's finger,
He's the new guy in her life.
Man, he's got the edge.
[soft piano music plays]
Oh! You're sitting on it. Get off of there!
We gotta keep looking.
We gotta find something.
Well, you keep looking.
I'm gonna even the score my way
By drinking his booze.
This is a 17-year-old bottle of scotch
That's not going to live
long enough to vote.
We gotta find something.
A pocketbook, some lipstick,
Dead hooker--something.
Oh, my gosh.
What? You find a dead hooker?
Better.
A live hooker?
[doorbell]
Hey, they're here.
Hi, guys. Come on in.
What's this about, gary?
You want me to help you find the
end of the saran wrap again?
It's all the same color!
How I am supposed to find it?!
Allison, I've brought you guys
over here because you were right.
I wanted to apologize.
I acted like a complete jerk.
I saw him put the ring on your finger,
and I just absolutely lost it.
It was a huge shock.
I think because I was surprised,
I immediately just let my mind
go to the darkest place it could.
The mind is a tricky thing.
And when put on the spot
and put in that situation,
I just said the most hurtful thing
about needleman I could think of.
Just nasty words.
So, needleman, what do you say?
From one boat guy to another, I'm sorry.
So, you're admitting that you falsely
accused me of cheating on allison?
Well, apology accepted, buddy.
All right.
Really? Gary, just all of a sudden,
out of the blue,
You're onboard with this?
All aboard! Toot-toot.
Curtis, it's good. All right?
All right. Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go into the kitchen.
Excuse me. Congratulations, allison.
Ok. Well, gary, I appreciate the apology.
So, I guess we'll go.
Don't go yet, because I got you
a special engagement present.
Needleman--
Don't tell me. You got me
something for my yacht?
Actually I gotou something from your yacht.
You have an amazing surveillance
system on that baby.
Care to take a look?
Uh-- what? What?
Actually, no. We should get going, allie.
Howard, honey, what's wrong?
Oh, nothing. I remembered that I just
left the oven on in my house in aspen,
Which you've never seen,
And I would like to take you there
right now on my jet. Let's go.
Ok...
Come on, needleman. Come clean.
Tell her the truth. No one has to see this.
See? See what?! What are
you guys talking about?
Nothing, allison. Gary's freaking out again!
Allison, look at me. Am I freaking out?
No. Actually, you're not.
Ok. You know what?
I want to see what's on the dvd.
Ok. Well, I'm gonna take off--
Howard, sit.
Gary, let's see it.
Come on. Have a seat.
Enjoy the show needleman.
Woman: Wow. Your boat is amazing.
Howard: Yacht. Whatever. It doesn't matter.
Who's the slut, howard?
I don't know. That's not me.
Uh-huh.
Woman: Come here, howard needleman.
Allison, I swear I was going
to tell you about this.
Howard: We're gonna take this to our grave!
Shut up, needleman!
You know what, gary? I've seen enough.
Just turn it off.
Look, hey. Allison, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to have to show you that.
But you just didn't believe
me when I told you the truth.
Allison, look. Why don't we talk about this
Over a very expensive dinner on my train?
Ok. You know what, howard?
I don't want to go out to dinner with you.
In fact, I never want
to see your face again.
Get out.
Come on, allison.
I mean it! Get out!
Hold on, allison. Let me tell
you something, needleman.
From one boat guy to another,
You got 5 seconds to get out of here
before I drop anchor on your face.
You know what? You can take this with ya!
Are you crazy?! That's a 3-carat diamond!
Ok. Totally, unrelated,
I need to get some fresh air!
Are you ready for another?
Oh, hang on.
Hit me.
This one's for you.
How about the maiden voyage
of the s.S. "gary" boat?
You ready? Yeah.
You do the honors.
Ahh! Lovely!
Ok.
Here she goes!
Ohh!
And there she goes!
The guy that sold that to me on ebay
Is going to get a lot of negative comments.
Look, gary. I know you were
just looking out for me.
Hey, come on. You don't have to say it.
Wait, were you just going to apologize?
Yeah.
Yeah, you gotta say it.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you, gary.
You don't have to say it.
Hey! How'd it go with the ring?
Well, it landed in the neighbor's dog dish.
And now it's inside the neighbor's dog.
So, what do we do?
There's only one thing we can do.
We wait.

- <i>Qui était le 13e président des USA ?</i>
- Lincoln.
- <i>Fillmore.</i>
- <i>Bonne réponse.</i>
<i>Et la plus grande ville
du Nebraska ?</i>
Lincoln !
- <i>Omaha.</i>
- <i>Bonne réponse !</i>
<i>Une marque de jouets à briquettes ?</i>
Les Legos !
- <i>Lincoln !</i>
- <i>Exact !</i>
- Salut, papa.
- Salut, mon coeur.
On revient de chez le dentiste.
Il préconise un appareil pour Louise.
Tu as accepté tout de suite ?
Tu as négocié ?
Un acompte ?
Du ruban adhésif, des élastiques ?
C'est un dentiste.
C'est pas le gars de Tijuana
qui t'a vendu le fouet.
Il doit encore se mordre les doigts
de notre marché.
Tu as des devoirs ?
D'accord.
Tom est ici ? On doit lui parler.
- Il est dans le cuisine. Pourquoi ?
- Un retard à l'école.
Encore un ?
On procède comment ?
Tu joues le bon flic ou le casse-pieds ?
Alors, lequel ?
Celle à la taille de guêpe.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- C'est ton 6e bulletin de retard,
en trois semaines.
Tu pars à l'heure.
Tu peux expliquer pourquoi
tu arrives en retard à l'école ?
On a des lectures intéressantes
à faire
et je lis sur les gradins
avant le début des cours.
<i>Huckleberry Finn,
Les raisins de la colère.</i>
Je me passionne pour l'histoire
et je perds la notion du temps.
D'accord.
C'est super de lire avant les cours.
Mais tu dois pas arriver en retard.
Ressaisis-toi.
D'accord.
- Il ment !
- Je sais !
Comme s'il aimait lire.
"Je lis."
C'est sûr.
Il n'a jamais ouvert <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>,
il y a de la poussière autour.
<i>Les raisins de la colère ?</i>
C'est même pas un bouquin.
Comme si
du raisin hantait la campagne
en quête de vengeance.
<i>Les raisins de la colère</i>
est un livre de John Steinbeck.
Tu te souviens pas ?
Au lycée, tu t'en servais
pour caler l'autoradio qui vibrait.
Je m'en souviens.
C'était ta faute s'il vibrait.
Tu portais tes bottes à talons hauts
quand on le faisait.
Il faisait 4 °C.
J'allais pas retirer mes bottes.
Toi, tu gardais ton caleçon long,
à ouverture frontale.
Que fait-on pour Tom ?
Chaque fois qu'il me répond,
c'est par monosyllabes :
"Ouais. Non. Et ?"
C'est inquiétant ?
Peut-être.
J'ai le sentiment qu'à l'école,
il a de mauvaises fréquentations.
Je sais pas trop.
Appelle ça l'instinct maternel,
mais il cache quelque chose.
Je te le dirai,
car je suis son père
et je le connais bien.
Ne t'en fais pas.
Il n'y a pas de mal à admettre
que je le connais mieux que toi.
Je suis son père.
Personne ne le connaît mieux que moi.
- Ah oui ? Qui est son meilleur ami ?
- Conner.
C'est Brian.
Son plat préféré ?
- Les pizzas.
- Faux, les frites.
Une autre.
- Son prof préféré ?
- Lincoln.
Épisode 2x12
<i>Gary feels Tom slipping away</i>
Jibes Team - La Fabrique
www.sous-titres.eu
On avance au pas sur les routes.
Y a des ralentissements
sur la 110, la 101 et la 605.
Si tu es le gars au pick-up rouge
qui m'a grillé la priorité
et qui a insulté ma mère,
je le dirai à ta soeur
demain matin au réveil.
Voilà pour le trafic.
On revient après ça.
On doit faire le flash
à la 3e minute ?
Pourquoi pas à la 5e ?
C'est plus facile à se rappeler.
On voulait la 5e, la 1re ou la 7e.
C'était pris.
Restait celle-là ou la 9e.
Mais du coup,
valait mieux attendre la 1re.
Ça va ?
T'es à cran, ce matin.
D'abord,
j'ai été pris dans les bouchons.
Puis je suis resté dans mon van
et j'ai surveillé Tom
après qu'il soit descendu du bus.
Tu observais une école
depuis ton van ?
Dis-moi quand ça passe sur YouTube,
pervers.
C'est pas ça.
Tom est souvent en retard
dernièrement.
Et l'instinct maternel d'Allison
dit qu'il traînerait avec des punks.
L'instinct maternel, c'est puissant.
À 15 ans, je suis allé à New York
avec la chorale.
C'était à 5 000 km de chez moi.
Je suis allé à une fête.
J'allais prendre une bière.
Et là, le téléphone sonne.
Je décroche et j'entends :
C'était une cabine téléphonique.
Je pensais être plus proche de Tommy
que mon père l'était de moi.
Il est pas venu
à la remise des diplômes,
il était occupé
à libérer un singe d'un labo.
C'est un geste noble.
Tout ça pour le ramener à la maison
et lui filer mon vélo.
Tu as surveillé Tom ?
Ça va pas vous rapprocher.
- Alors, je fais quoi ?
- Lis ses e-mails.
Le seul moyen de concurrencer
l'instinct maternel,
c'est d'entrer dans le XXIe siècle.
Je peux pas faire ça.
C'est violer son intimité.
Mon neveu, Dwayne,
était un très bon élève.
Et d'un coup, ses notes ont chuté.
Il a refusé d'en parler.
Alors, j'ai lu ses e-mails.
Il était embringué dans une sale bande.
Drogués ?
Non, un groupe d'improvisation.
"Sale bande", c'était leur nom.
J'ai apprécié, l'autre soir.
Moi aussi, j'ai beaucoup apprécié.
Vous êtes Laird Hamilton.
Gary Brooks.
- Aloha, Gary.
- Aloha, vous-même.
Vous avez influencé mon surf.
Il a surfé sur des vagues
qui ont détruit des villages.
On l'interviewe, demain.
Je suis Curtis Taylor.
Pas un grand nageur.
Sympa de vous revoir.
Si on allait dans mon bureau
discuter de l'émission de demain ?
- Il m'a serrée dans ses bras !
- Il m'a dit "Aloha".
Je suis l'une des organisatrices
de l'événement
"Sauvons la baie".
Et on adorerait que vous participiez
à l'émission de Gary, demain,
pour parler
du nettoyage de la plage.
Formidable.
Je ferais tout pour alerter l'opinion.
Quel esprit généreux.
Et grand.
Grand, blond...
Très bronzé.
Sans vouloir me vanter, Laird,
j'ai bien déchiré, à Sunset Beach.
Vraiment ?
J'ai une école de surf, là-bas.
C'est pratique,
c'est près des toilettes.
En préparant l'émission,
j'ai vu une vidéo
où vous surfez une vague de 20 m.
J'en avais des frissons.
Je dois me faire peur tous les jours
pour me sentir vivant.
Parfois, je surfe un tube de 10 m.
D'autres fois,
je m'essaie au noeud de cravate.
Vous êtes tellement drôle !
Drôle ?
Et mon interprétation de <i>Sling Blade</i> ?
J'ai pas dit que c'était nul.
Juste un peu médiocre.
Vous l'imitez mal.
Gary, je suis un grand fan
de votre émission.
Je ne sais pas comment vous faites.
La radio est votre royaume.
Comme l'océan est le mien.
Vous devez avoir raison.
Mais j'ai pissé dans votre royaume.
Louise a vu Tom
monter dans une voiture aujourd'hui,
avec des malabars plus âgés.
Ils le raccompagnent, peut-être.
Non !
Elle les avait jamais vus avant.
Calme-toi.
J'aurai le fin mot de l'histoire.
Il reste un moyen de découvrir
ce qu'il fabrique.
Ça urge.
Mon instinct maternel
me souffle qu'il a des ennuis.
C'est quoi, cet instinct maternel ?
Une sensation.
Un peu comme en ont les médiums.
Je connaîtrai jamais cette sensation,
je suis pas une sale menteuse, moi !
Je faisais rien de mal.
Je regardais un porno.
Tu lis ses e-mails !
J'avais pas le choix.
Mon fils a des ennuis.
C'est aussi le mien,
mais je m'abaisserai pas si bas.
Quid du câble de 100 m
relié à la parabole de nos voisins,
juste pour regarder la boxe ?
Les ondes sont publiques !
Depuis quand tu fais ça ?
Peu importe.
Cinq semaines.
Regarde.
Y a un tas de gosses
qu'on ne connaît pas.
Ils utilisent des mots de gangs.
Tu veux savoir ou pas ?
Pas comme ça.
Tu vas faire la planque dans ton van
devant l'école ?
Tu me prends pour un imbécile ?
Regarde celui-là.
Kingrath20.
C'est un des nouveaux potes.
"T-Bone,
on se retrouve sur place à 7 h 30."
Tom lui a répondu :
"Impossible.
Contrôle d'anglais."
Et Kingrath dit :
"Tu iras aux rattrapages.
Tu peux pas manquer ça."
Je suis inquiète.
Moi aussi.
Pourquoi tu le fais parler comme ça ?
En plus, il a pas dit
qu'il sécherait l'école.
Je faisais pire à son âge.
Je n'allais en cours
que les jours de match,
parce qu'il y avait une pom-pom girl
sans sous-vêtements.
Ouais, j'étais pas un ange.
Curieux qu'il veuille pas
me dire ce qui se passe.
Mon père s'en fichait.
Il disait : "Super, continue.
"On a de la visite.
Change l'eau du bong."
Tommy ne m'aime plus ?
Il tient plus à la relation père-fils ?
Regarde.
Ce soir, il projette d'emmener ses potes
à San Diego avec ton van.
- Tes clés.
- T'inquiète, il les trouvera jamais.
Dans le van, sous le tapis de sol ?
Sous le tapis !
Encore mieux.
- Il est pas là.
- Monte.
J'ai un super plan.
Monte dans le van.
Et baisse-toi au maximum.
Plus bas.
Dès qu'il arrive, on lui fait peur.
Il nous fera plus jamais un coup pareil.
Je sais pas ce que tu imagines...
Je sais que vous lisiez mes e-mails.
C'est comme ça que je sais, pour le van.
Bon, tu nous as eus.
Tu n'allais pas à San Diego ?
Non, je voulais que vous arrêtiez
de m'espionner.
Comment peux-tu être si sournois ?
Enfin, encore plus que nous.
Vous l'êtes pas tant que ça.
Maman ouvre mes messages,
elle a accepté l'invitation d'Amanda
au bal de promo pour moi.
Vous iriez bien ensemble.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Tu ne me parles plus.
Tu as de nouveaux amis.
Je fais rien.
Pourquoi violer mon intimité ?
Tant que tu vis ici,
c'est pas la tienne, mais la mienne.
C'est pas très clair.
Mais je suis très frustré, là.
Sois juste franc avec nous,
on peut sans doute discuter.
Je ne veux pas.
Alors, tu es puni.
Tu nous laisses pas le choix.
On t'emmènera à l'école
et on viendra te chercher.
Tu feras tes devoirs devant ta mère
ou avec moi à la station de radio.
Ça craint ! J'ai rien fait de mal !
Vous me faites pas confiance !
J'ai été jeune,
je sais ce que c'est.
Je veux pas que tu deviennes
comme ta mère !
Elle s'attirait des ennuis aux matchs
par son excès d'enthousiasme.
Normal !
Notre équipe était menée 0 à 8.
Je devais les motiver.
Ça a marché ?
Il y a eu 0 à 10,
mais ils étaient tous très heureux.
Tu as bien fait pour Tom.
La main dans le pot de confiture,
on confisque la confiture.
Comme avec Charlene.
Désolé, Charlene te trompait ?
Non, elle bouffait
trop de confiture.
J'aime les filles girondes,
mais j'ai que deux mains.
On doit interviewer Laird Hamilton
dans cinq minutes.
C'est quoi, le truc avec ce mec ?
On a pas besoin de lui pour l'émission.
Hier, on a débattu sur les noms
les plus loufoques dans le sport.
Tu as gagné avec Ron Tampax.
Mais ce matin,
je me suis souvenu du joueur,
Lucious Petit-kiki.
Prêt, vieux ?
Installe Laird en cabine.
Je dois revoir les détails
avec Gary.
Qui a le nom le plus loufoque,
dans le monde du surf ?
Probablement Néné Kaluhiokalani.
Lui ou...
Paul Scrotum.
Top, celui-là.
Bon, tu peux parler surf
et des autres trucs super
qu'il a faits.
Mais l'important, c'est l'événement.
Et son côté sexy ?
Tu as bien une liste de ses atouts.
File-la-moi.
Avec lui,
tu glousses comme une lycéenne.
Je glousse comme une lycéenne ?
Dans ton émission d'hier,
vous avez gloussé
sur les noms des baseballeurs.
J'ai dit à Curtis
que le nom se prononçait "Blaise".
C'est pas de ma faute
s'il l'a mal prononcé.
Je me vois bien expliquer ça
aux sponsors de ton émission.
Je soigne Laird.
Il a fait un gros don pour l'occasion.
Et pas parce qu'il est beau ?
Oui, il est craquant.
Tu vois, tu l'as dit.
T'es tombée dans le piège.
- C'est quoi, ton problème ?
- Je vais te le dire.
Tu n'agis pas en professionnelle.
Et tu es supposée agir en tant que...
Bonté Divine !
Je suis Gaby. Laird est là ?
J'assiste à son interview.
Salut, Gary.
Je suis Gabby.
Je vous conduis au studio.
Une boisson ? Un sandwich ?
Ou une orange
qu'on se passerait
juste avec nos cous.
Je crois que ça ira.
Je vais juste rejoindre mon mari.
En plus, votre cou m'arrive à peine
à la poitrine.
Alors, j'ai besoin de rien.
Pas de problème.
Vous écoutez <i>Le Score</i>.
Notre invité est Laird Hamilton.
Le célèbre surfer
et protecteur de l'environnement.
Aloha, Gary.
On a pigé, Laird,
que vous veniez d'Hawaï.
Parlons d'abord
de choses sérieuses...
Du projet "Sauvons la baie".
Comme vous le savez,
les eaux du sud de la Californie
sont menacées de pollution.
Et quelle pollution !
On s'implique
dans le nettoyage des plages,
l'information
et l'établissement de règles strictes
pour l'environnement.
Ça a l'air impressionnant.
Gabby s'implique aussi.
Pour vous qui écoutez,
Gabrielle Reece,
c'est une beach volleyeuse pro.
C'est aussi une super maman,
une merveilleuse actrice...
- Un mannequin magnifique...
- Et ma femme.
Laird, lâchez la bride,
détendez-vous.
Puisque vous êtes là,
parlez-nous de l'événement.
Avec plaisir, c'est tellement important.
On espère beaucoup de monde.
Retrouvez-nous à Santa Monica,
ce week-end...
Vous avez l'info.
Gabby et moi
serons à Santa Monica demain.
Tout comme moi.
Bon sang !
Vous pouvez lâcher du lest ?
Vous écoutez <i>Le Score</i>
On revient très vite,
avec mon invitée, Gabrielle Reece.
Et moi.
On n'est plus à l'antenne.
Raté.
Très cool, Scrotum...
Tu dragues la femme d'un mec
qui grimpe des dunes
avec un longboard.
Je peux le battre,
s'il traîne son longboard.
C'est quoi, cet entraînement ?
Il a pas les moyens
de s'inscrire dans un club ?
Tom est là.
Avec ces pectoraux,
Laird peut prendre le longboard
et enfoncer Gary dans le sol,
comme un clou.
J'ai pas le droit d'apprécier
la beauté d'un autre corps humain ?
Voilà ton prisonnier.
J'emmène Louise à la danse.
Il est à toi.
- Il a parlé ?
- Que dalle.
Fais tes devoirs.
Pas de baby-foot.
Ni de bouton péteur sur l'ordi.
Cela dit, pendant l'émission,
j'appuie pas dessus.
Ce serait moins dur,
si tu soulageais ta conscience.
Il veut être puni, qu'il soit puni.
Ça va ?
Ça va, Laird ?
Qu'est-ce que tu... vous...
T'es pas venu à Malibu, ce matin.
Ça va ?
Je sais pas de quoi vous parlez.
Qui est cet homme ?
Comment vous connaissez mon fils ?
Aloha. Je suis Laird.
Malibu.
Tu surfais avant les cours ?
D'où tes retards.
Pourquoi tu m'as rien dit ?
Tu as découvert mon secret ?
Content ?
Je surfais avec Hamilton.
Génial, c'est super !
Pourquoi t'as rien dit ?
J'aurais pu aider.
Je sais pas.
Je voulais que tu me vois au top.
Tu m'aurais vu déchirer la vague,
puis on aurait surfé ensemble.
Chéri, c'est tellement adorable.
J'ai mentionné
que j'étais pom-pom girl au lycée ?
On vient de se rencontrer.
Eh bien, je l'étais.
Pour être franc, je me sens minable.
Mon plan était stupide.
Que tu sois un bon ou mauvais surfeur,
ton père serait fier de toi.
L'un ou l'autre.
Mais il est bon, non ?
Carrément.
Fais ton truc, entraîne-toi,
c'est la voie de la perfection.
Quand tu seras prêt,
on surfera ensemble.
Mais plus de retard à l'école,
plus d'école buissionnière.
Et plus de mensonges.
Pigé ?
Pigé.
Mais vous lisez plus mes e-mails.
On ne lira plus tes e-mails.
Tommy !
T'étais passé où ?
C'est bon de te revoir.
Tu surfes mieux que moi,
Laird Hamilton,
mais on dirait que t'as du mal
à finir le sandwich.
Tu tiens plus le rythme ?
Je fais juste une pause.
Tu disais déjà ça,
y a quelques minutes.
T'as même pas commencé
ton paquet de chips.
Tu sais ce qu'il y a dans le mien ?
D'autres paquets, mais vides.
- Je me sens nauséeux.
- Abandonne.
Il te suffit de dire
que je suis plus fort que toi.
Ça va.
Super.
Passons au sandwich poulet XXL.
Mais sache-le, quoi qu'il se passe,
Gabby rentre avec moi, ce soir.
<i>Name the 13th president
of the United States.</i>
- Lincoln.
- Fillmore.
<i>Fillmore is correct.</i>
<i>Name the largest city
in Nebraska.</i>
Lincoln!
<i>- Omaha.
- Omaha is correct!</i>
<i>A favorite childhood toy
blank logs.</i>
Legos!
<i>- Lincoln!
- Correct!</i>
Hey, Gary.
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
We went
to the dentist,
and he thinks that Louise is
gonna need braces at some point.
Braces? You just accepted
the guy's first offer?
You didn't haggle?
Maybe a retainer?
Some scotch tape
and rubber bands? That's...
Gary, Gary,
he's a dentist, ok?
He's not that guy in Tijuana
who sold you the bullwhip, ok?
I bet that guy
still cries to his friends
about the bath he took
on that deal, huh?
Whatever.
Honey, could you go
- start your homework, please?
- Yes. - All right.
And is Tom home?
We need to talk to him.
Yeah, he's in the kitchen.
Why? What's up?
He got another
tardy notice at school.
Another... oh. All right.
How do you want
to handle this?
You want to play
good cop/annoying mom cop?
Which one
do you want to be?
Uh, how about I play
the one with the 24-inch waist?
What's going on?
What's going on is,
you got your sixth tardy slip
in the last 3 weeks.
You leave for school on time.
Could you please explain to us
what happens between that time
and the time you actually
show up to class?
Well, we've been assigned
some really great books in english,
and I read on the bleachers
before school. I mean...
Huckleberry Finn,
The Grapes of Wrath...
I guess I just get lost in their
stories and lose track of time.
All right. All right.
I'm glad you're reading
before school, Tommy.
That's cool.
But you can't be late.
All right?
So get it together.
I will.
- He's lying!
- I know! I know! Right?
Like he's been reading?
"Oh, oh, oh!
I'm reading."
Shh!
All right, look.
First of all, I know he's never
even opened Huckleberry Finn,
'cause there's dust around it from
when he first set it down on his desk.
Second of all,
Grapes of Wrath?
That's not even a real book.
I'm supposed to believe there's
a bunch of vengeful grapes
just stomping around
the countryside?
Gary, uh,
The Grapes of Wrath
was written by John Steinbeck.
Do you remember?
Back in high school, you used
to wedge it in the car stereo
to keep it
from rattling?
- Remember? Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. I do remember.
But it was your fault
the car stereo was rattling,
'cause you wore those high-heeled
boots when we were doing it.
Gary, it was
40 degrees outside.
I wasn't gonna
take off my boots.
Besides you got to keep
your long Johns on,
'cause they had
a flap in the front.
Anyway, what are we
gonna do about Tom?
I don't know.
Every time I talk to him,
he gives me some
one-word answer like:
"Yeah." "No." "So?"
Well, you think
we should be worried?
Maybe.
Look, Gary, I just get the
feeling he's hanging out
with some troublemakers
at school, and I don't know.
You know, call it
mother's intuition,
but something's
going on with him.
Well, I'll find out
if there is,
'cause I'm his father, and I
know my son tter than anybody.
- So, don't worry about it, ok?
- Gary, there's no harm
in ating that I might know
Tom a little better than you.
Uh, I'm his father.
Nobody knows Tommy
- more than I know Tommy.
- Really? Ok.
Uh, who's his
best frid?
- Conner.
- Wrong. Brian.
What's his
favorite food?
- Pizza.
- Wrong. French fries.
Uh, let's see. Who's
his favorite teacher?
- Lincoln.
- What?

It's a slow go
on the freeways today.
We got delays on the
110, the 101, and the 605.
And hey, if you were the guy
today in the red pickup truck
that cut me off and said
that thing about my mother,
yeah, I'm gonna mention
that to your sister
when she's leaving my bedroom
tomorrow morning. Ok, pal?
That's traffic.
"The Score" will be back
right after this.
Hey, Curtis, do we really
have to do the traffic report
on the 3s? Why can't
we do it on the 5s?
That's easier
to remember for me.
Well, you know, we tried to get the
5s. We tried to get the 1s, the 7s.
They were all taken. So, it
was either this or the 9s.
But at that point, you may as
well just wait for the 1s again.
Hey, are you ok, man? You've
been irritable all morning.
Well, first of all,
I got stuck in traffic.
Then I sat in my van
and watched Tom's school
after he got dropped off
at the carpool.
You sat in front of a school
in a windowless cargo van?
Let me know
when your "dateline" airs.
It's not like that.
It's just, uh,
Tom's been really late
to school lately.
And, well, Allison's
mother's intuition...
She says it's 'cause he's
hanging around a bunch of punks.
I'm gonna tell you, a mother's
intuition is a powerful thing.
When I was 15, I went
to New York city on this choir.
I mean, we're talking
3,000 miles away, right?
And after the performance was
over, I went to this party.
And I reached for a beer, right?
The phone rings, I pick it up,
and the only thing I hear
on the other end is,
"mm-mmm".
Gary, it was a pay phone.
That's amazing.
It's just, uh, I don't know.
I thought Tommy and I were closer
than me and my dad were.
My dad didn't come to
my high-school graduation
'cause he was freeing
a monkey from a laboratory.
Well, that's noble.
You know what's not noble?
Bringing the monkey home,
giving him my bike.
So, you stake out
Tom's school?
That's no way
to get close to him.
I don't know. What else
am I supposed to do?
- You got to read his emails, man.
- What?
The only way that you can compete
with her mother's intuition
is by stepping in the
21st century, my man.
I can't read Tom's emails. It's
a total invasion of his privacy.
Let me tell you about my
nephew Dwayne, all right?
Straight "a" student, and
then one day out of the blue,
his grades start falling. Now,
I asked him to talk about it.
He didn't want to talk about
it. So, I read his emails.
And it turns out, he was
involved in a bad crowd.
Like druggies?
No, it was an improv troupe. That
was their name... "a bad crowd."
Hi, Gary.
Hi, Sasha.
- I had a really good time
the other night. - Yeah.
I had a really good time
the other night, too.
Excuse me.
Oh, my gosh! Yes!
You're Laird Hamilton.
I'm Gary Brooks.
- Aloha, Gary.
- Aloha yourself, mister.
You've been such a huge
influence on my surfing.
This guy has surfed waves that
have gone on to destroy villages.
- He's gonna do our show tomorrow.
- Oh, hey.
Hi, I'm Curtis Taylor.
Not a big swimmer.
- Hi, Laird!
- Oh, hi, Sasha.
Good to see you again.
Hey, why don't we all
go into my office
and talk about
what we're gonna do?
- I got a hug!
- I got an aloha.
So, as you know,
I am one of the organizers
of this big
"save the bay" event.
And if it's cool
with you,
we'd like you to go
on Gary's show tomorrow
and talk about the
beach cleanup coming up.
Well, it's totally cool with me, anything
I can do to help bring awareness.
What a generous spirit.
And it's tall.
It's a tall, blond...
- Very tan spirit.
- Uh, Sasha?
You know, I don't want
to toot my own horn, Laird,
but I shred it pretty hard
over at sunset beach.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
I teach
a kiddie class there.
I like it 'cause
the bathroom's close by.
Hey, Laird!
When we were researching
for this event,
I saw this video of you coming
down the face of a 75-foot wave.
I... I literally
got the chills.
You know, I need to scare myself at
least once a day just to feel alive.
I mean, some days, I ride
a 30-foot barrel, or...
Sometimes, it's just
trying to tie my tie.
That is so funny.
Wait. That's funny,
but my sling blade
impression is dated?
Oh, no, no. I didn't say
it was dated.
I just said it was
an easy impression.
No, you guys aren't
doing it right.
You know, Gary, I'm a huge
fan of your show.
I mean, I don't know
how you do it.
The radio is like
your kingdom...
Kind of like the way
the ocean is my kingdom.
Yeah. I guess
you're right.
Except, I've peed
in your kingdom.
Hello?
Gary, it's me.
Listen, Louise says
she saw Tom
get into a car today
with some rough-looking
older boys after school.
All right. Well, maybe he's
just getting a ride home,
- you know?
- No, no, Gary.
She says she's never
seen these guys before.
All right, calm down.
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.
I only know of one way to
figure out what he's doing.
Well, we better do something,
because my mother's intuition
is telling me
he's in trouble.
What's it likeo have
mother's intuition?
Well, it's sort of like
a feeling...
You know, probably a lot like
what psychics feel.
Wow. You know, I'll never
know what that feeling's like,
'cause I'm not
full of crap!
Oh! Gary.
Gary, what...
Look, I'm not doing anything.
I was...
I was looking at porn.
You know?
You're reading
his emails!
Well, I had no choice, Gary. I mean,
something is happening to my boy.
He's my boy, too. But I
would never stoop this low.
Oh, really, gary? Then why
was there a 300-foot cable
running from our neighbor's
satellite dish to our tv
for the mayweather-hatton fight?
Nobody owns
the airwaves, Allison!
How long have you
been doing this?
It doesn't matter!
5 weeks, Gary.
Look, look, look. There's a
whole bunch of kids on here
we have never even heard of.
They're using terms
that sound like
they're gang-related.
Do you want to know
what your son's doing or not?
No, not like this. No.
So, what are you gonna do? Just
stake out his school in a van?
- What kind of moron do
you think I am? - Well...
Look, Gary, come here.
Look at this one.
Look, kingrath20...
He's one of the new guys.
"Hey, T-Bone, we're
meeting at the spot at 7:30."
and then Tom replies,
"I can't do it.
English quiz first thing."
And then kingrat says,
"Blow it off. You'll take a makeup.
You don't want to miss this."
Ok, I'm really worried.
I'm worried, too.
Why do you make
Tommy sound like this?
Secondly, he didn't say he
was gonna ditch school.
That's a heck of a lot better
than what I did at his age.
The only time I ever went to
school was for pep rallies,
'cause there was that one
cheerleader that never wore underwear.
Yeah, I was no angel.
It's so weird.
He won tell me
what's going on.
I mean, I never told my dad
stuff, 'cause he didn't care.
He would just say things like,
"that's great, son.Going on.
We got company coming over. Why
don't you change the bong water?"
You think Tommy's, like,
not into my anymore?
Like, he's just over the whole
father-son thing, or what?
Oh, my God. Wait,
look at this. Look.
He's planning on
taking your van
and driving his buddies
down to San Diego tonight.
- Where are your keys?
- Don't worry.
They're in a place where
he will never find them.
Uh, in your van,
under the floor mats?
Under the floor mats!
That's even better.
Gary, he's not here.
- Get in the van. I'll explain it.
- What?
I have a good plan.
Get in the van.
And when you get in the seat, I
want you to scooch down really low.
Crouch down low.
And then when he opens
the door, we scare him.
He'll never pull
a stunt like that again.
That's good.
Hello!
Hey.
Look, Tom, I don't know what
you thought we were doing...
I know what you were doing.
You were reading my emails.
How do you think I know
you'd go to the van?
Ok. So, you caught us.
So, what, you weren't gonna
drive down to San Diego?
No. I just wanted you
to stop spying on me.
How could you be so sneaky?
I mean, you know,
sneakier than we were?
Ok, you guys aren't
that sneaky. All right?
Mom keeps forgetting to click
"marked as unread,"
and she responded "yes" for me
when Amanda asked me to junior prom.
I just think
she's so right for you.
Tom, look.
What the heck's going on, man?
You're not telling me anything.
You got all these new
friends all of a sudden.
I'm not doing anything.
Why are you invading my privacy?
Hey, as long as you're living in
my house, it's not your privacy.
It's my privacy.
I know that doesn't make a lot of
sense, but I'm very frustrated right now.
Ok, look. Honey,
if you're just
honest with us,
maybe it's something
we could talk about it.
I don't want
to talk about it.
Then you're grounded. What
do you think about that?
You leave us no choice. We're
gonna drive you to school every day,
and we're gonna
pick you up every day.
You're gonna do your homework
sitting in front of your mom,
or you're gonna come
to the radio station
with me and do your
homework there. That's it.
This sucks, ok? I've done nothing
wrong, and I'm always good.
Why can't
you guys just trust me?
Because I was a young man
once, and I know what it's like.
And I don't want you growing up to
be just like your mother. All right?
She was always
getting in trouble
for showing a little too
much spirit at pep rallies.
Would you let that go?
Our football team was 0-8.
I had to give them
something to root for.
How did they finish?
Uh, 0-10 but very happy.
You made the right
choice for Tom, ok?
If someone's caught with
their hand in the cookie jar,
you gotta take
the cookie jar away, ok?
That's what I found out
with Charlene.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Was Charlene cheating on you?
No, man. She was just
eating a ton of cookies.
I mean, I'm all for a big girl,
but damn, I only got 2 hands.
You know. Oh!
We gotta get out of here. We got this
interview in 5 minutes with Laird Hamilton.
I don't see what the big
deal is with that guy.
We could do better
radio without him.
What about yesterday?
We had that whole debate
about the wackiest
name in sports.
And I thought you had me
with Ron Tugnutt.
Right?
Until this morning
on my drive in,
I remembered eastern Illinois
linebacker Lucious Pusey.
You ready to
do this, man?
Ok. Curtis, get Laird
set up in the booth.
I want to go over a
couple things with Gary.
Oh, let me ask you a question. Who's
got the funniest name in surfing?
Probably
Buttons Kaluhiokalani.
Either him or...
Paul Danglebag.
I call that one.
Ok. So, you can talk
about surfing
and all the other cool
things Laird has done.
But really focus
on the charity event.
Ok, what about
how dreamy he is?
I mean, I'm sure you have a
list of how dreamy Laird is.
- You have one of those
for me, right? - Excuse me?
I've seen the way
you've been looking at him.
You've been giggling
like a school girl.
- I'm giggling like
a school girl? - Yeah.
A half-hour of
your show yesterday
was you and Curtis giggling over
that old baseball player's name.
Ok. I told Curtis the man's
name was pronounced "Koontz".
Ok? It's not my fault
Curtis said it wrong.
Yes. I will explain that to
the good people at Pampers
who will no longer
sponsor your show.
And yes, I am giving Laird
a lot of attention.
He's writing a huge check
for this event.
Really? Not because
he's so handsome?
Hey, it's not my fault
he's gorgeous.
Ah! I didn't say gorgeous.
You said gorgeous.
- You fell into my trap.
- What is wrong with you?
I'll tell you
what's wrong with me.
You're acting completely unprofessional.
This is a place of business.
And you're supposed
to act like a...
Oh, my gosh!
- Hi.
- How are you?
Hey, I'm Gabby.
Is Laird around?
He said I could sit down
in the interview today.
Hi, Gary.
I'm Gabby.
Hi. Why don't you come
with me in the studio?
Could I get you a drink
or a sandwich or something?
Maybe we could take an orange
and... Just pass it back and forth
- using only our necks?
- Uh, you know,
I'm good. I think I just
have to go see my husband.
Plus, from what I can
see, I think your neck
only sort of reaches
my chest. So, I'm ok.
I'm ok with that.
Welcome to "The Score"
with Gary Brooks.
We're here with Laird Hamilton,
renowned big-wave surfer
- and environmental activist.
- Aloha, Gary!
Ok, Laird, we get it.
You're from Hawaii. Ok?
Laird, let's take care of
business first. Let's...
Let's talk about
"save the bay."
Well, as you know, southern
California's coastal waters
are susceptible
to a lot of pollutants.
Pollutants. Totally.
So, we're involved with
everything from hands-on cleanup
to education to lobbying for
tougher environmental standards.
Oh, God!
I know this seems
very impressive.
- Gabby's also involved.
- Oh, yes.
For those at home, Gabby is
professional beach volleyball player
Gabrielle reece. She's also
an incredible mom,
a fantastic actress,
a beautiful model...
And... and my wife.
Laird, loosen the reins,
man. Chill out.
Hey, Gabby, since you're sitting
here, why don't you tell everybody
- about the event, ok?
- Oh, absolutely.
You know, this is
such a great event.
We really that
many people can come out
And join us
in Santa Monica.
This weekend...
All right.
Well, there you have it.
Gabby and I will be down
at Santa Monica tomorrow...
- I'll be there, too.
- Laird, my gosh!
Would you just
loosen up a little bit?
This is "The Score" with Gary
Brooks, and I'll be right back
with my special guest
Gabrielle Reece.
And Laird Hamilton.
Yeah, we're off the air,
pal. Nice try.
Very smooth, danglebag.
You're ogling the wife of a guy
who trains by running up sand dunes
with a log chained to
his waist.
Oh, I can take that guy,
assuming he's still
chained to a log
running up a sand dune.
Why is he training
like that, anyway?
Seems like somebody can't afford
a membership to the "y."
Allison's
here with Tom.
Well, with those pecs,
I mean, Laird could probably
just pick up that log
and just pound Gary
into the ground like a nail.
What? I can't appreciate another
man's beautiful, sculpted body?
Well, here's
your fugitive.
I gotta take Louise to dance
class, so he's all yours.
- Has he talked?
- Not a peep.
All right. Well, just sit
there and do your homework.
No foosball,
no vending machines,
and no pushing the "fart"
button on my computer in there.
Although a lot of times
during the show,
I'm not really even
pushing the "fart" button.
Oh, God.
Honey, you could make this a
heck of a lot easier on yourself
if you just tell us
what you're up to.
- No.
- No.
All right. If he wants
to be grounded,
then just let Tommy
be grounded.
Tommy! How you doin'?
Hey, Laird, what's up?
What are you... ahem.
Hey, you weren't in Malibu
this morning. Are you all right?
I don't know what
you're talking about, sir.
Who is this man?
What is he...
I'm sorry. How do
you know my son?
And hello.
Aloha. I'm Laird.
Hi.
Hey. Malibu... you've been
surfing before school?
That's why you're late all the
time? Why didn't you tell me?!
Yeah, ok. You found out my
horrible secret. Are you happy?
I've been surfing before
school with Laird Hamilton.
Yeah, I'm thrilled!
I think that's awesome!
Why didn't you tell me? I could have
been out there helping you out. You know?
I don't know
how to explain it.
I just didn't want you to see
me until I was really good, ok?
I just... I guess the thought
of you seeing me shredding it,
and then you'd come out there,
and we could surf together, just...
Oh. Honey,
that is so sweet.
Did I mention I was a
cheerleader in high school?
We just met.
Well, I was.
Tom, I gotta be honest with
you. I feel like a complete jerk.
That's ok. It was
probably a stupid plan.
Oh, honey, your dad
would be proud of you
if you were a good surfer or not.
Yeah, whether you're a good surfer
or not. He's getting good, though,
- Right?
- Oh, totally.
All right. Hey, look,
do your thing.
Keep going out there, getting
better. Practice makes perfect.
And when you're ready for me,
I'll go out, we'll shred together.
But no more tardies. Ok?
No more skipping school.
And, you know, no more lying.
All right? You got that?
I got it. But hey, no
more reading my emails?
- All right.
- All right.
We will definitely not
read your email anymore.
Tommy? Oh, my gosh.
Where have you been?
Hey! How are you?
It's so good to see you
again. Oh, my goodness. Hey.
You may be a better surfer
than me, Laird Hamilton,
but it looks like you're
having a hard time
finishing up that
cold cut trio.
What's the matter, partner?
You slowing down?
- No, I'm just taking a break.
- Well,
That's what you said
18 inches ago, my man.
I happen to know that you haven't
even opened your chip bag yet.
You know what's inside my
chip bag, Laird Hamilton?
Other empty chip bags.
Oh, yeah!
Hey, I'm just getting
a little dizzy right now, ok?
You want to quit?
Just say,
"Gary Brooks, you're better
than me, Laird Hamilton.
- I quit."
- I'm fine.
Great. Let's move on
the the santa fe chicken
in the footlong size
right there.
Ok.
But just so you know, no
matter what happens right here,
Gabby's coming home with me.

C'était incroyable.
{\pos(192,220)}Désolé pour ton chemisier.
{\pos(192,220)}Les boutons m'agaçaient.
{\pos(192,220)}Pas grave.
T'en fais pas.
Ce n'était qu'un Prada.
Mais quelque chose m'a surprise.
C'est quoi, cette liste de noms de mecs
que tu n'as cessé de répéter ?
Ceux des joueurs
des Dodgers en 1988.
Ça m'aide.
Alors, tu as aimé ?
Tu rigoles ?
C'était au-delà de mes espérances.
Purée !
C'était excitant et sexy,
limite effrayant.
Désolée.
J'étais une bonne gymnaste.
Si j'avais de la magnésie,
je te ferais une démonstration.
Et maintenant ?
Je suis jamais sortie
avec quelqu'un du travail.
On y va ensemble demain ?
Non, on devrait séparer
travail et vie privée.
Pas les mélanger.
Alors, on dira rien à personne
au travail.
Je suis ta patronne,
et toi, mon employé.
T'es sexy quand tu dis ça.
On devrait recommencer.
J'ai pas de magnésie, mais du talc.

{\pub}Voilà le déjeuner.
KFC ?
{\pos(192,220)}Des ailes de poulet super épicées !
{\pos(192,220)}Fais gaffe, c'est très épicé.
{\pos(192,220)}J'en ai mangé une dans la voiture.
Je croyais sucer un chalumeau.
{\pos(192,220)}Laisse-moi essayer.
Ça doit pas être si épicé que ça.
Ça va, pas si épicé.
Brûlant, ce café !
C'est quoi ?
Un Bloody Mary.
Il doit bien être 17 h quelque part.
{\pos(192,230)}Ravie de te voir au travail.
{\pos(192,230)}Bonjour, Sasha.
Ravi de te voir.
{\pos(192,230)}- Tu es resplendissante.
- Merci.
{\pos(192,230)}Pas du tout.
{\pos(192,230)}- Vous couchez ensemble.
- Quoi ?
{\pos(192,215)}Pourquoi tu dis ça ?
{\pos(192,215)}Vous parlez en langage ancien.
Ravi de te voir.
{\pos(192,215)}Je suis captivé par tes charmes.
{\pos(192,215)}- Que Dieu te protège du choléra.
- D'accord.
{\pos(192,215)}Ne le répète pas.
C'est un secret.
{\pos(192,215)}On veut éviter les ragots.
{\pos(192,215)}Surtout de Hannah.
Elle se shoote aux ragots.
{\pos(192,215)}Elle se shoote plutôt à l'héroïne.
Il faut des assiettes.
{\pos(192,215)}Non, ma chérie, pas d'assiettes.
Ce sont des ailes de poulets épicées.
{\pos(192,215)}Il faut les manger direct dans le seau,
comme un homme.
{\pos(192,215)}Je vais les emporter dans mon bureau
et les manger comme une dame.
Avec un couteau et une fourchette ?
Non, je vais manger comme une cochonne
et faire honte à ma mère !
{\pos(192,215)}T'as bien choisi le moment
pour coucher avec elle.
- Quoi ?
- T'es pas au courant ?
On a reçu les audiences.
Elle parle de changements.
Allonger ou raccourcir des émissions.
Toi, t'es plus en danger.
Sasha est la patronne.
Je suis qu'un employé.
Elle contrôle tout, ici.
Elle va ajouter des émissions.
En supprimer.
C'est elle, la patronne.
Elle fera ce que bon lui semble.
Rien à voir avec le 10 que je lui ai mis
hier au cheval d'arçon.
Comment se passe le boulot
de mon petit chéri ?
Tu aimes bien ?
Je veux arrêter.
Je suis responsable des toilettes
et de la salade.
J'espère qu'ils ont une pancarte
<i>"Lava las manos</i>".
Je sais pas,
mais il y a un poème très triste.
Un gars qui avait le cœur brisé.
Il est venu...
Je connais ce poème.
C'est pas un boulot
très épanouissant,
mais tu dois apprendre à persévérer.
Facile à dire.
Tu commences le boulot de tes rêves.
Oui, travailler pour le doyen
de la fac de psycho...
Mais c'est pas tombé du ciel.
Ils avaient mon CV depuis un an,
quand ils m'ont appelée.
Et avant ça,
j'ai eu pas mal de boulots humiliants.
J'ai été serveuse,
barmaid
et mariée à ton père pendant 15 ans.
Ça, c'est pas un boulot.
Maintenant, si.
Voilà ton père.
Va chercher tes bouquins.
Comment vas-tu ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as ?
- Comment ça ?
- T'es de bonne humeur.
Tu rougis.
Ils font un remake de <i>Porky's</i> ou...
T'as couché.
C'est vrai.
Sasha et moi, on a fait l'amour.
C'est vrai pour <i>Porky's</i> ?
T'as lu ça où ?
Tu crois pas
que le sexe va affecter votre travail ?
On a décidé
de rester professionnels.
Et j'ai lu un article intéressant
dans <i>The New Yorker</i>.
Les relations au boulot
sont de plus en plus fréquentes.
<i>A</i>) C'est faux.
<i>B</i>) Tu t'es endormi
pendant un match des Lakers
et tu t'es réveillé
devant un talk-show.
Le sexe change tout.
On peut plus rester neutre.
Pense à notre première fois.
Ça a rien changé.
Ça n'a fait que confirmer
que tu étais une chaudasse.
Tout le monde le savait.
C'est quelque chose qui se sait.
Sujet suivant.
Comme notre famille KPPQ s'agrandit,
on manque de places dans le parking.
Y a des volontaires
pour se garer en face ?
Ça me gêne pas.
Y a pas de raison
que j'aie une place réservée.
Merci, Gary, d'être un bon collègue.
Je fais
ce que tout bon collègue ferait.
Et dernier point à l'ordre du jour.
C'est un peu dur.
L'émission de Sue, la mère aux chats,
<i>Pattes dramatiques</i>,
durera deux heures au lieu d'une.
Cette émission jouit
d'une audience inexplicablement élevée.
Ah oui ?
Une heure lui suffit pas
pour ses stupides jeux de mots félins ?
Chalut !
J'espère que cha va bien.
Ceci aura une conséquence
sur la durée de l'émission précédente.
On réduira <i>Le score</i> de Gary Brooks
à une heure.
- Quoi ?
- Je suis désolée.
Les audiences font la loi.
- J'ai une bonne audience.
- C'est vrai.
Mais tu cherches encore ton public.
Et comment je le trouve
en réduisant la durée ?
Rien de personnel.
Comment ça ?
On couche ensemble.
Allez, qui parmi vous
n'était pas au courant ?
Au temps pour moi.
Professeur Drakely,
je croyais qu'avec ce travail,
je pensais mettre en pratique
mes talents de psychologue.
Au lieu de faire vos courses.
J'ai fini major à la fac.
La blanchisserie Fong à Santa Monica,
c'est ça ?
D'accord, prêt à 15 h.
En fait, oui.
Je concasse vos cachets de Viagra,
en ce moment.
Salut, mon cœur.
Alors, ta journée ?
Toujours envie d'arrêter ?
Tu avais raison.
Je m'amuse bien.
Un gamin a perdu son appareil dentaire
quand il a vidé son plateau.
Et je l'ai récupéré.
Mon patron a dit que j'étais un héros,
puis j'ai fait une blague.
Quatre personnes ont ri.
C'était cool.
C'est super, mon chéri.
Tu dois être fier de toi.
J'aime faire partie
de la famille de Moe le crado.
On l'appelle comme ça.
Et toi, ton travail ?
Aujourd'hui, j'ai travaillé
sur un dossier très intéressant.
Un narcissique qui se sent obligé
de dominer les femmes.
Sans doute, la conséquence
d'une homosexualité refoulée.
Et tu l'as aidé ?
Oui, mais si mon aide
dure plus de quatre heures,
il doit consulter un médecin.
Tu fais quoi ?
Je prépare mon émission de demain.
{\pos(192,285)}T'as pas envie
de faire autre chose ?
Pas trop.
Je suis pas d'humeur.
Comment ça ?
T'en as toujours envie.
Tu as commencé à me chauffer
devant <i>Intervention</i>, l'autre soir.
{\pos(192,285)}J'ai pas pu voir
si Janine avait arrêté la drogue.
Non, et son père s'est même suicidé.
J'étais d'humeur à ce moment-là.
Pas ce soir, désolé.
- Ça a un rapport avec aujourd'hui ?
- Bien sûr que non.
J'ai du boulot.
Mon émission ne dure qu'une heure,
donc je dois faire des choix.
Bonne, cette blague.
Je la vire.
Un classique
dont personne profitera.
Je suis désolé,
C'est une décision professionnelle.
Ta petite amie le regrette,
mais ta patronne n'avait pas le choix.
Tu aurais pu raccourcir
n'importe quelle autre émission.
Mais tu as choisi la mienne.
Pourquoi pas celle du vieux
qui parle casseroles ?
Bob L'ancêtre ?
Il ramène plein de pubs
pour les couches pour adultes.
On dépend tous de lui.
Gary, je comprends pas.
{\pos(192,285)}C'est toi qui as voulu ne pas mélanger
vie privée et vie professionnelle.
{\pos(192,280)}Là, tu mélanges.
Évidemment.
Je hais tellement ma patronne
que je jouerai pas
avec les seins de ma copine.
{\pos(192,280)}Tu devrais avoir un traitement de faveur
à cause de notre relation ?
Ouais, ce serait top.
C'est pas possible.
Je vois pas comment faire.
J'ai peur de gâcher notre relation
à cause de notre travail.
Je vais devoir faire un choix.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je ferai un choix.
C'est très romantique.
Mais abandonne pas ton travail
à cause de moi.
De quoi tu parles ?
Tu me choisis, pas vrai ?
Si c'est la patronne qui parle, oui.
Je crois que je vais rentrer.
Qu'est-ce que tu croyais ?
C'est le boulot de mes rêves.
Je n'attends rien de toi.
J'espère juste
que tu ne regretteras pas ta décision.
Tu vas me virer ?
Non, mes sentiments
dicteraient mes décisions.
Et je suis professionnelle.
On se voit demain, au travail.
Tenue décontractée obligatoire.
{\pub}T'étais où ?
- On reprend dans une minute.
- Désolé.
{\pos(192,220)}Sasha a fait venir
une chiropraticienne.
{\pos(192,220)}Elle m'a fait un ajustement
appelé flexion-distraction.
{\pos(192,220)}Au départ, j'étais assez réticent.
Mais maintenant, je suis accro.
Au boulot !
- T'es à cran, aujourd'hui.
- Désolé.
On s'est disputés, avec Sasha.
J'ai dû choisir
entre elle et le boulot.
- T'as choisi le boulot ?
- Oui.
Tes dingue !
Faut toujours choisir la fille.
Tu te souviens de ce film
où Richard Gere revient
chercher Debra Winger
sous les applaudissements
des ouvriers ?
S'il était pas revenu,
ce serait pas <i>Officier et Gentleman</i>,
mais <i>Officier et Salaud</i>.
À toi.
Vous écoutez <i>Le score</i>
avec Gary Brooks.
On parle beaucoup de dynasties
au football.
Les Patriots, les Steelers.
Ne parlons pas d'eux.
Prenons par l'autre bout.
Parlons des dynasties de défaites.
Des losers.
Les Lions de Detroit,
on doit commencer par eux.
Y a aussi les Browns de Cleveland.
Aucune victoire à l'extérieur.
Ni à la mamelle... maison.
Tu fais quoi ?
Désolée,
j'ai dû laisser des documents.
Même les promus ont eu des victoires.
Comme les Jaguars de Jacksonville.
Les Titans du Tennesse.
Ils sont...
énormes et fermes.
On va faire une pause de dix secondes
pour raisons techniques.
On revient vite.
- À quoi tu joues ?
- Comment ça ?
Tu me fais un numéro super sexy.
On est au boulot,
donc ne dis pas que je suis sexy.
Mon stylo.
Tu es à l'antenne !
Un autre sujet !
On ramasse des stylos, ici.
Tu veux voir la chiropraticienne ?
Sors d'ici.
J'ai une émission à animer.
D'accord.
C'est à mon tour avec Rhonda.
Où j'en étais ?
Vous écoutez <i>Le score</i>.
Je suis Gary Brooks.
On a un appel de Glenn,
de Chula Vista.
Je t'écoute.
<i>J'ai une question.</i>
<i>Que devraient faire les Raiders
pour avoir une meilleure équipe ?</i>
Si vous, les fans,
êtes plus durs que votre équipe,
alors vous avez vraiment la trique.
<i>Je vous demande pardon ?</i>
Vous avez vraiment le truc.
Quel corps de rêve !
- <i>Vous parlez de Darren McFadden ?</i>
- Oui.
C'est de lui que je parle
et de sa souplesse.
J'ai besoin de toi.
- Viens ici.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Pourquoi t'es ici ?
Je croyais que c'était Tom.
Y a une fête surprise ?
J'ai oublié son anniversaire ?
J'ai oublié.
Il aime les olives ?
C'est pas ça.
Il doit pas savoir que j'ai démissionné.
Quand il rentrera,
il ira dans sa chambre.
Et je ferai
comme si je rentrais du boulot.
Il rentre pas avant une heure,
donc on peut sortir de là.
Une voiture !
Démissionné ?
J'en pouvais plus.
J'étais sa femme à tout faire.
Il m'a fait aller à l'épicerie,
à la blanchisserie.
Comme quand on était mariés,
sans les films de Steven Gutenberg.
Steven Gutenberg
est un trésor national.
J'ai élevé mes enfants.
Et je devrais repartir de zéro ?
Mais je veux apprendre à Tom une leçon,
donc je me cache ici comme une lâche.
Il te respecte
et comprendra ta décision.
- Salut, ma chérie.
- Salut, maman et papa.
Quoi de neuf ?
Je veux les crackers.
Tiens.
Vous devriez écouter la mère aux chats.
C'est trop bien.
Les coussinets des chats
sont insensibles au chaud et au froid.
C'est fascinant, en effet.
Je dois y aller.
Bob l'antique commence dans dix minutes.
- Sortons d'ici, c'est ridicule.
- D'accord.
Que me voulais-tu ?
Sasha essaie de me faire regretter
ma décision stupide.
Mais c'est elle qui a commencé
en raccourcissant mon émission.
- Une voiture !
- C'est le voisin !
Je fais quoi ?
Fais pareil.
Fais-lui regretter sa décision.
Qui peut faire culpabiliser quelqu'un
mieux que toi ?
Souviens-toi.
Robe blanche, fleurs à la main,
le prêtre me posant la question ultime.
Bon souvenir.
Mais quand le prêtre
a changé les vœux :
"Êtes-vous doublement, triplement sûre
de vouloir faire ça ?"
j'aurais dû me méfier !
C'est la faute de Curtis
qui m'a soûlé pour que je t'épouse !
Vous écoutez <i>Pattes dramatiques</i>.
Je suis Sue, la mère aux chats.
On a un appel de Carla, de Monrovia.
Elle est la maman
de deux chatons de six mois.
Je vous écoute.
<i>Quand je ramène Ginger
de chez le véto,</i>
<i>pourquoi M. Roboto hérisse ses poils
comme s'il la connaissait pas ?</i>
Elle déjeune encore ?
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Je vais détruire la mère aux chats.
Voilà la réponse.
M. Roboto ne l'a jamais vue.
Les chats ne se reconnaissent pas
par la vue.
Mais par l'odorat.
N'est-ce pas stupéfiant ?
<i>Si, c'est très intéressant.</i>
Merci de votre appel.
Un appel de Germain,
de Santa Monica.
Quel genre de papa êtes-vous ?
J'ai pas de chat,
mais j'ai une question sur les Lakers.
Ils joueront mieux avec Ron Artest
ou ils auraient dû garder Trevor Ariza ?
Je suis désolée,
vous vous trompez d'émission.
C'est pas <i>Le score</i>
avec Gary Brooks ?
L'émission ne durait pas 2 h ?
C'est une émission sur les chats ?
Je veux pas parler de chats,
mais de sport.
<i>Le score</i> a été raccourcie.
Quelle idée de la raccourcir
au profit d'une émission de chats !
Je vais quand même tenter
de répondre à votre question.
En effet,
Artest s'essouffle vite,
mais il marque 16 points
et 5 rebonds par match.
<i>Aux playoffs,</i>
il sera utile dans la raquette
face à Bateer, Nowitzski, Carmelo,
voire King James
si son équipe se qualifie.
C'est pas comme Ariza qui,
pour revenir à notre sujet,
joue comme un coq castré, un chapon.
Un chat-pon.
Tu fais quoi ?
Je sais pas.
Allons dans mon bureau.
Merci, j'aime votre émission, Sue.
Je suis désolé.
Tu as raccourci mon émission.
J'ai paniqué
et je m'en suis pris à Sue.
Elle en sait plus sur les Lakers
que Phil Jackson.
Tu n'avais pas de choix à faire.
Travailler ensemble
rend les choses difficiles,
mais je nous ai donné une chance.
Moi aussi, je faisais de mon mieux.
Puis j'ai pété un câble.
Désolé.
Moi aussi.
Je voulais te montrer ton erreur.
Donc, je me suis habillée sexy.
Je me suis fait super mal
avec ce grand écart.
Et si on recommençait ?
Je reformule.
J'aimerais beaucoup
nous redonner une chance.
Moi aussi.
Super.
Mais on devra trouver
un juste milieu
et établir des règles à respecter.
D'accord.
Bien, mais avant...
Ramasse des stylos.
{\pub}Alors, le boulot ?
Super, j'ai même eu une promotion.
Quand un client commande
un hogey spécial <i>de la dia</i>,
on l'appelle comme ça,
on sonne la cloche.
Je suis le responsable
du sonneur de cloche.
Et toi ?
À vrai dire, je dois te parler.
J'ai démissionné.
C'était pas ce que j'espérais
et j'ai pas réussi à tenir.
J'espère pas t'avoir déçu.
Dieu merci.
Ils m'ont viré.
Pourquoi, mon chéri ?
Un client a commandé
le hogey spécial <i>de la dia</i>...
Ils ont demandé
si on avait du ketchup.
Le ketchup, ça dénature le goût.
Tout le monde le sait !
J'ai refusé
de faire sonner la cloche.
Je suis désolée.
J'ai dû rendre mon casque,
la clé du placard à condiments.
On l'appelle comme ça.
Enfin, eux.
C'est pas grave.
L'important, c'est d'avoir essayé.
Ça n'ira qu'en s'améliorant.
On trouvera quelque chose
qui nous convient parfaitement.
Et si on vivait aux crochets de papa,
comme avant ?
Enfin, s'il est pas fauché.
Oh, my gosh.
That was incredible.
Hey, sorry about the buttons
on your blouse.
I just got a little
frustrated and ripped
them off.
That's all right.
Don't worry about it.
It was only...Prada.
But the one thing
that was confusing
Was what was that list of guys'
names you kept repeating?
That was the lineup for 1988
dodgers. It--it helps me.
So, did it live up
to all your expectations?
You kidding me? It lived up
to expectations I didn't
know that I had.
Holy smokes.
It was thrilling.
It was super hot.
At one point
it was really scary.
Sorry.
I was a trained gymnast.
If I could just get some
chalk on my hands I could
[knuckles crack]
really show you something.
Oh, my gosh. Wow.
So, what happens now?
I mean, I've never dated
anyone from work before.
Do we drive in together
tomorrow?
I don't think so.
I think we should probably
keep work work,
And this this.
Like, keep it separate.
Ok. So, when we're at work,
we don't tell anyone.
And I'm your boss.
And you're my employee.
When you say that
it sounds really hot.
Maybe we should do it again,
I don't have any chalk
But I could probably find
some baby powder.

Curtis: Lunch is here.
Kfc?
Mm-hmm.
New fiery grill wings, yo!
Be careful, man.
These things are hot.
I had one in the car,
felt like I was sucking
on a blowtorch.
Whoo!
Let me try one of these
bad boys right here.
Can't be that hot.
Yeah. That's not that hot.
Oh, my god!
Aah! That's hot coffee!
Aah!
What the hell is that?!
It's a bloody mary.
What?! It's 5:00 someplace!
Hey, curtis.
Hello, gary.
Brooks. Nice to see
you in the workplace.
Hello, sasha. Nice to see you.
You look very nice.
Why, thank you.
Oh, not at all.
You guys are doing it.
What?!
What gives you that idea?
Because you guys
are talking like you're
in victorian England.
[british accent]
uh, sasha, nice to see you.
I find myself captivated
by your charms.
I pray you don't
get cholera.
All right!
Just don't tell anybody, ok?
Just keep it a secret.
We don't want everyone
to start gossiping.
Especially hannah in ad sales.
You know, gossip--
That's like heroin
to that lady.
Actually, I think
that heroin is like
heroin to hannah.
Ok. I'm gonna get
some plates.
Oh, plates. No. Sweetheart,
these are fiery wings.
These are meant
to be eaten out of a bucket,
like a real man.
All the same, I think I would
like to take it into my office
And eat it like a lady.
Eat it like a lady? What?
With knife and fork.
No, like shoving it
into my face
Until I feel like I've
punished my mom enough!
Well, somebody picked
the right time to start
sleeping with the boss.
Oh, what are you talking about?
You didn't hear?
The latest ratings book
just came in,
And she's talking about
changing things--
Extending shows,
cutting shows.
But you're going to be safe.
Look. Sasha's the boss.
I'm just an employee.
She controls what happens
in the workplace.
She's going to add shows
that she wants.
She's going to cut shows
that she doesn't want to do.
She's the boss.
She's going to do whatever
she wants. It's her choice.
And it has nothing to do
with the fact
That she's scored
a 10 on my pommel horse
last night.
So, tom, how are things
going at my little boy's
very first job?
Huh? You like working
at hogie moe's?
No. I wanna quit.
What?!
That's told me I'd be in charge
of urinal cakes and lettuce.
Ok. Please tell me
they have a "lava las manos"
sign in the bathroom?
I don't know. But there's
this really sad poem
in one of stalls
About a guy who's brokenhearted.
See he came there--
No! I know it.
I know the poem, tom.
Look, I know it may not be
the most fulfilling job
in the world,
But I think it's important
we learned to stick
with things.
It's easy for you to get
excited. You're starting
a job you've always wanted.
That's true. Working
for the dean of psychology
at ucla--
You know, it didn't just
fall into my lap.
They had my resume there
for over a year and a half
before they called.
And you know what?
Before that I had to work
a lot degrading jobs.
I waited tables.
I bartended.
I was married to your
father for 15 years.
Yeah. That wasn't a paying job.
It is now.
[car horn]
Oh, there's your dad.
Go get your books, ok?
Hello, allison. How are you?
Ok. What's with you?
What do you mean,
"what's with me?"
You're in a good mood.
Your cheeks are all flushed.
So, they're either remaking
"porky's" or--
Ooh, you had sex.
Well, it is true.
Sasha and I did make love.
But what? Are they really
remaking "porky's?"
No. No.
No, gary. No.
Really? You're not
at all afraid
About how sex is going
to affect you two
working together?
Oh, no.
Sasha and I, we both agreed
to keep it professional.
Plus, I read a very interesting
article in "the new yorker"
That said office romances are
actually common these days.
Ok. A) no, you didn't.
And um, b) my guess is
you fell asleep during
a laker game
And woke up during
a dr. Phil re-run.
Gary, sex changes everything.
I mean, it makes everything
personal.
Think about the first time
we did it.
Uh, us having sex
changed nothing.
I went from thinking
you were slutty
to knowing you were slutty.
Everybody knew that.
When you're slutty,
word tends to get around.
Sasha: Ok. Next thing.
Since our kppq family
is growing,
We're running a little
short on parking spaces.
So, are there any volunteers
to park in the lot
across the street?
I'm fine with parking across
the street.
There's no reason why I should
have a special spot.
Thank you, gary,
for being a good
team member.
Hey, you know what?
I'm doing what any other
team member would do.
And last order of business--
this is a little tough.
We will be extending sue
the cat lady's show
"dramatic paws"
To 2 hours
instead of just one.
Based on some
very and somewhat
inexplicable ratings.
What's the matter?
An hour wasn't enough time
For her to do all
her stupid cat puns?!
Have a mice day!
Hope you're feline-ing great!
And since extending her show
will cut into the show
that comes before,
We will be cutting
"the score" with gary brooks
down to an hour.
Wait? What?!
Gary, I'm sorry.
It's purely a ratings thing.
But my show gets
really good ratings.
Yes, it does. But it's new.
And you're still building
an audience.
How am I supposed to build
an audience if you cut
my show in half?
Gary, it's nothing personal.
What do you mean
it's not personal?!
I'm your boyfriend.
We're sleeping together.
Gary!
Come on! Who here doesn't know
that these 2 are doing it?
My bad.
Yes, professor drakely.
It's just that when
I started this job,
I thought I'd be using more
of my psychology expertise
As opposed to running errands
for you.
See, I graduated
top of my class at uc irvine.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
Uh, yeah ok. So fong's cleaners
on santa monica?
Ok. Ready at 3.
Uh, you know what?
Yeah.
I am crushing up your
cialis pills right now.
Yeah. Ok. Bye.
Hi, mom.
Hey, honey.
How was your day
at hogie moe's?
You still thinking
about quitting?
I mean, you were right.
I just stuck with it.
And I'm having
a great time.
Hey, this kid threw out
his retainer when he dumped
his tray into the trash.
And guess who dug it out?
Me. And then my boss told me
I was a hero.
And I made a joke about
a hero sandwich,
And like 4 people laughed.
It was awesome.
Honey, that is so great.
You know it must be nice
to feel so productive.
Yeah. You know,
I'm loving being part
of the hogie family.
That's what we call it.
So, how's your job?
Actually I worked
with a particularly
interesting case today--
Borderline narcissist
who feels the need
to dominate women.
Probably due to his
repressed homosexuality.
Really? Did you help him?
Yeah. Yeah. But if my help
lasts for more than 4 hours,
He's supposed to consult
a physician.
Sasha: What are you doing?
Well, just dotting down notes
for my show.
Wow. Want to not do that
and do something else?
No, I don't think so.
I'm really not in the mood. Ok?
What do you mean you're
not in the mood?
You're always in the mood.
The other day you started
making out with me
When we were watching
"intervention."
And I never found out
if janine the ice skater
got off meth.
Uh, she didn't.
She relapsed and then her dad
killed himself.
I was in the mood then,
I'm just not in the mood now.
I'm not feeling it. Sorry.
Is this about today?
What--of course not.
No, come on.
I have work to do.
Since my show is only an hour,
I have to cut some stuff out
for time, you know.
Ha ha--that would have been
hilarious.
It's gone now.
Ha ha!
That's a classic
that no one will ever hear.
Gary, I'm sorry.
It was a business decision.
Look, your girlfriend
hates that it happened,
But your boss had to do it.
Hey, you know what?
You could have shortened
anyone's show,
And you chose to shorten mine.
I don't get it.
Why not shorten the show
with that old man that talks
about pots and pans?
Antique bob?
Do you know how much
revenue he brings in
With those adult diaper ads?
Our station depends on him.
Gary, I don't understand.
You are the one who said
we should keep work
and dating separate.
This does not seem separate.
Of course
it doesn't seem separate.
I'm so mad at my boss right now,
That I don't even want to play
with my girlfriend's boobs.
So, what? Are you saying
I should give you
special treatment
Because we're dating?
Yeah. That's awesome.
I can't do that.
Well, then I don't know
what to do.
You know, I'm afraid that what
we have is going to get ruined
Because we work together.
So, I'm going to have to choose
what's more important to me.
So, you know what?
Fine I'll choose.
Gary, that is very romantic.
But I don't think you should
quit your job over this.
What are you talking about?
What--you're choosing me,
right?
If by me you mean my job, yes.
You know what?
I think I'm going
to head home.
Ah, sasha, come on.
What am I supposed to do?
It's my dream job!
Oh, I don't expect you
to do anything.
I just hope you don't end up
regretting your decision.
What are you going to do?
Fire me?
No. No. No. That would be
letting my personal feelings
Dictate my business
decisions.
And I am a professional.
So, I will see you
at work tomorrow.
Don't forget
it's casual Friday.
Glad you could join me.
We're back from break
in like a minute.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.
Sasha arranged
for a chiropractor
to come in a work on us.
I got an adjustment called
a cox flexion distraction.
And at first it sounded like
something I definitely
did not want.
But now I want as much
cox flexion as I can get.
Ooh.
Can we please get to work?!
Ok. Someone's
a little uptight today, huh?
Sorry. I'm very uptight.
Sasha and I had a huge fight.
I basically had to choose
between her and work.
And you picked the job?!
Yes, I did.
Are you crazy?!
You always pick the girl!
Remember that movie
where richard gere went
back into the factory
And he picked up debra
winger and all those homely
left-behinds were clapping.
What if he hadn't?
If he hadn't,
it wouldn't be
"an officer
and a gentleman."
It would be
"an officer and
a selfish bastard."
You're on.
Hey, welcome back
to "the score"
with gary brooks.
You know there's a lot
of talk about football
dynasties, all right.
Patriots, steelers,
you know what I want to do.
I want to take it
in another direction today.
Let's talk about
the dynasties of failure.
I mean the real losers.
The detroit lions,
they gotta be at the top
of that list right away.
You also have your cleveland
browns. These poor guys,
they can't win on the road.
They can't win
when they go back to cleavage.
Cleveland.
What are you doing in here?
Oh, sorry.
I just left some paperwork.
Yeah. Even your newest
franchises in the nfl,
they win more.
You got your jacksonville
jaguars, your tennessee titans.
They're big, firm--
Ok, you know what.
Let's pause 10 seconds
for station identification.
We'll be right back
with "the score"
with gary brooks.
What the heck are you doing
in here, sasha?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
You're walking around
all sexy, that why
I mean what I mean.
Gary, since we're
in the workplace,
I would appreciate you not
referring to me as sexy.
Oops. Dropped my pen.
Curtis: Gary!
Gary! We are back
from station id.
Well, roll another one!
We're picking up pens
in here!
So, do you want you turn
with the chiropractor?
No. I want you to get out.
I'm trying to do a show here
professionally.
All right. Well, it's
my turn with rhonda anyway.
Ok. Where were we?
Ok. Welcome back
to "the score" everybody.
My name is gary brooks.
How about we take a call.
We have glenn in chula vista.
Glenn, what can
I do for ya, pal?
Yeah, hey gary, listen,
I was wondering,
What do you think
the raiders have to do
To put together a better
team for next year?
Well, I'll tell you, glenn,
if your fans are tougher
than your team,
You have a big turn on.
I'm sorry.
Did you say, turn on?
Yeah, turn on. You gotta
turn on the power, kiddo.
Oh, my god I've never seen
bodies move that way.
Are you talking about
darren mcfadden?
Yes, I am. I'm talking
about darren mcfadden and
his perfect, supple bottom.
Thank you!
Allison!
Alli, I need your help!
Gary, shh.
What?
What's going on?
Why are you in the pantry?
I thought you were tom.
Oh, no. Is it a surprise party?
Did I miss his birthday?
I didn't get him anything.
He likes olives, right?
No, look. I quit my job and
I don't want him to know.
So, when he comes home.
He's going to go upstairs.
And I'm going to come out
and pretend I just got home
from work.
Yeah. But you're in here
for no reason. He doesn't get
home for another hour.
So, you're safe. Let's go.
All right.
Car.
Oh!
There's a car.
All right.
Why'd you quit your job?
Gary, I couldn't stand it.
It was like I was
his personal assistant.
He made me do all his
grocery shopping for him,
pick up his dry cleaning.
I mean, it was like being
married to you
Except I didn't have
to watch one steven
gutenberg film.
Steven gutenberg
is an american treasure.
Ok.
Gary, listen to me.
I took off all of this time
to raise my kids
And now I have to pay
my dues all over again?
But I want to teach
tom a lesson,
So I'm hiding in the pantry
like a coward.
Tom totally respects you.
Tell him you quit your job.
He will completely understand.
Both: Aah!
Oh, jeez.
Hi, honey.
Hey, mom.
Hey, dad.
'sup.
Can I have the triskets?
Oh, yeah.
Here you go.
Thanks. You guys should come
listen to this cat lady show.
It's so interesting.
Did you know that cats
have no sense of hot and cold
in their feet?
Really? That's kind of
fascinating, actually.
I gotta go.
Antique bob comes
on in 10 minutes.
All right, come on.
Let's get out of here.
This is ridiculous.
All right.
So, hey, gary.
What did you want?
Sasha's trying to get me
to regret my incredibly
stupid decision.
But it was her stupid decision
to shorten my show
That made me make
my stupid decision.
Car!
No, it's the neighbor's,
allison!
All right.
What am I supposed
to do about sasha?
Ok. Just do
the same thing to her.
Make her regret her decision
to shorten your show.
I mean, who could fill
someone with regret
more than you?
I mean, remember me?
White dress,
flowers in hand,
Priest asking me if I would
take you as my husband.
You did not regret that.
Yeah, but you know what?
When the priest changed
the vows to
"are you double,
triple, super-duper sure
you'd want to do this?"
I should have taken it
as a sign, gary!
The only reason we were
standing there is curtis double
dog dared me to marry you!
Welcome back to
"dramatic...Paws."
I'm sue the cat lady.
Ok. We have carla
from monrovia on the line.
She's the mom of 2 sweet
little 6-month-old calicoes.
Go ahead, carla.
Um, my question is.
When I bring ginger
home from the vet,
Why does mr. Roboto
hiss at her like he's
never seen her before?
She's still at lunch?
Yeah. Yeah.
What are you doing?
Blowing up
the cat lady.
The answer to your question is
mr. Roboto hasn't
seen ginger before.
Cat's can't actually recognize
one another by sight,
Only by smell.
Isn't that interesting?
Yes, it is.
That's really interesting.
Thanks for you call.
I've got germaine from santa
monica on the air.
Germaine,
who's daddy are you?
Yeah, I don't have a cat.
But I do have a question
about the lakers.
Do you think they're better
off with ron artest
Or should they have stuck it
out with trevor ariza?
I'm sorry. I think you may be
calling into the wrong show.
This isn't [in radio voice]
"the score"
with gary brooks?
I thought that show
went 2 hours.
What is that?
Some kind of weird cat show?
I don't want
to talk about cats.
I want to talk about sports.
No. It's recently
been shortened.
That's a terrible idea
to shorten a sports show
for a cat show.
Well, I could take a stab
at answering your question.
Sure, artest struggled early,
but he's good for 16 points
and 5 boards a game.
And come playoffs time,
you're gonna want his strong
presence in the paint
To bang with bateer,
nowitzski, carmelo,
And likely king james
if they make the finals.
You just aren't going to get
that with a slasher like ariza,
Who, to bring it back
to the subject,
Plays the post
like a pussy cat. Pussy cat.
Gary, what are you doing?
I don't know.
Why don't we go
to my office?
Uh, thanks.
I love your show, sue.
Sasha, look. I'm sorry.
You shortened my show.
I freaked out. I took it out
on sue the cat lady,
Who apparently knows more about
the lakers than phil jackson.
Gary, you never had
to make a choice.
Look, I know working
together makes
dating complicated,
But I was willing
to give it a try.
So, was I. I really wanted
to give it a try.
And then I just spazzed out.
I'm sorry.
Uh, it wasn't just you.
I wanted to show you
how wrong you were,
So I dressed sexy
And nearly crippled myself
with that split I did.
Look, could we maybe
try this again. You know what?
Let me rephrase that.
I would really like
to try this again.
So, would I.
Ok. Great.
But if we do this, we have
to sit down and hammer out
an ironclad set of rules
That we stick to
no matter what.
Ok. I agree.
Good. But first...
Let's pick up some pens.
Hey, mom.
Hi, honey.
How was work today?
Uh, great. They promoted me.
When someone orders
a special hogey de la dia--
That's what we call it--
Someone rings a bell. Ok.
You're looking at
the guy who tells the guy
to ring the bell.
So, how was work for you?
Actually, I've got something
to tell you.
I quit my job.
I just--
It wasn't what
I hoped it would be.
And I couldn't make it work.
I hope I didn't let you down.
Thank god.
Huh?
They fired me.
What?!
Oh, gosh! Why, honey?
Well, someone ordered
the special hogey de la dia.
Yeah.
And they asked if they could
have ketchup on it. Ok.
You don't put ketchup on it.
It completely offsets
the flavor,
and everyone knows that!
Yeah.
I refused to give the order
to ring the bell.
Oh, gosh, tommy. I'm sorry.
Yeah. Well, I had to hand in
my hairnet, my key to the
condiment closet--
That's why we call--
That's what they call it.
Ok.
Tommy, it's going to be ok.
The point is that we tried.
We're just going to move on
to bigger and better things.
You know, we're just gonna find
something that's better suited
to us. You know?
Yeah. Well, how about just
living off dad like we've
been doing this whole time?
Hey, if it ain't broke--
Ohh!
Je crois que j'ai une tendinite
au coude et au poignet.
Et aux fesses aussi.
Ça a dû arriver
quand j'ai sauté par-dessus le filet.
J'y serais allée mollo,
mais tu as dit jouer régulièrement.
Chaque jour.
Mais les raquettes sont plus lourdes
que les manettes de jeux.
On devrait peut-être se concentrer
à un tout autre sport.
Juste un bras ?
Je peux pas le lever.
Toc toc.
Désolée.
Tu sais ce qui marche mieux
que "Toc toc" ?
Frapper.
J'appelle les enfants.
Contente de te voir.
Le matin.
Vous passez à la vitesse supérieure.
Non, on vient de jouer au tennis.
T'es sérieuse.
J'ai joué au tennis
une fois avec lui.
Il pensait trouver des Pringles
dans les tubes à balles.
C'est vrai,
il n'est pas aussi bon que Louise.
Cette fille
fait des smashs incroyables
avec ses bras de Barbie.
Tu as joué avec Louise ?
La semaine dernière,
après le baseball avec Tom.
Ils sont incroyables.
Ils me font vraiment rire.
La semaine dernière, soirée film.
<i>Le docteur Jivago</i>.
Et Tom a dit, je cite :
"C'est le film le plus long
que j'aie jamais vu."
Tu prêches une convaincue.
- Ils arrivent.
- J'attends dans la voiture.
Je peux les avoir ce week-end ?
Pour la Saint-Valentin ?
Vous voulez pas rester en amoureux ?
Sasha voulait faire un truc spécial
avec Louise et Tom.
Ah oui ?
J'ai une invitation
pour la nouvelle salle d'arcade.
Ils adoreraient.
Une salle d'arcade.
Dans la Valley.
Y a trop de monde et c'est sale.
Quand est-ce que tu consultes ?
Sérieux.
T'as la phobie des microbes.
Tu mets tant de papier sur la lunette
que tes pieds touchent pas le sol.
On a partagé une salle de bains
pendant 15 ans.
Qu'est-ce qui n'allait pas
avec la cuvette
pour que tu la rates à chaque fois ?
- On y va ?
- Oui.
- Salut et merci pour la manucure.
- Pareil.
- Salut, Chaussure.
- À plus, Chien.
Vous avez des surnoms !
On a joué au Monopoly, hier soir.
Tom était la chaussure, moi, le chien,
et Louise, le haut-de-forme.
À plus, Capsule de bière.
Tiens donc.
J'ai perdu des pions,
donc j'en ai pris un du damier.
Je peux les emmener
à la salle d'arcade ?
Oui, tant que c'est sûr
et qu'ils sont d'accord.
Arrête un peu.
C'est qu'une salle d'arcade.
Je te rappelle
que le vigile t'a plaqué au sol,
car tu tapais la machine à sous.
J'y avais mis 40 dollars
et j'ai rien récupéré.
Que dalle.
Un gosse arrive, met une pièce
et gagne.
Pas question.
Épisode 2x14
<i>Gary lowers the bar</i>
Jibes Team - La Fabrique
www.sous-titres.eu
Lequel tu préfères ?
Un massage aux huiles chaudes ?
Ou à quatre mains ?
Koreatown t'a pas servi de leçon ?
C'est pas pour moi,
c'est pour Sasha.
Pour la Saint-Valentin,
je lui offre un massage dans un spa.
Et pour Koreatown,
je croyais que c'était légal.
Maintenant, je sais dire "Lâche ça"
en coréen.
Un bon pour un spa ?
Tu la vois depuis six semaines.
T'es pas obligé.
Il faut attendre trois mois
avant d'offrir des vacances.
Je l'aime bien, beaucoup même.
Tout se passe bien.
Elle est cool avec les enfants.
Hier, ils ont tellement joué
à Dr Maboul
que j'ai dû
changer l'ampoule du nez.
Place la barre bas.
Si tu commences trop fort,
tu es condamné
à te surpasser constamment.
J'ai offert à Allison
des boucles d'oreilles en or.
Après 10 ans de mariage,
je devais lui offrir une Mercedes
pour qu'elle enlève le haut.
Tu l'as achetée ?
Non, mais après dix ans de mariage,
je me foutais qu'elle l'enlève.
Fais pas la même erreur avec Sasha.
Tu veux lui offrir un truc ?
Place la barre bas.
Curtis, j'adore ton pull !
C'est la perle rare, traite-la bien.
<i>Place la barre bas.</i>
Et voilà.
Il m'a fallu 39 ans pour comprendre.
C'est pour moi ?
C'est à retardement ?
Pourquoi t'es là ?
Tu décroches pas.
Parce que je sais que c'est toi.
C'était pour te dire
que les enfants sont punis
et qu'ils restent avec moi.
- Pourquoi ?
- Tu te demandes ?
Ils devaient ranger les courses
de la voiture.
Ils ont continué à jouer
et j'ai dû jeter 100 dollars de bouffe.
Désolée,
mais pas de salle d'arcade, ce soir.
Tu peux pas faire ça,
pas ce week-end.
On a envie d'y aller.
Les enfants doivent comprendre
que tout se paie.
Et c'est pas ton van
qui va sentir le fromage des semaines.
Il sent le fromage depuis cinq ans.
Ça m'est égal.
Pourquoi tu veux saboter
ce moment avec Sasha ?
- C'est pas le cas.
- Si.
Chacune de tes conquêtes
se sacrifie pour la gent féminine.
Et je lui en sais gré.
Mais je ne contournerai pas les règles
à cause de votre week-end.
Tu es jalouse de Sasha.
- Je suis aussi sympa qu'elle.
- C'est faux.
Pour info,
j'ai emmené les enfants à la plage.
C'était super !
Je sais.
Tu les as tellement enduits de crème
qu'ils pouvaient plus parler.
Une table pour quatre
chez les chevaliers verts.
À quelle heure commence la joute ?
"Quand le soleil
sera pile au-dessus des collines" ?
Genre, 21 h pile ?
D'accord, super.
Je viens de réserver une table
avant notre soirée,
mais si tu veux de l'alcool,
tu devras l'apporter.
Ils ont perdu leur licence
quand le chevalier noir a tué le rouge.
On va devoir annuler.
Allison a puni les gosses.
- Quoi ?
- C'est terrible.
Ils auraient adoré.
Mais je vais te rendre le sourire.
On n'a pas beaucoup évoqué
la Saint-Valentin.
Mais je me suis lancé.
C'est adorable.
T'aurais pas dû.
On est au diapason
parce que j'ai aussi un truc pour toi.
Sans blague !
Toi d'abord.
C'est collé, t'y arriveras pas.
Tiens.
Et voilà.
C'est l'intention qui compte,
on est d'accord.
Tu n'as rien fait d'extravagant,
j'espère.
Ah non, en effet.
Ton cadeau,
c'est des poignets éponge.
Qui vont avec un bandeau.
Tu n'auras plus de sueur
dans les yeux.
Des poignets.
Et un bandeau.
C'est si pratique.
Je crois que le mien...
C'est l'intention qui compte.
La carte de Kirk Gibson de 1988
avec son autographe !
Comment t'as fait ?
Je suis allée
à une vente aux enchères.
J'ai dû surenchérir sur Kirk Gibson.
C'est fantastique !
Y a son autographe !
C'est l'année de son home run
sur Eckersley.
Tu l'as eue, c'est dingue !
C'est tellement
tellement supérieur
à ce que je te t'offre...
Je ne sais même pas quoi dire,
à part...
Je t'ai bien eue.
Quoi ?
- Un cadeau, ça ?
- C'est pas ça ?
Une blague, oui.
Qui offrirait des poignets éponge
et un bandeau
pour la Saint-Valentin ?
T'aurais dû voir ta tête !
Genre : "Je romps avec Gary Brooks."
J'ai été un peu surprise.
Tu seras encore plus surprise
quand tu verras le vrai cadeau
qui t'attend chez moi,
en ce moment même.
C'est vrai ?
J'ai trop hâte.
Porte un casque de protection,
je ne veux pas retrouver
des morceaux de ta jolie cervelle
collés au plafond.
Parce que quand tu verras le cadeau,
ta tête va exploser.
Je viens vers 17 h ?
17 h, c'est parfait.
Ça me laisse le temps de...
rien faire,
le cadeau est déjà chez moi.
Il n'attend plus que toi.
T'as pas fait de folie ?
Pas du tout.
Comment t'as pu me faire ça ?
Tu m'as trahi.
Tu m'as fait mettre la barre trop bas.
Je me suis senti ridicule.
- T'as offert quoi ?
- Des poignets éponge et un bandeau.
T'es dingue ?
J'avais pas dit si bas.
Des poignets éponge ?
Et un bandeau assorti.
C'est important.
C'est le cadeau idéal
de Saint-Valentin
si tu sors
avec le John McEnroe de 1977.
Tu sors
avec le John McEnroe de 1977 ?
Alors, pourquoi tu as acheté ça
pour le John McEnroe de 1977 ?
J'ai flippé.
J'ai commis une erreur.
Et maintenant, je lui ai dit
que le vrai cadeau l'attendait chez moi.
Et c'est...
Dis-moi ce que c'est.
Me fais pas languir !
- Que fais-tu là ?
- Tu décrochais pas.
Je savais que c'était toi.
Dans quel magasin j'allais
quand je voulais nous réconcilier ?
Logogriphe ?
Arrête les mots savants,
on n'est plus ensemble.
Juste le nom du magasin.
Logogriphe, c'est le nom du magasin.
C'est le nom ?
C'est quoi ?
Même si on s'amuse beaucoup
avec les enfants,
on va faire la fête, ce soir.
- <i>Tous les coups sont permis</i>.
- Tu trouves à y redire ?
Non, c'est le nom du film loué.
Jean-Claude Van Damme et Donald Gibb.
C'est génial.
Dégage et laisse-nous
à notre petite soirée.
Une fin alternative ?
Personne n'a intérêt de me raconter.
- Dégage !
- Je m'en vais.
Les enfants ! Dîner !
J'ai des burgers et des milk-shakes,
et j'ai fait des cookies
pour le dessert.
Mais si les voulez en apéritif,
pas de problème.
On fait une soirée à l'envers.
C'est fou, non ?
- On n'est pas punis ?
- Ça n'exclut pas de s'amuser.
En fait, si.
J'ai aussi loué des films
qu'on peut regarder toute la nuit.
Ça va être super.
Allez, servez-vous.
Donc, c'est pas grave,
la viande aux hormones ?
Les filles aiment les types grands.
Ce cookie a un goût bizarre.
Je l'ai fait avec du vrai sucre
et de la farine blanche.
Et le mieux,
je ne vous chronométrerai pas
quand vous vous brosserez les dents.
Des films pour adultes ?
Ce sont ceux
que vous vouliez voir.
Les plus de 13 ans sont pour Louise.
J'ai pas 13 ans !
Tu fais une dépression ?
Pas du tout.
Y a plein de sexe et de violence.
Rien que d'y penser,
je fermerai pas l'oeil de la nuit.
Mais tu dis toujours
que le manque de sommeil
joue sur les résultats scolaires.
Tu démissionnes, c'est ça ?
- Je suis une cause perdue ?
- Voyons, Tom.
Tu me fais peur !
Autant profiter de l'effet sucre.
Je vais réviser mon latin
avant de m'effondrer.
Les enfants !
J'ai aussi un jeu vidéo !
<i>Resident Evil 5</i>.
Celui qui tue le plus de zombies
est dispensé
de son complément de calcium.
Je te le dis,
malgré ce que tu m'as dit,
j'ai arrangé le coup pour Sasha.
Je suis allé dans mon magasin fétiche
et j'ai rectifié le tir.
Mais un petit conseil,
évite le stand des extensions de cheveux
si tu veux pas de queue-de-cheval.
J'y vais, à plus.
Entre.
Tu vas signer
la Déclaration d'indépendance ?
Aide-moi à l'enlever.
Ça fait mal.
Ça y est.
- Entre.
- Je suis en retard.
J'ai pas envie de me faire suer.
Ces trucs...
LOL.
Trop drôle que tu m'aies cru.
Tu vas péter un câble
quand tu verras
ton vrai cadeau de Saint-Valentin.
- J'adore le magasin Logogriphe.
- Oui, c'est chouette.
J'ai le reçu si tu veux le changer.
Leur machine doit être cassée,
car c'est daté d'aujourd'hui,
alors que je l'ai acheté
il y a deux semaines.
Bizarre.
- Quel magnifique médaillon !
- N'est-ce pas.
Je l'ai vu,
c'est comme s'il était fait pour toi.
Je l'adore, merci.
Il y a une photo à l'intérieur.
C'est une super photo de Louise.
De moi, en fait.
J'étais un gosse plutôt fluet.
C'est parfait.
Bonté divine.
Pourquoi vous êtes là ?
Maman nous a emmenés ici,
j'ai rien dit.
J'ai eu peur qu'elle me fasse taire
avec un twinkie.
Je voulais vous annoncer
que la nuit arcade est de retour.
Prenez vos affaires.
Merci, Allison, c'est génial.
On s'amusait bien tous les trois,
et il faut pas s'arrêter
en si bon chemin.
Profitez-en.
Que la fête continue.
Sans oublier le spray antibactérien.
Il faut partir si on veut
qu'ils aient le temps d'en profiter.
Je mets le champagne au frais.
Je vais m'asseoir.
- Ça va ?
- Oui...
Ça doit être la viande aux hormones
et le lait longue conservation.
Ça ira mieux quand j'aurai vomi.
C'est un médaillon intéressant.
Ça ? Oui.
C'est un cadeau de Gary.
C'était ça
ou il dormait dans la niche.
Pour autant que je me souvienne,
il me l'a donné
la fois où il est allé
à la fête de la bière en septembre
et qu'il n'est rentré
qu'en novembre.
Ça ou dormir dans la niche ?
Si vous vous disputez
ou s'il déconne,
t'auras droit à un bijou.
Oui, je parierai là-dessus.
On est prêts.
D'accord, les enfants.
On y va.
À plus tard, Alisson.
Tu lui diras que j'aime ton médaillon
autant que le mien.
T'attends pas Gary ?
Bon sang.
Où est Sasha ?
Partie avec les enfants.
Sans dire au revoir ?
C'est bizarre, non ?
Elle est un peu fâchée.
Ça m'étonnerait.
Pas après mon cadeau.
- Allison, c'est...
- Le mien.
Et tu as décidé de...
Je suis...
Pourquoi tu le portes, aujourd'hui ?
J'ai pas de boule de cristal
dédiée à la stupidité.
Elle est reliée à ton cou.
Faut que je la rattrape.
J'espère que c'est pas trop tard.
Trop tard, elle est partie.
Super.
Le médaillon devait tout arranger.
Et là, c'est cent fois pire.
C'est quoi, le cadeau parfait ?
Quand t'en achètes un,
c'est jamais gratuit.
Rabaisser les prétentions,
te faire pardonner ou la sauter.
C'est le principe du cadeau.
Un cadeau,
c'est pas donnant-donnant.
Ça révèle tes sentiments.
Depuis quand c'est comme ça ?
Commence donc ce soir.
Tu as raison, je vais les rejoindre.
Pour lui dire...
Lui dire quoi ?
Personne ne finit ses phrases !
Coupe-moi pas la route.
Les femmes, toutes les mêmes.
Je te rappelle
que ton personnage est une fille.
J'aime sa tenue.
- Voilà Sasha, va lui parler.
- Je ne crois pas.
Elle tient un maillet.
Gary, ça va aller.
Ça me rappelle le Grand Canyon
quand tu me disais de reculer
pour me prendre en photo.
Tu l'as avec toi ?
- Oui, je l'ai.
- Alors, vas-y.
T'es fâchée, hein ?
Un peu.
Je ne peux dire que...
Je t'ai encore eue.
Parce que le médaillon...
Pourquoi j'ai fait ça ?
Ça ne marche plus.
Désolé.
Je t'ai offert une babiole.
J'ai flippé
et j'ai essayé d'arranger le coup.
Désolé.
Je suis plus embarrassée
qu'en colère.
La différence entre nos cadeaux
prouve que je tiens plus à toi
que toi à moi.
Et c'est bon...
Je voulais pas aller trop vite,
donc j'ai placé la barre bas.
Ça aurait pu être pire.
T'as failli recevoir une carte virtuelle
avec un cornichon dansant.
On oublie tout, d'accord ?
Oublions la Saint-Valentin.
Je ne prononcerai plus ces mots.
À partir d'aujourd'hui, ce sera "SV".
Tu sais ce qu'il y a de bien
avec la SV ?
Ça nous a rapprochés.
J'ai un truc pour toi.
Tu devrais poser le maillet
par précaution.
Tu vois la machine à cinq dollars
qui te donne une pièce
avec un message ?
"Je te kiffe" ?
Le coeur est à l'envers,
mais c'est ce que je ressens.
C'est le cadeau parfait.
Et pour info, je te kiffe aussi.
- Vous voilà.
- Ça va ?
- Tu t'amuses bien ?
- Oui, je mange même un hot-dog.
Enfin, je mangeais.
Le taureau est interdit aux enfants.
Vous devez essayer.
Pas moi, mon bonhomme.
La dernière fois,
j'ai eu mal aux fesses
pendant une semaine.
Un taureau mécanique ?
Pour être projetée
et ballottée dans tous les sens ?
Non.
Je tiens pas sur ces trucs.
C'est trop difficile.
Où est ce taureau ?
On peut y aller mollo.
Vous rigolez ?
Mes enfants regardent.
Bonne chance.
Allison, ton chemisier !
Ton chemisier !
Et les voilà à l'air libre.
Oh, my gosh. I think I have tennis elbow.
I think--think I have tennis wrist.
I think I have tennis ass.
But I think that happened
From when I tried to jump over the net.
I would have gone easier on you, gary,
But you said you played tennis all the time.
I do. I play tennis every day,
But the racket's a lot heavier
Than those little plastic controllers.
Well, maybe from now on,
you and I should stick to indoor sports.
Wow. Yeah.
Wh-what's this? I only get one arm?
I can't--I can't lift it. You gotta--
There you go.
Knock, knock.
Oops. Sorry. Oh.
Yeah. Hi. You know what's even
better than saying, "knock, knock"?
Knocking.
I'll go get the kids. Great.
Hey, allison.
Hey, sasha. Nice to see you. In the morning.
I didn realize you guys
were at the sleepover stage.
Oh, no. We just met for
an early tennis date.
Ha! Oh. You're serious. Wow. Yeah.
One time I tried to play tennis with gary.
He was so disappointed the can of
balls didn't have pringles in them.
Mm. Yeah, well, it's true
he's not as good as louise.
Boy, that girl can sure
power 'em over the net
For a girl with arms like a barbie doll.
Ooh. You--you played tennis with louise?
Yeah, last week, after tom and
I went to the batting cages.
Huh. Those two are such a blast.
Yeah. I know. I have fun
with them all the time.
Last week was movie night, "doctor ivago."
Tom said, and I quote, "that was
the loest movie I've ever seen.
[laughing] yeah.
So you're preachin' to the choir. Boy.
Kids'll be out in a minute.
Ok, ok. I'll just-- I'll be in the car.
Hey, allison. What?
Can I have the kids this weekend?
What, on valentine's day?
I'd've thought you 2 lovebirds
Would have planned to do something alone.
Here's the thing. Sasha
wanted to do something special
With tom and louise. That's all.
Oh. Really?
I scored thiinvitation to this
huge new arcade in the valley,
And I st think the kids would love it.
Oh, gosh. An arcade.
In the valley. Ahh.
Those--I mean,
Those places are always
so crowded and dirty.
At what point are you gonna
get some help? Seriously.
With the germs, you're like a maniac.
You put so many toilet
seat covers on the seat,
Your feet don't even touch the ground
When you go to the ba-- gary.
You know what? I shared a
bathroom with you for 15 years.
What exactly was wrong wi the
inside of the toilet bowl
That was not good enough
for your pee. Huh? What?
Hey, guys, you ready to go?
Yeah, mom.
Bye, sasha. Thanks for dog my nails.
Hey, thanks for doin' mine. Bye, shoe.
See ya, dog.
Wow. Wow, you got nicknames, huh?
We played monopoly last night.
Yeah, tom was the shoe. I was the dog.
Louise was the top hat.
See ya later, beer cap.
Ha ha. Beer cap.
Yeah. We, uh, lost a couple pieces,
So I had to borrow one
from the checkerboard. Oh.
So, allison, is it ok if I
take them to the arcade?
Yeah. I guess, you know, as long as you
Checked it out and they wanna go, ok.
What's wrong with you? What's the worst
That could happen? It's an arcade.
Gee, let me see. The security guy
Tackles you to t ground
For tipping over the quarte
r-pushing machine.
I put, like, $40 in that machine.
I didn't get anything, bubkes, nothin'.
Then an 8-year-old comes by,
Puts in one quarter, wi the jackpot?
Not on my watch. All right.
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>

Hey, curtis, what do you thk sounds better,
A hot-oil or a 4-handed massage?
Oh, gary, didn't you learn your lesson
Last time you were in koreatown?
It's not for me, curtis, ok?
It's for sasha, all right?
I thoughit'd be nice for valentine's day,
Get her a nice spa gift certificate, ok?
And for the record, that place in koreatown,
I thought that was legit, all right?
And I--I did learn the words in korean
For, "let go."
A spa gift certificate?
You been seein' sasha for,
like, what, 6 weeks?
No, you are under no obligation
Honor the big-ticket holidays
until at least 3 months in.
I like--I like sasha, though, you know,
A lot, and things are going really great.
She's makin' an effort with the kids.
Last night, she played operation with them
So long I had to replace the light bulb
In that naked fat guy's nose.
Yeah. Ok, just set the bar low.
If y go crazy and set expectations too high,
Then you have to keep outdoing yourself
For the restof the relationship.
That's true. You know, with allison,
My first gift was gold earrings.
By the time we'd been together 10 years,
She wouldn't take off her bra unless
There was a new mercede.
You bought allison a mercedes?
No, but after 10 years of marriage, I really
Didn't care if the bra was onr not. I just--
All right. Ok.
Just don't make the same
mistake with sasha, ok
If you have to get her anything,
set the bar low.
Sasha: Hey, guys.
Ooh, curtis, I'm loving
that new sweater vest.
Hey, gary, this girl is one
in a million right here.
You better be treatin' her right.
All right? Mm-hmm.
[mouths words]
All righok.Mm-hmm.
All right, there you go.
I don't know why it took 39 yearsto figu.
[knocks] hey, gary.
Oh, is that for me?
Is it ticking?
Why are you here?
Because you don't pick up
your phone when I call.
Because I have caller I.D. I know it's you.
Ok. Well, if you would have answered,
You would know that the kids are grounded,
So they're staying with me.
No. Grounded? Why? Well, why?
Because I asked them to
take in the groceries
From the car. They put it off
Playing video games. I ended up having
To throw away $100 worth of food.
So I'm sorry, but they're not gonna
Be able to go to sasha's
little arcade night.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You can't do this, not this weekend.
Everybody is really lookin'
forward to it, allison.
Gary, I'm sorry, but the kids have to learn
That there are consequences
to their actions.
Besides, you're not the one whose car
Is gonna smell like blue cheese for a month.
My van has smelled like blue
cheese for, like, 5 years.
I don't care. That's true.
Why are you sabotaging
Sasha's time with the kids?
I am not. Yes, you are.
Please! Anyone who is sleeping with you
Is taking a hit for the
entire female species, gary.
I mean, I appreciate that, ok?
But I-I'm not gonna-
I'm not gonna bend the rules
Just because sas has
some silly arcade plans.
You're jealous 'cause the
kids have fun with sasha.
Ok, why would I be jealous?
I am just as much fun as sasha.
No, you're not. Hey, you know what?
You know what? For your information,
I, uh--I took the kids
to the beach last week.
We all had a great time.
Yeah, I heard about that.
You put so much sunscreen on 'em,
They looked like they were in a silent film.
So that's 4 for dinner in
the green knight section.
Um, and what time does the joust start?
"when the sun is nigh over the hills"?
So, like, half past nigh?
Ok. Ok, great.
Hey, gary, I just made dinner
reservations for before the arcade,
But if you wanna drink, you're gonna have to
Bring your own grog. Sorry.
They lost their quor license
After the black knight
Shot the r knight in the parking lot.
Sasha, look,
I don't think arcade night's gonna happen.
Allison, uh, she grounded the kids.
What? It's terrible.
Oh, no. Yeah.
Oh, they would have loved it. I know.
Hey, but I got somethin'
that might cheer you up. Ok?
I know we didn't talk a
lot about valentine's day,
But I--I just went for it.
Gary, that's so sweet.
Oh, you really shouldn't have.
We must on the same page,
Because I got somethin' for you, too.
No way. Yeah.
Awesome. You open yours first.
Ok. Ah, that's glued.
You're never gonna get it. Here.
There you go.
Ok. Oh, gary,
You know it's the thought
that counts, right?
I really hope you didn't do
anything too extravagant.
[disappointed] oh, good. You didn't.
You got me...
Wristbands.
Yeah. And-- and a matching headband.
It'll keep the-- the sweat out of
your eyes next time we play tennis.
Wow. Wristbands.
And a matching headban hee.
Wow. That's-- it's so practical.
Gary, I don't think mine is quite as--
Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
It's the thought that counts,
just like you said.
Oh, my god!
An autographed kirk gibson
baseball card from 1988!
Yeah!
Oh, my god!
How did you get this?
I--I went to a sports memorabilia auction.
The only way I got it was
by outbidding kirk gibson.
Whoo! This is awesome!
He autographed it!
This is wh he hit the
home run off of eckersley
In the world series, and you got it!
This is incredible! This is so...
I, uh--I don't even know what to say,
Except...
Bo-oi-oi-oing! Ha ha ha ha!
Gotcha! You got served.
[laughs] what are you talking about?
You thought that was your
real valentine's day present?
Oh, it's not? Ha ha ha! No.
That's like a total goofy gift.
What kind of a guy gets
his girlfriend wristbands
And a matching headbd for valentine's day?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
You should've seen your face.
Whoo!
You were like, "
I'm breakin' up with gary brooks."
I was a little surprised.
You were surprised?
Wait how surprised you're gonna be
When you see your real gift, whh is
at my house right now waiting for you.
Really? Yeah, really.
Ok. Now I'm getting excited.
Yeah, I hope you wear your min
d-explosion-prevention helmet,
Because I don't want to be raping pieces
Ofute sasha's brains off the ceiling
From when you see the present and
your head explodes off your body.
Ok, so I should come over around 5:00?
5:00 is awesome.
5:00 gives me plenty of time to...
Do nothing, because it's already
at my house waiting for you,
Like just waiting for you to be there.
Ok. All right. Ok.
Gary, I hope you didn't go overboard.
Don't worry. I won't.
Curtis, how could you do that to me, man?
You sold me down the river with sasha.
You told me to set the bar low.
I made a fool out of myself.
Why? What did you get her?
I t her terry cloth wristbands
and a matching headband.
A-are you crazy?
I didn't mean set it that low.
Seriously, wristbands?
And a matching headband.
Why does everybody leave out the headband?
That is only a good valentine's day gift
If you're dating 1977 john mcenroe.
Are you dating 1977 john mcenroe?
No.
Then why did you buy athletic equipment
For 1977 john mcenroe?
I don't know. I freaked out.
I made a mistake,
ok? But now I'm in deeper trouble,
'cause I told her the
real gift is at my house.
Which is...
Which is what? Tell me, man.
Don't leave me hangin'.
Hey, allison.
What are you doing here?
Uh, you're not pickin' up your phone.
Yeah, 'cause I have caller I.
D. I know it's you.
What was the name of the store
the mall that I used to go to
Whenever I had a problem with you?
Uh, you mean conundrum?
Look, I don't like that you use fancy words
Now that we're not together anymore.
Just tell me the name of the place, ok?
No, gary, the name of the
store is called conundrum.
That is the name of the store?
Yeah. Yeah. Ok, what is all this?
Oh. Well, uh, even though I always
have a great time with the ds,
Yeah. Yeah. I decided to kick it
up a notch tonight. Is all this?
"no holds barred."
Oh, what? So now you have
to say things differently?
No, you rented the movie "no holds barred."
It's-- oh.
Hulk hogan and joan severance.
This thing's amazing.
Ok, gary just-- just get out of here
And let me have my fun night. Put it back.
Alternate ending? Are you kidding me?
Nobody better breathe a word of what happens
Until I see this for myself.
Gary, get out.
I'm leaving. Get out.
Bye. Kids, dinner!
I got burgers and milkshakes,
And I made some cookies for dessert.
But if you want to eat them as
an appetizer, go ahead, huh?
Maybe it's backwards night.
How crazy is that, right?
But I thought we were grounded.
Oh, it doesn't mean you can't have fun.
Well, it does, actually.
You know what? I also-- I alsoot some movies
That we could--we could watch
all night long if we want.
You know what? Wouldn't that be fun?
What are you gs waitin' for? Just dig in.
Go ahead. Here we go.
So we don't have to worry about
growth hormones in meat anymore?
Tom, girls like tall guys, ok?
What's in this cookie? It tastes weird.
Oh, uh, real sugar and white flour.
I know. And you know what?
Whenou guys brush your teeth tonight,
I'm not even gonna time you.
Right?
Arthese r-rated movies?
Yeah. I just got you guys all the stuff
You been begging me to see.
Uh, the pg-13 ones are for louise.
But I'm not even 13.
Mom, are you having a nervous breakdown?
No. No, honey, I'm not.
These movies are full of sex and violence.
Ok? And thinking about either one
is gonna keep me up all night.
Ok, and you're the one who's always
talking about the correlation
Between sleep deprivation and
poor performance in school.
Ok, so what? Are you giving up on me?
Am I that far gone?
Oh, honey, come on, tom.
No. You know what, mom? You're scaring me.
Oh, my gosh.
I may as well put this
sugar high to good use.
I'm going to go to my room and
learn latin before I crash.
But you guys! You guys, look!
You didn't even-- you didn't
see the video game I got.
"resident evil 5."
Look.
Whoever kills the most zombies
Doesn't have to take
their calcium supplement!
I'm tellin' you, curtis,
in spite of what you told me,
I was able to fix things with sasha, ok?
I went to the mall, my old reliable spot.
I was able to right the ship.
But, hey, word of advice.
Don't stop at the hair-extension kiosk
Unless you wanna come
home with a fake ponytail.
All right, I gotta go. See yolater.
[knocking on door]
Hey, gary. Hi. Hey, what's up?
Come on in. Ooh.
Am I here to watch you sign the
declaration of independence?
I can't get it out. I need your help.
Ok. Ow, ow, ow.
That hurts a lot.
There you go. Ok. Here.
Come on in.
Sorry I'm late. I would have called
But I decided not to sweat it.
Ah ha ha! Yeah! Right?
Those things.
L-o-l.
I can't believe you thought
that was your real gift.
Which means you're really
gonna go crazy when you see
Your real valentine's day gift.
Ah hah hah. Ooh.
I love the store, conundrum.
Yeah, it's nice.
I got you a gift receipt for you,
In case you wanna return it,
But I think their printer was broken,
'cause they put today's date on,
Even though, you know, I bought this,
Like, 2 weeks ago. So whatever.
That's weird.
Ok. [gasps]
Oh, gary, what a beautiful locket.
That's right.
You know, I saw that,
It just said sasha.
Oh ho ho.
I love it. Thank you.
Open it up. There's a picture inside.
Ohh! What a cute picture of louise.
Yeah. That's me, actually.
I was--I was a pretty scrawny kid.
Oh.
Gary, it's perfect.
Thank you.
Hi, dad.
Oh, goodness gracious.
What are you guys doing here?
Mom. Yeah, she told us to get in the car,
And I didn't ask questions.
I was afraid she was trying
To stuff a twinkie in my mouth.
Hey, gary. Hey, sasha. Uh,
I just wanted to let everyone know
That arcade night is back on.
So gget your stuff. What?
Yay! All right!
Thank you, allison. That's great.
Yeah. You know what?
We were havin' such a great time
At my house. I thought, you know,
It's just not even fair to
have the fun stop there,
So have at them, you know.
Let the good times roll.
With antibacterial hand spray. Rit there.
Great.
Well, we should probably get going
So the kids have more time
to play before they close.
Yeah, I'll go put the
champagne in the fridge.
Aw, yeah.
You know, I, uh-
I need to sit down a second.
Are you ok?Yeah. I just, uh...
I think I poisoned myself with processed mts
And preservative-laced dairy, but--[gasps]
I'm gonna be fine once I puke.
Yeah. It's gonna be good.
Wh--
Wow. That's, um-- hmm?
That's a really interesting locket.
Oh, this? Ah, yeah.
Gary actually gave this to me. Yeah.
A locket was always his "get
out of the ghouse" gift. Yeah.
As--as I recall, I think he gave this to me
When he went out drinking for oktoberfest.
He didn't come home till November.
Mmm. His "get out of the
doghouse gift," huh?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
So if you ever get in a fight with him
Or if he screws up, you can always count
On a piece of jewelry comin' your way.
Yeah. Seems like a pretty safe bet.
We're ready. We're ready.
Ok, kids. Let's go.
All right, allison. Well, see you later.
Tell gary I love my locket
as much as I love yours.
What? Aren't you gonna wait for gary?
Oh, crap.
Where's, uh-- where's sasha?
Uh, she left for the arcade with the kids.
Without saying good-bye?
That's a little bizarre, don't you think?
Yeah. Yeah, I think she's a little mad.
Ah, I don't think so,not after .
Allison, is that-- mine.
And you decided to-- yeah.
Am I-- oh, so much.
Gaah!
Why would you wear it here, now?
How was I supposed to know?
I don't have a crystal ball of stupidity.
The only one I know of
is attached to your neck.
I gotta go get her.
Sasha!
Oh, man, I hope it's not too late.
It's too late. She's gone.
That's great.
The locket was supposed to be
The gift to make everything better.
Now erything's a million times worse.
Why is it so hard to find the perfect gift?
Gary, it's because of
the way you buy a gift.
You always have an agenda--
Lowering someone's expectations,
Getting someone to forgive you,
Getting someone to have sex with you.
That's what gifts are for.
Ok, gary,
Sten to me.
You don't give someone a gift
to get something in return.
You give them a gift to show
them how you feel about them.
What? When did this start?
Ok,
Why don't yo have it start tonight?
You're right. I gotta get to the arcade.
To tell her...
To tell her what?
Why won't anybody finish a sentence?
Quit cutting me off.
Ah, women drivers.
Women drivers? Your character's a girl.
I like what she's wearing.
Oh. There's sasha. Go talk to her.
Yeah, I don't thinso.
She's holding a mallet.
Gary, you'll be fine.
That's what you said at the grand canyon
When you kept telling me to
back up to get my picture taken.
So you, uh-- you have the thing?
Yeah, I got the thing.
All rit, well, go.
Hi. Oh.
Hi.
Bet you're pretty mad, huh?
Yeah, little bit.
Well, all I have to say
to that is bo-oi-oing.
Bu-whup. I got you again.
Because the locket--
Why am I even doing this?
It barely worked that one time.
I'm sorry. I got you those wristbands,
And I just freaked out, and I tried
to fix it the only way I know how.
I'm sorry, ok?
And I just freaked out, gary, I'm not so
much madx it as I am embarrassed, ok?Now
how.
Because the difference
in our gifts clearly show
That you don't feel the same way about me
As I feel about you, and that's fine.
I mean, we haven't--
Sa-sasha, I didn't want to go too
far too fast with the first gift,
So I was gonna set the bar low.
I could have set it a lot lower.
You don't know how close you came
To getting an e-card with a
singing and dancing pickle, ok?
Look, gary, let's-- let's just
forget the whole thing, ok?
Let's forget valentine's day ever happened.
I won't even say, "valentine's day."
From now on, I'm just gonna say, "v.D." ok?
Ok.
You know what's great about v.D.?
Is that it brought you
and I closer together.
Uh, I got somethin' for you.
Uh, actually, why don't you put down
the mallet in case you don't like it.
You know that machine, you put $5.00 in it,
And they give you a penny
with a message on it?
"I butt you"?
Yeah.
The heart came out upside down,
But that's how I feel, so...
This is a perfect gift.
And just for the record,
I butt you, too.
[laughs]
There you guys are.
How you doing, allison? You vin' fun?
Yeah, I'm tryin'.
Look at me eatin' a hot dog, huh?
Ah-choo. Uh.
I was eating a hot dog.
Here.
Hey, the-- the mechanical
bull is 18 and over.
One of you's gotta try it.
Not me, little man.
Once I tried a mechanical bull,
I had to sit on fron peas for a week.
Mom?
What? A mechanical bull, and get thrown
And spun around in every direction. Ah...
Sasha?
No way. I can never stay on those things.
It's way too hard.
Show me the bull.
I can take it easy on you if you like.
What, are you kidding?
Kids are over there watchin'.
There you go. Tom: All right.
Good luck, mom.
Yeah. L right.
Ohh!
Louise: Go, mom! Tom: All right!
All right, allison.
Whoo! Go, mom!
Allison, watch out! Your shirt!
Allison, your shir-- oh, and they're out.

Hi, Gary.
Hi Dad.
Hi sweetie.
Oh, wow. Reading the newspaper.
I'm impressed.
I'm just seeing what's on TV.
Oh, my gosh.
Jon Cryer documentary.
"from duckie to emmy."
Hmm.
Uh, listen,
Gary, we have to
talk to Louise,
But first we have
to deal with Tom,
Who, if he
would stop pouting
in the car,
Would come out
and tell you
what happened.
Uh, Louise,
would you get daddy
a beer, please?
Yeah, sure.
Gary, do you
really think
it's a good idea
To have Louise get
your drinks for you?
Yes.
Um, I used
to get them myself.
This way, I don't
have to get them myself.
It's totally bogus.
Take it easy, man.
What's goin' on?
Well, I tried out for
the Lakeside wrestling club.
Lakeside wrestling?
Hey, just like
your old man, huh?
Yeah.
All right. How'd it go?
I'll tell you
how it went.
Ok, I wrestled
the coach's son,
And I totally pinned him,
but then I got cut,
And he had
a spot on the team.
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.
If you pin, you're in.
That's how it's
always worked.
Who's the coach
over there?
Uh, Joe Campbell.
You remember him
from high school?
Soup? I remember
soup Campbell.
I'm pretty sure
he likes to be called Joe now.
Ah, well,
that's too bad for soup,
Because unfortunately
in the real world,
You don't outrun
a perfectly good nickname
Just 'cause
you wanna go back
to your real name.
Works both ways, too.
I went to school with
a kid named Wang Chin.
He begged
for a nickname.
Yeah. Well, I totally
pinned him, and it's not fair.
Don't worry. I'll talk
to soup Campbell.
He owes me a favor.
We wrestled together
in high school.
Let's just say, uh,
I did him a solid, ok?
You do your homework.
I'll straighten it out.
All right?
Here, daddy.
Ah, daddy's little girl.
Look at that.
I hope you're happy
when Louise decides
To tend bar
at Dublin's Pub.
Are you--
is that someth--
Is that something
she's shown interest in?
No. No. Man.
On that note,
Louise, I'm gonna
Show your father
your history test.
Ohh. Wait. You got a "d"
on your history test?
You're the smartest kid
in the class.
I don't know
how it happened,
But it was bound to
eventually,
Just like when you say Tom
is due to get an "A" someday.
Law of averages, right?
It's what we're
all countin' on.
Here. Look, uh,
honey, it's--
It's unfamiliar
territory,
But I guess we're
supposed to impose
Some--some kind
of a punishment, right?
But how do you
punish Louise?
Take away her books?
Make her play?
Hey, Tommy, if you
came home with a "D,"
How would we punish you?
Uh, probably
somewhere
in the area
Of no video games,
phone, tv until
my grades improve.
But that depends on
how much sass I'm
dishin' your way.
Uh, ok, Louise,
So you're
gonna get
the Tom special.
Uh, you can dish
a little sass,
Because that
comes with
the package.
[sighs] that sounds
very appropriate. Thank you.
Ok...
Something is
going on with her.
I'm really worried.
I don't know.
Drugs? Pot?
I shouldn't. Uh-uh.

Hey, soup.
Hey, guy, name's Joe.
No one's called me
soup since--well, well.
Gary Brooks.
How you been, man?
Me? Not bad. Not bad.
You got your own
sports radio show.
Yes, I do.
Dream come true.
You listen to it?
Yeah, really not my thing.
I'm all about coaching here
And holdin' down the fort
at Valencia Public Storage.
You lookin' to streamline?
I can put you in a 10-by-12
for 75 bucks a month,
And that's climate controlled.
I'm divorced, soup.
I, uh--I own nothing.
I came by to talk to you
About my son Tommy,
Tommy Brooks.
He said he tried out
for the wrestling team.
I was wondering
what happened.
Yeah. I want you to know I did
everything I could for him.
It broke my heart
to see him fail.
Uh, fail. That's--
that's the thing.
He--he said
he pinned your son.
Heh heh heh heh.
Pin's an exaggeration.
It's more like he
held him down for 3 seconds.
However you want
to explain it, soup,
My son beat your kid.
He deserves to be
on the team, you know?
Yeah, I just felt
in the long run,
My son donny
has more potential.
All right,
for the sake of argument,
Let's not go by your feelings
and go with maybe--
I don't know--logic.
My son beat your son.
He deserves to be on the team.
Sorry. 12 spots,
12 wrestlers,
one broken heart.
Tough nuts, huh?
I didn't wanna
bring this up, soup,
But, uh--ahem.
You owe me.
How do I owe you?
Senior year,
I let you beat me
So you can
come to states
With the rest of us,
remember?
You're crazy.
I straight-up beat your ass.
What?! I let you win.
You begged me.
Y-you said your dad
would kick your ass
If you didn't
get to state.
Sorry. I don't
remember it that way.
I guess we just
agree to disagree.
Uh, yeah. No. No.
We--we don't.
We don't agree to disagree.
I completely
threw that match for you.
If we wrestled in real life,
You wouldn't score one point
against me. You know it.
My son Tommy deserves
to be on the team.
He beat your kid.
Well, he didn't beat him
enough to make the team.
I'm sorry. Donny's just
a better wrestler.
Dad.
I'm tired. Can I go home
and watch tv now?
That depends.
How many'd you do?
3.
You did 3 push-ups?
Candy bars.
You "did"
3 candy bars?
Get out of here.
Don't come back
Until you've done
20 push-ups.
It's not fair.
I hate wrestling.
Look, this is ridiculous.
My son beat your son.
He deserves to be on the team.
You're not gonna
get away with this, soup.
Wait. We have soup?
You know why
he's doin' this, right?
Because every time
he looks at you or Tommy,
It's gonna remind him
of that moment in his life
when it counted most
And he couldn't get it done.
He's feeling shame, man.
Well, you know
how I feel about
shame, Curtis.
I think as soon
as something happens
in your life,
You just let it go,
forget about it
Like it never
even happened.
You're on.
I wanted to talk
about something
That happened
20 years ago.
I let this guy win
a wrestling match
'cause I was being
nice, and now he
resents me for it,
So he's taking it
out on my son.
'cause I was being
so we're talkingw he
about unfairme for it,
Coaching practices
in children's sports.
Who's got a take?
Let's hear it.
We got Aaron in Chino.
Aaron,
you are on the air.
What do you got for me?
Yeah, a similar thing
happened to my kid
in little league
Because I stole
the coach's wife.
You know who gets hurt?
The kids do.
Yeah, that's
exactly right, Aaron.
Except in my case,
where the coach got hurt
When I showed up
to the game with a tire iron--
Ok, thank you, Aaron.
All right, let'so
to another call.
We have s.C. In--
what is this?
Wine country?
Soup: Yeah, as in
stop whining about your kid
when he doesn't make the cut.
Well, well, well.
Looks like we got soup Campbelll
on the line,
Aka the weasel
who blackballed my son
From makin'
the wrestling team,
even though I let him
Beat me in high school
so his sorry rear end
Could go to state
with the rest of us.
I thought you didn't
listen to my show, soup.
I'm sick of you
claiming you let me win.
Not only did I beat you then.
I'd be glad to give you
another beating now.
Soup, as much
as I'd love to drive
your face into the mat,
I hate to break it
to you, but I'm
a grown man now, ok?
A grown man now would
strap on his singlet and dance.
What am I supposed
to do with this guy?
The man is
callin' you out.
You can't host
a sports show
And then back down
when someone steps to you.
Soup: What's it
gonna be, Brooks?
You gonna sac up?
You gonna change
the name of your show
To "the score
with fairy Brooks"?
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Timeout, soup.
You callin' me a fairy?
Hey, if the wings fit
and the wand's tiny...
Ok, soup,
you wanna go,
we'll go.
But after I pin
your ass,
My son Tommy is
on that wrestling team.
You follow me?
You got it.
Bring your "a" game,
'cause this soup's
about to boil over.
Good! I hope
it does boil over,
'cause I'm gonna
bring the spoon,
And I'm gonna eat you
like you're
The most tastiest soup
that ever existed.
Ok, Louise, there was
a famous division
Between the north
and the south
In the civil war
called the...
No clue.
Uh, Mason...
Mason-dix...
Mason-dixie chicks.
No!
Louise, no. I--
I don't get it.
You--you're
a straight-a student
in every other subject.
Mom, maybe we just found
the one thing I'm not good at.
Maybe we all need
to accept the fact that
I'm not the perfect kid.
No. Louise, you are
the perfect child since
the day you were born.
Your head was shaped
like an oval,
And you pointed your
toes on the way out.
Hey, is Tom home?
Uh, no, not yet.
Honey, could you
Excuse us just
for a second?
Yeah, sure.
[sighs] ok, something
is happening with her.
I mean, she doesn't
know her history,
But I--I actually think
she's just pretending.
Why do you think
everybody has an agenda?
Maybe she
doesn't know her stuff.
Not everyone's
workin' an angle,
Like, uh, the salesgirl
at Victoria Secret
That you said was
trying to hit on you
'cause she liked
the way your bra fit.
Ok, I'm sorry.
I didn't imagine that, Gary, ok?
She slipped a wine cooler
in my dressing room
And told me that
my bra would look better
on the floor of her Miata, ok?
Look, Louise,
she knows the stuff,
But she's faking it,
and I don't know why.
I don't know.
Maybe she's, uh,
tired of the pressure
Of trying to be perfect
all the time.
I--I know the feeling.
I'd love a day off.
I'd love to see
a day on, gar.
Hey, thanks a lot, dad.
You completely
humiliated me at school.
Wait. Honey, hang on.
What's wrong? What happened?
Dad went on the radio
show and said he would
wrestle my coach
And if he wins, that I
get a spot on the team.
Now everyone at school's
saying the only
way I can get in
Is if my dad fights
my battles for me.
This is
a good thing, Tommy.
I beat your coach,
I settle an old score,
Plus you get
on the team.
It's a win-win.
I'm just tryin'
to help you out.
Yeah, well,
I don't want your help.
If you fighting my battles
is the only way I can get in,
I don't wanna be on at all.
Whoa. What's up
with that guy?
He was full
of thank-yous
When I helped him
pull his head out
of that pumpkin.
Ok. Look, I know
this is the last thing
you wanna hear right now,
But I think
you have to back down
from this fight, Gary.
Tom's feelings are
what's important here.
I can't back down,
allison.
I'll totally
lose my rep.
I can't lose my rep.
Gary, I know backing down
is the hardest thing
in the world for you.
Oh, you're dead wrong,
And I'll never
admit to that.
All right,
I'll back down.
All right.
I'll go talk to soup.
I'll take care of it.
Good. Good.
You're doing the right thing,
and you're a good father, Gary.
By the way, how did,
uh, Tom's head end up
in a pumpkin in the first place?
Ha! I dared him.
Hey, soup,
we gotta talk.
What do you want, Brooks?
All right.
You here to beg for mercy?
No. I'm here
to back out of the match
for my son's sake, ok?
Oh, that's so touching.
I think I just
lactated myself.
All right, knock it off.
Here's the thing.
I know every single
resentment you have
about high school
A-and me,
you're taking it out
on my son. It's not ok.
I'm gonna go on the air.
I'm gonna tell
all my listeners
That I'm backin' out
of the match,
And I'll take
whatever repercussions
come with it,
As long as you let my
son try out for the team
fair and square, ok?
All right, I'll do that.
As long as you announce
to all your fans
That not only are you
a quitter, you're a liar.
You tell 'em I won
that match in high school
fair and square.
But you didn't.
Duh.
That's why
I want you to say it.
Fine. I'll do it.
Ok. I'll give Tom
another tryout,
But this time, it's not
gonna be against
my load of a son.
He's gotta beat
the best wrestler
in his weight class.
All right.
It's a deal.
Oh, uh, hey, soup...
Remember junior year,
we had that crazy
outbreak of jock itch?
The one that kept us
out of divisionals.
You know
who that started with?
Who?
Your mom.
Gary: Look, there comes
a time in every man's life
Where he has to bite
the bullet and he
just has to admit
That he's been wrong
about something for years.
This better be
about me.
I said on the radio
that I let soup Campbell
Win a wrestling match
against me in 1988.
The truth is soup Campbell
beat me, Gary Brooks,
Fair and square.
Wow. I can't believe
how well he's handling this.
So the match is off,
Because I am both
a liar and a quitter.
[no audio]
Daniel, don't chicken out
on me now.Liar and a quitter.
If you lock in a "c"
and I manage a "d,"
Everything will go
according to plan.
Do I have your word?
Good.
Did you see
"Jersey Shore" last night?
Snooki is a hot mess.
Ok. Gotta go. Bye.
Hi, Louise.
Oh, hi, mom. I'm gonna
go do my homework.
No, no. No, you're not.
Listen, um...
I need some help
with some U.S.
History questions,
So, uh, can you sit?
Yeah.
Um, so Lewis and Clark,
They died
in the Alamo, right?
Uh, I--I think so.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know
George Washington,
When he
freed the slaves,
Was that before
or after he invented
the light bulb?
Um, I- couldn't tell you
one way or the other.
Hmm.
Ok.
Hey, you--you know
who was a pretty
good president?
Nixon.
Yeah, if you like a leader
who escalated a questionable war
By launching
an offensive into Cambodia
After winning the election
on a secret plan to end
that very war.
But you might be right.
Oh, gosh!
Come on, Louise. I know
you know your history.
Why are you
pretending you don't?
We're trying to help
our friend Marjorie.
Our class is on a curve,
and some of our grades
Are so high that she
might fail and get held back.
Honey,
you're a good friend,
Ok, but you can't
let your grades suffer.
If you wanna help her,
Why don't you
offer to tutor her
after school?
That's not going to be enough.
She's a terrible test taker.
You know what?
That's the only way I'm
gonna let you help her.
Ok? She's gonna
have the same
problems next year.
What are you gna do,
tank your tests again?
Uh, no way.
Next year, colleges start
looking at transcripts.
I'm going to drop her
like a hot rock.
Oh. Good.
All right, so let me
teach you some
takedowns, ok?
Hey, dad, if I wanna get
on the wrestling team,
I wanna do it myself.
Ok, but you
gotta be prepared,
'cause you don't know
what I went through to--
You're gonna
make the team.
You just gotta win.
Let me show you
some takedowns,
show you some moves,
Show you what it's lik
to be real man.
Be a real man.
Ok. Curtis, get down
on your hands and knees.
You...
Just a reminder. We have
to see each other
at work on Monday. Ok?
Just help me out here.
I'm gonna show my son
some moves.
All right, son,
the key to establishing
dominance in a match
Is you gotta really
ride your man.
Ride him good, all right?
Control his hips.
Make sure you're
the boss of his hips.
You stay back
behind his bottom, where
you can control everything.
Don't be afraid
to throw the cross-face.
Really get it in there.
You can feel his lips
right up against your skin.
Take your knuckles.
Dig it into his hips.
Aah! Come on! Hey!
Man, I might wanna
have kids someday.
All right.
Wait. You're gonna
have kids with your hips?
Yeah, man.
I--I need my hips
To do the thing
to get the kid.
All right.
All right, get up.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's just go over
what we learned, ok?
Yeah, I got it, dad.
Hand control,
stay off my back,
And if I'm doin'
the fireman's carry,
Don't be afraid
to shoot the crotch.
You gotta shoot
the crotch, right?
Bump, bump.
Both: Shoot the crotch!
You gotta shoot it
in there.
Go do some homework
or somethin', ok?
He doesn't understand.
It's killin' me
That I had to backut
of that match with--with soup.
It's makin' me nuts.
Yeah, but you don't want
Tom to win for you.
You want Tom
to win for him.
I understand that,
But let me
tell you somethin'.
I would love a piece
of that soup guy.
I would love a piece
of that soup guy.
I know.
I know.
All right.
See you later.
Thanks for helping out.
No problem, brother.
Hey, just for the record,
When my hand slipped
off your hip, I was
goin' for your ankle.
We don't need to talk
about it. It just--
it never happened.
All right, son, don't forget
that fireman's carry.
Shoot the crotch, ok?
Ok, yeah.
'cause whenever
you're in there,
keep your back straight.
Shoot the crotch.
Ok.
Just shoot it
right up there, all right?
Allison, why don't
you come on over here
and help us out?
Hasn't my crotch done
enough for this family?
Uh, honey,
uh, no pressure,
But here comes
a very pretty girl.
Hey. I'm Jessica.
Are you wrestling next?
Uh, yeah. I'm Tom.
Are you, uh--
you gonna watch?
Yeah, I got
a really good seat,
on top of you
In the middle
of the mat.
Oh.
Well,
that sounds awesome,
But I gotta wrestle
someone first.
Um, honey,
I think you're
wrestling her.
Oh, god.
Dad, I'm wrestling
a girl?
Ok, you didn't
train me for this.
How am I supposed to shoot
the crotch, all right?
In health class,
They told me to ask
permission before
I shoot the crotch.
Soup,
what the heck's
goin' on here?
You tryin'
to embarrass my kid
or what?
You said you wanted him
to do it on his own,
So I put him up against
the best wrestler on the team.
That's Jessica. But now
that I think about it,
If he loses to a girl,
that'd be pretty embarrassing.
Oops.
All right, Tommy, big deal.
You're wrestling a girl.
Just one thing.
Don't let it
get in the way, ok?
Ok, dad,
I don't know how much
you know about girls,
But there's
more than a few things
that can get in the way.
All right, shake hands.
And wrestle.
Gary: Easy.
Easy, guys.
All right,
shoot it, Tommy!
Shoot!
Ok!
Take it.
But be
a gentleman,
honey.
Ow. Ow.
You're hurting me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry. Oh, god!
No!
[blows whistle]
Winner!
No!
Uh, honey, honey,
Uh, why don't we get
some sweatpants on you?
I think Jessica
realizes how much
You enjoyed the match.
There you go.
That didn't take long.
Ah, I'm sorry, dad.
I know how much
You humiliated yourself
for me to get this shot.
Plus I, uh--I totally
got to second base without
even touching first.
You know what I mean?
Don't worry
about it, Tommy.
Some people
just don't know how
to play fair, ok?
All right,
you be a good sport.
You go over there
and shake Jessica's
hand, ok?
For what it's worth,
Gary, um,
I'm proud of you.
Proud of me
for what?
No matter what
I did, I couldn't
help Tommy.
Look, you know what?
You did.
You let him know
that it's ok for a man
To swallow his pride
when someone else's
feelings are on the line.
I mean,
that's a much bigger deal
Than getting
on any team, Gary.
Besides, look.
He doesn't look like
he's suffering too much.
Hey, uh, dad,
Jessica just told me
About this ballroom dancing
class she takes after school,
And she wants me
to be her partner.
Oh, instead
of wrestling?
Yeah. Well, I mean,
ballroom dancing with Jessica
Sounds like a lot more fun
than holding some sweaty guy
between my thighs.
Yeah. Tell me about it.
Another Brooks
gets pinned.
The dynasty
of failure continues.
Heh heh. Ok, soup.
That's terrific.
Look, Tommy, if it's
all right with you
And if your mom
doesn't think
I'm setting
a bad example,
I think
I'd like to really
Kick soup Campbell's
ass on this mat
once and for all.
I'm good.
Go for it.
Let's go, soup.
You and me
right now.
I'm havin' soup
for dinner.
Dad, can we
have soup for dinner?
Shut up, donny.
All right, I got
30 seconds to spare.
You on top
or me on top?
I'll start on bottom.
All right.
I figure you could use
all the help you can get.
Do us a favor, allison.
Count us in.
Uh, 1, 2, 3.
Wrestle.
Ohh! Ow!
I think you broke my ribs!
Oh, really?
No, not really.
Yes. Ha!
How's that feel, soup?
Not so good. I think
I fell on my keys.
Gah! You ready to give up?
Are you kidding me?
I got you right
where I want you.
I think you sat
in some gum.
That's not my ass, soup.
That's yours.
You think
I'm letting go,
you're high.
I will die on this mat.
You will be pinning
my corpse.
[cell phone rings]
Ah, that's my phone.
Do you mind?
Nah, I don't mind.
Wh-where is it? Right here?
Wait. No funny business.
Ok.
Joe Campbell's phone.
Oh, hi, Robin.
[whispering]
it's your wife.
[whispering]
tell her I'm not here.
Ok.
Uh, Robin, Joe stepped out
for a minute.
It's Gary Brooks.
I'm good. Thanks.
Uh, can I take
a message, though?
Pick up, uh,
skim milk and eggs
And remind him to take
his lipitor. You got it.
Bye, Robin.
Don't forget
to take your Lipitor.
Cholesterol?
Yeah. Ah, they think
it's genetic,
But what
do they know?
Doctors, right?
Yeah. Uh,
they're closin' up.
How long have we been here?
I don't know.
I'm starvin'. You wanna
order a pizza or something?
Aw, I can't.
The cheese.
Oh, right. Sorry.
Don't let it
stop you, though.
If you get me
a salad,
I'll be fine.
Salad? I'd rather
have the pizza.

[both screaming]
[laughing]
[laughing]
Whoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yes!
Yeah!
My brother!
How long are you home for?
Well, let's see,
the rest of my life.
My time in the marines
is up, man.
I'm a civilian now.
Whoo!
Ha ha.
My man. Let's play
some video games.
Want to play, what,
"Gears of War."
My--
What, too soon?
Yeah, a little bit.
All right, we'll play
"Mario Kart" or something.
Work our way up,
have a seat.
Nice.
I'm gonna get
a whole bunch of beer
And some adult diapers,
that way we don't have
to get up for a while.
Hey, so what
are you going to do
now what you're home?
I don't know.
Uh, economy's kinda
bad right now.
Kinda thought I'd be
painting with you,
But now you're this
big radio guy, so.
I don't know,
you got any ideas?
You can do whatever you want,
You know,
you got lots of talent.
The world's your oyster,
what do you want to do?
Hey, what if I was on
the radio with you?
You know, like a sidekick.
Yeah, nice try,
though, Mitch.
You have no radio
experience at all.
I did a ton of radio work
in Afghanistan.
You were calling in
air strikes.
Come on, man,
we're really funny together.
Any time we play Xbox,
we always get some
good banter going.
No, that's not banter.
It's you yelling at me,
calling me a woman,
Telling me you're gonna
go in the kitchen,
Make me midol
sandwiches.
[laughs] see?
That funny!
Actually, that is
pretty funny.
Yeah!
All right, look,
I'll talk to Sasha first thing,
But I can't promise anything,
all right?
Hey, I really
appreciate it, bro.
What do you say to a quick game
of midnight "Madden"?
"Madden"?
Yeah.
Been a while.
Let me switch teams, though, ok?
Well, the way you play,
I assumed you already had.

All right, thanks
for coming in,
I'll let you know,
Jagger.
You might hire
an assistant named Jagger?
That is awesome!
There's a guy in ad sales
named Keith.
We'll have half the band.
Well, I am not
hiring Jagger,
Because under
special skills,
He listed
"keepin' it real."
[chuckles] well, hey,
speaking of hiring people,
You know, my brother Mitch
just got back from the war.
He was over in Afghanistan.
And, well, I kinda told him
I would talk to you--
Oh, hang on a second,
Gary, that's my phone.
Which I still have
to answer myself.
Though I'm running
out of fake voices.
[Australian accent]
g'day, mate,
Sasha Warden's
office.
Hold on, please.
[normal voice]
just come talk to me
in a minute, ok?
Ok.
Hey, Gary,
guess what, man?
Ok, I'll give you a hint,
I'll give you a hint.
What are three words
you swore you would
never say again?
"I'm getting married."
I'm getting married!
Oh.
Congratulations,
I guess.
What, uh,
What, the
is the charm?
Yeah, oh, man,
Charlene and I,
We went out
and had a real nice
romantic weekend
up in Big Bear.
I'm talking long walks,
Red wine,
Hot tub. It was like
a two-day cialis commercial.
She laid the law down,
didn't she?
Pretty much. Yeah.
Yeah, we've been
seeing each other
for about six years, man.
If I didn't propose
this weekend,
They'd have been
pulling my body
out of that hot tub
And checking
my fingernails for dna.
Hey, Gary,
hey, Curtis.
Oh, great.
You know, I was just
about to tell you
All the reasons
you shouldn't get married,
And they just walked in
right behind me.
It just so happens
Curtis asked me
To help plan
his wedding.
Yeah, we wanted an elegant,
classy wedding,
And Charlene says
that Alison is
The classiest woman
she knows.
Also, I need Alison
to curb my baby's spending.
You know, I have
a hard time saying no.
Huh, well, Alison
has no problem
saying, "no," at all.
She likes to say, "no."
She also likes to say,
"over my dead body."
That's a big one.
With her,
if she does say yes,
You'll feel like
you're on top
of a dead body.
In which case,
I was the only
stiff in the room.
Mmm!
Yeah.
Well.
Is Charlene here?
We have to go
look for dresses.
Yeah, we were in the booth
listening to bands.
Hey, Charlene?
Baby, I almost forgot.
We're going to need
to go through this guest list
To find out
who's afraid of peacocks,
'cause they gonna want
to sit away from the aisle.
Oh, that's good.
She's smart.
Hey, Charlene!
Hey!
Congratulations!
Thank you!
Oh, my gosh.
You just snared yourself
one of the world's most
eligible bachelors.
I just got a 40-year-old guy
who's been married twice
And sleeps on a futon.
But I'm gonna fix all that.
Ha, all right!
Charlene,
don't worry,
You're going to have
a great wedding.
It's gonna be tasteful,
sophisticated.
Oh, no, I'm not worried,
'cause I got ideas.
Bam.
Oh.
Uh, wow.
I don't think this
is the kind of thing
Peaches and Herb would get
together for, yeah.
I thought u guys
talked about
Staying within
a certain budget?
Budget, ok,
I'll tell you
the budget.
Charlene's wedding
is so beautiful
that people cry.
That's the budget.
Uh, I think the caterer's
looking for something
more like a dollar figure.
Curtis?
You know, you can't
put a number on love.
So...
So we started talking
about what Mitch
wanted to do, and--
Oh, hang on
a second, Gary.
Yeah, she not here
right now, man,
she call you back.
Look, I was thinking
maybe Mitch could be
a sidekick on my show.
[normal voice]
oh, listen, Gary,
I would love
to add more comedy
to the show,
But financially,
I don't see how
that's going to work.
What? Whoa, whoa?
Add more comedy?
Yeah, you don't
tell a guy like me
to add more comedy.
You didn't think
it was funny today
When I did
Joe Pesci talking
about the Lakers?
I thought you were
doing urkel.
What?! No.
It was Joe Pesci.
Like--[imitating Joe Pesci]
what do you mean?
Kobe Bryant's like a joke,
what, does he amuse you?
He's some kind of clown?
He's a clown?
I'm hearing urkel.
[normal voice] what?
Look, Mitch will
work for free
Until he proves himself.
Here's the thing--
a long time ago,
He made a really big
sacrifice for me.
I owe him. Please.
Ok, ok, you can
try him out.
But if it doesn't
work, you're gonna
have to fire him.
You ready
to face that?
Yeah, great.
I don't care.
Thanks.
How do you not know
"Goodfellas"?
I was nine
when it came out.
Look, do you know
anything from
"The Goonies"?
"Aladdin"?
"3 Ninjas Kick Back"?
All right,
here's a prediction.
Jason Bay
of the Mets
is going to hit
45 diamond ringers this year.
I know he had a rough stretch--
whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you just say
"diamond ringers"?
Yeah. Yeah,
it's my new thing
for a home run.
"Jason Bay with another
diamond ringer."
That doesn't sound like
a home run to me.
How about something like,
"johnny's dough boy."
What?
Yeah.
Ooh, ooh, how about
this, how about,
"Manny Ramirez
just dropped
a hot bag of nasty
Into the bleachers."
You really--you think
that sounds better?
All right,
hold that thought, Mitch.
We got a call.
Who's this?
Jerry from Glendale.
Jerry from Glendale,
you're on the air, go ahead.
Jerry:
You're an idiot, Brooks.
Jason Bay
is the luckiest guy
in baseball.
If he hits three
home runs this year,
I'll pay your salary.
Which can't be much,
because you suck.
Ha ha, ok, Jerry.
Hey, Jerry,
this is Mitch.
Never talk
to my brother
that way again.
You understand?
We got
your phone number.
I'm going to reverse
white page you,
Come to your house
and show you
How I can tie
your shoe from
inside your mouth!
Hey, uh, Mitch,
It's ok to have attitude,
But you gotta, like,
pull it back a little bit.
Just a little,
just dial it back.
All right, roger that,
loud and clear.
Just like firing
a semi-auto.
All right. Here we go.
Let's take another call.
We have Nate in Venice.
Nate, you're on the air,
what's up?
Nate: I don't know.
Diamond ringers
Sounds a little soft, bro.
Hey, Gary's not
your bro, Nate.
Gary, who is this dude?
Whoa, whoa!
I'll tell you who I am,
I'm your nightmare,
captain,
That's who I am.
I'm the man who
steals your mom
From your dad
and ruins his life.
Then I get your mom
to marry me,
And I dump her
at the altar!
Then I go back
and marry your dad!
Huh?
How's that
for soft, Nate?
[dial tone]
Let's take a little break.
This is "The Score"
with Gary Brooks.
And machine gun Mitch!
Ha ha, this is fun.
Yeah, a real riot.
[chuckles]
I thought that went--
fire him.
Ok.
Hey.
Hey. Uh, Mitch, buddy,
we gotta talk.
Things are going
great, right?
Yeah, it's definitely
going great.
I just think maybe
your talents
Are being misused in here,
you know?
What's going on?
You gonna fire me?
Well--
oh, my god.
You're gonna fire
your brother.
[chuckles] no.
No, Mitch.
It's just, uh...
I'm promoting you.
You are now Sasha Warden's
assistant. Congratulations.
Really?
Yep.
I don't know.
I don't know,
seems like kind of
a lower position.
No, it's not.
It's corporate, man.
I gotta be honest
with you, Mitch.
Anybody could do this
on-air stuff.
You sit down,
you talk, it's easy.
But you know what
I saw in here today?
A businessman.
A businessman?
Like Donald Trump.
The donald.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Now you think about it.
You got the perfect mind
for business, Mitch.
You're logical,
you're mathematical,
You're ruthless.
I mean, you're gonna
start as an assistant.
But I give you six months,
You're gonna be
running this place!
And Sasha signed off
on this?
Are you kidding me?
It was practically her idea.
This is great.
Thanks, man,
I appreciate it.
Ok!
Ha ha!
Yeah!
Oh, look. Oh.
Hey! Yeah!
Yeah! Ha ha ha!
You want Mitch
to be my assistant?
After what he did
on the radio?
Absolutely not.
All right, so he's not
an on-air type of guy.
That doesn't mean
he's not qualified
to be an assistant.
He told a little boy
He was going
to drop-kick him
into traffic.
All right, look,
here's the thing.
Mitch and I,
we look out
for each other.
I really let him down.
When we were in
our twenties,
We were both supposed
to go into the Marines
together, ok?
I was literally
in the recruiter's office
When I got the call
that Alison was pregnant,
And I bailed.
So now you feel like
you owe him?
I totally feel like
I owe the guy, ok?
Please, help me on this one.
I'm asking you,
as your boyfriend.
That is not fair.
We said we were going
To keep our relationship
and work separate.
Yeah, that was before
I really needed something.
[telephone rings]
Besides, how many more accents
do you have left in you?
Actually,
I have one more,
But I'm pretty sure
it's offensive.
Sasha Warden's office.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Wong.
Oh, that was close!
Tell him he can
start tomorrow.
Ok.
Look, Charlene,
you can't come down
the aisle on a zebra!
I mean, like,
Where would you even
get one of those?
I mean, at the zoo,
they don't have
a "need a zebra,
Take a zebra" tray
out front.
I am the bride!
And the bride gets
what she wants.
So I don't want
to hear anymore
"can'ts" or "too bigs",
And stop telling me
Marvin Gaye died in 1984!
Ooh.
Look, I don't
want to say this
in front of her,
But I'm on
your side.
No, you have to say it
in front of her,
Curtis, ok?
You cannot have
Zebras in your wedding,
Or a snow machine,
or acrobats.
And even if I could get
an ice sculpture that big,
I don't think david blaine
is going to want to sit
in it for three days!
I know she can be
a little overbearing,
But she's nervous,
and this is how she
expresses anxiety.
Trust me, she really is
an incredible woman.
Ok, look, look,
I love Charlene, ok?
But she's acting
like a nutcase!
I'm sorry, you know what,
I shouldn't have said that
About your future bride, ok.
I just--I don't want
to see you get, you know,
Walked all over
for the rest of your life.
Oh, please,
like you didn't boss
Gary around
for 15 years?
Actually, it was 19
if you include high school.
Ok, look, this is
our relationship!
She makes every decision.
And I say
the word "baby" a lot.
All right?
It works for us, ok?
Well...
Now just tell me,
Is there anything
on our list
I can afford?
Uh, well, let's see.
Do you feel
comfortable waxing
The bridesmaid's
privates into
the shape of hearts?
Um, considering
the three of them
are my sisters, no.
Ugh!
[telephone rings]
Sasha Warden's
office.
Uh, she is on
a call right now,
Can I take
a message?
All right,
anniversary
of uncle's death.
Place flowers
at gravesite.
Got it.
Hey, tgif.
All right!
Look at you, man!
Look at me!
Climbing the ladder.
See you at the top, M.B.
Not if I see
you first, J.B.
[both chuckle]
excuse me.
Ah, god!
Aah!
I'm here to see
Gary Brooks.
Mitch, that's Joe Torre,
manager of the Dodgers!
Let him up!
Sorry, Mr. Torre.
I'm Gary Brooks.
That's my maniac brother Mitch.
Sorry, Mr. Torre.
Shouldn't sneak up
behind me, though.
Military kind of
trained me to kill
people who do that.
Well, thanks...
Thanks for your
military service,
Really appreciate it.
Hey, I know we got off
to an awkward start,
But you think
there's any way we can
get an autograph?
Oh, sure.
Ahh!
Aah!
Mitch, Mitch!
I was just going
for my pen.
Uh, Mr. Torre,
I'm sorry,
Would you excuse me
for a second
While I talk
to my brother?
Sure.
Ok, we'll be right with you.
Mitch, can I talk to you
for a second here?
Sure, Gar. Hey, just
give me one second
To get someone
to cover my desk.
Torre, cover my desk.
Mitch, this is not
working out, ok?
Sorry.
I'm getting fired?
Yes.
You said I was
cut out for business!
I only told you
that 'cause
You're so terrible
on the radio.
Oh, no, no, you said
I nailed it on the radio.
What's going on, Gary?
Mitch, I gotta
let you go.
You just put
Joe Torre
in a headlock.
You kinda freak
everybody out.
So this is where
you bail on me, huh?
Just like when
we joined the Marines.
I didn't bail, Mitch.
I had a responsibility.
Well, if it looks like a bail
and smells like a bail...
That doesn't...
All right, look,
It doesn't matter,
Mitch, ok?
I'm done
helping you.
You never started
helping me, all right?
Doing nothing
would have been better
Than setting me up
to fail, twice.
Look, I'm home
from the service
And I just need
a little support.
And you let me down, bro.
Now I know how Rambo felt.
Hey.
Nice grouping.
Yeah, it's amazing,
You put them all
through the same
hole like that.
Believe it or not,
There are some things
I actually do pretty good.
I can see.
What do you want, Gary?
Is that
a .357 magnum?
Yeah, it is.
Just, uh,
just checking, ok.
What I've been holding
around for 16 years,
it has to stop, ok?
You and I were
supposed to go into
the Marines together,
But we didn't.
You know why
I didn't, Mitch?
Because I had a family
that was about to happen.
Alison was pregnant,
I had to care for my wife
And my unborn child.
I had to be a grown-up.
And I suggest
you start acting like
a grown-up, too, Mitch.
And as far as what
you want to do for
the rest of your life,
You've got to figure
that out for yourself.
[gunshot]
if that's ok with you.
You know what, Gary?
What, is this the part
where you kill me? Heh.
You're absolutely right.
This is the part
where you kill me?!
No.
No, no. I mean,
you tried to help me out,
you did everything you could,
And I just screwed it up.
And I wanted to blame you,
because...
Well, because.
'cause I'm scared, Gary!
I'm so scared!
[sobbing]
Whoa!
I'm scared,
too, Mitch!
Mitch, get it away!
When I was in the Marines,
you know, I knew who I was,
But now, I don't even know!
That's why I was so happy
to see you when I came out!
You know?
[sobbing]
Yeah.
Yeah, you were
happy 'cause
We could sit
on the couch,
watch football,
Drink beer
like guys, right?
No, no, no!
'cause I figured
you'd be able
To help me
figure out who I am,
But that's not fair!
I mean, I have
to do that! Me!
Not you! Me!
I gotta do it,
and you, you told me
what I needed to hear!
And that's why I love you
so much, Gary!
[sobbing]
Thanks, guys.
Charlene's going
to be here any second
for the food tasting.
Hey, uh, what's
this black stuff
called again?
It's called rhythm
and blues, tom, ok?
It's for the party
afterwards,
And we don't
call it "black stuff"
in this house!
I was talking about this.
[chuckles]
That's caviar.
Oh.
Hey, kids, go get
your stuff, ok?
Ok.
Hey, Gary, I heard
you talked to Mitch.
Good for you.
Look, Charlene and Curtis
are going to come over
Any sec to taste some food,
if you want to hang out.
What's going on
around here?
You seem super calm.
I thought you said
Charlene was
making you nuts,
Curtis wouldn't
stand up to her.
Well, that was before
I discovered my secret weapon
That solved both problems.
Alison, you cannot
drink all day, ok?
That is not
my secret weapon.
And, yes, I can.
Alison, I'm going
to make this thing
easier on everybody.
All this picking
and choosing,
It's just too much,
And it's driving
everybody crazy.
Right,
so I have decided
To have it all!
I want a little bit
of everything!
I want people
to go home and say,
"damn! I never had
pheasant or caviar!
Tonight I had both!"
Ok, time for
the secret weapon.
Ahem. Mitch.
Curtis, Gary.
And this stunning beauty
must be Charlene.
I've heard so much
about you.
Ooh! I like
this one! So you--
Lock it down, squeaky toy!
I'm running the show
from here on out.
You can talk
when I'm finished.
Now, we've got
budget considerations.
There will be no arrival
on white horses.
There will be
no harp orchestra.
However, this black stuff
is acceptable.
As is the Marvin Gaye
impersonator,
Who will be singing
such hits as
"heard it through
the grapevine,"
"what's goin' on,"
and of course,
"sexual healing."
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Good, moving on.
Curtis?
Yeah.
It's time
to stone up, man.
You are a man?
Mm-hmm.
You have two testicles.
Yeah.
I suggest
you deploy them.
Um, all right.
Um, ahem.
[deep voice]
um, Charlene...
We want the wedding
to be nice,
But we did
set a budget.
Now there is an assortment
of bridal bouquets,
Corsages, and nose gaze
in the living room.
I suggest that we
go in there,
Take a look at them,
and pick something
Within our price range,
But that is still
as beautiful as you are.
Oh, baby!
Move, move, move!
Thank you.
Hey, I owe you
a big thank you, man.
Got my ass in gear,
and I think I figured out
Exactly what I want to do
with the rest of my life.
A wedding planner?
No. No.
I mean, I'm good
at it, but...
I need to be doing something
that makes a difference,
You know,
where people's lives
are on the line.
I want to be a Marine.
Mitch, come on,
you don't have
to say that
Just 'cause you can't
think of something
else, you know?
I'm not just saying it,
Gary, all right?
I love the Marines.
I'm good at it.
It's where I'm happiest.
So after Curtis' wedding,
I'm going back in.
I'm gonna
miss you, buddy.
And I know
I'm your older brother,
But I want to be you
when I grow up.
