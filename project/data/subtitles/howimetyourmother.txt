TED:
Okay where were we?
It was June of 2006,
and life had just taken
an unexpected turn.
Dad, can't you
just skip ahead
to the part
where you meet Mom?
I feel like you've been talking
for like a year.
Honey, all this stuff
I'm telling you is important.
It's all part of the story.
Could I go to
the bathroom?
No.
The summer of 2006
was both wonderful and awful.
<i>For me, it started out great.</i>
<i>In fact, day one was amazing.</i>
<i>I'd finally gotten together</i>
<i>with Robin.</i>
<i>But while I'd been off having</i>
<i>one of the best nights</i>
<i>of my life, your uncle Marshall</i>
<i>had been having one</i>
<i>of the worst nights of his.</i>
* Crying in the street... *
MARSHALL:
<i>So that's it?</i>
We're breaking up?
Marshall, I'm sorry.
I just...
I just need to go
to San Francisco and do this art
program and-and figure out
who I am outside of us.
And the only way
that I can do that is if...
if we don't talk for a while.
For a while.
Try never, okay?
You walk out that door,
and we're done.
You're never going to hear
my voice again.
I should call her.
No, No.
Ted it is--
If you call her
when she asked you not to
you're just going to look weak
and you're going to regret it.
Now, listen, whenever
you feel like calling her,
you come find me first.
And I will punch
you in the face.
You're a good friend, Ted.
(knock at door)
Hey.
So, did you hear the big news?
You mean how Lily and Marshall
broke up,
and Lily's gone
and nothing else
even remotely important happened
last night,
yeah, I think he knows.
Oh, my God.
I-I'm so sorry.
Wh--
What happened?
Well, she left.
And I don't even know
if she's coming back.
I didn't get your message
until I woke up.
Bro, I am
so sorry.
Thanks.
I know
it must be tough,
but are you ready
to hear something
that will not only
make you feel better,
but will actively
excite you?
Sure.
For the first time, <i>ever,</i>
the three of us are single
at the same time.
I've dreamed
about this day, boys,
and it's going to be
legendary.
Together, we will own this city.
Anytime a girl wants to get back
at her ex-boyfriends,
we'll be there.
Anytime a girl wants to solve
her father issues
through promiscuity and binge
drinking, we will be there.
Anytime a bachelorette party
drives through the city
in a limo, sticking their
heads out the sunroof shouting,
(mimicking female voice):
"What's up, New York?"
we will be what is up New York.
Gentlemen, we are
about to embark on...
Aw, man, you guys
did it, didn't you?
<i>One thing I learned that summer</i>
<i>is that when love</i>
<i>is beginning...</i>
(moans)
<i>...and love is ending,</i>
<i>the first 30 days</i>
<i>are remarkably similar.</i>
<i>For one thing, you spend</i>
<i>most of your time in bed.</i>
(moans)
(groans)
<i>Your friends can't stand</i>
<i>to listen to you.</i>
He's so ticklish.
It was a really beautiful song.
So... stupid, man.
(mimicking choking)
<i>And you never seem</i>
<i>to wear pants.</i>
(sighs)
Hey, Marshall.
Hey, Ted.
You hungry?
What's the point?
I could eat some food.
It's just going to leave me.
Well, at least in that scenario
you get to do the dumping.
Come on, it's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.
Lily always made the pancakes.
God, I loved her pancakes.
So soft.
So warm.
So perfectly shaped.
Are we still talking
about her pancakes?
Come on, you got to eat
something; what can I get you?
Beer.
No, that's what you had
for dinner.
Fine.
Then I'll just have leftovers.
BARNEY:
<i>So, he stays home</i>
all the time <i>not</i> getting laid?
No, see,
that's what you do when you have
a fianc\e.
He should be down here
celebrating.
He's free.
He got that redheaded tumor
removed.
You should write and illustrate
children's books.
You know what Marshall
needs to do.
He needs to stop being sad.
When I get sad, I stop being sad
and be awesome instead.
True story.
It's only been a month.
He just needs to go
at his own pace.
Anyway, Lily's the one
who caused this whole mess.
Hey, cut her
some slack.
She's our friend, too.
She's just trying to
figure out who she is.
Figure out who she is?
Yeah, she should call me;
I got a whole list.
She's selfish.
She's immature.
She's...
What?
God, your eyes
are so blue.
Aw, Teddy Bear.
(mimics sword unsheathing)
Oh that's a...
(groans)
(coughs)
<i>Yeah, it was hard to feel</i>
<i>too bad.</i>
<i>I was dating the woman</i>
<i>of my dreams,</i>
<i>and things were going great.</i>
<i>Well, for the most part.</i>
So, I found her shampoo.
MARSHALL:
I guess she left it here.
It smells like her.
Like lavender and seashells
and hope.
Somehow,
erotic and comforting
all at the same time.
That's my shampoo.
Oh, sorry.
Mmm, I thought
he'd never go to sleep.
(moans)
Uh-oh.
Already?
He's calling her.
I don't hear any--
He's calling her.
No.
(screams)
MARSHALL:
Okay, you're right,
I won't call her.
I will not call her.
Well, I called her.
And get this,
she changed her number.
What, like I'm going
to stalk her,
or something?
Like she's <i>so</i> special.
Like she's the only Lily Aldrin
out there.
'Cause there are four others
in the San Francisco area alone,
and they all seem
a lot better than her
based on the brief conversations
I had with them.
Does he know
I'm in here?
Yeah, hey, Robin.
Anyways, one of the
Lily Aldrins said...
This has to stop.
Ted, we just started dating.
We agreed we don't want
to move too fast,
and yet somehow,
we have a baby.
He can't feed
himself.
He cries a lot,
he keeps us up all night.
Have you tried breast-feeding?
Nailed it!
Look, they were
together nine years.
It's only been a
month and a half.
He just needs to
go at his own pace.
He slept on our floor
last night, Ted.
He watched a
scary movie.
It is time
for some tough love.
We need to get him
out of that apartment.
He needs fresh air.
He needs sunshine.
Mmm, sunshine.
ANNOUNCER (over speaker):
Please welcome to the stage,
Sunshine.
All right, I really don't think
this is going to help.
Do you know why you're
not over Lily yet?
It's 'cause you can
still picture her naked.
You can't get over a woman
until you can no longer
picture her boobs;
it's a scientific fact.
The average male brain can
only store a finite number
of boob images
or "b-pegs".
And your hard drive's filled
to capacity with Lily's.
There are a lot of them.
Well, they won't go away
until you overwrite them
with images of
other women's boobs.
Now, this
journey may take
as many as a
million boobs,
so we begin here
tonight, my friend.
Two at a time.
Those count as four.
Yeah.
This is fun right?
We're outside, it's
a beautiful day.
The Indians are winning.
I got to admit,
it is really nice
to be outside.
ANNOUNCER (over speaker):
Yankee fans,
please turn your attention
to the Diamond Vision
for a special
seventh-inning-stretch surprise.
Oh, no.
(crowd sighing)
(applause and cheering)
It's all a big lie!
She's just going
to break your heart.
(crowd booing)
You can drag me out of here,
but she has no soul!
We've tried everything--
baseball, strippers.
The guy still won't eat
a damn pancake.
I think he's beyond repair.
See, this is the problem
with guys.
You don't know how to deal
with heartbreak.
Oh, and what's your
prescription, Dr. Estrogen?
Eat Haagen-Dazs
and watch <i>Love Actually,</i>
till your periods sync up.
(Ted, Barney laughing)
Yeah, that's the stuff.
Oh, my God.
How long have you
been doing this?
Well, my dad taught me
to me shoot when I was a kid.
Whenever I'm feeling lonely
or depressed, I come here,
and it reminds me that...
guns are fun.
(chuckles lightly)
Um, you know, Ted is
kind of against guns.
And that's why
Ted's never going
to find out about this.
Whoa, that sounded
kind of scary
with me holding a gun,
didn't it?
No, I-I just mean,
please don't tell Ted.
You want to try?
Only hell yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, this
is what I needed.
I felt so powerless
this whole time,
but this... (laughs)
this is power.
This is...
(gasps)
I should of mentioned
the recoil.
I got to hand it to you,
when he got home,
Marshall was smiling--
did you sleep with him?
'Cause I was actually,
like, three days away
from suggesting that.
Sometimes, all you need
is to get in touch
with your feminine side.
(laughing)
Yeah, yeah!
Well, congratulations.
You're the first person
to cheer him up all summer.
You win.
Oh, what do I win?
I'll tell you what you win:
I'm taking you away
this weekend.
You are?
Mmm.
That's so nice.
Yeah, my aunt and uncle
have a beach house
out in Montauk, oh,
it's really romantic.
My uncle's had like
three affairs there.
Wow, must be a nice house,
I've seen pictures
of your uncle.
This is going
to be so great.
We'll finally get
some time alone.
Are you sure Marshall's
going to be okay with this?
Yeah, absolutely.
Dude, I'm doing much better.
Oh.
In fact, take my car.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey, thanks...
and, hey,
if you need anything day
or night, just call me--
You know what,
please don't call me.
What? What's wrong?
It's, uh,
Lily's credit card bill.
She must have forgotten
to switch her address.
So?
So, I wonder what kind
of charges she's making
out there in San Francisco.
No.
No, no good can come
from looking at this.
You've made too much
progress already.
I know but I just,
maybe the--
No!
You're going to
thank me for this.
You're a good friend, Ted.
August 5th,
one charge-- tickets.
To what? George Clinton
and the P-Funk All-Stars.
August 10th, one charge:
Tennis Emporium.
August 18th, two charges:
Mario's Bistro
and, get this, Pet Palace.
You guys see what
this means, right?
Wow, Mario's Bistro.
What a perfect place
to whore around.
Only the best
for my little Lily pad.
Oh, funk legend
George Clinton,
I am so glad you spotted
me at your concert
and dragged me onstage to dance
with you Courtney Cox-style.
And I'm so glad you agreed
to play tennis with me.
Aw.
You know, Marshall
tried to get me
to play tennis
for nine years,
but I didn't do it, because
I never truly loved him.
I got you a gift.
Oh.
A ferret.
Oh, I'll buy it some food
next door at the Pet Palace.
Oh, I've always wanted one,
but Marshall had this
secret phobia of ferrets.
I bet that's something he made
you promise not to tell nobody.
(laughing):
It was.
Oh.
I love you, funk
legend George Clinton.
I love you, too, Lily.
That's right, Marshall,
she's all mine.
Now I'm gonna let her play
with my hair.
* Ow, we want the funk *
* Give up the funk... *
That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard.
Yeah, why are you
afraid of ferrets?
They're adorable.
Because, Robin, they're like
fuzzy, tube-shaped rats.
Plus, those charges are
from, like, a month ago.
Exactly.
For new charges,
you have to go
to her online account.
You can see credit card activity
from, like, two hours ago.
But, you know, don't.
Why do you talk?
Why do you talk?!
BARNEY:
He needs her password.
It's not like he
has her password.
Ooh, this is good,
he has her password.
There's a charge
from earlier today:
the Kellett Hotel on 5th.
I don't believe this.
Lily's back in New York.
I can't believe this.
Lily's in New York?
I-I guess I've been thinking
when she got back,
she'd call me.
That's really
the only reason
I've been able to hold it
together so far this summer.
This has been "holding
it together"?
Okay, you know what?
I'm calling her.
No.
Ted, give me the phone.
You're not calling her,
this changes nothing.
You, come here.
Look, while we're away
this weekend, can you keep
an eye on him, make sure
he doesn't call that hotel?
You want me to babysit him?
(laughs)
20 bucks.
An hour.
And money for pizza.
Uh, yeah, how about
you do it for free
or every time we hang out,
you have to watch this?
Come here.
Ooh.
My little blue-eyed
baby, baby lips.
Ooh, ooh, sugar, sugar...
Okay, I'll do it!
Stop being a couple.
Marshall.
Marshall, Marshall!
Ted, I know I shouldn't
do this, but I have to!
You call her
We were together for
nine years!
and everything
we've been working so hard for
is completely flushed
down the toi...
Hello, Lily Aldrin's
room, please.
Thank you.
Hang up now.
Ted, I can't hang up now.
Hang up now.
The missiles are in the air, and
I know that you don't approve.
Hang up.
Hello.
Uh, a guy answered.
There's-there's a guy
in her room.
I'm going down there.
BARNEY:
Dude, you can't do that.
I have to go down there,
and I have
to tell her I love her; I have
to beg her to take me back,
even if I have to
get down on my knees.
Marshall, you
can't do that.
Oh, really, why not?
TED:
<i>56 days.</i>
<i>That's how long it took me</i>
<i>to get right about here.</i>
Because you're pathetic!
I'm sorry, but right now,
you are not Marshall.
You are the miserable,
whining, shampoo-sniffing
ghost of Marshall,
and frankly, a guy like you
doesn't have a shot
in hell with a girl like Lily.
You know
who might have a shot
somewhere down the line?
Marshall.
The real Marshall.
But if you go down there right
now like this, you're going
to blow it for him, and he's
never going to forgive you.
Of course, whatever I say,
you're just going to do
the opposite,
so have a great weekend.
Good luck screwing up
your life.
Come on, Robin.
(clears throat)
Is it still okay if
we borrow the car?
Bold. Bold to go for the car.
What?
I didn't say a thing.
You think I was
too hard on him.
I didn't say a thing.
(scoffs)
I can't believe you're accusing
me of being too hard on him.
You're the one
who said "tough love."
Yeah, tough love, not
"hand the guy a noose."
Oh, but it's okay
to hand him a nine millimeter?
Yeah, he told me.
So you're a gun nut?
No, I'm a gun enthusiast.
Do you know
how many people
are killed each year
The Second Amendment
protects my right
to bear arms...
in accidents...
All right, all
right, all right.
I was too hard on him.
A little.
(laughs softly)
I'm going to call Barney,
see how they're doing.
(phone rings)
Go for Barney.
Oh, hey, where are you guys?
We're at a fundraiser,
helping young women raise money
for community college.
Strip club, nice.
Is Marshall okay?
(laughs)
Yeah, he's here
and he's great.
Uh, hang on.
Marshall?
Tell Ted that--
Uh-oh.
Already?
What? What uh-oh?
He's gone.
You lost him?
I can't believe this.
He's going to go down
to that hotel.
Crap, you're right.
Okay, okay, here's the plan,
here's the plan.
You go down to the hotel
and find him.
I'll stay here
and get a lap dance.
On three. One, two...
Barney!
Was there a hot tub
at your uncle's place?
A really nice one.
Hi, uh, could you tell me
what room Lily Aldrin's in?
Marshall.
(chuckling):
Hey.
What happened?
Well, I went
up to Lily's floor,
<i>and I had this little speech</i>
<i>in my head--</i>
<i>everything I've been wanting</i>
<i>to say to her all summer</i>
<i>about love, loyalty, respect.</i>
<i>I knocked on the door.</i>
So you knocked out
Lily's new boyfriend?
Yeah.
It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.
What? Who-- who was it?
TED:
<i>His name was Joey Adalian,</i>
<i>although he went by a number</i>
<i>of aliases in his years</i>
<i>as an identity thief.</i>
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>earlier in the summer... </i>
LILY:
Oh, this is so embarrassing.
I-I could have sworn
I had some change.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
Oh, here we go.
No, that's-that's a button.
It was a button.
Do you, uh, take
credit cards?
Yes, I do.
So Lily's not back in town,
and she doesn't
have a boyfriend?
Th-That's good news, right?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Those credit card charges
were the only remaining
connection I had to her.
I don't know where she is
or what she's doing.
She was my whole life, man,
and now she's-she's gone.
You know, first day of
college, I showed up,
I was so freaked out,
and-and I got up to my room,
and there was my roommate,
lying on the bed with
his feet up on the wall.
Had headphones on,
big smile on his face
like he just didn't give a crap.
Happy.
Confident.
Not afraid of anything.
That guy was you.
You before you met Lily.
Ted?
Yeah?
I was high that day.
I was.
I was so high,
I thought you were the dean.
Wh-What I'm saying is
there's a version of
you without Lily,
and it's not this.
You can't let Lily
steal your identity
the way that guy stole hers.
Okay.
Okay, resolved.
Starting tomorrow, I'm
going to start being okay.
(chuckles)
Cheers.
Cheers.
* *
<i>But he wasn't,</i>
<i>'cause that's not</i>
<i>how life works.</i>
<i>The next day, he found one</i>
<i>of her socks or something,</i>
<i>and we were back to square one.</i>
<i>And then, one morning...</i>
Ted, I think
you should see this.
Oh, no, what now?
Marshall,
what are you doing?
It's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.
<i>It took him 67 days</i>
<i>and one really disgusting</i>
<i>batch of pancakes...</i>
So good.
Mmm.
So good.
<i>...but Marshall had come back</i>
<i>from the dead.</i>
<i>Because while baseball,</i>
<i>strippers, and guns can help,</i>
<i>the only thing that can really</i>
<i>heal a broken heart is time.</i>
* I try to laugh about it *
* Cover it all up with lies *
* I try to laugh about it *
* Hiding the tears
from my eyes *
* 'Cause boys don't cry. *
**
Com had been together
for nine wonderful years,
until she dumped him and
ran off to san francisco.
The healing process was taking a long time.
then, one night, he made
a giant leap forward.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
- I'll walk you out.
- See ya.
You just checked out robin's ass.
What? No!N-no, barney, I was...
dude, that's awesome.
You're finally forgetting
about that short redhead.
- Lily.
- Yes, lily.Thank you.
That was going to drive me crazy all night.
Hey, ted, marshall just checked
out your girlfriend's ass.
- I did not, ted, I...
- that's awesome.
You're finally getting better.
This is the moment I've been waiting for.
Starting tonight, I am going
to teach you how to live.
Ted, you had your chance.
You're out; marshall's in.
- Yes!
- Oh, god.
Marshall, being a single guy
in new york city is like...
what's something everybody likes?
Candy.
Yes, it's like being in a candy store.
You just walk right in and
grab yourself some whoppers.
yeah.
Is whoppers the best one?
Mounds.
Milk dudS.
Gobstoppers.
This went on for another hour;
I'll just skip to the end.
Dubble bubbles.
Nice!
Marshall. We're doing this.
- I am not taking no for an answer.
- Fine.
hey, robin.
Marshall checked out your ass.
Ted, what is wrong with you?
He checked out my ass.
Hey, tell him thanks.I felt
like I was having a bad ass day.
Cool, see ya.
Lily.
It is a great ass.

<font color=#38B0DE>How I Met Your Mother
Season 2 Episode 2</font>
******In three months.
There were so many unanswered
questions, so many things to say.
Your hair is adorable.
meanwhile, barney was taking marshall out to
meet women for the first time since he was 17.
Hi.Have you met marshall?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Look how sweaty my hands are.
It's weird, right? Uh, sweat?
Like, this smelly water
coming out of your skin.
It was nice meeting you.
I- I-I hate to interrupt,
but, uh, do you like magic?
Um, I guess.
oh, my god!
anyway, marshall here is awesome.
Salad in a bag? His idea.
Dude!
You were awesome last night.
You were charming, you were funny,
you were totally working that girl.
You went home with her.
Yes, I did.
But she told me that if it wasn't for me,
you would have had a shot with her,
so, in hypothetical terms, you
scored last night. All right!
Hypothetical high five.
Nice.
All right.
Tonight, we're going to go to the bar...
barney, no, I am not going
out with you ever again.
Come on!
I'll, I'll teach you all of my strategies.
Oh, really?
My favorite, number seven:
Create a mystery about yourself.
That way, they become so intrigued,
they have to hang out with you all night.
Oh, come on, does that really work?
Maybe it does, and maybe it doesn'T.
Damn it, that's intriguing.
Okay, I'm in.
- I have something you've got to hear.
- You will not believe what just happened.
You go first.
I found a 1939 penny on the subway.
Just imagine the kind of
history this little copper guy...
lily's back in town.
And you let me go first?
- Have you seen her?
- Uh, yeah.
I actually went
apartment-hunting with her today.
How's she doing?
You're not going to like it.
I am doing great.
This summer, best thing ever!
San francisco is so happening right now.
She's happy?!
Marshall had the worst summer
of his life, and she's happy.
Yeah, and I suppose her art program
was all fulfilling or whatever.
Oh.The art program...
best thing ever.
Oh, my god.
This is your best work.
In all my years
teaching, I've never seen anything so...
needless to say, this is art.
I can't teach you anything.
but the best part of S.F.
Oh, that's what we call san francisco...
the people.
Even just riding around
on the bus all summer.
It was like a human tapestry.
Hi, I'm mike.
I'm a buddhist monk slash
adventure-traveler writer.
I'm paula. I sing in a
punk band for children.
Yeah.
I'm dan, I'm a neurosurgeon.
You are stunning, by the way.
I'm so happy for you.
Oh, she's such A...
after what she did to marshall, she
should come back here devastated,
crawling on all fours over the broken
glass of her own shame and regret.
You never chose sides.
I respect that.
She's unbelievable. Unbelievable.
Unbelievable?
What's unbelievable?
Listen, marshall.
Ted found a penny on the subway,
and it's old, and that's interesting.
Way to go.
Okay, first of all, that is interesting.
Second, we have to tell him.
No, we don'T.He's just starting to
get better, going out with barney.
I mean, how do you think he's going
to feel when he hears lily's moved on?
- She's moved on?
- It happens.
I've fallen out of love
faster than that before,
sometimes, boom, with
no warning whatsoever.
One day we're in love, the
next day, he's dead to me.
But we're great. Honey.
Now, let's review barney's
rules for mating without dating.
Lesson two, corollary five.
Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and
unattractive, and she'll be putty in your hands.
Excellent.
- Have you chosen your entree?
- I have.
Sweet brunette, eight o'clock.
Nine o'clock.
Ten... thirty. She's walking to the bar.
- Her? Really?
- Yeah.
No, you're right.
Ambition is the enemy of success.
Okay.Hit it.
what's the matter, four eyes,
you got astigmatism or something?
I'm sorry, I was trying to playfully disarm
you, but I just got out of a long relationship.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
- I'm marshall.
- Hi, marshall. Amy.
Don't worry. I've been there.
Hold on.
Nice recovery. I think it's working.
Um, amy.This is my friend,
barney.Barney, this is amy.
- Hi, barney.Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
Amy, do you like... magic?
- I hate you.
- I am so sorry.
It's a sickness.
I'm the real victim here.
Twice. Twice in a row, you took
my candy. That was my candy.
- I know, but tonight...
- no.Forget it.
You're such a jackass.
I thought you were gonna call me a jerk.
All right, I'm sorry.I
will make it up to you.
Tonight, we'll go to a college bar
near nyu- the scorpion and the toad.
I figure in a younger crowd you'll
seem more mature, more worldly and,
as a third-year law
student, more smarter.
Okay, but no magic.
How did you do that?
I'm taking a leak, dumb ass.
Robin and I met lily outside the
next apartment she was seeing.*******
But I need the freedom to really chase my passion,
which was painting, but now I think
it's music or spoken word- maybe both.
God!Isn't life amazing?
It is so great to see you, ted.
I'm going to get the key from the lockbox.
What?
She's miserable.
She's realized she's made a huge mistake.
Her and marshall will be
back together in a week.
I love it!
Um, no.You just want lily to be miserable.
The truth is, she's happy.
Trust me.I've known lily for nine years.
Trust me.I'm a girl.
Yeah, but you're canadian.
- Why do you always have to bring that up?
- You're our weird neighbors to the north.
You bring it up every time.
All right, five bucks says
she still wants marshall.
You're on.
Five american bucks.
Damn it.
Okay, so how do we get the truth out of her.
Tequila.
It's her weakness.
Three shots, she'll tell
you the truth about anything.
I hope this is my new home.
Yeah, I'm going to take
that first apartment.
- marshall eriksen, suit up!
- No way.
Yeah, you're good in that.
- Let's go.
- wait.
Empty your pockets.
Come on.
- Come on, let'S...
- sleeves.
- There is nothing in my...
- oh, is that right?
Let's go.
behind my ear.
There is nothing behind your...
Yeah, I'm in pre-law.
The workload's killing me, though.
Oh, tell me about it.
I'm third year at columbia law, so...
If the workload does kill you,
I can probably get a conviction.
yeah.
You must be majoring in chemistry, 'cause
what I'm picking up between us is, uh...
college lesbian phase.
Listen, I got to go, but it'd
be great to see you again.
Yes, it would.
It really would.
Well, maybe I'll see you here sometime.
Probably not.I'm never here, so...
you know, I do have a phone number.
Great.
Nice.
- Hi, I'm barney.
- Oh, no.
Do you... mind giving my
friend your phone number?
Sure.
Whoo!
I did it!I got a girl's phone number.
Oh, and her handwriting is so cute, look.
Oh, I'm gonna take her out for chinese food
and then maybe we'll walk through the park.
It'll be so... what?
Sorry, buddy, I'm taking this one, too.
I'll kill you!
And then, I discovered
this area, north beach.
Best beach ever!
Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer.
How are you guys doing?
And hey, how's marshall?
- Give me the card!
- I'm not giving you any card.
- I swear...!
- You are not getting...!
Terrific.
That is so good to hear.
oh, hold on.
This could be about the apartment.
okay, we're way past
truth-telling-lilly and about to hit
cinco-de-mayo-1998-lilly and
I'm not cleaning that up again.
So, congratulations, you win.
She's happy.
I didn't get it.
That first apartment,I...
I waited too long and...
somebody else got it.
interesting.
Wow, lily, you, uh... seem to be having a
pretty strong reaction on losing an apartment.
I wonder if it's because it reminds you of
something else you lost because you couldn't commit.
no, lily, you're crying over the crown
molding and the real hardwood floors.
There's no deeper meaning.
Right, lily?
Just quit crying and tell him.
the apartment is a metaphor for marshall.
stop! You don't want to see
what I'm like when I'm angry.
Hold on!
If we can't settle this like
gentlemen, then no one gets the number.
- stop the cab.
- Wha...?
no, wait.Come on. Marshall!
81st and first, please.
Ah, she does have cute handwriting.
The thing about a hangover is that
everyone has their own special remedy.
Waiter: Morning, guys.
What can I get you?
Bring me the dirtiest,
greasiest tuna melt you goT.
And a milkshake.
For you, sir?
Gravy.
You want that gravy on something?
Surprise me.
I'd take you with gravy if my
boyfriend wasn't sitting right here.
Just kidding.
I'm good.
What are you so chirpy about?
She's still drunk from last night.
I don't think so.
Look, if you want marshall back so bad, how
come it took you two days to even ask about him?
I was dying to ask.
I was just trying to play it cool.
But really...
but it's good, I mean, work is great...
Lily: Come on, say something about marshall.
Where's marshall? How's marshall?
What's marshall doing right now?
Shut up and talk about marshall.
Marshall, marshall, marshall,
marshall... I've got to ask!
And hey, how's marshall?
It was such an awful summer.
I just wanted to get back here and see him.
But I thought your summer was great.
Not exactly.
Oh, my god.
This is you best work?
In all my years teaching, I've
never seen anything so needless.
To say this is... art...
I can't teach you anything.
So all those interesting
people you met on the bus?
Yeah, um...
I'm mike.
I'm a buddhist monk slash
adventure travel writer.
I'm paula.
I sing in a punk band for children.
I'm dan. I'm a neurosurgeon.
You are stunning, by the way.
I never got in touch because
I was too embarrassed.
I screwed everything up.
I have no job, no place to live.
I lost the love of my life.
I know I have no right to ask this,
but do you think marshall
would take me back?
In a heartbeat.
If you called him up, yeah, he'd
take you back with open arms.
So maybe I should call him.
Maybe.
No!This is... ow!
Hold on.
Look, if you're going to go back to him,
I don't want to hear the word "maybe.
" "Maybe" cannot be in your vocabulary.
This breakup almost killed him.
And he cannot go through it again.
So, unless you're absolutely
certain, stay the hell away from him.
This guy likes pennies.
Hi, marshall.
No, go away.I don't want to talk to you.
Okay, I know what I did a couple
nights back is in a moral gray area.
But the great news is, she loved you.
If things had gone your way
- you'd gone out a couple times,
I think she definitely
would have had sex with you.
There's no "would" in sex.
you're right, I totally... I'm
just no good at this, barney.
I'm good at being in a couple,
I'm good at being lily's boyfriend.
Being single- forget it.
Come on, you can't give up now.
What if I told you that you could relive
that night with the exact same conversations,
the exact same jokes only this
time, you get her and I don'T.
That's not possible.
Oh, but it is.
She has... wait for it...
Here it comes...Almost
there... an identical twin.
Yes!
A twin isn't the same person.
Of course it is.
What do you think identical means?
"Ident"- same, "ical"- person. Same person.
Hey, we could double date.
Fine.
But you have to promise me, you're
not going to steal my new twin,
and leave me with your old, used-up twin.
Used up?
They're a human being, marshall.
So uncle marshall and uncle barney went
out on a double date with the twins.
How you doing?
Great. This is so much fun.
And I think me and the
girl are really clicking.
You are, you definitely are.
Listen, you're going to have to leave now.
I just talked with the twins, and get
this, I'm going home with both of them.
Yeah.
That's happening.
It is impossible that you're
doing this to me again.
But they're twins.
You... you said to me that being single
would be like being in a candy store.
Well, it's not, it's not like a candy store.
It's a lawless, postapocalyptic wasteland.
- I may be your best friend...
- actually ted's my best friend.
But in this world, it's
every hombre for himself.
That's what being single is.
And after nine years in captivity,
that is the single greatest lesson I can
teach you about surviving in the wild.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I have two unique breasts and
two duplicates waiting for me.
oh, bad news
- marshall got food poisoning.
- What?
- Oh, no.
That's too bad.I really liked him.
Yeah.
Well, I guess we're
just a threesome tonight.
Lily, what are you doing here?
Oh, oh, I was just walking by.
I wasn'T... oh, you mean new york?
My program ended.
It was just great.
Just lots of fun... it was awful.
It was the worst mistake I ever made.
I'm so sorry, marshall, and... hello.
Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.
I know. It was the
worst summer of my life.
It was the hardest thing that
I've ever had to go through.
Can we please get back together?
All that crap you said to me about,
"we need to figure out
who we are outside of us,
and we need to learn to
do things on our own,"
it broke my heart.
Three months ago, you broke my heart.
Can we please get back together?
Lily, you were right.
All that crap was right.
So, no.
No, we can't get back together.
We shouldn'T.
At least, not right now.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well... will we still see each other?
Yeah, yeah.
I think so.
I don't know.
This is all really new to me.
I just got out of a long relationship.
I like your hair.
Thanks.
I figured new city, a different color...
ÄÇŔď»ąÓĐĆĄČř ÄÇĘÇÎŇłÔąýµÄ×î˛îµÄĆĄČř
ÎŇŐć¸ßĐË»Řµ˝ÁËĹ¦ÔĽ
ĘÇŃ˝
To even begin to make things up to you...
actually there may be something
that you can do for me,
but you can never ever ask me why.
So then I was promoted
to assistant ménage-er...
manager- why do I keep doing that?
Lily?
You gave me chlamydia, you jerk.
So where was I?
Ah, yes, assistant
ménage-er... I did it again.
I can't believe it.
You gave my twin sister chlamydia.
You slime!
Wha... wait, I know magic.
Well, played, eriksen.
Well played.

???
<i>had been together</i>
<i>for nine wonderful years,</i>
<i>until she dumped him</i>
<i>and ran off to San Francisco.</i>
<i>The healing process</i>
<i>was taking a long time.</i>
(groans)
Then, one night,
he made a giant leap forward.
All right, I'll
see you guys later.
I'll walk you out.
MARSHALL:
See ya.
You just checked out
Robin's ass.
What? No!
N-No, Barney, I was...
Dude, that's awesome.
You're finally
forgetting
-about that short redhead.
-Lily.
Yes, Lily. Thank you.
That was going to drive me
crazy all night.
Hey, Ted, Marshall just checked
out your girlfriend's ass.
-I did not, Ted, I...
-That's awesome.
You're finally
getting better.
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.
Starting tonight, I am going
to teach you how to live.
Ted, you had your chance.
You're out; Marshall's in.
-Yes!
-Oh, God.
Marshall, being a single guy
in New York City is like...
-What's something everybody likes?
-Candy.
Yes, it's like being
in a candy store.
You just walk right in
and grab yourself some Whoppers.
(groans)
Yeah.
Is Whoppers the best one?
Mounds.
Milk Duds.
Gobstoppers.
<i>This went on for another hour;</i>
<i>I'll just skip to the end.</i>
-Dubble Bubbles.
-Nice!
Marshall.
We're doing this.
I am not taking no
for an answer.
-Fine.
(chuckles)
-Hey, Robin.
Marshall checked out your ass.
Ted, what is wrong with you?
He checked out my ass.
Hey, tell him thanks.
I felt like I was having
a bad ass day.
Cool, see ya.
Lily.
It <i>is</i> a great ass.
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>

???
<i>in three months.</i>
<i>There were so many</i>
<i>unanswered questions,</i>
<i>so many things to say.</i>
Your hair is adorable.
(both giggling)
<i>Meanwhile, Barney was taking</i>
<i>Marshall out to meet women</i>
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>since he was 17.</i>
Just wing it.
Come on.
Hi. Have you
met Marshall?
-Hi.
-Hi.
Look how sweaty my hands are.
It's weird, right? Uh, sweat?
Like, this smelly water
coming out of your skin.
Eww.
It was nice meeting you.
I-I-I hate to
interrupt, but, uh,
do you like magic?
Um, I guess.
(gasps)
Oh, my God!
(laughing)
Anyway, Marshall
here is awesome.
Salad in a bag? His idea.
<i>Dude!</i>
You were awesome last night.
You were charming,
you were funny, you were totally
working that girl.
You went home with her.
Yes, I did.
But she told me
that if it wasn't for me, you
would have had a shot with her,
so, in hypothetical terms,
you scored last night.
All right!
Hypothetical high five.
Nice.
All right. Tonight, we're going
to go to the bar...
Barney, no, I am not going
out with you ever again.
-Come on! I'll, I'll teach you
all of my strategies.
-Oh, really?
My favorite, number seven:
create a mystery about yourself.
That way,
they become so intrigued,
they <i>have</i> to hang out
with you all night.
Oh, come on, does
that really work?
Maybe it does,
and maybe it doesn't.
Damn it, that's intriguing.
Okay, I'm in.
I have something you've
got to hear.
You will not
believe what just happened.
You go first.
I found a 1939 penny
on the subway.
Just imagine
the kind of history
this little copper guy...
Lily's back in town.
And you let me go first?
Have you seen her?
Uh, yeah. I actually went
apartment-hunting
with her today.
How's she doing?
You're not going to like it.
I am doing great.
This summer,
best thing ever!
San Francisco is so
happening right now.
She's happy?!
Marshall had the worst
summer of his life,
and she's happy.
Yeah, and I suppose
her art program
was all fulfilling or whatever.
Oh. The art program--
best thing ever.
Oh, my God.
This is your best work.
In all my years teaching,
I've never seen
anything so...
Needless to say,
this is art.
(chuckles)
I can't teach you anything.
(gasps)
(chuckles)
But the best part of S.F.--
Oh, that's what
we call San Francisco--
the people.
Even just riding around
on the bus all summer.
It was like a human tapestry.
Hi, I'm Mike.
I'm a Buddhist monk slash
adventure-traveler writer.
I'm Paula. I sing in a
punk band for children.
Yeah.
I'm Dan, I'm a neurosurgeon.
You are stunning, by the way.
Wow. I'm so happy for you.
Oh, she's such a...
After what she did to Marshall,
she should come back here
devastated,
crawling on all fours
over the broken glass
of her own shame and regret.
You never chose sides.
I respect that.
She's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable?
What's unbelievable?
Oh. Listen, Marshall.
Ted found a penny
on the subway,
and it's old, and
that's interesting.
Way to go.
Okay, first of all,
that <i>is</i> interesting.
Second, we have
to tell him.
No, we don't.
He's just starting to get
better, going out with Barney.
I mean, how do you think
he's going to feel
when he hears
Lily's moved on?
She's moved on?
It happens.
I've fallen out of love
faster than that before,
sometimes, boom, with
no warning whatsoever.
One day we're in love,
the next day, he's dead to me.
But we're great. Honey.
Now, let's review
Barney's rules for
mating without dating.
Lesson two, corollary five.
Make a beautiful woman feel
self-conscious and unattractive,
and she'll be
putty in your hands.
Excellent.
Have you chosen your entree?
I have. Sweet brunette,
eight o'clock.
Nine o'clock. Ten... thirty.
She's walking to the bar.
Her? Really?
Yeah.
No, you're right.
Ambition is the enemy
of success.
Okay. Hit it.
(smacks lips)
What's the matter, four eyes,
you got astigmatism
or something?
I'm sorry, I was trying
to playfully disarm you,
but I just got out
of a long relationship.
I have no idea
what I'm doing.
I'm Marshall.
Hi, Marshall. Amy.
Don't worry. I've been there.
Hold on.
Nice recovery.
I think it's working.
Um, Amy.
This is my friend, Barney.
Barney, this is Amy.
Hi, Barney.
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.
Amy, do you like... magic?
-I hate you.
-I am so sorry.
It's a sickness.
I'm the real victim here.
Twice.
Twice in a row,
you took my candy.
That was my candy.
I know, but tonight...
No.
Forget it.
You're such a jackass.
I thought you were gonna
call me a jerk.
All right, I'm sorry.
I will make it up to you.
Tonight, we'll go
to a college bar
near NYU--
The Scorpion and the Toad.
I figure
in a younger crowd
you'll seem more mature,
more worldly
and, as a third-year
law student, more smarter.
Okay, but no magic.
How did you do that?
I'm taking a leak, dumb ass.
<i>Robin and I met Lily</i>
<i>outside the next apartment</i>

But I need the freedom

God! Isn't life amazing?
It is so great
to see you, Ted.
I'm going to get the key
from the lockbox.
What?
She's miserable.
She's realized she's
made a huge mistake.
Her and Marshall will be back
together in a week.
-I love it!
-Um, no. You just
want Lily to be miserable.
The truth is, she's happy.
Trust me. I've known
Lily for nine years.
Trust <i>me.</i> I'm a girl.
Yeah, but you're Canadian.
Why do you always
have to bring that up?
You're our weird
neighbors to the north.
You bring it up every time.
All right,
five bucks says
she still wants Marshall.
You're on.
-Five American bucks.
-Damn it.
Okay, so how do we get
the truth out of her.
Tequila. It's
her weakness.
Three shots, she'll tell you
the truth about anything.
I hope this is my new home.
Yeah, I'm going to take
that <i>first</i> apartment.
(knocking)
Marshall Eriksen, suit up!
-No way.
-Yeah, you're good in that.
Let's go.
(clears throat)
Wait.
Empty your pockets.
Come on.
Come on, let's...
(clears throat)
Sleeves.
There is nothing in my...
Oh, is that right?
Uh-huh.
Let's go.
(clears throat)
Behind my ear.
There is nothing behind your...
BOTH:
Oh.
WOMAN:
<i>Yeah, I'm in pre-law.</i>
The workload's
killing me, though.
Oh, tell me about it.
I'm third year
at Columbia Law, so...
Hmm.
if the workload
does kill you, I can
probably get a conviction.
(both laughing)
Yeah.
You must be majoring in
chemistry,
'cause what I'm picking

College lesbian phase.
Listen, I got to go,

Yes, it would.

a phone number.
Great. Nice.
Hi, I'm Barney.
Oh, no.
Do you...
mind giving my friend
your phone number?
Sure.
Whoo!
I did it! I got
a girl's phone number.
Oh, and her handwriting
is so cute, look.
Oh, I'm gonna take
her out for Chinese food
and then maybe we'll
walk through the park.
It'll be so... what?
Sorry, buddy, I'm
taking this one, too.
I'll kill you!
And then, I discovered
this area, North Beach.
Best beach ever!
Oh, I've been
blabbering on about my summer.
How are you guys doing?
And hey, how's Marshall?
Give me the card!
I'm not giving you any card.
I swear...!
You are not getting...!
Terrific.
That is so good to hear.
(cell phone ringing)
Oh, hold on.
This could be
about the apartment.
(ringing continues)
Okay, we're way past
truth-telling-Lilly
and about to hit
Cinco-de-Mayo-1998-Lilly
and I'm <i>not</i> cleaning
that up again.
So, congratulations,
you win.
She's happy.
I didn't get it.
That first apartment, I...
I waited too long and...
somebody else got it.
(crying)
Interesting.
Wow, Lily,
you, uh...
seem to be having a
pretty strong reaction
on losing an apartment.
I wonder if it's
because it reminds you
of something else
you lost because
you couldn't commit.
(continues crying)
No, Lily,
you're crying
over the crown molding
and the real
hardwood floors.
There's no
deeper meaning.
Right, Lily? Just quit
crying and tell him.
(crying continues)
The apartment is a metaphor
for Marshall.
-stop it.
-You don't want to see
what I'm like
when I'm angry.
Stop! Hold on!
If we can't settle
this like gentlemen,
then no one
gets the number.
(screams)
Stop the cab.
Wha...?
(tires screech)
No, wait. Come on.
Marshall!
(door closes)
81st and First, please.
Ah, she does have
cute handwriting.
TED:

how come it took you two
days to even ask about him?
I was dying to ask.
I was just trying
to play it cool.
But really...
But it's good, I mean,
work is great...
LILY:
<i>Come on, say something</i>
<i>about Marshall.</i>
<i>Where's Marshall?</i>
<i>How's Marshall?</i>
<i>What's Marshall</i>
<i>doing right now?</i>
<i>Shut up and talk</i>
<i>about Marshall.</i>
<i>Shut up</i>

<i>Shut up and talk</i>
<i>about Marshall.</i>
<i>Marshall, Marshall,</i>
<i>Marshall, Marshall...</i>
<i>I've got to ask!</i>
And hey, how's Marshall?
It was such an awful summer.
I just wanted to get

you met on the bus?
Yeah, um...
Hi. I'm Mike.

Being single-- forget it.
Come on, you can't
give up now.
What if I told you that
you could relive that night
with the exact same
conversations,
the exact same jokes
only this time, you
get her and I don't.
That's not possible.
Oh, but it is.
She has... wait for it...
(voice rising):
...here it comes...
(high-pitched):
...almost there...
an identical twin.
Yes!
A twin isn't
the same person.
Of course it is. What do
you think identical means?
"Ident"-- same,
"ical"-- person.
Same person.
Hey, we could
double date.
Fine.
But you have to promise me,
you're not going to steal
my new twin, and leave me
with your old, used-up twin.
Used up?
They're a human
being, Marshall.
<i>So Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>and Uncle Barney</i>
<i>went out on a double date</i>
<i>with the twins.</i>
How you doing?
Great.
Amazing.
This is so much fun.
And I think me and the
girl are really clicking.
You are,
you definitely are.
Listen, you're going
to have to leave now.
I just talked
with the twins, and get this,
I'm going home
with both of them.
Yeah. That's happening.
It is impossible
that you're doing
this to me again.
But they're twins.
You-- you said to me
that being single
would be like being
in a candy store.
Well, it's not, it's not
like a candy store.
It's a lawless,
postapocalyptic wasteland.
I may be your
best friend...
Actually Ted's my best friend.
But in this world, it's
every hombre for himself.
That's what being single is.
And after nine years
in captivity,
that is the single greatest
lesson I can teach you
about surviving in the wild.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I have two unique breasts
and two duplicates
waiting for me.
(chuckles)
Oh, bad news-- Marshall got
food poisoning.
What?
Oh, no.
That's too bad.
I really liked him.
Yeah. well, I guess
we're just a threesome tonight.
Lily, what are you doing here?
Oh, oh, I was just
walking by. I wasn't...
Oh, you mean New York?
My program ended.
It was just great.
Just lots of fun...
It was awful.
It was the worst mistake
I ever made.
I'm so sorry, Marshall,
and... hello.
Lily, this was the
worst summer of my life.
I know. It was the worst
summer of my life.
It was the hardest
thing that I've ever
had to go through.
Can we please get back together?
All that crap you
said to me about,
"we need to figure out
who we are outside of us,
and we need to learn
to do things on our own,"
it broke my heart.
Three months ago,
you broke my heart.
Can we please
get back together?
Lily, you were right.
All that crap was right.
So, no.
No, we can't
get back together.
We shouldn't.
At least, not right now.
Wow.
Okay. Yeah.
Well...
Will we still see each other?
Yeah, yeah.
I think so.
I don't know.
This is all really
new to me.
I just got out of
a long relationship.
I like your hair.
Thanks.
I figured new city,
a different color...
* ...Wide open road *
* It was love to us *
And the pizza there,
worst pizza ever.
I'm so glad to be
back in New York.
Listen, if there's
anything I can do
to even begin to make
things up to you...
Actually there may be something
that you can do for me,
but you can never
ever ask me why.
So then I was promoted
to assistant m\nage-er...
Manager--
why do I keep doing that?
Lily?
You gave me chlamydia,
you jerk.
So where was I?
Ah, yes, assistant m\nage-er...
I did it again.
I can't believe it.
You gave my twin sister
chlamydia.
You slime!
Wha... wait, I know magic.
Well, played, Eriksen.
Well played.
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome to www.1000fr.com</font>
Com had been together
for nine wonderful years,
until she dumped him and
ran off to san francisco.
The healing process was taking a long time.
then, one night, he made
a giant leap forward.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
- I'll walk you out.
- See ya.
You just checked out robin's ass.
What? No!N-no, barney, I was...
dude, that's awesome.
You're finally forgetting
about that short redhead.
- Lily.
- Yes, lily.Thank you.
That was going to drive me crazy all night.
Hey, ted, marshall just checked
out your girlfriend's ass.
- I did not, ted, I...
- that's awesome.
You're finally getting better.
This is the moment I've been waiting for.
Starting tonight, I am going
to teach you how to live.
Ted, you had your chance.
You're out; marshall's in.
- Yes!
- Oh, god.
Marshall, being a single guy
in new york city is like...
what's something everybody likes?
Candy.
Yes, it's like being in a candy store.
You just walk right in and
grab yourself some whoppers.
yeah.
Is whoppers the best one?
Mounds.
Milk dudS.
Gobstoppers.
This went on for another hour;
I'll just skip to the end.
Dubble bubbles.
Nice!
Marshall. We're doing this.
- I am not taking no for an answer.
- Fine.
hey, robin.
Marshall checked out your ass.
Ted, what is wrong with you?
He checked out my ass.
Hey, tell him thanks.I felt
like I was having a bad ass day.
Cool, see ya.
Lily.
It is a great ass.

<font color=#38B0DE>How I Met Your Mother
Season 2 Episode 2</font>
******In three months.
There were so many unanswered
questions, so many things to say.
Your hair is adorable.
meanwhile, barney was taking marshall out to
meet women for the first time since he was 17.
Hi.Have you met marshall?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Look how sweaty my hands are.
It's weird, right? Uh, sweat?
Like, this smelly water
coming out of your skin.
It was nice meeting you.
I- I-I hate to interrupt,
but, uh, do you like magic?
Um, I guess.
oh, my god!
anyway, marshall here is awesome.
Salad in a bag? His idea.
Dude!
You were awesome last night.
You were charming, you were funny,
you were totally working that girl.
You went home with her.
Yes, I did.
But she told me that if it wasn't for me,
you would have had a shot with her,
so, in hypothetical terms, you
scored last night. All right!
Hypothetical high five.
Nice.
All right.
Tonight, we're going to go to the bar...
barney, no, I am not going
out with you ever again.
Come on!
I'll, I'll teach you all of my strategies.
Oh, really?
My favorite, number seven:
Create a mystery about yourself.
That way, they become so intrigued,
they have to hang out with you all night.
Oh, come on, does that really work?
Maybe it does, and maybe it doesn'T.
Damn it, that's intriguing.
Okay, I'm in.
- I have something you've got to hear.
- You will not believe what just happened.
You go first.
I found a 1939 penny on the subway.
Just imagine the kind of
history this little copper guy...
lily's back in town.
And you let me go first?
- Have you seen her?
- Uh, yeah.
I actually went
apartment-hunting with her today.
How's she doing?
You're not going to like it.
I am doing great.
This summer, best thing ever!
San francisco is so happening right now.
She's happy?!
Marshall had the worst summer
of his life, and she's happy.
Yeah, and I suppose her art program
was all fulfilling or whatever.
Oh.The art program...
best thing ever.
Oh, my god.
This is your best work.
In all my years
teaching, I've never seen anything so...
needless to say, this is art.
I can't teach you anything.
but the best part of S.F.
Oh, that's what we call san francisco...
the people.
Even just riding around
on the bus all summer.
It was like a human tapestry.
Hi, I'm mike.
I'm a buddhist monk slash
adventure-traveler writer.
I'm paula. I sing in a
punk band for children.
Yeah.
I'm dan, I'm a neurosurgeon.
You are stunning, by the way.
I'm so happy for you.
Oh, she's such A...
after what she did to marshall, she
should come back here devastated,
crawling on all fours over the broken
glass of her own shame and regret.
You never chose sides.
I respect that.
She's unbelievable. Unbelievable.
Unbelievable?
What's unbelievable?
Listen, marshall.
Ted found a penny on the subway,
and it's old, and that's interesting.
Way to go.
Okay, first of all, that is interesting.
Second, we have to tell him.
No, we don'T.He's just starting to
get better, going out with barney.
I mean, how do you think he's going
to feel when he hears lily's moved on?
- She's moved on?
- It happens.
I've fallen out of love
faster than that before,
sometimes, boom, with
no warning whatsoever.
One day we're in love, the
next day, he's dead to me.
But we're great. Honey.
Now, let's review barney's
rules for mating without dating.
Lesson two, corollary five.
Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and
unattractive, and she'll be putty in your hands.
Excellent.
- Have you chosen your entree?
- I have.
Sweet brunette, eight o'clock.
Nine o'clock.
Ten... thirty. She's walking to the bar.
- Her? Really?
- Yeah.
No, you're right.
Ambition is the enemy of success.
Okay.Hit it.
what's the matter, four eyes,
you got astigmatism or something?
I'm sorry, I was trying to playfully disarm
you, but I just got out of a long relationship.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
- I'm marshall.
- Hi, marshall. Amy.
Don't worry. I've been there.
Hold on.
Nice recovery. I think it's working.
Um, amy.This is my friend,
barney.Barney, this is amy.
- Hi, barney.Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
Amy, do you like... magic?
- I hate you.
- I am so sorry.
It's a sickness.
I'm the real victim here.
Twice. Twice in a row, you took
my candy. That was my candy.
- I know, but tonight...
- no.Forget it.
You're such a jackass.
I thought you were gonna call me a jerk.
All right, I'm sorry.I
will make it up to you.
Tonight, we'll go to a college bar
near nyu- the scorpion and the toad.
I figure in a younger crowd you'll
seem more mature, more worldly and,
as a third-year law
student, more smarter.
Okay, but no magic.
How did you do that?
I'm taking a leak, dumb ass.
Robin and I met lily outside the
next apartment she was seeing.*******
But I need the freedom to really chase my passion,
which was painting, but now I think
it's music or spoken word- maybe both.
God!Isn't life amazing?
It is so great to see you, ted.
I'm going to get the key from the lockbox.
What?
She's miserable.
She's realized she's made a huge mistake.
Her and marshall will be
back together in a week.
I love it!
Um, no.You just want lily to be miserable.
The truth is, she's happy.
Trust me.I've known lily for nine years.
Trust me.I'm a girl.
Yeah, but you're canadian.
- Why do you always have to bring that up?
- You're our weird neighbors to the north.
You bring it up every time.
All right, five bucks says
she still wants marshall.
You're on.
Five american bucks.
Damn it.
Okay, so how do we get the truth out of her.
Tequila.
It's her weakness.
Three shots, she'll tell
you the truth about anything.
I hope this is my new home.
Yeah, I'm going to take
that first apartment.
- marshall eriksen, suit up!
- No way.
Yeah, you're good in that.
- Let's go.
- wait.
Empty your pockets.
Come on.
- Come on, let'S...
- sleeves.
- There is nothing in my...
- oh, is that right?
Let's go.
behind my ear.
There is nothing behind your...
Yeah, I'm in pre-law.
The workload's killing me, though.
Oh, tell me about it.
I'm third year at columbia law, so...
If the workload does kill you,
I can probably get a conviction.
yeah.
You must be majoring in chemistry, 'cause
what I'm picking up between us is, uh...
college lesbian phase.
Listen, I got to go, but it'd
be great to see you again.
Yes, it would.
It really would.
Well, maybe I'll see you here sometime.
Probably not.I'm never here, so...
you know, I do have a phone number.
Great.
Nice.
- Hi, I'm barney.
- Oh, no.
Do you... mind giving my
friend your phone number?
Sure.
Whoo!
I did it!I got a girl's phone number.
Oh, and her handwriting is so cute, look.
Oh, I'm gonna take her out for chinese food
and then maybe we'll walk through the park.
It'll be so... what?
Sorry, buddy, I'm taking this one, too.
I'll kill you!
And then, I discovered
this area, north beach.
Best beach ever!
Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer.
How are you guys doing?
And hey, how's marshall?
- Give me the card!
- I'm not giving you any card.
- I swear...!
- You are not getting...!
Terrific.
That is so good to hear.
oh, hold on.
This could be about the apartment.
okay, we're way past
truth-telling-lilly and about to hit
cinco-de-mayo-1998-lilly and
I'm not cleaning that up again.
So, congratulations, you win.
She's happy.
I didn't get it.
That first apartment,I...
I waited too long and...
somebody else got it.
interesting.
Wow, lily, you, uh... seem to be having a
pretty strong reaction on losing an apartment.
I wonder if it's because it reminds you of
something else you lost because you couldn't commit.
no, lily, you're crying over the crown
molding and the real hardwood floors.
There's no deeper meaning.
Right, lily?
Just quit crying and tell him.
the apartment is a metaphor for marshall.
stop! You don't want to see
what I'm like when I'm angry.
Hold on!
If we can't settle this like
gentlemen, then no one gets the number.
- stop the cab.
- Wha...?
no, wait.Come on. Marshall!
81st and first, please.
Ah, she does have cute handwriting.
The thing about a hangover is that
everyone has their own special remedy.
Waiter: Morning, guys.
What can I get you?
Bring me the dirtiest,
greasiest tuna melt you goT.
And a milkshake.
For you, sir?
Gravy.
You want that gravy on something?
Surprise me.
I'd take you with gravy if my
boyfriend wasn't sitting right here.
Just kidding.
I'm good.
What are you so chirpy about?
She's still drunk from last night.
I don't think so.
Look, if you want marshall back so bad, how
come it took you two days to even ask about him?
I was dying to ask.
I was just trying to play it cool.
But really...
but it's good, I mean, work is great...
Lily: Come on, say something about marshall.
Where's marshall? How's marshall?
What's marshall doing right now?
Shut up and talk about marshall.
Marshall, marshall, marshall,
marshall... I've got to ask!
And hey, how's marshall?
It was such an awful summer.
I just wanted to get back here and see him.
But I thought your summer was great.
Not exactly.
Oh, my god.
This is you best work?
In all my years teaching, I've
never seen anything so needless.
To say this is... art...
I can't teach you anything.
So all those interesting
people you met on the bus?
Yeah, um...
I'm mike.
I'm a buddhist monk slash
adventure travel writer.
I'm paula.
I sing in a punk band for children.
I'm dan. I'm a neurosurgeon.
You are stunning, by the way.
I never got in touch because
I was too embarrassed.
I screwed everything up.
I have no job, no place to live.
I lost the love of my life.
I know I have no right to ask this,
but do you think marshall
would take me back?
In a heartbeat.
If you called him up, yeah, he'd
take you back with open arms.
So maybe I should call him.
Maybe.
No!This is... ow!
Hold on.
Look, if you're going to go back to him,
I don't want to hear the word "maybe.
" "Maybe" cannot be in your vocabulary.
This breakup almost killed him.
And he cannot go through it again.
So, unless you're absolutely
certain, stay the hell away from him.
This guy likes pennies.
Hi, marshall.
No, go away.I don't want to talk to you.
Okay, I know what I did a couple
nights back is in a moral gray area.
But the great news is, she loved you.
If things had gone your way
- you'd gone out a couple times,
I think she definitely
would have had sex with you.
There's no "would" in sex.
you're right, I totally... I'm
just no good at this, barney.
I'm good at being in a couple,
I'm good at being lily's boyfriend.
Being single- forget it.
Come on, you can't give up now.
What if I told you that you could relive
that night with the exact same conversations,
the exact same jokes only this
time, you get her and I don'T.
That's not possible.
Oh, but it is.
She has... wait for it...
Here it comes...Almost
there... an identical twin.
Yes!
A twin isn't the same person.
Of course it is.
What do you think identical means?
"Ident"- same, "ical"- person. Same person.
Hey, we could double date.
Fine.
But you have to promise me, you're
not going to steal my new twin,
and leave me with your old, used-up twin.
Used up?
They're a human being, marshall.
So uncle marshall and uncle barney went
out on a double date with the twins.
How you doing?
Great. This is so much fun.
And I think me and the
girl are really clicking.
You are, you definitely are.
Listen, you're going to have to leave now.
I just talked with the twins, and get
this, I'm going home with both of them.
Yeah.
That's happening.
It is impossible that you're
doing this to me again.
But they're twins.
You... you said to me that being single
would be like being in a candy store.
Well, it's not, it's not like a candy store.
It's a lawless, postapocalyptic wasteland.
- I may be your best friend...
- actually ted's my best friend.
But in this world, it's
every hombre for himself.
That's what being single is.
And after nine years in captivity,
that is the single greatest lesson I can
teach you about surviving in the wild.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I have two unique breasts and
two duplicates waiting for me.
oh, bad news
- marshall got food poisoning.
- What?
- Oh, no.
That's too bad.I really liked him.
Yeah.
Well, I guess we're
just a threesome tonight.
Lily, what are you doing here?
Oh, oh, I was just walking by.
I wasn'T... oh, you mean new york?
My program ended.
It was just great.
Just lots of fun... it was awful.
It was the worst mistake I ever made.
I'm so sorry, marshall, and... hello.
Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.
I know. It was the
worst summer of my life.
It was the hardest thing that
I've ever had to go through.
Can we please get back together?
All that crap you said to me about,
"we need to figure out
who we are outside of us,
and we need to learn to
do things on our own,"
it broke my heart.
Three months ago, you broke my heart.
Can we please get back together?
Lily, you were right.
All that crap was right.
So, no.
No, we can't get back together.
We shouldn'T.
At least, not right now.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well... will we still see each other?
Yeah, yeah.
I think so.
I don't know.
This is all really new to me.
I just got out of a long relationship.
I like your hair.
Thanks.
I figured new city, a different color...
ÄÇŔď»ąÓĐĆĄČř ÄÇĘÇÎŇłÔąýµÄ×î˛îµÄĆĄČř

To even begin to make things up to you...
actually there may be something
that you can do for me,
but you can never ever ask me why.
So then I was promoted
to assistant ménage-er...
manager- why do I keep doing that?
Lily?
You gave me chlamydia, you jerk.
So where was I?
Ah, yes, assistant
ménage-er... I did it again.
I can't believe it.
You gave my twin sister chlamydia.
You slime!
Wha... wait, I know magic.
Well, played, eriksen.
Well played.

<font color=#38B0DE>How I Met Your Mother
Season 2 Episode 2</font>
Kids, you know the photo in the den?
It was taken back in 2006,
when Grandma and Grandpa
came to visit me and we all
went out to brunch.
We all look pretty happy,
right?
(camera shutter clicking)
Wrong.
I wish your face
would melt off.
I wish your eyeballs
would explode.
I hate you.
I hate you more.
I'm going to kill him.
I can't say
I blame you.
No, I mean I'm seriously
going to kill him.
I don't care how
unpleasant it is.
You have to
talk to him.
Not now.
Okay, if you
don't, I will.
Robin...
Okay, for any of this
to make sense,
you got to understand, there
are three parts to this story.
Let's start with the Marshall
and Lily part.
As a 30th anniversary gift,
I had flown
my parents
to New York for the weekend.
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
your cousin Jimmy
had a wonderful time
at that spa he visited.
You mean the spa the judge
ordered him
to go to to quit cocaine?
Coffee?
Now, Grandma and Grandpa
didn't like to talk
about things that were
uncomfortable, emotional,
or in any way... real.
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.
Oh, Lily!
Hi, Marshall.
Good to see you.
I was just
stopping by
to pick up some
of my things.
Yes, we were so sorry
to hear about your...
you know, the, the...
Well...
Lily calling off the
wedding and dumping me?
Me begging Marshall to take
me back and him rejecting me?
I love your hair.
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sync:FRM@mini.F</font>
This is only the sceond time Marshall and Lily
had seen each other
since breaking up,
but to their credit,
it wasn't that awkward.
Actually, we're cool.
We just divided
up CDs.
It was all very civil.
I'm proud of us;
we're, we're good.
MRS. MOSBY:
Well, we were all going to go
to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00.
Lily, would you like to join us?
Um...
What?
Well, I-I don't want to go
if it would make you
uncomfortable.
Why would it?
Well, I mean, yeah,
we're... we're good,
but you got to admit
there's that stuff between us.
Um, not for me.
Now it's just like
we're friends.
It's like we're
brother and sister.
"Brother and sister"?!
Okay.Fine, yeah,
I'll see you
at the restaurant, bro.
See? Not awkward at all.
Hello, everyone.
Hi.
Hello, Marshall.
MRS. MOSBY:
Lily, that is a stunning dress.
Oh, thanks.
It's kind of revealing,
but I thought, "Hey,
we're all family."
(chuckling):
Right, bro?
Ooh. Ow.
What's wrong?
Oh, I, I hurt my
ankle in yoga today.
The instructor told me
to just take deep breaths
to get through
the pain, just...
Are you all right?
You're kind of sweating.
No, I'm fine.
It's just...
this roll is really spicy.
Lily is evil!
She just wore that dress
to torture me.
Well, you know what?
Two can play at that game.
See, at brunch, I'm going
to torture Lily right back.
Yeah.
There's a part of my body that
she's got a weakness for, too.
Dude, you can't whip that out
at brunch.
No, not that.
I'm going to unleash my calves.
That's crazy.
Nobody's turned on
by men's calves.
They're a thoroughly
unerotic body part.
Well, yeah, I'd say that, too,
if I had those skinny little
chicken legs.
I'll be waiting by the phone
for your apology.
So Marshall showed up at brunch
with a plan.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Hey, Marshall.
Hey.
Hey. How are you feeling?
You looked kind of feverish
last night.
Oh, no, I actually
feel great.
It is kind of warm in
here, though, isn't it?
Oh, I don't know,
if anything, it's kind of...
What are you doing?
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.
I'm just making myself feel a
little bit more... comfortable.
Oh.
Oh, yes.
I've been doing all these
toe lifts lately, and so...
my calves have really
been cramping up.
Take off your shirt.
Take off the rest
of your pants.
Oh.
Oh.
I really wasn't expecting
that to happen.
Yeah, me neither.
It kind of complicates
things, doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.
Why did you have to throw
your magnificent calves at me?
You know you have
a punter's leg.
Well, why did you have to throw
your beautiful boobs at me?
You know you have... boobs.
Just admit it, you came here
trying to seduce me.
Seduce you?
You seduced me.
You sat down next to me
and took most of your pants off.
You went to San Francisco
for three months.
How is that seducing you?
Well, it's not but I'm
still mad about it.
All right, that's it--
I want TheBeatles Anthology.
Oh, well, that's too
bad; I'm keeping it.
And you know the U2
box set I gave you?
Look inside--
all Dave Matthews.
You are evil.
Smile.
I'm going to kill him.
I can't say
I blame you.
No, I mean I'm seriously
going to kill him.
Now let's talk about
the Barney part of the story.
This was going to be Robin's
first time meeting my parents,
so we were both
a little nervous.
(knocking)
(scoffs)
Barney, what are you doing here?
Uh... I'm here to
meet your parents.
They must be dying
to meet me after all
the legendary Barney
stories you've told them.
I haven't told them any
legendary Barney stories.
What?
Barney, here is a list
of all the things
I talk with my dad about:
baseball.
But I'm your best friend.
Well, actually Marshall's my...
I'm the most important
person in your life.
Well, Robin's actually...
How could your parents not know about me?
I'm delightful.
To us, sure, in very small,
infrequent doses.
I mean, come on,
you're not exactly
the kind of friend
parents want their kid to have.
Oh, really?
Then I guess those
shoes aren't the thing
you're most wrong
about today.
Hey, Mom.
Hey, Dad.
MR. MOSBY:
Ted.
I know you've all
been excited to meet...
Barney Stinson.
An honor to meet
the two of you.
That needlepoint "Bless This
Mess" pillow you made for Ted--
what a stitch.
Stitch!
Did that just happen?
Uh, Mom, Dad,
this is my
girlfriend, Robin.
Hello.
ROBIN:
Hello.
MRS. MOSBY:
Oh, it's wonderful
to meet you, Robin.
Oh, you are so pretty.
Isn't she pretty, Al?
A real looker.
That's funny, I didn't even
"look" in the mirror today.
That's not anything,
is it?
So, I made a reservation
at San Marino tonight for 8:00.
(laughing):
San Marino.
Oh, you're serious? Yikes.
No. We have to try
Casa A Pezzi.
Best salmon risotto
I have ever had.
I love salmon risotto.
I know.
How are we supposed to get
a table at Casa A Pezzi?
They're booked for weeks.
Well, lucky for you,
I happen to know
the head waitress,
which is ironic
because...
Ironic because we both work  at a homeless shelter
where I serve the food.
Where do you
volunteer, Robin?
What's the
matter with you?
I'm his girlfriend,
and I'm not even
trying that hard.
Way to wreck the
curve, kiss-ass.
Robin, I'm his
best friend.
That's a commitment.
Girlfriend, that's
like a bad flu.
Out of your system
after a couple weeks in bed.
(chuckling):
High five.
Can I help?
Yes, you can,
Virginia.
There's a story
behind that broach,
and I'm going to hear it.
Well, funny you should ask.
MR. MOSBY:
Whoa! Bravo, Barney.
That is my all-time
favorite sonata.
Barney, you are just delightful.
No, Virginia, you're delightful,
I am deligh-ted.
And he's just Ted.
I'm really not
planning these things;
they just keep happening.
(laughter)
Whoops.
I think I dropped
an ice cube down here.
Ow, it's so cold.
All right, that's it,
I'm out of here.
In a minute.
Anyone up for a drink
at MacLaren's?
No, I'm kind of tired.
Me, too.
Yeah, I'm sure my folks
are gonna want...
I feel like I could knock
back a few cervezas.
Cervezas?
Did he fall?
I'd join you, too,
but I want to get up early
for Mass tomorrow.
St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m.,
it's my favorite service.
Wait a minute-- you're able to
cross the threshold of a church?
I'll save you a seat.
Oh, you are just terrific.
Isn't he, Susan?
Robin.
Susan, her name is Virginia.
Dude, I am sincerely ticked
at your dad right now.
Why?
Last night, we go to MacLaren's
for a drink, right?
So Barney darts back
into the burning house,
lifts up the refrigerator
I'm pinned under
and pulls me to safety.
Whoa. You're like a hero.
Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy.
You know who is a hero?
My Dalmatian, Smokey.
He... didn't... make it out.
(sobbing):
I'm sorry.
You poor, brave man.
Why don't you give
the guy a hug?
I'm... oh.
My dad was your wingman?
This is really
messing with my head.
Barney, is my dad cool?
I'm not done.
So, your dad stays
to finish his drink,
but I take off
because I have to be up early
for Mass with your mom.
Sure.
Anyway, I realize that I left
my phone on the bar,
so I come back...
(whispers):
Oh, my God...
Mmm...
Oh, my God.
Is that really...
Oh, my God!
I know.
**
My dad made out with
Wendy the waitress?
He cheated on my mom?
No, that's impossible.
Ted, it's a well-known statistic
that 83% of people
married longer than six months
are seeing someone on the side.
Do you know that
when you make up
a statistic,
you always use "83%"?
You think I'm lying.
Well, have you done
any surveys on the subject?
Because the good people at
www.swingers.open-marriage-is
natural\legalize-polygamy.org
have, and they beg to differ.
That's not a real Web site.
Oh, and I suppose
I didn't get a real T-shirt
for running in their 10K.
Hi, Dad.
Hey, Ted.
Barney.
TED:
Enjoying your
vacation so far?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, listen, can I speak
to you outside for a sec?
Sure.
So you went out
with Barney last night?
Yeah.
You have a good time?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry
you couldn't join us.
Yeah.
So...
What?
Well...
Well what?
You think Cerrano's got
a shot at the RBI title?
I wanted to confront him,
but I couldn't.
I guess I got
the let's-not-talk-about-
anything-
uncomfortable gene.
Well, you didn't get your
dad's close-the-deal gene,
that's for sure.
Smile.
Great.
I don't care how
unpleasant it is.
You have to
talk to him.
Not now.
Okay, if you
don't, I will.
Robin...!
TED:
Okay, now I got to back up
all the way
to the beginning
to tell you the me
and Robin part of the story.
We were expecting my parents
at any minute.
One last thing about my mom.
She grills every
single one of
my girlfriends about when we're
gonna get married and have kids.
But this is the first time
she's meeting me.
Doesn't matter.
And you'll know it's coming
when she mentions my cousin
Stacy-- six kids in five years.
The woman's basically
a ride at a water park.
But I don't want
to get married and have kids.
What am I supposed to say?
You know what?
You're an adult with
perfectly valid opinions.
You shouldn't have to
apologize for them.
I'm gonna lie.
I would.
Thanks again for
letting me have the U2 box set.
I know how important
it is to you.
I talked to Aunt
Caroline the other day.
Stacy's pregnant again.
Oh, good for her.
So, dear...
Oh, boy.
Tell us what it's like
being a journalist.
I'm just not ready.
Okay. No pressure.
Oh.
Uh, I thought you, um...
It's great.
Good.
Focus on your job now,
because your career clock
is ticking.
There's time
for marriage and kids
and all that other stuff later.
Ooh, a piano!
TED:
You lucked out with my mom last
night, huh?
What a relief, right?
Oh, absolutely.
Whew, what a relief it is
to know I'm the one girlfriend
your mom doesn't want you
to have kids with.
Hooray?
I mean, did she really think
that your college girlfriend Chery
would pop out
attractive children?
'Cause I've seen pictures,
and, I'm sorry,
that girl had a brow ridge
like a caveman.
Come on, she was just
frowning under direct light.
And besides, that's not even
what I liked about her.
It was her...
It's not important.
What happened to
Marshall and Lily?
They've been fighting lately.
They're probably off
somewhere going at it.
More coffee?
Oh, no, thank you.
Isn't she sweet?
Well, if she's so sweet, maybe
she should have Ted's babies.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
LILY:
Just a minute.
MARSHALL:
Maybe less.
Robin, dear.
Did I say something
to upset you?
Why don't you want me
to have your grandkids?
Do you want to have
my grandkids?
No!
I mean, I don't know.
I just...
I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids.
And you should.
I'm a genetic gold mine.
No family history of diabetes
or heart disease.
Everyone has nonporous teeth
and perfect eyesight.
I had one schizophrenic uncle,
but even he had perfect vision.
Which was unfortunate
for the people around the bell tower he was in,
but still he w a very fine man, and...
Excuse me. Sorry.
Didn't know that
there was a line.
Marshall, your zipper.
Oh.
Robin, it's not that I
don't want grandkids.
It's just I don't think
anyone should make the mistake
of getting married too young.
I mean, you got married
pretty young.
Why do you say that?
That wasn't a mistake.
Was it?
(whispers):
Well...
Okay, there's something
you don't know.
WAITRESS:
Smile.
I wish your face
would melt off.
I wish your eyeballs
would explode.
I'm gonna kill him.
I don't care how
unpleasant it is,
you have to
talk to him.
Not now.
Okay, if you
don't, I will.
Robin...!
Oh, gosh, let me help you
pick those up, sweetheart.
Sweetheart?
Sweetheart?!
The only sweetheart in your life
should be the woman you
married 30 years ago,
not the waitress
at the bar last night
and not this clumsy floozy!
I'm sorry, you're
not a floozy.
I'm upset, I don't know
what I'm saying.
But stay away from my dad.
Ted, what are you talking about?
Dad?
You, uh, want
to tell Mom
what happened at the bar
last night?
Okay.
I hooked up with a waitress.
Oh.
Oh?
I mean, oh!
Oh! Ooh!
We're going to have
a serious talk
about this when
we get home, Al.
Oh, ooh!
Serious talk?
Mom, what...?
He was kissing another woman.
Don't you care?
Mrs. Mosby?
Ted, we weren't quite sure
how to tell you this...
Your mother and I
are divorced.
You...
What do you mean
you're divorced?
Since when?
Oh, gosh, it's been
about nine months now.
Closer to ten, I think.
Time flies.
(chuckles)
So ten months ago,
you just up and decided
to get divorced
without telling me?
No, it wasn't a
snap decision.
We'd been separated
almost two years.
How could you not tell me this?!
We meant to, it just never
seemed like the right time.
So last Christmas...?
We talked about
telling you kids then,
but it didn't seem
very Christmasy.
I got you a tandem bike.
Oh, it didn't
go to waste.
Your mother and Frank
ride it all the time.
Who the hell is Frank?!
(chuckling):
Oh, great guy.
I actually set them up.
You remember Dr. Muchnik.
He did your braces.
Okay, my head's
about to explode,
and I don't want to get it
all over everyone's waffles,
so I am leaving.
Teddy bear, oh...
You know, he mentioned
he was divorced last night.
I totally spaced on that.
Ooh, no line
at the omelet station.
Lily...
I'm sorry that I said
all those things.
Me, too.
I just find it really confusing
to be around you right now.
It's the same for me.
I think we're probably
both better off
trying to keep some
distance for a while.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Are you wearing
a push-up bra?
Did you Mystic
Tan your calves?
I withdraw the question.
We're sorry we didn't say
anything about the divorce.
It was wrong
not to tell you.
Thank you.
But listen,
don't tell your sister.
It would just
upset her.
No, this is
ridiculous!
We have to start talking about
stuff, and not just baseball.
Indians won today
on a walk-off double.
Against the Red Sox?
Boy, that's a big win.
No. No. No.
We're not gonna
blow past this.
I mean, I don't even
know who you people.
I don't even know
how you met.
I never told you
how I met your mother?
No.
Oh, great story.
At a bar.
That's it?
That's what passes for
communication in our family?
Man, when I have kids,
and I tell them how
I met their mother,
I'm gonna tell them everything,
the whole damn story.
I think it was an Irish bar.
I just, I don't...
I don't understand.
You seemed so happy.
When I was growing up,
you seemed so...
What happened?
We just realized we're
very different people.
Your father's kind of a
head-in-the-clouds romantic,
and I'm much more
down to earth.
So?
Robin and I
are like that.
That doesn't
mean anything.
I wanted kids.
And your mother...
also wanted kids.
Robin and I have
different views on families.
We're not about to break up
because of it.
On some level,
I always knew.
I didn't even want to go out
with him in the beginning.
But he spent months badgering
me until I finally gave in.
Huh.
Well, when you don't connect
on that many fundamental levels,
it's only a matter of time
before you realize
you're not meant
to be together.
But we love Robin.
MR. MOSBY:
Absolutely.
Meeting you was
the highlight of my trip.
Well, second highlight.
MRS. MOSBY:
We'll see you inside.
Sorry.
Wow.
I know.
They love me!
We are definitely going to
try and communicate more.
From now on,
full disclosure.
Good. Good, I think it'll be
really good for the family.
By the way,how's Grandma?
She hasn't returned my last couple calls.
I'm gonna get
some juice.
No.
No.
You missed a great game
last night. Real squeaker.
<font color="#ffff00">welcome to www.1000fr.com</font>
<i>in the den?</i>
<i>It was taken back in 2006,</i>
<i>when Grandma and Grandpa</i>
<i>came to visit me and we all</i>
<i>went out to brunch.</i>
<i>We all look pretty happy,</i>
<i>right?</i>
(camera shutter clicking)
<i>Wrong.</i>
I wish your face
would melt off.
I wish your eyeballs
would explode.
I hate you.
I hate you more.
I'm going to kill him.
I can't say
I blame you.
No, I mean I'm seriously
going to kill him.
I don't care how
unpleasant it is.
You have to
talk to him.
Not now.
Okay, if you
don't, I will.
Robin...
<i>Okay, for any of this</i>
<i>to make sense,</i>
<i>you got to understand, there</i>
<i>are three parts to this story.</i>
<i>Let's start with the Marshall</i>
<i>and Lily part.</i>
<i>As a 30th anniversary gift,</i>
<i>I had flown </i>
<i>my parents</i>
<i>to New York for the weekend.</i>
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
your cousin Jimmy
had a wonderful time
at that spa he visited.
You mean the spa the judge
ordered him
to go to to quit cocaine?
Coffee?
<i>Now, Grandma and Grandpa</i>
<i>didn't like to talk</i>
<i>about things that were</i>
<i>uncomfortable, emotional,</i>
<i>or in any way... real.</i>
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.
Oh, Lily!
Hi, Marshall.
Good to see you.
I was just
stopping by
to pick up some
of my things.
Yes, we were so sorry
to hear about your...
you know, the, the...
Well...
Lily calling off the
wedding and dumping me?
Me begging Marshall to take
me back and him rejecting me?
I love your hair.

**
<i>Marshall and Lily</i>
<i>had seen each other</i>
<i>since breaking up,</i>
<i>but to their credit,</i>
<i>it wasn't that awkward.</i>
Actually, we're cool.
We just divided
up CDs.
It was all very civil.
I'm proud of us;
we're, we're good.
MRS. MOSBY:
Well, we were all going to go
to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00.
Lily, would you like to join us?
Um...
What?
Well, I-I don't want to go
if it would make you
uncomfortable.
Why would it?
Well, I mean, yeah,
we're... we're good,
but you got to admit
there's that stuff between us.
Um, not for me.
Now it's just like
we're friends.
It's like we're
brother and sister.
"Brother and sister"?!
Okay.Fine, yeah,
 I'll see you
at the restaurant, bro.
<i>See? Not awkward at all.</i>
Hello, everyone.
Hi.
Hello, Marshall.
MRS. MOSBY:
Lily, that is a stunning dress.
Oh, thanks.
It's kind of revealing,
but I thought, "Hey,
we're all family."
(chuckling):
Right, bro?
Ooh. Ow.
What's wrong?
Oh, I, I hurt my
ankle in yoga today.
The instructor told me
to just take deep breaths
to get through
the pain, just...
Are you all right?
You're kind of sweating.
No, I'm fine.
It's just...
this roll is really spicy.
Lily is evil!
She just wore that dress
to torture me.
Well, you know what?
Two can play at that game.
See, at brunch, I'm going
to torture Lily right back.
Yeah.
There's a part of my body that
she's got a weakness for, too.
Dude, you can't whip that out
at brunch.
No, not that.
I'm going to unleash my calves.
That's crazy.
Nobody's turned on
by men's calves.
They're a thoroughly
unerotic body part.
Well, yeah, I'd say that, too,
if I had those skinny little
chicken legs.
I'll be waiting by the phone
for your apology.
<i>So Marshall showed up at brunch</i>
<i>with a plan.</i>
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Hey, Marshall.
Hey.
Hey. How are you feeling?
You looked kind of feverish
last night.
Oh, no, I actually
feel great.
It is kind of warm in
here, though, isn't it?
Oh, I don't know,
if anything, it's kind of...
What are you doing?
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.
I'm just making myself feel a
little bit more... comfortable.
Oh.
Oh, yes.
I've been doing all these
toe lifts lately, and so...
my calves have really
been cramping up.
Take off your shirt.
Take off the rest
of your pants.
Oh.
Oh.
I really wasn't expecting
that to happen.
Yeah, me neither.
It kind of complicates
things, doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.
Why did you have to throw
your magnificent calves at me?
You know you have
a punter's leg.
Well, why did you have to throw
your beautiful boobs at me?
You know you have... boobs.
Just admit it, you came here
trying to seduce me.
Seduce <i>you?</i>
You seduced me.
You sat down next to me
and took most of your pants off.
You went to San Francisco
for three months.
How is that seducing you?
Well, it's not but I'm

All right, that's it--
I want <i>TheBeatles Anthology.</i>
Oh, well, that's too
bad; I'm keeping it.
And you know the U2

Look inside--
all Dave Matthews.
You are evil.
Smile.
I'm going to kill him.
I can't say
I blame you.
No, I mean I'm <i>seriously</i>
going to kill him.

Barney.
TED:
Enjoying your
vacation so far?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, listen, can I speak
to you outside for a sec?
Sure.
So you went out
with Barney last night?
Yeah.
You have a good time?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry
you couldn't join us.
Yeah.
So...
What?
Well...
Well what?
You think Cerrano's got
a shot at the RBI title?
I wanted to confront him,
but I couldn't.
I guess I got
the let's-not-talk-about-
anything-
uncomfortable gene.
Well, you didn't get your
dad's close-the-deal gene,
that's for sure.
Smile.
Great.
I don't care how
unpleasant it is.
You have to
talk to him.
Not now.
Okay, if you
don't, I will.
Robin...!
TED:
<i>Okay, now I got to back up</i>
<i>all the way</i>
<i>to the beginning</i>
<i>to tell you the me</i>
<i>and Robin part of the story.</i>
<i>We were expecting my parents</i>
<i>at any minute.</i>
One last thing about my mom.
She grills every
single one of
my girlfriends about when we're
gonna get married and have kids.
But this is the first time
she's meeting me.
Doesn't matter.
And you'll know it's coming
when she mentions my cousin
Stacy-- six kids in five years.
The woman's basically
a ride at a water park.
But I don't want
to get married and have kids.
What am I supposed to say?
You know what?
You're an adult with
perfectly valid opinions.
You shouldn't have to
apologize for them.
I'm gonna lie.
I would.
Thanks again for
letting me have the U2 box set.
I know how important
it is to you.
I talked to Aunt
Caroline the other day.
Stacy's pregnant again.
Oh, good for her.
So, dear...
Oh, boy.
Tell us what it's like
being a journalist.
I'm just not ready.
Okay. No pressure.
Oh.
Uh, I thought you, um...
It's great.
Good.
Focus on your job now,
because your career clock
is ticking.
There's time
for marriage and kids
and all that other stuff later.
Ooh, a piano!
TED:
<i>You lucked out with</i> my mom last
night, huh?
What a relief, right?
Oh, absolutely.
Whew, what a relief it is
to know I'm the one girlfriend
your mom doesn't want you
to have kids with.
Hooray?
I mean, did she really think
that your college girlfriend Chery
would pop out
attractive children?
'Cause I've seen pictures,
and, I'm sorry,
that girl had a brow ridge
like a caveman.
Come on, she was just
frowning under direct light.
And besides, that's not even
what I liked about her.
It was her...
It's not important.
What happened to
Marshall and Lily?
They've been fighting lately.
They're probably off
somewhere going at it.
More coffee?
Oh, no, thank you.
Isn't she sweet?
Well, if she's so sweet, maybe
she should have Ted's babies.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
LILY:
Just a minute.
MARSHALL:
Maybe less.
Robin, dear.
Did I say something
to upset you?
Why don't you want me
to have your grandkids?
Do you want to have
my grandkids?
No!
I mean, I don't know.
I just...
I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids.
And you should.
I'm a genetic gold mine.
No family history of diabetes
or heart disease.
Everyone has nonporous teeth
and perfect eyesight.
I had one schizophrenic uncle,
but even he had perfect vision.
Which was unfortunate
for the people around the bell tower he was in,
but still he w a very fine man, and...
Excuse me. Sorry.
Didn't know that
there was a line.
Marshall, your zipper.
Oh.
Robin, it's not that I
don't want grandkids.
It's just I don't think
anyone should make the mistake
of getting married too young.
Why do you say that?
I mean, you got married
pretty young.
That wasn't a mistake.
Was it?
(whispers):
Well...
Okay, there's something
you don't know.
WAITRESS:
Smile.
I wish your face
would melt off.
I wish your eyeballs
would explode.
I'm gonna kill him.
I don't care how
unpleasant it is,
you have to
talk to him.
Not now.
Okay, if you
don't, I will.
Robin...!
Oh, gosh, let me help you
pick those up, sweetheart.
Sweetheart?
Sweetheart?!
The only sweetheart in your life
should be the woman you
married 30 years ago,
not the waitress
at the bar last night
and not this clumsy floozy!
I'm sorry, you're
not a floozy.
I'm upset, I don't know
what I'm saying.
But stay away from my dad.
Ted, what are you talking about?
Dad?
You, uh, want
to tell Mom
what happened at the bar
last night?
Okay.
I hooked up with a waitress.
Oh.
Oh?
I mean, oh!
Oh! Ooh!
We're going to have
a serious talk
about this when
we get home, Al.
Oh, ooh!
Serious talk?
Mom, what...?
He was kissing another woman.
Don't you care?
Mrs. Mosby?
Ted, we weren't quite sure
how to tell you this...
Your mother and I
are divorced.
You...
What do you mean
you're divorced?
Since when?
Oh, gosh, it's been
about nine months now.
Closer to ten, I think.
Time flies.
(chuckles)
So ten months ago,
you just up and decided
to get divorced
without telling me?
No, it wasn't a
snap decision.
We'd been separated
almost two years.
How could you not tell me this?!
We meant to, it just never
seemed like the right time.
So last Christmas...?
We talked about
telling you kids then,
but it didn't seem
very Christmasy.
I got you a tandem bike.
Oh, it didn't
go to waste.
Your mother and Frank
ride it all the time.
Who the hell is Frank?!
(chuckling):
Oh, great guy.
I actually set them up.
You remember Dr. Muchnik.
He did your braces.
Okay, my head's
about to explode,
and I don't want to get it
all over everyone's waffles,
so I am leaving.
Teddy bear, oh...
You know, he mentioned
he was divorced last night.
I totally spaced on that.
Ooh, no line
at the omelet station.
Lily...
I'm sorry that I said
all those things.
Me, too.
I just find it really confusing
to be around you right now.
It's the same for me.
I think we're probably
both better off
trying to keep some
distance for a while.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Are you wearing
a push-up bra?
Did you Mystic
Tan your calves?
I withdraw the question.
We're sorry we didn't say
anything about the divorce.
It was wrong
not to tell you.
Thank you.
But listen,
don't tell your sister.
It would just
upset her.
No, this is
ridiculous!
We have to start talking about
stuff, and not just baseball.
Indians won today
on a walk-off double.
Against the Red Sox?
Boy, that's a big win.
No. No. No.
We're not gonna
blow past this.
I mean, I don't even
know who you people.
I don't even know
how you met.
I never told you
how I met your mother?
No.
Oh, great story.
At a bar.
That's it?
That's what passes for
communication in our family?
Man, when I have kids,
and I tell them how
I met their mother,
I'm gonna tell them everything,
the whole damn story.
I think it was an Irish bar.
I just, I don't...
I don't understand.
You seemed so happy.
When I was growing up,
you seemed so...
What happened?
We just realized we're
very different people.
Your father's kind of a
head-in-the-clouds romantic,
and I'm much more
down to earth.
So?
Robin and I
are like that.
That doesn't
mean anything.
I wanted kids.
And your mother...
also wanted kids.
Robin and I have
different views on families.
We're not about to break up
because of it.
On some level,
I always knew.
I didn't even want to go out
with him in the beginning.
But he spent months badgering
me until I finally gave in.
Huh.
Well, when you don't connect
on that many fundamental levels,
it's only a matter of time
before you realize
you're not meant
to be together.
But we love Robin.
MR. MOSBY:
Absolutely.
Meeting you was
the highlight of my trip.
Well, second highlight.
MRS. MOSBY:
We'll see you inside.
Sorry.
Wow.
I know.
They love me!
We are definitely going to
try and communicate more.
From now on,
full disclosure.
Good. Good, I think it'll be
really good for the family.
By the way,how's Grandma?
She hasn't returned my last couple calls.
I'm gonna get
some juice.
No.
No.
You missed a great game
last night. Real squeaker.
<font color="#ffff00">welcome to www.1000fr.com</font>

Kids, sometimes your relationship
goes so smoothly for so long
that you think it will be
that way forever.
It never is.
Well, we just had our first fight.
We had our first fight.
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?
A few months ago,
my architecture firm was approached
to design this new building...
It's this big skyscraper
in Spokane.
It'd be a huge project
for his firm.
And if we don't get it,
we could go under.
So anyway, the head architect
unveils his new design
to the whole company.
- No.
- No.
Yes.
All skyscrapers
kind of look like a...
Marshall,
it's a 78-story pink marble tower
with a rounded top
and two spherical
entryways at the front.
Wow, so it's the whole package.
- Yeah, you did.
- Had to.
Oh, dude, if they're selling condos,
you got to get me in.
And don't give me the shaft.
- Yeah, you did.
- Had to.
It's a travesty.
It's gonna define
the skyline of the city.
If it was me, I could've
designed something amazing.
Instead, I'm spending 12 hours
a day designing the cornices.
- Yeah, you did.
- That wasn't one.
So you and Ted
had your first fight.
It obviously ended well.
I mean, you're here with me.
Actually,
it didn't end at all.
I started getting bummed out,
so I came here.
It's what I do.
When my grandma died,
I got a perm.
Ooh, two tragedies in one day.
The thing is,
Ted has been literally
complaining about work
nonstop for weeks.
So, when I came over today,
I was kind of done.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How was your day?
- Good.
Wow, you're a great interviewer.
Aren't you gonna ask
how my day was?
No, I know how it was.
It was awful.
Ooh, you want to rent
a movie tonight?
You know, um...
I listen to your work
stories all the time.
Yeah, but...
and I don't want to be rude here,
but my work stories
are interesting.
I'm a television news reporter.
- Robin...
- What?
I knew exactly
what he was going to say.
I was just helping him
get there faster.
You should work
at a suicide hotline.
And then it got ugly.
What I don't do is tell you
the same story over and over again.
I mean, you wouldn't
watch the same movie
over and over again, would you?
Maybe a great movie
like Die Hard.
But Field of Dreams?
Once is more than enough.
So that's your go-to bad movie?
The number one example
on the tip of your tongue
of a bad movie is
Field of Dreams?
It's about
ghost baseball players.
I think it's stupid.
So, now he's all mad at me
about the stupid movie.
Robin, he's upset because
you wouldn't listen to him,
not because you didn't like
some movie.
How do you not like
Field of Dreams?!
Listening is the foundation
of a relationship.
And if he's really droning on,
you can always practice
saying the alphabet backwards.
You know, in case
you get pulled over for a DUI.
I guess I don't know
how to do that.
Yeah, it's really hard,
even when you're sober.
That's what I tried
to explain to the cop.
No, I mean, I guess I don't know
how to do this girlfriend thing.
I've never been in a relationship
this serious before.
I  should probably go tell him
I'm sorry, shouldn't I?
You're trying to do it right now,
aren't you?
What the hell comes before "Q"?
Then at the end of the movie when
he has a catch with his dad, like...
like he never did when he was
young enough for it to matter.
Can we talk about something else?
You know what, dude?
Forget about Robin, okay?
You're hanging with us tonight.
I've got an awome party lined up.
Oh, God.
This gonna be another one
of your weird all-guy parties?
That was a poker game.
What is wrong with you?
No, it's the first law school
party of the year
and it's gonna be awesome.
I haven't seen this guys since,
like, last year
before Lily and I broke up.
So I'm gonna have
to break the news to everybody.
It's really gonna bum them out.
This party's gonna suck.
Well, love to join you at that one.
But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.
I wish I could join you guys,
but I got to get back
to my apparently boring job.
- Your job's not boring.
- Robin thinks so.
Dude, lots of chicks
think architects are hot.
Think about it,
you create something out of nothing.
You're like God.
There's nobody hotter than God.
I love it when you quote Scripture.
I'm telling you, you should use
the architect angle with the ladies.
Okay, first of all,
I have a girlfriend.
Second, the architect angle
doesn't even work on her.
And, third, I can't imagine
that working on anyone ever.
That's 'cause you're always like...
Ted Mosby, architect.
If it were me, I'd be like...
Ted Mosby, architect.
Anything sounds impressive when
it's said with the right attitude.
Marshall Ericksen.
Recently dumped
and heading to a lame party.
Whoa. Whoa, ladies,
please take it easy.
There's enough of me for everyone.
Oh. Hi. Hello.
All right. We're gonna take off..
Wait up, I'll leave with you guys.
Ted Mosby, architect.
Trust  me.
Hey, just out of curiosity.
If  a guy told you
he was an architect,
what would you think of that?
Are you kidding?
Architects are hot.
How do you think Mr. Brady
scored a babe like Carol?
Solid point.
She did have hair of gold.
- Yes, she did.
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?
No.
Hey, Lily.
- You still single?
- Yes.
You know... I've poured a lot of
free drinks for you over the years.
A lot.
Carl, do you really want
to be with a woman
who would trade sex for beer?
Only if you're into it.
It's on me.
Thanks.
I wonder where Ted went.
Ted Mosby, the architect?
Actually, yeah.
Oh, he is such a cool guy.
He was here earlier.
And what made you decide
you wanted to become an architect?
Well, you know, soul of an artist,
hands of a master craftsman.
It was inevitable, I guess.
I bet you can draw, can't you?
You should draw me.
Well, I could try, but you might end up
looking like a midcentury tri-level.
Hey. If you want, my friend Marshall
invited me to this party we could all go to.
Marshall's great.
He's just a lawyer,
but somebody has to push the paper
around for us creative types.
- Am I right?
- Yeah.
He asked her to a party.
Oh, my God, are you okay?
Okay? It's awesome.
It's a win-win.
Ted got to vent
and I don't have to hear it.
Maybe after he's done with
the talkie-talk, he'll come over
and I'll get the fun part.
What is wrong with you?
God, I feel like I'm teaching
love as a second language here.
Okay, you know how when
he tells you boring work stories
you're supposed to listen?
Well, when he picks up
some random girl at a bar,
you're supposed to freak out.
I'm not freaking out
because in my mind, she's fat.
She's a kickboxing instructor.
Her ass looks better than my face.
All right, we'll swing by the party.
Now the party was for
some of Marshall's classmates
from Columbia Law School,
who by day were some of the sharpest
and most serious
young legal minds in the country.
By night, however...
Damn, these are some
drunk almost-lawyers.
Okay! Seriously...
who wants to shave my ass?!
That guy went on to become
a Supreme Court justice.
Okay, where are
the guys and the hooker?
Yo, what's up, ladies?
Welcome to the party. Yeah!
Just need you to sign
this release protecting the host
from any and all responsibility
should you harm yourself
or a third party.
Then freakin' rage! Yeah!
Hey, drunk legal dude, um...
have you seen Marshall Ericksen?
He was with a guy named Ted.
You mean Ted Mosby, the architect?
Man, what a visionary.
Yeah, they were here.
Awards are nice,
they look good on my shelf.
But none of that acclaim means
anything compared to the joy
of seeing the sun rise over
your first building.
Wow.
I would love to watch
the sun rise with you.
I know you would.
It's the job.
Dude. You should let us
shave your ass tonight.
No way.
Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?
I didn't want to ruin the party
for everybody this early, but, uh...
everyone take a seat.
Um... Lily actually called off
the wedding this summer
to go to San Francisco.
So...
we're broken up.
Her name wasn't on
your lease, was it?
'Cause if not, New York state law,
you're not obligated
to give her half the deposit
when you move.
Yeah, that's not really the part
I was worried about, guys.
And don't forget the precedent set
by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74.
Any personal effects she left
in your house or dwelling
become yours after 30 days.
Guys, can we cease and desist
with the lawyer speak for a minute?
Love died.
The love that made you all believe
in love, that's dead now.
You should sue her.
Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?
On the grounds of... shut up.
That's our attorney general.
See? Marshall's still hung up
on our breakup.
Why? Because I listened to him.
It was a strong
and nurturing relationship
that I threw away like old gum.
Not that I'm worried or anything,
but, um, back to the sun rising
over Ted and, uh... oh,
what tasteful way did you describe her?
The girl with the smackable ass.
Yes, that's the young lady.
So,  I know the bouncer
at this techno club, Posers.
Do you feel like dancing?
Yeah, okay.
There is no way Ted went dancing.
Ted hates clubs.
Hell, yeah. I love clubs.
I mean, I was going to design
a cathedral tonight,
kind of take a whack at the whole
relationship between God and man conundrum.
But sure, let's go dancing.
Wait, let me just check
with my friend.
Okay.
Hey, Marshall. You up for
some super loud, repetitive music
that hasn't changed
since the mid-90s?
Um... only always.
Let's go.
Dancing?
He went dancing with this girl?
Okay, maybe this is a little bad.
Dancing is bad.
Dancing leads to sex.
Did you grow up
in that Footloose town?
I'm calling him.
I'm telling him that I was wrong
and I'm sorry, and I totally want to
listen to his stupid stories.
Yeah, think of another way
to phrase that and you'll be fine.
He's not answering.
Calling Marshall.
Hello.
Marshall, hi, it's Robin.
Can I talk to Ted?
Oh, Robin, hi.
Um, no, Ted's not here tonight.
He's, uh... he's working.
Uh, okay. Bye.
Marshall just lied.
Ted's cheating on me.
Excuse me. I'm looking for
a couple guys who came in here earlier.
One's about six-four, 210,
sandy brown hair.
And the other's a cheating bastard.
You're going to need
to refresh my memory.
Okay, fella, baby knows
how this game's played.
How's a $20 help your memory?
Thanks,  but seriously,
it was crazy tonight.
You really do need
to refresh my memory.
Then can I have the...?
That's cool. You keep that.
So these guys--
one of them's an architect.
Ted Mosby, the architect?
That's the one.
Oh, yeah, he was here.
And then I was all, "No, Frank Gehry.
You're on your own this time."
And that, my dear,
was the end of that hack's career.
I live across the street.
That is one hell of a non sequitur.
You want to come over?
Well, I don't know.
But I suppose I should at least
give you a ride home.
Hop on.
I'll see you at book club, Vinny.
- Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudités.
- Nice.
Dude, dude, what are you doing?
Galloping.
You proved it, all right? The whole
Ted Mosby, architect things works.
Architects rule! Whoo-hee!
Aren't you a little worried
that a certain somebody
might find out that
you're doing this?
This isn't you, Ted.
It is tonight.
Whoo!
You know this girl.
Where does she live?
I'm not telling you that
for less than 20 bucks.
- Well, I'm out of money.
- I'm cashed, too.
I'll take your purse.
My purse?
Yeah, my girl likes clutches.
Okay, fine.
You should tell her that looks
really good with a chocolate boot.
Bitch is lucky I brought
my small purse.
No room for my gun. Here.
Now where does the rodeo slut live?
The building with the green light,
apartment 3-C.
Oh, my God, Robin,
are you going to kick
this girl's ass?
Yeah...
and steal her purse.
I can't believe
he's cheating on me.
You know how many times
I could have cheated?
Six... no seven.
And you know two of them,
and they would surprise you.
3-C, let's do this. You ready?
Should I just kick the door in?
Those are really nice heels
and you already lost the purse.
Let's see if it's unlocked.
It's unlocked.
Okay, get in there
and kick some spankable ass.
Robin.
- I'm the problem.
- What?
You were right.
I don't know how to be a girlfriend.
I took the nicest guy in the world
and I made him a cheater.
Well, don't stand out here
and beat yourself up.
Get in there and beat Ted up.
I'll handle the slutty kickboxer.
Actually, I'll take Ted.
- Let's do this.
- Bring it.
What do you think you're...?
Barney?
Thank God you're here.
Can you help with this? I need nails.
Okay, I'm totally lost here.
Where's Ted?
Ted? He's at work.
How did you get here?
Awesome story. As per usual.
How do you think Mr. Brady
scored a babe like Carol?
Solid point.
- And she did have hair of gold.
- Yes, she did.
Sorry, I forgot my binocs
for Foxy Boxing.
Whoo, looks like things just got
a little foxier right here.
Yes, they did.
And you're just in time.
Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you
in very good, if slightly sullied hands.
Don't go. We don't even know your name
to look out for your buildings.
Yeah, stay.
Excuse us for one second.
Okay, you were right--
the architect thing totally works.
But I've got a girlfriend
and I've got to get back to work.
This project is getting
harder and harder.
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, had to.
See ya.
Sorry, my, uh...
intern had to leave.
Oh, well, that's too bad.
I'm Anna, by the way.
Ted Mosby... architect.
But  none of that acclaim means
anything compared to the joy
of seeing the sun rise
over your first building.
- Dude, dude, what are you doing?
- Galloping.
All right, you proved it. The whole
Ted Mosby, architect thing works.
Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.
Aren't you afraid a certain somebody
might find out about this?
I mean, this isn't you, Ted.
It is tonight.
And that led to a couple of hours
that I cannot, as a gentleman,
divulge to you.
We did it right here,
and here and here.
But why would you use
Ted's name?
I've had some recent bad press
on the World Wide Web.
So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole
"using my real name" thing.
Oh, this is great.
It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.
Everything isn't okay.
Look at me. I'm acting crazy
and jealous and paranoid.
This is how people act
in relationships.
And that's why
I avoid relationships.
Well, guess what,
I haven't been crazy or jealous
or paranoid in months,
and I really miss it.
And thus ended this chapter of,
"Let's pour our hearts out
in the bedroom of Barney's
one-night stand."
Come on, let's go before
she gets out of the shower.
You're such a pig.
You're not even going to say good-bye?
I'll have you know
I composed a lovely form letter
for use in just such an occasion.
Just fill out her name and then...
Something with a "A."
A... A...
I'll just put "resident."
Go, go, go, go.
Robin took a long walk that night.
She thought about how opening
yourself up to another person
usually means opening yourself up
to going a little crazy.
She thought about how much easier
it was just to be alone.
And then she came to see me.
# And I am nothing of a builder #
# But here I dreamt I was an architect... #
Hey.
Hey.
- What are you doing here?
- I brought donuts.
And I don't want to brag,
but they're filled with jelly.
Thanks.
So, uh... how was your night?
It was... fine. Nothing exciting.
How was yours?
You really want to hear about
boring architect stuff?
Yes, I do.
I'm sorry about earlier.
To tell you the truth, I never
even saw all of Field of Dreams.
I fell asleep half way through.
What? The best part's
the last 20 minutes.
Well, maybe they should have moved that
part up a little bit earlier, 'cause...
You know what, um...
What I'm trying to say is...
I love being the person
you bitch to.
So how was your day,
Mr. Architect?
Oh, I like the way
you say that.
Hey, you want to see
the building
that will make every man
in Spokane feel inadequate?
Obviously.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
You know, you didn't mention
all the foliage around the base.
If you trim that back,
the rest would look bigger.
You don't have to tell me.
And, um... just for fun, I've...
I've sort of been working on my own idea
of what I think the building should be.
What do you think?
You know that time we went to Spokane
and I pointed out that skyscraper?
That was the first building
I ever designed.
And that night was the first time
I showed anyone my first drawing of it.
Wow.
Ted, this is amazing.
Thanks.
It's not like it will ever
come to anything.
I don't know.
It might come to something.
You know, girls find
architects very hot.
Okay,
but I don't want you expecting
78 stories or anything.
"Dear Resident...
The time we spent together,
however long it was,
meant the world to me.
I would love to see you again,
but unfortunately, I cannot.
You see, I am a ghost.
I can't only materialize
once every decade
on the anniversary of my death.
I chose to spend my one day among
the living with you,
sweet... Resident.
Perhaps we will meet again
in another decade,
provided you keep your figure.
Until then, all my love
from the beyond.
Barney."
Barney?
Who the hell is Barney?

???
It obviously ended well.
I mean, you're here with me.
Actually, it didn't end at all.
I started getting bummed
out, so I came here.
It's what I do.
When my grandma died,
I got a perm.
Ooh, two tragedies in one day.
The thing is,
Ted has been literally
complaining about work
nonstop for weeks.
So, when I
came over today,
I was kind of done.
Hey.
Hey.
How was your day?
Good.
Wow, you're
a great interviewer.
Aren't you gonna ask
how my day was?
No, I know how it was.
It was awful.
Ooh, you want to rent
a movie tonight?
You know, um...
I listen to your work
stories all the time.
Yeah, but...
and I don't want
to be rude here,
but my work stories
are interesting.
I'm a television
news reporter.
Robin...
What?
I knew exactly what
he was going to say.
I was just helping him
get there faster.
You should work at
a suicide hotline.
And then it got ugly.
What I don't do is tell you the
same story over and over again.
I mean, you wouldn't
watch the same movie
over and over again, would you?
Maybe
a great movie like <i>Die Hard.</i>
But <i>Field of Dreams?</i>
Once is more than enough.
So that's your go-to bad movie?
The number one
example on the tip
of your tongue
of a bad movie
is <i>Field of Dreams?</i>
It's about ghost
baseball players.
I think it's stupid.
(stammers)
So, now he's all mad at me
about the stupid movie.
Robin, he's upset because you
wouldn't listen to him,
not because you didn't like
some movie.
How do you not like
<i>Field of Dreams?!</i>
Listening is the foundation
of a relationship.
And if he's really droning on,
you can always practice saying
the alphabet backwards.
You know, in case you get pulled
over for a DUI.
I guess I don't know
how to do that.
Yeah, it's really hard,
even when you're sober.
That's what I tried to explain
to the cop.
No, I mean, I guess I don't know
how to do this girlfriend thing.
I've never been in
a relationship
this serious before.
I should probably go tell him
I'm sorry, shouldn't I?
You're trying to do it
right now, aren't you?
What the hell comes before "Q"?
Then at the end
of the movie
when he has a catch with his
dad, like...
like he never did when he was
young enough for it to matter.
Can we talk about
something else?
You know what, dude?
Forget about Robin, okay?
You're hanging
with us tonight.
I've got an awesome
party lined up.
Oh, God.
This gonna be another one of
your weird all-guy parties?
That was a poker game.
What is wrong with you?
No, it's the first law
school party of the year
and it's gonna be awesome.
I haven't seen this guys
since, like, last year
before Lily and I broke up.
So I'm gonna have to
break the news to everybody.
It's really gonna bum them out.
This party's gonna suck.
Well, love to join
you at that one.
But I got tickets
to Foxy Boxing.
I wish I could join you guys,
but I got to get back
to my apparently boring job.
Your job's not boring.
Robin thinks so.
Dude, lots of chicks think
architects are hot.
Think about it, you create
something out of nothing.
You're like God.
There's nobody
hotter than God.
I love it when
you quote Scripture.
I'm telling you, you should use
the architect angle
with the ladies.
Okay, first of all,
I have a girlfriend.
Second, the architect angle
doesn't even work on her.
And, third, I can't imagine that
working on anyone ever.
That's 'cause you're always
like...
(dull):
Ted Mosby, architect.
If it were me,
I'd be like...
(suave):
Ted Mosby, architect.
Anything sounds
impressive
when it's said with
the right attitude.
(clears throat)
Marshall Ericksen.
Recently dumped and
heading to a lame party.
Whoa.
Whoa, ladies,
please take it easy.
There's enough of me
for everyone.
Oh. Hi. Hello.
All right.
We're gonna take off.
Wait up, I'll leave
with you guys.
Ted Mosby, architect.
(clicks tongue):
Trust me.
Hey, just out of curiosity.
if a guy told you
he was an architect,
what would you
think of that?
Are you kidding?
Architects are hot.
How do you think Mr. Brady
scored a babe like Carol?
Solid point.
She did have hair of gold.
Yes, she did.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, Carl,
is Ted still here?
No.
Hey, Lily.
You still single?
Yes.
You know...
I've poured a lot of free drinks
for you over the years.
A lot.
Carl, do you really want
to be with a woman
who would trade sex for beer?
Only if you're into it.
It's on me.
Thanks.
I wonder where Ted went.
Ted Mosby,
the architect?
Actually, yeah.
Oh, he is such
a cool guy.
He was here earlier.
And what made you decide
you wanted to become
an architect?
Well, you know,
soul of an artist,
hands of a master
craftsman.
It was inevitable,
I guess.
I bet you can draw,
can't you?
(chuckles modestly)
You should draw me.
Well, I could try,
but you might end up
looking like
a midcentury tri-level.
(laughing)
Hey.
If you want,
my friend Marshall
invited me to this party
we could all go to.
Marshall's eat.
He's just a lawyer,
but somebody has to
push the paper around
for us creative types.
Am I right?
Yeah.
(laughing)
He asked her to a party.
Oh, my God,
are you okay?
Okay? It's awesome.
It's a win-win.
Ted got to vent
and I don't have to hear it.
Maybe after he's done
with the talkie-talk,
he'll come over and
I'll get the fun part.
What is wrong with you?
God, I feel like I'm teaching
love as a second language here.
Okay,
you know how
when he tells you
boring work stories
you're supposed to listen?
Well, when he picks up
some random girl at a bar,
You're supposed to freak out.
I'm not freaking out because
in my mind, she's fat.
She's a kickboxing instructor.
Her ass looks better
than my face.
All right, we'll
swing by the party.
<i>Now the party was for some of</i>
<i>Marshall's classmates</i>
<i>from Columbia Law School,</i>
<i>who by day were</i>
<i>some of the sharpest</i>
<i>and most serious young</i>
<i>legal minds in the country.</i>
<i>By night, however...</i>
(loud music playing)
Ooh...
Damn,
these are some
drunk almost-lawyers.
Okay!
Seriously...
who wants to shave my ass?!
<i>That guy went on to become</i>
<i>a Supreme Court justice.</i>
Okay, where are the guys
and the hooker?
Yo, what's up, ladies?
Welcome to the party. Yeah!
Just need you to sign this
release protecting the host
from any and all responsibility
should you harm yourself
or a third party.
Then freakin' rage!
Yeah!
Hey,
drunk legal dude, um...
have you seen
Marshall Ericksen?
He was with a guy
named Ted.
You mean Ted Mosby,
the architect?
Man, what a visionary.
Yeah, they were here.
Awards are nice,
they look good on my shelf.
But none of that acclaim
means anything
compared to the joy
seeing the sun rise
over your first building.
Wow.
I would love to watch
the sun rise with you.
I know you would.
It's the job.
Dude.
You should let us
shave your ass tonight.
No way.
Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?
I didn't want to ruin the party
for everybody this early,
but, uh... everyone take a seat.
Um... Lily actually called off
the wedding this summer
to go to San Francisco.
So...
we're broken up.
Her name wasn't on
your lease, was it?
'Cause if not,
New York state law,
you're not obligated
to give her
half the deposit
when you move.
Yeah, that's not really the part
I was worried about, guys.
And don't forget
the precedent set by
<i>Smith v. Rosenblatt,</i> '74.
Any personal effects
she left in your house
or dwelling become
yours after 30 days.
(murmuring)
Guys, can we
cease and desist
with the lawyer speak
for a minute?
Love died.
The love that made you all
believe in love,
that's dead now.
You should sue her.
Uh, really?
On what ground, Kara?
On the grounds
of... shut up.
<i>That's our attorney general.</i>
(giggling)
See? Marshall's still
hung up on our breakup.
Why? Because I listened to him.
It was a strong
and nurturing relationship
that I threw away like old gum.
Not that I'm worried
or anything,
but, um, back to the sun rising
over Ted and, uh...
oh, what tasteful way
did you describe her?
The girl with the smackable ass.
Yes, that's
the young lady.
So, I know the bouncer
at this techno
club, Posers.
Do you feel like dancing?
Yeah, okay.
There is no way
Ted went dancing.
Ted hates clubs.
Hell, yeah.
I love clubs.
I mean, I was going to
design a cathedral tonight,
kind of take a whack at
the whole relationship
between God and man
conundrum.
But sure,
let's go dancing.
(squeals)
Wait, let me just check
with my friend.
Okay.
Hey, Marshall.
You up for some super loud,
repetitive music that hasn't
changed since the mid-90s?
Um... only always.
Let's go.
Dancing? He went dancing
with this girl?
Okay, maybe this is
a little bad.
Dancing is bad.
Dancing leads to sex.
Did you grow up
in that <i>Footloose</i> town?
I'm calling him.
I'm telling him
that I was wrong
and I'm sorry,
and I totally want to listen
to his stupid stories.
Yeah, think of another way
to phrase that
and you'll be fine.
He's not answering.
Calling Marshall.
(synthesized dance music)
Hello.
Marshall, hi, it's Robin.
Can I talk to Ted?
Oh, Robin, hi.
Um, no, Ted's not here
tonight.
He's, uh... he's working.
Uh, okay. Bye.
Marshall just lied.
??
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a couple
guys who came in here earlier.
One's about six-four,
210, sandy brown hair.
And the other's
a cheating bastard.
You're going to need
to refresh my memory.
Okay, fella, baby knows
how this game's played.
How's a $20 help
your memory?
Thanks, but seriously,
it was crazy tonight.
You really do need
to refresh my memory.
Then can I have the...?
That's cool. You keep that.
So these guys--
one of them's an architect.
Ted Mosby, the architect?
That's the one.
Oh, yeah, he was here.
And then I was all,
"No, Frank Gehry.
you're on your
own this time."
And that, my dear, was the
end of that hack's career.
I live across the street.
That is one hell
of a non sequitur.
You want to come over?
Well, I don't know.
But I suppose I should at
least give you a ride home.
Hop on.
I'll see you
at book club, Vinny.
I'll be bringing the crudit\s.
Nice. Giddyap.
Dude, dude, what
are you doing?
Galloping.
You proved it, all right?
The whole Ted Mosby,
architect things works.
Architects rule!
Whoo-hee!
Aren't you a little worried
that a certain somebody
might find out that
you're doing this?
This isn't you, Ted.
It is tonight.
(neighing)
Whoo!
You know this girl.
Where does she live?
I'm not telling you that
for less than 20 bucks.
Well, I'm out of money.
I'm cashed, too.
I'll take your purse.
My purse?
Yeah, my girl
likes clutches.
Okay, fine.
You should tell her
that looks really good
with a chocolate boot.
Bitch is lucky I brought
my small purse.
No room for my gun.
Here.
Now where does
the rodeo slut live?
The building with the green
light, apartment 3-C.
Oh, my God, Robin,
are you going to kick
this girl's ass?
Yeah... and steal her purse.
I can't believe
he's cheating on me.
You know how many times
I could have cheated?
Six... no seven.
And you know two of them,
and they would surprise you.
(whispers):
3-C, let's do this.
You ready?
Should I just kick the door in?
Those are really nice heels
and you already lost the purse.
Let's see if it's unlocked.
(whispers):
It's unlocked.
Okay, get in there
and kick
some spankable ass.
Robin.
I'm the problem.
What?
You were right.
I don't know how to be
a girlfriend.
I took the nicest guy
in the world
and I made him a cheater.
Well, don't stand out here
and beat yourself up.
Get in there and beat Ted up.
I'll handle the slutty
kickboxer.
Actually, I'll take Ted.
Let's do this.
Bring it.
What do you think you're...?
Barney?
Thank God you're here.
Can you help with this?
I need nails.
Okay, I'm totally
lost here.
Where's Ted?
Ted? He's at work.
How did you get here?
Awesome story.
As per usual.
How do you think Mr. Brady
scored a babe like Carol?
Solid point.
And she did have
hair of gold.
Yes, she did.
Sorry, I forgot my binocs
for Foxy Boxing.
Whoo, looks like things just got
a little foxier right here.
Yes, they did.
And you're just in time.
Girls, I got to go,
but I'm leaving
you in very good,
if slightly sullied hands.
Don't go.
We don't even
know your name
to look out for
your buildings.
Yeah, stay.
Excuse us for one second.
Okay, you were right--
the architect thing
totally works.
Mm-hmm.
But I've got a girlfriend
and I've got to get
back to work.
This project is getting
harder and harder.
Yeah, you did.
Yeah, had to.
See ya.
Sorry, my, uh...
intern had to leave.
Oh, well, that's too bad.
I'm Anna, by the way.
Ted Mosby...
(clicks tongue) architect.
But none of that acclaim
means anything
compared to the joy
of seeing the sun rise
over your first building.
Giddyap.
(Barney neighing)
Dude, dude,
what are you doing?
Galloping.
All right, you proved it.
The whole Ted Mosby,
architect thing works.
Architects rule!
Whoo-hoo.
Aren't you afraid
a certain somebody
might find out
about this?
I mean, this isn't you, <i>Ted.</i>
It is tonight.
And that led to a couple
of hours
that I cannot, as a gentleman,
divulge to you.
We did it right here,
and here and here.
But why would you use
Ted's name?
I've had some recent
bad press on the World Wide Web.
So I'm taking a T.O.
on the whole
"using my real name" thing.
Oh, this is great.
It wasn't Ted.
Everything's okay.
Everything isn't okay.
Look at me.
I'm acting crazy and jealous
and paranoid.
This is how people act
in relationships.
And that's why I avoid
relationships.
Well, guess what,
I haven't been crazy or jealous
or paranoid in months,
and I really miss it.
And thus ended this chapter of,
"Let's pour our hearts out
in the bedroom of Barney's
one-night stand."
Come on, let's go before
she gets out of the shower.
You're such a pig.
You're not even going
to say good-bye?
I'll have you know I composed
a lovely form letter
for use in just
such an occasion.
Just fill out her name
and then...
Something with a "A."
A... A...
I'll just put "resident."
(door creaking)
Go, go, go, go.
<i>Robin took a long walk</i>
<i>that night.</i>
<i>She thought about how opening</i>
<i>yourself up to another person</i>
<i>usually means opening yourself</i>
<i>up to going a little crazy.</i>
<i>She thought about how much</i>
<i>easier it was just to be alone.</i>
<i>And then she came to see me.</i>
* And I am nothing
of a builder *
* But here I dreamt
I was an architect... *
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I brought donuts.
And I don't want to brag,
but they're filled with jelly.
Thanks.
So, uh... how was your night?
It was... fine.
Nothing exciting.
How was yours?
You really want to hear
about boring architect stuff?
Yes, I do.
I'm sorry about earlier.
To tell
you the truth,
I never even saw all
of <i>Field of Dreams.</i>
I fell asleep half way through.
What? The best part's
the last 20 minutes.
Well, maybe they should have
moved that part up
a little bit
earlier, 'cause...
You know what,um...
What I'm trying to say is...
I love being the person
you bitch to.
So how was your day,
Mr. Architect?
Oh, I like the way

In all the years we lived in new york,
none of us had ever set foot in his apartment.
Until one day,
**********
it's a pretty good story.
And believe it or not,
alcohol did not play a role.
It all started two weeks earlier
at lily's housewarming.
Welcome to my new home.
Oh,wow,lily,this is...
oh,this is all of it.
Yeah,I know it's small,
but it's got character. Thank you.
And I am learning lithuanian
from my neighbors.
They're great.
They're always out there
in the hall,you know,
cooking and gambling and giving
each other haircuts. It's nice.
Hey,is that a toilet
in your kitchen?
Or a stove
in your bathroom?
Oh,that's not
just a stove.
That's a stovenkerator:
A combination of a stove,
oven and sink and refrigerator.
Stovenkerator.
- Isn't that futuristic?
- God,I hope not.
Hey,cool murphy bed.
Yeah,it's kind of a mess.
I didn't make my bed this morning,so...
oh!
You know what,I bet sleeping at this angle
is good for you.
For some reason.
I got it.
that was,something,something,
I am going to,something,you
like a,something,donkey.
Other cultures.
Hey,let's break out

Ok,We have to get Lily
out of that apartment.
Her roommate is a raccoon.
I'd offer her my place,
but I've got dogs and she's allergic.
Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend.
I think she's a little more allergic to that.
What about your place,barney?I know it's
shrouded in mystery,but it's gotta have a couch.
The fortress of barnitude?
No way.
Come on.
She's desperate.
Hmm,normally a prerequisite
for the women I bring home,but... pass.
One of you guys is very,
very lucky because I have...
a boom,an extra ticket to the
alanis morissette concert. Who's in?
- Absolutely not.
- No.
Damn! I got these tickets,
like,months ago for me and lily
and now I can't find
anyone to go with me.
This is what I miss
about being in a couple.
I always had someone
to go to concerts with,
or farmer's market,
or brunch.
God,I miss brunch!
Well,I guess you could--
well,you could try going to brunch alone.
Oh,you don't
think I've tried?
- Table for one.
- One couple?
Um,no,just me.
Really? For brunch?
You're right. Who am I kidding?
Ooh,the popover pantry.That place is great.
Can we go get brunch tomorrow?
- Of course,sweetie.
- Can I go with you guys?
Really? For brunch?
God,I hate being single!
Okay,I'll take the over
on the pittsburgh game.
Oh,and P. To the S.,I never got my payout
from seattle from two weeks ago.
Yeah. Don't make me call
the gaming commission on you.
I'm sure they'd be very interested
to know what's going on over there.
All right? All right?
Okay,I love you,too,mom.
Take care.
Hello,lily.
You've somehow managed
to circumvent my security.
How did you do it?
- Ted gave me your spare key.
- Spare key,brilliant!
I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here
if I had no other choice.
But earlier today,I was getting
ready to go to sleep and...
sveikas.
That's terrible.
Well,see ya.
Well,can i
stay here maybe?
I'd let you,
but I don't have any room.
You live in a two-bedroom
apartment.
You have one room
just for your suits.
Hey,I'm at a point in my life
where my suits are my family.
Look around you,lily.
You are in the heart
of bachelor country,
and as a woman,you are
an illegal immigrant here.
Now,you can try to apply for a sex visa,
but that only lasts 12 hours.
14 if you qualify
for multiple entry.
is something
some lame,judgmental chick would say,
but I say give me
multiple high fives.
you really are desperate.
I really am.
Okay,you can stay
here for two days.
but I only have
one rule.
You can't change anything.
Why would I change anything?
This place is...
...perfect.
Except for the fact
that you don't have a tv.
See that wall?
300-inch flat-screen.
They only sell them in japan,
but I know a guy.
Had to ship it over
in a tugboat like freakin' king kong.
It hurts my eyes.
Yeah. That doesn't
go away.
Hey.
Hey,where have you been?
- The alanis morissette concert.
- By yourself?
No,actually I went
with a friend from law school.
Oh,really?
Who's this friend?
Brad.
Bro,alanis morissette rocks!
Totally! I can't believe
I almost didn't come tonight.
Let me guess: You bought the tickets
for you and lily right before she dumped you.
Yeah,how'd you know?
I just got dumped myself.
What,kara
broke up with you?
I'm sorry,man.
That sucks.
Brad,do you
like brunch?
You invited him
to brunch?
Yeah,I invited him to brunch.
Why,is that weird?
Yes. That's why I was all,
"you invited him to brunch?"
Why can't two guys
who are friends go to brunch?
Because brunch
is kind of...
girly.
Girly? Breakfast isn't girly.
Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?
I don't know.
There's nothing girly about a horse.
Nothing girly about a horn,
but put them together and you get a unicorn.
I don't care what
either of you say,
I am going
to the popover pantry with brad.
We're here. We're hungry.
Get used to it,brunch.
- smells delicious.
- Thank you.
There was no food in the fridge,
so I picked up...
what are you doing?
Lily,what was the
first rule again?
- Don't change anything?
- And what was the second rule?
There was no second rule.
Exactly! There was only one rule
and you broke it.
I bought groceries.
That counts as changing something?
Lily,if I wanted a fridge
full of groceries,or fresh coffee in the morning,
I'd be in a relationship.
But I don't want to be
in a relationship.
That's why I make it crystal-clear
to every girl that walks through that door
that this is not a place
to leave a toothbrusH.
This is not a place to leave
a contact lens case.
This is a place
to leave.
Come on,I'll give you a tour.
Uh,no flash photography,please.
Bienvenido to the bedroom.
Dig this: King-sized bed,
full-sized blanket,one pillow.
Everything about this bed says,
"our work here is done."
Next we say "bienvenue"
to the bathroom.
What,only one towel?
What,no hairdryer?
You know where I keep that stuff?
Your place. Beat it.
And the coup de grace...
yeah,that's right.
Patent-pending.
And wilkommen to the hallway.
While guys like ted and marshall may
hide their porn...
marshall doesn't have porn.
Aww,that's sweet.
While guys like ted and marshall may
hide their porn,I had mine...
professionally lit.
Girls see this,
they can't get out of here fast enough.
And if that doesn't drive them away,
there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.
No,that's just awesome.
So you see,
whenever a girl wakes up here,
I never have to tell her
to go build her nest somewhere else.
My apartment
does it for me.
God,I love brunch.
Oh,damn...
the zucchini bread
is "ridonculous."
This isn't weird,right?
I sort of thought
it might be,but it totally isn'T.
And b-t-dub,you totally
did not oversell the eggs benny.
Right?
I mean,why can't two single bros go out
and rock brunch sunday morning-style?
Exactly. Thank you,that's
exactly what I've been saying.
- This must be destiny.
- What are you talking about?
I have two tickets
for mamma mia friday night.
You like abba,right? What am I saying?
Who doesn't?
Anyway,I was gonna take kara,
but now it's all you and me.
We're gonna do broadway,
bro style. What do you say?
Yeah!
Hey. Did the
cold wake you?
No,I've just been
watching you sleep.
Oh,did you try and take a shower?
I'm sorry,I only have one clean towel.
I don't buy into the myth
that we need to shower every day.
Okay.
I'd offer you some coffee,
but I don't have any,so you're gonna have to...
I'm boycotting coffee.
You may as well drink the tears
of a colombian peasant farmer.
God,I love this place.
Good thing I don't have a job
because I could stay here all day.
I think I left something
on the bookshelf.
Whoops.
Oh,no,oh,look.
Oh,I'm disgusting.
Wow,you're open about your sexuality
and that's one of the reasons I love you.
Did I just say that?
Oh,well,cat's out of the bag.
I love you.
okay,beep,beep.
Backing up,um...
hi,barney. Oh...
oh,my god.
Are you married? Is this your wife?
What? No.
Yes!
- Yes?
- Yes.
You son of a bitch!
I can't believe I let you
enter my sacred temple.
- Come on,baby. please,no.you don't understand.
- Oh,dawn,you can find...
what have I done? This is the worst.
How could you...?
You're not going anywhere.
Live claritin clear.
That was close.
That hippie chick wouldn't leave.
She was ready to squat here.
Well,she'd have to with your spring-loaded
toilet seat,wouldn't she?
She was freakishly immune to
everything in my apartment... except you.
- You're better than porn.
- Thank you?
How would you like to
extend your stay here?
All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife,
and scare off the occasional one-night stand.
I know,I know. You've got your ethics.
You've got your principles...
- I'll do it.
- Really?
Barney,you've clearly got
some serious mother issues
that have left you the emotional equivalent
of a scavenging sewer rat.
But,in my
other apartment,
I would be living with an actual scavenging
sewer rat,so you win.
I'll take it.
- Mamma mia?
- Mamma mia.
You know what? It's supposed
to be a great musical,okay?
It won all sorts
of tonys and stuff.
No,totally. It sounds like a really,really
fun,exciting,third date.
Ooh,third date.
You know what that means.
it is not a date,okay.
It's just two bros taking in a broadway show.
You bros going to get
dinner beforehand?
- We might grab a steak,yeah.
- Where at?
Cafe l'amour.
Brad says the food is
really good there,okay.
Sounds like brad's got quite
the night planned out.
You better bring your "a" game.
That means no granny panties.
All right,
you know what?
You two are just threatened because
I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' turf.
Well,guess what?
It's my territory now.
I'm peeing all over brunches,
fancy dinners and musicals.
That's right; brad and i
are taking back broadway.
What are you going to wear?
I was thinking like this
collared shirt and these pin...
oh,you know what? Shut up.
Can you pass
the arts and leisure?
Can you pass
the arts and leisure?
- I just did.
- Honey,I'M...
barney,
what the hell is going on here?
- Lily,I can explain...
- how could you?
In our own home?
You bastard!
- I'm so sorry. I-i didn't know he had...
- just get out.
This is what I get after I worked as a stripper
for four years to put you through medical school?
I got breast implants for you.
I...
I was just about
to turn on the tears.
Brava.
That was incredible.
And that slap was genius.
You did not hold back.
Yeah,that I just
always wanted to do.
Fair enough.
I have to say,it's kind of nice having food
around here for a change.
You know...
nah,never mind.
What? You're my wife.
You can tell me anything.
Well,if you really wanted
to sell this ruse,
we should try to make
this place a little more...
you know,homey. Like-like a woman
would actually live here.
What did you have in mind?
Bones,bones,
brittle little bones
it's not the milk you seek
it's the sun you need
sugar dumpling,muffin baby
this world is going crazy
do do do do
do do do do
do do do do do
Hey,you're home.
I didn't think we'd be seeing you
until tomorrow morning.
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
It wasn't a date.
Okay,it was a date
and it got way weird.
- Oh,you really don't have to do that.
- No,I insist.You're my guest.
Thanks,brad.
Bro,
you got some chocolate
on your chin.
Still there.
I'll get that bad boy.
Well,it could have been worse.
It could have fallen in your lap.
It gets worse.
No,I-I can do it,brad.
Okay,thank you.
So anyway,ah,it's this saturday.
Do you want to come?
You want me to go to
a wedding with you?
Okay,that's not too bad.
Two single guys on the prowl.
It'll be likewedding crashers.
Just keep brad away
from the bouquet.
It gets worse.
It gets better.The foliage
in vermont this time of year is ridonc.
Vermont?
Yeah,the wedding's
at this awesome b&B.
Kara and I used to go there.
Anyway,
there is one room left,and we got it.
Walt whitman suite,bro.
- You said no,right?
- Of course.
- I understand.
- It's cool.
It's the first time I was going
to see my college friends since kara left me.
I just...
I just miss her so much.
I'll go to vermont with you.
That's great!
You know,uh,they're
registered at pottery barn.
I figure we could go
halfsies on a gravy boat.
I'm sorry.
It's not funny anymore.
Damn you,brunch!
This guy's crazy,right?
Look,I don't think
he's crazy.
I just think he's suffering
from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal.
And unfortunately,
you're his nicotine patch.
And now you have to do
what every dysfunctional couple has to do:
Break up.
You're right.You're right.I promised brad I would
go to the wedding with him,and then that is it .
Good man.
Oh,I think we made the right decision
going for the custom-made italian sheets.
Hey,if my bed's going suit up,
it's going to do it right.
Want to give it a whirl?
Oh.
all right,I'm going to head out,hit the bars.
What are you going to do tonight?
Oh,I was just going
to watch letterman
but,god this bed is so comfy.
I wish you had a tv in here.
Okay,seriously,
what do you do for a living?
Please.
I thought
you were going out.
Eh.
After the monologue.
The next morning,
as the sun rose over manhattan,
your uncle marshall headed over to brad's
apartment to leave for the wedding in vermont.
But when he got there...
no.
No...
no.
No!
No.
Ted.
Um,brad got me flowers.
Hold on.
Brad got him flowers.
I'm sorry.
It just got funny again.
Oh,hey...no,brad,uh,
I don't want to hear it.
I do like you.
And calla lilies are my favorite flower.
I don't know how you knew that.
I guess you just get me,but this is not cool,man.
I can't believe
that you would...
- hey,sweetie.
- Hey.
- Hey,marshall.
- Hi,kara.
So you guys,are like,
back together now?
Yeah.
Happened last night.
Uh,I'm sorry,bro.
I should have called you.
Yeah,you should have.
- Well,I didn't mean to hurt...
- don't,brad.
Just don'T.
There was something
in the air that night
the stars went bright
oh,what was with him?
I don't know.
I think he's in love with me.
I can't believe we just...
you and I...
- what have we done?
- Nothing.Nothing happened.
We-we just went to sleep.
Just went to sleep?I don't sleep
in the same bed as a woman and not make a move.
How could... you.
You spooned me against my will.
Hey,it takes two to cuddle.
We...
we...
we redecorated my place.
We stayed in on a friday night
to watch letterman,
and then slept together
and didn't have sex?
Oh,my god,
we're in a relationship.
That's what you think
a relationship is?
You were supposed to be the vaccine,
but you gave me the disease.
You gotta go.
Barney.
I don't think you're mad at me.
You're mad at yourself.
You let down your guard,
and let someone into your life,
and-and it actually felt okay.
And that terrifies you.
You gotta go.
Hey,you can't just kick me out!
I put a lot of work into this place,
and I've grown accustomed
to a certain standard of living.
A certain standard of living?
You didn't paya single...
and so mr. And mrs. Stinson,after two weeks
of marriage,decided to call it quits.
Fortunately,
they reached a settlement.
And that's the story
of how aunt lily furnished her apartment.
Ynto brad again some time later.
Oh,my god,
it's brad.
Laugh like I said
something really funny.
- Right,right.
- That's was great.
- Hey,marshall.
- Oh,hey,hey,how's it going?
It's good.
Hey,I'm,uh...
yeah,I know
who you are.
Well,I got to go.
I got this thing.
Yeah,me too,
but more important.
- So,I guess I'll see you around.
- Sure. Sure.

***********
In all the years we lived in new york,
none of us had ever set foot in his apartment.
Until one day,
**********
it's a pretty good story.
And believe it or not,
alcohol did not play a role.
It all started two weeks earlier
at lily's housewarming.
Welcome to my new home.
Oh,wow,lily,this is...
oh,this is all of it.
Yeah,I know it's small,
but it's got character. Thank you.
And I am learning lithuanian
from my neighbors.
They're great.
They're always out there
in the hall,you know,
cooking and gambling and giving
each other haircuts. It's nice.
Hey,is that a toilet
in your kitchen?
Or a stove
in your bathroom?
Oh,that's not
just a stove.
That's a stovenkerator:
A combination of a stove,
oven and sink and refrigerator.
Stovenkerator.
- Isn't that futuristic?
- God,I hope not.
Hey,cool murphy bed.
Yeah,it's kind of a mess.
I didn't make my bed this morning,so...
oh!
You know what,I bet sleeping at this angle
is good for you.
For some reason.
I got it.
that was,something,something,
I am going to,something,you
like a,something,donkey.
Other cultures.
Hey,let's break out
the fruit basket.
Hey,who ate all the...?

 Lily
out of that apartment.
Her roommate is a raccoon.
I'd offer her my place,
but I've got dogs and she's allergic.
Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend.
I think she's a little more allergic to that.
What about your place,barney?I know it's
shrouded in mystery,but it's gotta have a couch.
The fortress of barnitude?
No way.
Come on.
She's desperate.
Hmm,normally a prerequisite
for the women I bring home,but... pass.
One of you guys is very,
very lucky because I have...
a boom,an extra ticket to the
alanis morissette concert. Who's in?
- Absolutely not.
- No.
Damn! I got these tickets,
like,months ago for me and lily
and now I can't find
anyone to go with me.
This is what I miss
about being in a couple.
I always had someone
to go to concerts with,
or farmer's market,
or brunch.
God,I miss brunch!
Well,I guess you could--
well,you could try going to brunch alone.
Oh,you don't
think I've tried?
- Table for one.
- One couple?
Um,no,just me.
Really? For brunch?
You're right. Who am I kidding?
Ooh,the popover pantry.That place is great.
Can we go get brunch tomorrow?
- Of course,sweetie.
- Can I go with you guys?
Really? For brunch?
God,I hate being single!
Okay,I'll take the over
on the pittsburgh game.
Oh,and P. To the S.,I never got my payout
from seattle from two weeks ago.
Yeah. Don't make me call
the gaming commission on you.
I'm sure they'd be very interested
to know what's going on over there.
All right? All right?
Okay,I love you,too,mom.
Take care.
Hello,lily.
You've somehow managed
to circumvent my security.
How did you do it?
- Ted gave me your spare key.
- Spare key,brilliant!
I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here
if I had no other choice.
But earlier today,I was getting
ready to go to sleep and...
sveikas.
That's terrible.
Well,see ya.
Well,can i
stay here maybe?
I'd let you,
but I don't have any room.
You live in a two-bedroom
apartment.
You have one room
just for your suits.
Hey,I'm at a point in my life
where my suits are my family.
Look around you,lily.
You are in the heart
of bachelor country,
and as a woman,you are
an illegal immigrant here.
Now,you can try to apply for a sex visa,
but that only lasts 12 hours.
14 if you qualify
for multiple entry.
is something
some lame,judgmental chick would say,
but I say give me
multiple high fives.
you really are desperate.
I really am.
Okay,you can stay
here for two days.
but I only have
one rule.
You can't change anything.
Why would I change anything?
This place is...
...perfect.
Except for the fact
that you don't have a tv.
See that wall?
300-inch flat-screen.
They only sell them in japan,
but I know a guy.
Had to ship it over
in a tugboat like freakin' king kong.
It hurts my eyes.
Yeah. That doesn't
go away.
Hey.
Hey,where have you been?
- The alanis morissette concert.
- By yourself?
No,actually I went
with a friend from law school.
Oh,really?
Who's this friend?
Brad.
Bro,alanis morissette rocks!
Totally! I can't believe
I almost didn't come tonight.
Let me guess: You bought the tickets

and it got way weird.
- Oh,you really don't have to do that.
- No,I insist.You're my guest.
Thanks,brad.
Bro,
you got some chocolate
on your chin.
Still there.
I'll get that bad boy.
Well,it could have been worse.
It could have fallen in your lap.
It gets worse.
No,I-I can do it,brad.
Okay,thank you.
So anyway,ah,it's this saturday.
Do you want to come?
You want me to go to
a wedding with you?
Okay,that's not too bad.
Two single guys on the prowl.
It'll be likewedding crashers.
Just keep brad away
from the bouquet.
It gets worse.
It gets better.The foliage
in vermont this time of year is ridonc.
Vermont?
Yeah,the wedding's
at this awesome b&B.
Kara and I used to go there.
Anyway,
there is one room left,and we got it.
Walt whitman suite,bro.
- You said no,right?
- Of course.
- I understand.
- It's cool.
It's the first time I was going
to see my college friends since kara left me.
I just...
I just miss her so much.
I'll go to vermont with you.
That's great!
You know,uh,they're
registered at pottery barn.
I figure we could go
halfsies on a gravy boat.
I'm sorry.
It's not funny anymore.
Damn you,brunch!
This guy's crazy,right?
Look,I don't think
he's crazy.
I just think he's suffering
from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal.
And unfortunately,
you're his nicotine patch.
And now you have to do
what every dysfunctional couple has to do:
Break up.
You're right.You're right.I promised brad I would
go to the wedding with him,and then that is it .
Good man.
Oh,I think we made the right decision
going for the custom-made italian sheets.
Hey,if my bed's going suit up,
it's going to do it right.
Want to give it a whirl?
Oh.
all right,I'm going to head out,hit the bars.
What are you going to do tonight?
Oh,I was just going
to watch letterman
but,god this bed is so comfy.
I wish you had a tv in here.
Okay,seriously,
what do you do for a living?
Please.
I thought
you were going out.
Eh.
After the monologue.
The next morning,
as the sun rose over manhattan,
your uncle marshall headed over to brad's
apartment to leave for the wedding in vermont.
But when he got there...
no.
No...
no.
No!
No.
Ted.
Um,brad got me flowers.
Hold on.
Brad got him flowers.
I'm sorry.
It just got funny again.
Oh,hey...no,brad,uh,
I don't want to hear it.
I do like you.
And calla lilies are my favorite flower.
I don't know how you knew that.
I guess you just get me,but this is not cool,man.
I can't believe
that you would...
- hey,sweetie.
- Hey.
- Hey,marshall.
- Hi,kara.
So you guys,are like,
back together now?
Yeah.
Happened last night.
Uh,I'm sorry,bro.
I should have called you.
Yeah,you should have.
- Well,I didn't mean to hurt...
- don't,brad.
Just don'T.
There was something
in the air that night
the stars went bright
oh,what was with him?
I don't know.
I think he's in love with me.
I can't believe we just...
you and I...
- what have we done?
- Nothing.Nothing happened.
We-we just went to sleep.
Just went to sleep?I don't sleep
in the same bed as a woman and not make a move.
How could... you.
You spooned me against my will.
Hey,it takes two to cuddle.
We...
we...
we redecorated my place.
We stayed in on a friday night
to watch letterman,
and then slept together
and didn't have sex?
Oh,my god,
we're in a relationship.
That's what you think
a relationship is?
You were supposed to be the vaccine,
but you gave me the disease.
You gotta go.
Barney.
I don't think you're mad at me.
You're mad at yourself.
You let down your guard,
and let someone into your life,
and-and it actually felt okay.
And that terrifies you.
You gotta go.
Hey,you can't just kick me out!
I put a lot of work into this place,
and I've grown accustomed
to a certain standard of living.
A certain standard of living?
You didn't paya single...
and so mr. And mrs. Stinson,after two weeks
of marriage,decided to call it quits.
Fortunately,
they reached a settlement.
And that's the story
of how aunt lily furnished her apartment.
Ynto brad again some time later.
Oh,my god,
it's brad.
Laugh like I said
something really funny.
- Right,right.
- That's was great.
- Hey,marshall.
- Oh,hey,hey,how's it going?
It's good.
Hey,I'm,uh...
yeah,I know
who you are.
Well,I got to go.
I got this thing.
Yeah,me too,
but more important.
- So,I guess I'll see you around.
- Sure. Sure.

Season 02 Episode 05 </font>
kids,when you reach your late twenty,
you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out.
Like with aunt lily.
Even though she was back from san francisco,
she was still on a quest to find herself.
It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten.
I want to get out there and change the world.
I want to find my passion.
And she did find it.
I'm going to be a life coach.
In fact, she found it again and again.
I'm going to be a marine biologist.
...Slam poet.
...Beekeeper!
Not a beekeeper.
Her newest lifelong dream?
Singing in a punk rock band.
What is she doing for money through all this?
Oh, she's been waiting tables at big wave luau.
Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?
No.
Here she comes.Here she comes.
Welcome to big wave luau.Can I tiki your drink order?
Aw, crap.
I'm sorry.
Oh, hi, lily.
We were just in the neighborhood,thought we'd get some lunch.
We didn't even know you'd be here.
What do you want?
I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at big wave luau.
Aloha, island visitors.
The big wave brought you to our humble luau.
For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.
I didn't catch your name.
-- Did you guys catch her name?
-- No.
My name is anuhea.
It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.
Robin, nothing to add?
No.
Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.
Thank you.
Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum
because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.
Birthday girl!

I've never need the beer more than I do right now.
I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake.
I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time
and you said, "dude, my semester is gonna be this."
Yeah, well, it was supposed to be,but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen.
She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us.
To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.
Really?
Laid, you say?
You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.
She hot?
Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.
And she's looking for some action.
Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.
A what?
A cougar.
An older woman,usually in her 40s or 50s,single and on the prowl for a younger man.
What's a woman in her 60s or 70s-- a turtle?
Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.
-- I didn't challenge you to have sex with my professor.
-- Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.
So, I quit my job.
I just couldn't take it anymore.
Approximately 50 times a day,some guy asks me for a lei...
classic.
Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?
Yeah.
Somebody did just quit.
So, where should we eat today?
Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone?
Dude, that is cold-blooded.
It was an honest mistake.
Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it,
it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.
Ted, that girl didn't quit.You destroyed her.
It was an whole chicken.
And did I mention she had 12 sides?
Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure.
Real classy, ted.
So, lily, what do you say?Do you want the job?
What would I be doing?
Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.
You'll sit there.My station is right over here.
And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.
Oh, right, is that the...
yeah.
Here's the model.
You weren't kidding.It really does look like a giant penis.
I know.
For whatever reason, mr.Druthers just doesn't see it.
How can he not see it?I mean there's the...
I know.
-- And the way it...
-- I know.
-- And the two little...
-- I know.
it is just...
spectacular?
Why, thank you.
Lily, this is mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project.
Lily's going to be our new office assistant.
Nice to meet you.
Isn't it?
Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony.
Tell me, do you want to be an architect?
I, uh... I am an arcteg
really?
Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos.
Is he an architect?
Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.
Ted, you've got promise.
But you have to study what I do more carefully.
Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model.
-- Think you can handle that?
-- Absolutely.
-- So you're going to design the...
-- styrofoam trees.
Once again-- with feeling.
Styrofoam trees.
-- Styrofoam trees!
-- Styrofoam trees!
That's the spirit.Now, gather 'round.
This isn't just about trees, ted.
This is about life.
And sometimes in life,
you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm?
Man, that guy is a total, well...
okay, wait, wait, wait.That's professor lewis's office there.
Okay, let's take a look.
Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right.
A prime specimen.
See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics.
Start with the hair.
The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage.
The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar
until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair.
Now, the blouse.
The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey.
If you're watching them bounce,she's about to pounce.
See the claws?
Long and sharp,to ward off rival females...
or open alimony checks.
Yeah, this one's a beaut.
Okay,
let the hunt begin.
Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure
I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.
Who do you rather have grading your papers--
a savage, man-eating jungle cat,
or a purring, satisfied kitty?
Go, barney.
Go mount and stuff that cougar.
Scusi,I am luigi,italian exchange student.
I was, uh,walking to class,
but then I noticed you...
bella principessa...
tell me what you want or get out.
Direct.
I like that.
The name's barney.
What I want... is you.
Turn around.
My place. Two hours.
Don't be tardy.
I can't believe how mr. Druthers treats people.
And that building?
Talk about overcompensating.
He's not usually this bad.
It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us,
so lately he's been a little testy.
You know what I mean--crotchety.
I'm just saying it's been hard on him.
All right stop.
-- Did you show lily your design?
-- No.
What design?
-- It's nothing.
-- It's fantastic.
Just for fun,ted's been working on his own design.
And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia.
At least, not healthy male genitalia.
Ted, you should pitch your building to druthers.
Are you kidding?
He's hammond druthers.He's a legend.I'm just part of his team.
This building is huge for the firm,so it's really important we don't blow it.
all right, enough.
Oh, my god.
Incredible.
Hmm... c-minus.
C-minus?What are you talking about?
I just pulled an all-nighter!
You didn't budget your time well,
you glossed over some of the most important points,
and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.
Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.
Then he stared at me until I laughed.
Okay, I'm done.
Great. I'll put the paints away.You just go show him.
Great. Thanks.
Well, finally.
I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.
Good one, sir.
Anyway, here they are.
Too green.
Too green?
Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color.
Almost brunette.
And think bushier.
I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild,
ungroomed, brunette shrubbery.
Can you picture it, ted?
I can't un-picture it.
Good.
Oh, my god.
It's gone!
What? What's gone?
My baseball signed three tes by pete rose.
Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.
What do you think, ted,
it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away?
Somebody stole it.
Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.
Oh, who cares about the trees?
It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.
Inspiring as always, sir.
Lily?
Where's she put those paints?
Hey.
Hey.
Um, lily, question for you.
Why did I find mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by pete rose in your desk drawer?
That's easy. I took it.
Why?
It's simple.
I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef.
I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university.
Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you.
I didn't get you a birthday present.
What? You gonna cry?
Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry?
Hey, everybody, look!
The little crybaby's gonna cry!
I lost my ice cream!
Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one,
but the point is, he was mean.
And that's why I took away his ball.
What does his ball have to do with anything?
Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that.
When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean,
I would take away one of his toys.
The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.
Hey, guys. What's going on?
Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by pete rose.
Why? Was he being mean?
You know about this?
Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice.
Did you tell him about that time at the gap?
Oh, that was a good one.
This sales guy was rude to robin,so I took a pair of khakis.
I gave them to you for your birthday.
So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?
I prefer to call them "justice khakis."
That's not justice.It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.
So is being mean.
Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense.
In kindergarten,the kid knew why he was being punished.
Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.
Well, that's why I left a note.
-- A note?
-- Yeah.
When he finds it,he'll understand why his ball was taken away,he'll stop being mean,
and the office will be a nicer place to work.
Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.
Look, lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having,
with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny,
but this is my career you're messing with.
I'm not sure I like your tone.
You know what?
Now you just lost the ball.
I'd ask you how last night went,but we had a pop quiz today.
Nobody got higher than a c-minus.
I know, I know.
You claim to have so much sex.I only assumed  you'd be good at it.
Look, I miscalculated.
I thought she'd be old and fragile,like most cougars.
But kitty's got claws.
Don't worry though.
Tonight, I'm seeing her again.
Just let it go, man.You're making things worse.
I promise you,after tonight,that cougar will be my pet,
and I its master.
I think I'm falling in love with you.
Oh, god. That wasn't your first time, was it?
Although that would explain a lot.
What? No.We had sex yesterday.
Oh, right. That.
Well, you had sex yesterday.
I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.
When druthers goes to get his bagel,I'll go in, grab the note,put the ball back.
If something goes wrong,yell out, "who wants espresso?"
So I'll know he's coming.Got it? Okay,
-- now give me the ball.
-- No.
What do you mean, no?
I mean I stand by what I did, ted.
Come on, lily.We're running out of time.
Everybody get in here now!
Who wants espresso?
Now, as most of you know,my pete rose, pete rose, pete rose baseball has been stolen.
Well, I just found this note.
"Dear mr. Druthers,I, your baseball, am leaving.
"Maybe, if you start being nice, I'll come back.
"If not, other things in your office may follow my lead.
"In fact, I overheard your ipod talking,and he may shuffle off at any minute."
Normally,I would scream at everyone until my voice goes,
but maybe that's the wrong reaction here.
Interesting.
Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day
to decide he's homesick,
or, tomorrow morning,I'll begin firing three people an hour.
And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well,
then you are gambling more than pete rose--
major league baseball's all-time hit leader,
a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world-- ever
"allegedly" did!
Wow. Looks like bye-bye, ipod.
Give him his ball back right now.
People are going to get fired.
No, they're not.
It's just a tantrum, ted.
I saw this in kindergarten all the time.
This isn't kindergarten.Mr. Druthers is an adult,and he wants his ball back.
All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.
No. You'll give it back or you're fired.
I'm sorry, ted.I just can't do that.
Then you're fired.
Fine.
Here's the ball.
At least you have one now.
Dude,you're killing me.
You didn't tame the cougar.You just made her angrier.
Do you not see the powerbar in my hand?
I'm fueling up.
So you're going back over there?
Oh, yeah. And tonight,just like john mellencamp,
I am going to get rid of the "cougar" once and for all.
Get it?
'Cause that's what he did with his name.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Please give me another chance.
Barney, I teach all day.It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.
But you don't understand.See, I've been going easy on you, holding back,
'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something.
But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes--
days, weeks, half a year.
Fine.Come in.
You can start while I finish grading some papers.
Hurry up.Clients will be here any moment.
Now, slide it closer to his chair.
I want this thing to really smack him in the face.
Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about lily.
Oh. Well, I pity her.
I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note...
you might say that lily was mentally deranged.
You might say that, ted.
Lily was mentally deranged.
You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.
Lily was mentally deranged!
Oh! That's a bit harsh,don't you think, ted?
The clients are here.
Excellent. Bring them in.
Our client was a major bank and financial services company in spokane.
They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the spokane national bank building.
That's a penis!
That'S... that's ridiculous.
There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.
We're not building a penis.
You got any other ideas?
Other ideas?
You said you wanted hammond druthers.
This is hammond druthers.
Well, hats off to your ladyfriends,
but I'm not building it.
We're done here.
The trajectory of my entire career might have been different
had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.
Wait!
We have one more idea for you.
ted,What are you doing?
I have another design.
Sit down, shut up right now.
No.
to ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories probably!
Probably!
Congrats, ted.
Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to druthers and pitch my idea.
Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.
Oh. You know what, ted?
That was very nice.
You have earned these screws back.
Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.
Hey, I'm project manager now,so, if you want your old job back...
no, thanks.
I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.
casey, that's not how we treat people.
You'll get this back
when you learn to be nice.
Sbarney! Oh, my god!
What happened?
He broke his hip.
That's not true.It's just temporarily dislocated.
Seriously, I'm fine.
No, he's not fine.
Professor lewis, hi.
Mr. Eriksen. Hello.I graded your paper tonight.
I was pleasantly surprised.
Yeah, she was.
B-plus.
B-plus?!
Marshall,
after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy,
I am going to get you that "a"!
Let her go.
She belongs out there in the wild.
You should feel proud.
You fought the cougar and lived.
It was an amazing safari.
I can't wait to show you guys the slides.
Kids, when you reach your late
20s you might be surprised
to discover you still don't
have life quite figured out.
Like with Aunt Lily.

Not a beekeeper.
Her newest lifelong dream?

money through all this?
Oh, she's been waiting

Wait, you mean that
Hawaiian place
where they wear those

No.
Here she comes. Here she comes.
Welcome to Big Wave Luau.
May I tiki your drink order?
Aw, crap.

Oh, hi, Lily.

Thank you.
Although, you might want to
bring out the big Hawaiian drum
because I'm pretty sure
today's my birthday.
Birthday girl!
I have never needed beer
more than I do right now.
I thought you said your semester
was gonna be a piece of cake.
I remember because you were eating
a piece of cake at the time
and you said, "Dude,

Yeah, well,
it was supposed to be,

To tell you the truth,
I think she just needs to get laid.
Really?
Laid, you say?
You wouldn't be into her.
She's, like, in her late 40s.

Lily, this is Mr. Druthers,
the head architect on the project.
Lily's going to be our
new office assistant.
- Ah.
- Nice to meet you.
Isn't it?
Ted, I looked at your design
for the penthouse balcony.
Tell me,
do you want to be an architect?
I, uh... I am an architect.
Really?
Well, my six-year-old
nephew plays with Legos.
Is he an architect?
Well, not unless he somehow
passed all his licensing exams.
Ted, you've got promise.
But you have to study
what I do more carefully.
Now I want you to design
some Styrofoam trees
for the building model.
- Think you can handle that?
- Absolutely.
Good. So you're going
to design the...
- Styrofoam trees.
- Once again-- with feeling.
- Styrofoam trees.
- Styrofoam trees!
- Styrofoam trees!
- That's the spirit.
Now, gather 'round.
This isn't just about trees, Ted.
This is about life.
And sometimes in life,
you have to get the trees just right
or you're fired, hmm?
Man, that guy is
a total, well...
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
That's Professor Lewis's office there.
Okay, let's take a look.
Oh, yeah,
it's a cougar all right.
A prime specimen.
See, you can identify a cougar
by a few key characteristics.
Start  with the hair.
The cougar keeps up
with current hairstyles
as a form of camouflage.
The prey may not realize
that he's engaged a cougar
until he's already
being dragged, helpless,
back to her lair.
Now,  the blouse.
The cougar displays
maximum cleavage possible
to captivate her prey.
If you're watching them bounce,
she's about to pounce.
See the claws?
Long and sharp,
to ward off rival females...
or open alimony checks.
Yeah, this one's a beaut.
Okay, let the hunt begin.
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm not so sure I'm comfortable
with you hunting my
constitutional law professor.
Who do you rather have
grading your papers--
a savage,
man-eating jungle cat,
or a purring, satisfied kitty?
Go, Barney.
Go mount and stuff that cougar.
Scusi, I am Luigi,
Italian exchange student.
I was, uh, walking to class,
but then I noticed you...
bella principessa...
Tell me what you
want or get out.
Direct.
I like that.
The name's Barney.
What I want... is you.
Turn around.
My place. Two hours.
Don't be tardy.
I can't believe how Mr.
Druthers treats people.
And that building?
Talk about overcompensating.
He's not usually this bad.
It's just that the partners
have made it very clear
this project is make
or break for us,
so lately he's been
a little testy.
You know what I
mean-- crotchety.
I'm just saying it's
been hard on him.
All right stop.
- Did you show Lily your design?
- No.
- What design?
- It's nothing.
It's fantastic.
Just for fun,
Ted's been working on his own design.
And it doesn't look at
all like male genitalia.
At least,
not healthy male genitalia.
Ted, you should pitch your
building to Druthers.
Are you kidding?
He's Hammond Druthers.
He's a legend.
I'm just part of his team.
This building is
huge for the firm,
so it's really important
we don't blow it.
All right, enough.
Oh, my God. Incredible.
Hmm... C-minus.
C-minus? What are
you talking about?
I just pulled an all-nighter!
You didn't budget
your time well,
you glossed over some of
the most important points,
and your oral presentation
was sloppy and inconclusive.
Mr. Druthers asked if
you were making the trees
or waiting for them to
sprout on their own.
Then he stared at
me until I laughed.
Okay, I'm done.
Great. I'll put the paints away.
You just go show him.
Great. Thanks.
Well, finally.
I wondered whether you
were making the trees
or waiting for them to
sprout on their own.
Good one, sir.
Anyway, here they are.
- Too green.
- Too green?
Yes, the leaves should really be
more of a natural brown color.
Almost brunette.
And think bushier.
I want this tower to rise
from a thicket of wild,
ungroomed, brunette shrubbery.
Can you picture it, Ted?
I can't un-picture it.
Good.
Oh, my God.
It's gone!
What? What's gone?
My  baseball signed three
times by Pete Rose.
Well, it's got to be
around here somewhere.
What do you think, Ted,
it just let itself out of its
plastic case and rolled away?
Somebody stole it.
Well, um, I better get back
to these Styrofoam trees.
Oh, who cares about the trees?
It's just busy work to make you
feel like you're contributing.
Inspiring as always, sir.
Lily?
Where's she put those paints?
Hey.
Hey. Um, Lily,
question for you.
Why did I find
Mr. Druthers' baseball
signed three times by Pete
Rose in your desk drawer?
That's easy. I took it.
Why?
It's simple.
I can't believe there's no
horseradish for the roast beef.
I guess you were sick the day they
taught that at Sandwich University.
Mother, no one from the nursing
home is stealing from you.
I didn't get you a
birthday present.
What? You gonna cry?
Little crybaby's going to cry?
Hey, everybody, look!
The little crybaby's gonna cry!
I lost my ice cream!
Okay, I may have
exaggerated that last one,
but the point is, he was mean.
And that's why I
took away his ball.
What does his ball have
to do with anything?
Druthers has to be taught
he can't behave like that.
When I was teaching kindergarten,
whenever a kid was mean,
I would take away
one of his toys.
The kid would be
upset at first,
but then he'd learn
to stop being mean.
Hey, guys. What's going on?
Lily stole my boss' baseball
signed three times by Pete Rose.
Why? Was he being mean?
- You know about this?
- Yeah.
It's her own personal
form of justice.
Did you tell him about
that time at the Gap?
Oh, that was a good one.
This sales guy
was rude to Robin,
so  I took a pair of khakis.
I gave them to you
for your birthday.
So I've been walking
around in stolen khakis?
I prefer to call them
"justice khakis."
That's not justice.
It's shoplifting, and it's a crime.
So is being mean.
Lily, your little system
doesn't even make sense.
In kindergarten,
the kid knew why he was being punished.
Druthers just thinks
someone stole his ball.
Well, that's why I left a note.
- A note?
- Yeah.
When he finds it, he'll understand
why his ball was taken away,
he'll stop being mean,
and the office will be
a nicer place to work.
Maybe he'll even be open
to hearing your ideas.
Look, Lil, we're all tolerating
this prolonged nervous
breakdown you're clearly having,
with the punk band and the
beekeeping and the petty larceny,
but this is my career
you're messing with.
I'm not sure I like your tone.
You know what?
Now you just lost the ball.
Hey.
I'd ask you how last night went,
but we had a pop quiz today.
Nobody got higher
than a C-minus.
I know, I know.
You claim to have so much sex.
I only assumed
you'd be good at it.
Look, I miscalculated.
I thought she'd be old and fragile,
like most cougars.
But kitty's got claws.
Don't worry though.
Tonight, I'm seeing her again.
Just let it go, man.
You're making things worse.
I promise you, after tonight,
that cougar will be my pet,
and I its master.
I think I'm falling
in love with you.
Oh, God.
That wasn't your first time, was it?
Although that would
explain a lot.
What? No. We had sex yesterday.
Oh, right. That.
Well, you had sex yesterday.
I revised my syllabus
for the spring semester.
When Druthers goes
to get his bagel,
I'll go in, grab the note,
put the ball back.
If something goes wrong,
yell out, "Who wants espresso?"
so I'll know he's coming.
Got it?
Okay, now give me the ball.
- No.
- What do you mean, no?
I mean I stand by
what I did, Ted.
Come on, Lily.
We're running out of time.
Everybody get in here now!
Who wants espresso?
Now, as most of you know,
my Pete Rose, Pete Rose,
Pete Rose baseball has been stolen.
Well, I just found this note.
"Dear Mr.
Druthers, I, your baseball, am leaving.
Maybe, if you start being nice,
I'll come back.
If not, other things in your
office may follow my lead.
In fact,
I overheard your iPod talking,
and he may shuffle
off at any minute."
Normally, I would scream at
everyone until my voice goes,
but maybe that's the
wrong reaction here.
Interesting.
Instead, I'm giving my baseball
until the end of the day
to decide he's homesick,
or, tomorrow morning,
I'll begin firing three people an hour.
And, if the thief
doesn't believe me, well,
then you are gambling
more than Pete Rose--
major league baseball's
all-time hit leader,
a man whose absence from the
Hall of Fame is a travesty
to the entire sports world--
ever "allegedly" did!
Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.
Give him his ball
back right now.
People are going to get fired.
No, they're not.
It's just a tantrum, Ted.
I saw this in kindergarten
all the time.
This isn't kindergarten.
Mr. Druthers is an adult,
and he wants his ball back.
All right, I'll give it back
if you show him your plans.
No. You'll give it
back or you're fired.
I'm sorry, Ted.
I just can't do that.
Then you're fired.
Fine.
Here's the ball.
At least you have one now.
Dude, you're killing me.
You didn't tame the cougar.
You just made her angrier.
Do you not see the
PowerBar in my hand?
I'm fueling up.
So you're going
back over there?
Oh, yeah.
And tonight,
just like John Mellencamp,
I am going to get rid of the
"Cougar" once and for all.
Get it?
'Cause that's what he
did with his name.
I can't stop
thinking about you.
Please give me another chance.
Barney, I teach all day.
It's the last thing I want
to do when I get home.
But you don't understand.
See, I've been going easy on you,
holding back, 'cause I was afraid
you'd break a hip or something.
But, this time, no mercy.
I don't care how long it takes--
days, weeks, half a year.
Fine. Come in.
You can start while I
finish grading some papers.
Hurry up.
Clients will be here any moment.
Now, slide it closer
to his chair.
I want this thing to really
smack him in the face.
Mr. Druthers, thank you again
for understanding about Lily.
Oh. Well, I pity her.
I mean, to steal from my office and
then write that slanderous note...
You might say that Lily
was mentally deranged.
You might say that, Ted.
Lily was mentally deranged.
You might even say it loud
enough for everyone to hear.
Lily was mentally deranged!
Oh! That's a bit harsh,
don't you think, Ted?
The clients are here.
Excellent.  Bring them in.
Our client was a major bank and
financial services company in Spokane.
They wanted a modern
skyscraper that still captured
the distinct flavor and
history of the Northwest.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you
the Spokane National
Bank Building.
That's a penis!
That's... that's ridiculous.
There's no way this majestic
tower can be confused
with the male organ of love.
We're not building a penis.
You got any other ideas?
Other ideas?
You said you wanted
Hammond Druthers.
This is Hammond Druthers.
Well, hats off to
your ladyfriends,
but I'm not building it.
We're done here.
The trajectory of my entire
career might have been different
had I not unwittingly worn
my justice khakis that day.
Wait!
We have one more idea for you.
Ted, what are you doing?
I have another design.
Sit down, shut up right now.
No.
# Thank you for the invitation #
# She showed me very nice... #
To Ted! The youngest person
to ever design a building
over 70 stories probably!
Probably!
Congrats, Ted.
Hey, thanks for telling me
to stand up to Druthers
and pitch my idea.
Seriously, none of this would have
happened if it weren't for you.
Oh. You know what, Ted?
That was very nice.
You have earned
these screws back.
Don't sit in your desk chair
until you've put them back in.
Hey, I'm project manager now,
so, if you want your
old job back...
No, thanks.
I think I figured out what
I want to be when I grow up.
Casey, that's not
how we treat people.
You'll get this back when
you learn to be nice.
- Barney! Oh, my God!
- What happened?
He broke his hip.
That's not true.
It's just temporarily dislocated.
Seriously, I'm fine.
No, he's not fine.
Professor Lewis, hi.
Mr. Eriksen. Hello.
I graded your paper tonight.
I was pleasantly surprised.
Yeah, she was.
B-plus.
B-plus?!
Marshall, after I've gone through
my eight weeks of physical therapy,
I am going to get you that "A"!
Let her go.
She belongs out
there in the wild.
You should feel proud.
You fought the
cougar and lived.
It was an amazing safari.
I can't wait to show
you guys the slides.

- So, I guess that decides it.
- Yup.
Hanging out at a coffee place
is not nearly as much fun
as hanging out at a bar.
Man, what's that?
What?
That cute coffee girl
wrote a heart by your name.
Somebody has a crush on you.
Somebody thinks you're me.
Do you really
think she likes me?
I mean, I guess
it's not that surprising.
Every time I come in here,
I totally crack her up.
Marshall, here's
your pumpkin latte.
Wow. How did you fit a
pumpkin in this little cup?
I'll have a pumpkin latte.
How do they even fit a
pumpkin in those little cups?
What? You got a shrink
ray back there?
Yeah.
Hey, remember that
time I said that thing
about how do they fit a
pumpkin into that little cup?
- Which time?
- The first time.
Yeah. That was really funny.
Right.
All right, there's only two
reasons she'd laugh at that.
One, it's the first
joke she's ever heard,
or two, she likes you.
You should totally ask her out.
You think?
Yeah, that why you're not
back with Lily, right?
So you can experience what
it's like to be single.
Well, what if the heart
doesn't mean anything?
What if she writes
it on all the cups?
Mine says "Ted," no heart.
Mine says... "Swarley."
How'd they get
"Swarley" from "Barney"?
It's not even a name.
Who would ever be
called "Swarley"?
Oh, please don't start
calling me "Swarley."
This would never
happen at a bar!
Man! What's up with Swarley?
I know. You almost never see
old Swarlz get that upset.
Hey, guess what?
Oh, sorry.
It's only my mom.
She's just rambling
on like always.
What happened?
Marshall asked out a girl.
Wow.
Well, if anything,
that's Dad's fault.
That'll keep her going a while.
Oh, of course, you know,
he had a little help.
Swarley hooked him up?
Oh, good. You got my text.
- Yeah.
- Oh. No, it was me.
I gave Marshall
one of my secrets.
- So, what she say?
- Nothing.
I don't think she heard me.
It's pretty busy up there.
What? You gave her
the look right?
Head down, eyes looking up,
hands in pockets, shoulders up,
head slightly tilted,
conveying shy vulnerability.
I think so.
Look, can we just go?
Pumpkin latte for Marshall.
I didn't order that.
Phone number.
I love that look.
I think I slept with you
because of that look.
And it's fake?
Oh, and you biting your lower lip,
shyly looking away
and thrusting your
chest out is natural?
Yeah, I hear you.
- Hey!
- Hey, guys.
Are you free tomorrow night?
I was thinking of having
a wine tasting slash
"help me catch the rat
in my apartment" party.
That's a great idea.
You can put out cheese for both.
I should invite
Marshall, right?
It'd be weird if I didn't.
Yeah, I don't think he can go.
Really? Why not?
Uh, okay, um...
Lily, we have to
tell you something.
Marshall has a date.
Oh. Well... good for him.
Really? You're okay with it?
Look, we've been broken
up almost six months.
I mean,
I'm not thrilled about the idea,
but he has every right
to date someone else.
That's very mature.
Why are you holding the phone?
Oh, shoot.
That's hilarious, Mom.
Didn't even notice.
Hey, dude, by the way,
I really like that suit.
Tell me about the fabric.
Is it foreign or something?
Wow. It is foreign.
I'm impressed, Ted.
- It's Moroccan, actually.
- Whoa.
I got a call for Swarley.
Is there a Swarley here?
You weren't interested in
my suit at all, were you?
- Hmm?
- Swarley!
Yeah, I know he's there.
It's really important.
Could you ask again?
Important call for Swarley!
Geez,  can't you hear him, Swarley?
There's a call for you.
Stop calling me that.
Uh...  Hey, I'd like you guys
to officially meet Chloe.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
It's nice to meet you guys.
- I'll be right back.
- It's right back there.
Right? Right? She's hot!
And she likes me?
She likes Italian food.
I also like Italian food.
She likes Billy Joel.
I also like... music.
And I think we're
going to go out again.
- Dude, you gotta ditch her.
- Obviously.
Why?
She's got the crazy eyes.
Dude. The eyes.
They're crazy.
What are you guys talking about,
the crazy eyes?
It's a well-documented condition
of the pupils, or pupi.
No. Just pupils.
It's an indicator of
future mental instability.
She does not have
the crazy eyes.
You just can't see it
because you're afflicted
with "haven't been laid
in a while" blindness.
She was too far away
in the coffee place,
but when I saw her
up close just now...
Hey, I'd like you guys to
officially meet Chloe.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
It's nice to meet you guys.
You guys,
I'm not going to stop dating Chloe
just because you think
she has the crazy eyes.
You can keep going out with her,
but you're gonna regret it.
One time,
I met a girl at this very bar.
I saw that she had
the crazy eyes...
...but I ignored it.
And then, sure enough.
Barney, can I ask
you a question?
Anything.
Would you like to
have a threesome?
Of course.
Great. It'll be you,
me and Mr. Weasels.
So, did you do it?
No. It ended up
being just a twosome
with the third one
watching from a chair.
Which one were you?
I'd rather not say.
Look, there was a time I didn't
believe in the crazy eyes either,
and then I met Jeanine.
She had serious crazy eyes.
I told myself I was
just imagining it, but then...
So, should we go get a drink?
As long as it's in
your apartment.
Whoa, I'm sorry.
Watch! Where! You're! Going!
So, where do you live?
You guys, Chloe is not
gonna do any of that stuff.
She's a nice girl
from Nebraska.
She's not crazy.
She's... she's awesome.
But you can't avoid
the crazy eyes forever.
Sooner or later, the crazy
comes bubbling to the surface.
Hello?
Marshall, it's Chloe.
Are you the one who's
called me like nine times?
Yeah. Could you come get me?
I'm in the middle
of taking a test.
Please.  I'm so scared.
Well, what's going on?
This weird midget guy
started following me
and he was screaming at me
and he had a limp and
a big hump on his back
and the police
didn't believe me
and I almost got trampled
by a horse and...
God I must sound totally
crazy to you right now.
No. Pfft.
Not at all.
So, she's needy crazy.
That's one of the worst kinds.
I've had one of those.
Makes up stories
to get attention.
Went out with her for three weeks--
her dad died twice.
Guys, she was really
freaked out, okay?
Maybe the story is true.
What in the world would make
you believe that's a true story?
She's really hot.
They always are.
- You all done with that, Ted?
- Yeah.
Ned. I told you
to call him Ned.
That's just sad.
Sorry, Swarley.
So, do just you
and Ted live here
or does Swarley live here, too?
Nah. Swarley has his own place.
What was that?
Oh, I, uh, dropped my keys.
So, here you go.
Two pumpkin beers.
I was joking.
They're regular beers.
What is that?
This picture is broken.
Oh. That's too bad.
Is that Lily?
Is  that the girl you
were going to marry?
Yeah. Is that what
that sound was?
Did you just smash this?
No.
Why would I do that?
Let me look into your eyes.
Okay.
I had a really
nice time tonight.
Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.
I like your eyes a lot, too.
Stop!
Hi. I'm Lily.
Stop!
Now, kids,
I know Lily hiding in the apartment
while Marshall was on a date with
another girl seems pretty crazy,
but when you hear her
side of the story,
well, it's still pretty crazy.
What's up Swarlz?
No. Okay? No. No more.
I will not let this
become a thing. It's over.
No more Swarley. No Swarlz.
No more Swar-lay.
No  more Swar...
wait for it... ley.
No more Bob Swarley, mon.
No more. No! It's over.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Thank you.
Nice.
- Why didn't you call me?
- Was I supposed to call you?
Yes, about the whole Marshall-
dating-another-girl thing.
You said you were fine with it.
Yeah, in front of Ted,
but then I shot you a look.
- What look?
- This.
That doesn't seem like a look.
Yes it is. It means,
"I'm upset call me later."
You should have pulled me aside
and told me what the look meant.
If I pulled you aside,
I wouldn't need the look.
Well, maybe if it was a
more distinctive look...
Okay, the look isn't important.
What's important is that
I can't stand the idea
of Marshall dating
another woman.
I mean, what if
he falls in love with her?
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,
Ted says she has
the crazy eyes.
What's that?
Apparently, a thing women
have that guys can see
and it tells them that
the girl's crazy.
Oh, kind of like how you
never want to date a guy
with perfect fingernails?
Jerk nails. Exactly.
Well, did-did Ted say
whether she was good-looking?
I mean,
'cause if I knew she was ugly,
then maybe I wouldn't
be so freaked out.
Uh, he didn't say,
but you can find out.
I think her name is Chloe--
she works at Cosa Coffee on 78th.
Phone call for Swarles Barkley?
Hey, Ted. No, he's not here.
Good one, though--
remember that one.
Is, um, Chloe here?
She just left.
You can probably still catch her.
She's easy to spot--
she's got a pink umbrella.
Oh, thanks, Brian.
My name is Scott.
Your tag says Brian.
I know. Funny story.
So, I wake up this
morning, and...
Yeah, see you later, Brian.
There she is.
She doesn't look that great.
She's not fat,
but that doesn't mean anything.
I know tons of skinny,
ugly women.
That's right,
snotty girl in my yoga class,
I'm talking to you.
Come on, Chloe, turn around.
Here we go. Turn around, Chloe.
Come on,
show me that hideous face.
Damn it!
Ooh, I know,
I'll get ahead of her,
then I'll cut back so I... Aah!
Oh, my God, that hurts!
Turn around! Come on!
Just turn around!
Okay, this is ridiculous.
Hey!
Turn around!
What's the matter with you?
Hey, you!
Turn around!
Turn around, Chloe!
She's hot? I'm so sorry.
No, it's fine.
I-It just makes things easier.
Now that I know she's a threat,
all I have to do is keep Marshall
from ever seeing her again.
Okay, I have two plans--
you can help me choose.
Plan A--
remember that time Marshall
and I had sex in the bathroom?
Oops, I got knocked up.
- Lily.
- Okay, plan B
is called "Chloe's Accident."
- Just stop.
- What?
Lily, you can't do
any of those things.
If you two are ever
gonna get back together,
you have to let him work
out whatever this is.
I know. You're right.
Now, come on,
Ted asked us to be upstairs at 6:00.
Some surprise for Barney.
- Barney?
- Uh, Swarley.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
Where's Marshall?
Oh, he's getting a haircut.
Oh. For his date.
Good for him.
Hope he has a good
time tonight.
Relax, you've got
nothing to worry about.
The girl's crazy.
Thanks!
He'll just have wild monkey
sex with her five times, max,
and be done with her.
Thanks again.
What are you doing?
I just wanted to listen to
a little music, that's all.
And this next one's
going out to Swarley.
All your friends know
you miss Barney,
but he's gone,
and you got to accept that, baby.
And, Swarley, you're gonna be
a better woman for it.
Here's "I Am Woman"
by Helen Reddy.
Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman.
I love it!
You know, I was thinking about this
whole new name thing last night,
and you know what I realized?
I like it.
You like being called Swarley?
Are you kidding?
I want you to call me that.
Do you really think
this is gonna work?
Do I think what's gonna work?
I'm just saying, I love my new name,
so please only call
me that from now on.
Call you what?
You know, that-that-that new name
that you've been calling me.
Say it.
Why? You guys know what it is.
Say the name.
No, I don't want to! I hate it!
I hate it! It's not funny!
It's never been funny!
I've never done any...
No!
Man, he is really gonna lose it
when all the magazine
subscriptions start coming in.
I signed him up for
People in Espanol,
but I addressed it to Swarlos.
Hey, where's the picture of
Marshall and me at the pier?
Didn't it used to
be by that window?
Oh, yeah, he, uh,
he sort of took it down when you left.
Put it behind some books,
I think.
Oh, well-well,
maybe I should put it back up.
Why, so Chloe'll see
it and get scared off?
No.
So Marshall'll see
it and feel guilty.
Yeah, okay.
But she wasn't okay.
Later that night,
while Marshall was on his date,
Lily came back.
...anymore.
Pretty impressive, huh?
Wow, you really did memorize all the
lyrics to "We Didn't Start the Fire."
Can I, uh,
can I get you a drink?
I'd love a beer.
You got it.
Lily did what any
sensible woman would do.
She hid under the desk.
And she stayed there,
listening to her ex-fiance
on a date with another woman.
I had a really
nice time tonight.
Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.
I like your eyes a lot, too.
Finally, much like Billy Joel,
she couldn't take it anymore.
Stop!
Hi. I'm Lily.
Lily... Lily,
what the hell are you doing?
I don't know. I...
I don't know... what I'm doing.
Oh, pumpkin beer--
that was a good one.
I'm just... I'm gonna go.
I... I'm so sorry.
En-Enjoy the rest of your date.
She seems nice.
- Lilly, what the hell...
- I'm sorry.
I only snuck up
there because...
when I saw how cute she was yesterday,
I freaked out.
Lily,  you saw her yesterday?
Yeah, I...
kind of chased her down the street.
Wait, so you were the
hunchback with the limp?
Yeah.
And she didn't break the picture,
I did.
So Chloe's not crazy, she's...
just a nice, normal girl.
Yeah, she is.
And you deserve a nice,
normal girl.
So, why don't you
just go back up there
and-and finish your date.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Wait, if you were the hunchback,
then why did she think you were a guy?
I-I might have used a voice
that sounded like this.
- Why?
- Because I didn't want
her to know it was me, which
I now realize doesn't make sense,
because she hadn't even met me.
You're crazy.
You have... crazier eyes than
anybody that I have ever met.
Shouldn't you be
going back up...
I mean,
you're out of your mind.
You're... just
absolutely insane.
Shouldn't you be
going back upstairs?
I've missed you so much.
Okay, I ran it by the group,
and we decided we're
gonna give you a choice.
We will agree to stop
calling you Swarley,
but instead,
we'll call you Jennifer.
Well?
I'm thinking.
How about this?
On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays...
Hey.
Look at this.
So right there,
in the exact same place
that six months earlier I had
walked up and found Marshall alone,
crying over his breakup with Lily,
I found him again.
Only this time he wasn't alone,
and he was happy.
So we went to the bar to celebrate,
and it was great.
I was with Robin,
Marshall and Lily were back together,
and Barney had a cool new name.
All was right with the world...
until we got back
to the apartment.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Chloe, I...
guess I forgot I
left you up here.
I was gonna leave,
but I can't find my keys.
They're right there
on the coffee table.
Silly me.
I must have looked
everywhere else.
Well... I'm just gonna go.
Oh, I don't think we've met.
I'm Chloe.
Robin.
It's nice to meet you, Roland.
I'll see you guys later.
Roland?
Your name's Roland.
That's funny, right?
Rock and Roland.
Warsaw is the capital
of what? Roland.
You're Monica Roland-ski.
Hey, yeah,
that's just how I Roland.
- Nice try, Swarley.
- Damn it.
Swarley!

And so, after six months apart,
Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall
were finally back together.
Oh, my God.
These pancakes are delicious!
Yes. Thank you.
Um, I learned how to cook while
you were gone this summer.
Oh. Do you want to
cook dinner tonight?
Yeah, sure.
How about pancakes?
And things were back
to normal... almost.
You may not have much range,
but at least I'm marrying a guy
who knows how to make pancakes.
Oh, um...
I mean, um...
Well, I... I realize that we
haven't really discussed
whether us getting back together
means us getting married, but...
I still wanna.
Do you still wanna?
Really?
Of course, I love you.
No, I mean,
that's how you're gonna do it?
"Do you still wanna?" That's
like the lamest proposal ever.
When I did it, I got down on my knees...
I don't know, I'm just saying.
Marshall Eriksen,
will you ma...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What?!
You can't lead with that.
You got to... build up to that.
You got to have,
like, a little speech.
Do you remember your
proposal to me?
I had a speech prepared.
What do you want to hear?
I don't know.
I mean, you could tell me,
like, about how good-looking
and funny and smart I am
and I've been
working out lately.
It might be nice for you to
mention something... about that.
Marshall...
- you are good-looking...
- Thank you.
- You're funny.
- Oh, thanks.
- You're smart.
- And a few tears wouldn't hurt.
Okay, would you freakin'
marry me already?
I'll marry you. Of course.
But, um, until you see a ring on this
finger, don't expect me to put out.
Yeah, right.

I'll give you this.
That was a very
creative use of syrup.
I can't even look Mrs.
Butterworth in the eye.
Oh, my God.
We're getting married!
I know, I know.
It was a moment of happiness,
followed of course by a
moment of total panic.
See, when they called
off their first wedding,
Aunt Lily took off
for San Francisco
leaving Uncle Marshall
with the unfortunate task
of telling his entire family.
Yeah, so now she's gone
and the wedding's off.
What do you call someone who just
takes off and leaves like that?
What do you call that?
I think that that's
a little strong.
I can't even believe you
would use a word like that.
Geez, Grandma.
Man, I made a big mess by
canceling this wedding, didn't I?
It's okay, baby.
You're not just realizing that now,
are you?
God, the idea of standing up
there in front of all those people
who hate my guts...
just makes me want to run off to
Atlantic City and get married today.
Yeah.
Coming up at 11:00:
Are there piranhas in the East River?
What you don't know...
could eat you.
Robin! Stop the news!
- What the hell?
- It's okay. They're my friends.
We're going to Atlantic City to elope.
You got to come with us.
Oh, my God,
that is so fantastic!
I-I don't know if I
can just leave work.
It's  okay;
Mike can read the news tonight.
Hey, Mike...
you can read, right?
Yeah, I'm the best at reading.
- Let's go to Atlantic City!
- Yeah!
You guys are eloping!
Oh, that's fantastic.
Wait, is this because there's a time
crunch Uncle Ted should know about?
I hope not because I plan
on getting hammered.
Guys, this sounds like so much fun,
but I can't really take off work.
I'm kind of important around here,
you know? I'm the project manager.
Ted, for the rest of our lives,
we are going to be
telling the amazing story
of how we went to Atlantic
City and got married.
Don't you want to
be in that story?
Of course I do.
- Let's go to Atlantic City!
- Yeah!
Oh, but when we tell the story, can you
leave out the part where I hesitate?
You got it.
Hey, guys.
Wow. A pedicure.
Uh, if there were any shame
in a dude getting a pedicure
I don't think there would have been a
feature about it in Details magazine.
We're going to Atlantic
City to elope right now!
Oh, congratulations, Lily.
Marshall, you're getting married?
What the hell?
So are you in or not?
Hell, yeah, I'm in!
Just... I'm almost done.
- No, we got to get going to the...
- Well, actually, I mean...
It is my wedding day,
and since we're here...
So we all got a pedicure
and then headed down...
to Atlantic City.
Wow. Look at this place.
I guess I'll have my
pick of something old.
And something blue. Somebody
should really check on this lady.
Ah, A.C., always in decline,
never hitting bottom.
It's good to be back,
old friend.
You been here before?
Oh, uh, once or twice.
Barney!
Ah, good to see you, too.
Three times, maybe.
The wedding chapel--
this is it.
Are you ready to do this?
I'm ready.
- Let's get married.
- Yeah.
Oh, crap. I don't have a veil.
I'm a bride;
I can't get married without a veil.
And a bouquet.
I need a veil and a bouquet.
Oh, my God,
we're getting married.
Don't  worry. Relax.
We'll get you a veil, honey.
Oh, Robin,
that's a really cute outfit.
Oh, really? Thanks.
Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride;
you can't look better than me.
Done.
I'm going to get the bouquet.
You guys get the veil.
We'll meet in the
chapel in 20 minutes.
Ready, break.
You  guys want to go gamble?
No, we got to go get the veil.
Or we looked everywhere,
and we couldn't find one.
Yeah, okay.
No, you guys go ahead.
I'm going to find the veil.
So this is it, right?
The last 20 minutes of your single life.
- I'm proud of you, buddy.
- Thanks.
- How are you feeling?
- Great, a little nervous.
- Yeah? Craps?
- Not that nervous.
- No, I mean do you want to play craps.
- Oh, yeah, definitely.
Okay, I got the veil.
She wasn't ready to be married.
All right,
let's talk bachelor party.
Are we thinking full-on strip club,
or should we rent a room
and have a private
toy show-- whew.
What did you just say?
- Barney, no.
- Marshall, I'm your best man.
- You're not my best man.
- Right here.
And as your best man,
I have to throw you a bachelor party.
That's part of
being a best friend.
- You're not my best friend.
- Right here.
Barney, I don't have any
time for a bachelor party.
I've got, like, 18 minutes.
18 minutes.
Oh, good. Did you get the veil?
Of course.
And it took us
exactly 18 minutes.
We went to a strip club.
- Dude!
- Unbelievable!
We weren't there for very long.
It's not like I had time
to have a lap dance or anything.
I got a lap dance.
- Your last lap dance ever.
- Right...
What?
Okay, I'm here. Right?
Oh, God, the things people
waste money on in Atlantic City.
Does it smell like
strippers in here?
That's weird, right?
Marshall and Lily
are getting married!
Hell, yeah, look at this.
Oh, baby, this is it.
- Let's do this thing.
- All right.
Hi. We're here to get married.
Congratulations. We offer
a variety of packages
to give you the special day
you've always dreamed about.
We don't want any of that. Just your
basic quickie wedding will be fine.
Yeah.
You know this
isn't Vegas, right?
Well, sure.
In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen.
Here, it looks like
everyone brought their own.
What?
It also takes three days to get
a marriage license in New Jersey.
The earliest I could
book you for is Monday.
No, no, no, it has to be today.
That's the whole point.
Look, I don't know what to say,
but if you guys don't want
to book a wedding for Monday
or play a round of keno,
I can't help you.
Thirty-five.
Wait, I don't understand, people get
married in Atlantic City all the time.
Yes, they do,
but they don't elope.
They choose Atlantic City
for its white sand beaches,
world-class amenities,
and exotic Riviera feel.
Have you been outside?
There is half an orca whale rotting
not 20 feet from the cabana.
You guys, take it easy, guys.
Are you sure about this?
About the marriage laws of the state
where I work in a wedding chapel?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
Bright side:
the bachelor party continues!
Yes!
Continues? You mean
"start." He means "start."
We went to a strip club.
Twenty-seven.
Is there any way that we
could get a license today?
You could go to the courthouse.
In some extreme circumstances,
the waiting period can be waived,
but you have to
have a good reason.
Well, we're in love.
What better reason
could there be?
The last one I heard was,
"I'm going to Iraq tomorrow
to defend my country,"
but, you know,
give yours a whirl.
So we went to the courthouse.
God, this is taking forever.
Can't believe they're
getting married.
I know.
I am so proud of these two.
After all they've been through.
In fact,
that crazy road has led them
all the way here
to Atlantic City.
Ted, up here.
You were just staring
at my shirt boobs.
No! I wasn't.
I-I was checking out the hot
bod underneath the shirt.
Okay, look,
maybe I was looking at your shirt,
but it's a, it's a funny,
funny shirt.
Hey, it's Barney!
- Barney!
- Hi.
...suit up.
...legend.
...Daddy.
American daddy.
What the hell was that?
A... Chinese guy?
Hi. Hello.
Uh, we need a marriage license,
but we need to skip the
waiting period because...
we're in love.
Aw. I'm gonna waive this
waiting period right now.
Oh, really?!
Is what I would say if I could
waive the waiting period,
but unfortunately,
only a judge can do that.
Oh. Well,
so can we see a judge?
- Absolutely.
- Really?!
Is what I would say if there was any
chance of you seeing a judge today,
which there isn't.
Why are you doing this to us?!
'Cause you're on Candid Camera!
- Really?!
- Is what I would say...
You know what? We get it.
Okay, this is a good plan B.
Judges are people.
People go to the batoom.
A judge is bound to
come by eventually,
and we'll get married.
I'm sure we won't
be waiting long.
Geez, you go to a vending
machine for 30 seconds.
Vultures.
What?
Here?
Yeah. Got a little
time to kill.
Oh, my God,
it's the T-shirt, isn't it?
No.
A little.
Something is seriously
wrong with you.
So what, is that a no?
- All right, let's do it.
- All right.
Um, also...?
- Yes, I'll leave it on.
- Sweet.
Guys, let's bail.
This is never gonna happen.
Look, I know this is turning
into a bit of a disaster,
but believe me,
it's better than the alternative.
You throwing a big,
free party with lots of booze and food
and all your single,
desperate girlfriends from college?
Yeah,  glad we
dodged that bullet.
Judge! Judge, come on.
Come on, come on, come on!
- Turn it off.
- Okay.
May we please get
married today?
Now, normally I would say
no to a request like that,
but you two impress me.
Just the fact that you've
been together for ten years,
standing by each other's
side through thick and thin,
never wavering.
- What was that?
- What was what?
That little look.
What was that?
A look of love.
You two have stood together
through thick and thin, right?
- You know, what's thick, what's thin?
- Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.
I have.
All  right, what was that look?
What's going on?
They broke up over the summer.
Lily totally ran off to San Francisco
and these two just had sex in the closet.
What? We're under oath.
No, we're not.
Yeah, we are. He's a judge.
Wh-- did we take an oath?
Do you even know
what an oath is?
Uh, yeah. Courthouse.
Oath. We're under it.
Guys. It's looking like
this isn't gonna happen.
No, Marshall,
we are gonna get married today.
Baby, anyplace we go,
we're gonna need a marriage license.
Except international waters.
So-so let's find
a ship captain.
A ship captain can marry us.
There's boats all
over this place.
Oh, is that what those wooden things
are floating between the garbage?
This is a great idea.
This is gonna work. Let's go.
Excuse me.
Are you a ship captain?
This is my machine.
-  I should go talk to her.
- No, let me.
- Blackjack?
- Yeah.
Well, I found a guy who said he'd be
willing to put his boat in my slip,
so we're getting closer.
Okay, Lil, why is it
so important to do this today?
Because... if we
don't do it today,
I just know we're gonna wind
up having a huge wedding
with a huge crowd full of
huge Midwestern people
looking all disapproving
and judging me
while sipping little
cups of mayonnaise
and-and cracking runaway
bride jokes all night long.
- Nobody's gonna do that.
- No, they're not
because I'm not gonna
give them the chance.
I'm gonna find a ship captain and
we're gonna be married tonight.
Sweetie, this is crazy.
You're never gonna
find a ship capt...
Hey, Lily.
Found a ship captain.
- What?
- Yeah.
First guy we talked to.
Ship captain.
How great is that?
See? See, this is destiny.
So, captain, can you take us out to
international waters and marry us?
I sure can.
If there's two things I love, it's
bringing people together in marriage
- and making $5,000.
- What?
Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that.
Come on, everybody.
Fork over your cash.
Don't think. Just do it.
I can get us that money.
How?
Have you noticed
that all day today
Chinese guys have been coming
up and saying hi to me?
Yes. Have you noticed I
haven't asked about it
because I'm too
scared of the answer?
Well, those are my
old gambling buddies.
Truth is...
I used to come here all the time.
Play an old Chinese game
called "Shing Hasabu Shing".
Had a small gambling problem.
Actually, it wasn't
so small. I...
kind of lost my entire
life's savings.
But tonight, I don't know,
I'm feeling hot.
I think I can win
us that money.
No, we're not letting you
gamble all our money away.
Uh, it's not gambling if you
absolutely know you're going to win.
I'll get us that money.
I swear it, nay...
I oath it.
Now, I had been to a lot of
casinos before that night,
and I've been to a
lot of casinos since,
but in all that time I've never
seen a game quite like this one.
To this day,
I have no idea how it was played.
But luckily, Barney did.
Do you understand
what's happening?
Not a clue.
Do you think he's winning?
I don't even know
if he's playing.
Wait, I get it.
I understand this game.
No, you don't.
I totally understand
the game, Theodore.
Barney, split your tiles. You can triple
your money if you find the jellybean.
Marshall, please.
Don't you think I know what I'm...
My God, you're right.
Wow. It's beautiful.
Thanks, Barney.
Did you guys see me?
I was on fire tonight.
Man, I can't wait to
get back to the shore.
God, I love gambling!
When we get home, we're gonna
go to a little meeting. Okay?
Why can't I do it
just a little?
Okay.
Let's get this started.
Okay, uh...
you guys want the serious
one or the funny one?
Oh, I think...
serious would be best.
You sure? I got a lot of
great nautical jokes in there.
Like how you two float each
other's boat, stuff like that.
Yeah, serious is probably good.
"We stand witness today
"to celebrate the union
of Lily and Marshall.
"Today, you two
will become one,
"sharing your lives,
"the happiness, the sadness,
"the frustrations
and the joy..."
This is pretty cool.
I can't believe you never
want to get married.
I never said "never."
"...to declare your love
"and devotion to each other
"in front of
friends and family,
"all the people who
matter most to you."
What was that?
What was what?
That little look.
You two just shared a look.
- We don't want to do this.
- We don't.
Are you kidding me?
You guys are calling
off another wedding?
After I spent all this
money on a bridesmaid shirt?
Did I bet someone that they'd call it
off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?
You actually expect any of us are
gonna come to your third wedding?
Yes.
'Cause it's gonna be amazing.
Look, before I was afraid
to face Marshall's family
and-and I didn't want to
do all that work, but...
now that we're here...
I realize that I have to
face Marshall's family
and I really want to
do all that work.
So do I.
And yeah... my family
might still be upset with you.
But when they see us up there, they're
gonn
..learn about relationships
is that you're never done
getting to know someone.
Everyone has secrets.
Some are nice.
You know how to make crepes?
That is so cool.
Some aren't as nice.
And then there was Derek,
and counting you,
- that puts the total up to--
- Oh, I got your total.
I've been counting along.
And some are just weird.
You're scared of
the seven dwarfs?
Just Doc. He's creepy.
I mean the guy went
to medical school.
What's he doing living
with six coal miners?
Oh, man! I'm so excited.
I couldn't sleep last night.
- I bet you guys couldn't either.
- Why?
Only the Gala event
for the Grand Opening
of Sharper Image's 500th store.
Didn't you get my email?
No, I blocked your address
after the fourth time
you sent me the video of the
monkey sniffing his own butt.
Come on! It's on me.
I'm buying three of you foot massagers
and one of you a nose hair trimmer.
You know who you are.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, I'm in.
- To the Willowbrook Mall!
- To the Willowbrook Mall.
Oh, it's at a mall?
I'm not going.
What? Why not?
I just don't feel
like going to a mall.
We can split a Cinnabon.
No, I'm really not going to go.
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- No, I don't go to malls!
Sorry, I just don't like malls.
Why not?
I'd rather not say.
- Sharper Images.
- But that's where clothes live.
Guys, guys, guys,
Robin doesn't like malls.
If she doesn't want to tell us why,
she doesn't have to.
I think we should all
just respect her privacy.
Thanks, Ted.
So, what's the deal
with you and malls?
I thought you said that,
if I didn't want to talk about it,
I didn't have to.
Yeah, with those people.
But I'm your boyfriend.
Come on. What is it?
Did you get arrested at a mall?
No.
- Dumped at a mall?
- Ted.
Found out you were
Canadian at a mall?
Let it go.
Trapped under a fake
boulder at a mall?
- Let it go.
- Mauled at the mall?
Let it go!
And who gets trapped under
a fake boulder at the mall?
Not me in Ohio when I was nine,
that's for sure.
I don't get it. Why won't Robin
tell me why she hates malls?
Ted, you should be happy
Robin has a secret.
The more you learn
about a person,
the better chance you have of
hitting the fatal "Oh" moment.
The "Oh" moment?
Yeah, that moment when you find
out that one detail about a person
that is going to
be a deal breaker.
It's a promise ring.
I made a pact with God to stay
a virgin till I'm married.
I don't have an
eating disorder.
It's just when I put food in my mouth,
I chew it, and then I spit it out.
I just turned 30.
So trust me,
you want to postpone
knowing anything about each
other for as long as possible.
Mmm. I disagree.
If there is some potential "Oh" moment,
I want to know about it right away.
I mean, what's the alternative?
I now pronounce you,
man and wife.
I love you.
I used to be a dude.
Yeah,  I agree with Ted.
In a real relationship,
you share everything.
That's why Marshall and
I don't keep any secrets.
You are such a cutie pie.
Here's a quarter.
Go play a song on the jukebox.
No, it's true.
They tell each other everything.
I can think of tons of things,
there's no way Marshall's told you.
Try me.
Do you know about the time
Marshall was in Trenton?
Donkey ate his pants. Yup.
Bill's bachelor
party in Memphis?
Oh, when they had to pump out
all the nickels from his stomach?
Wow. Okay. Seattle.
Trick question. Marshall's never
been to the Pacific Northwest
because he's afraid
of Sasquatch.
Damn, you're good.
I'm not afraid of Sasquatch,
I just think we should all be on alert.
Trust me. Not only do they
tell each other everything,
they want to know everything.
So after the shower I was brushing
my teeth. And I was like,
"Oh, man!
I wanted to have some orange juice.
I should have done that first."
But I already had the
toothpaste on the toothbrush.
So I just went ahead
and brushed them anyway.
What happened next?
Yeah, meanwhile,
Robin tells me nothing.
Fine. Do you want to know
what Robin's secret is?
You know?
Of course I know.
She couldn't look at us,
her face got flushed--
that's shame, my friend.
Our friend Robin used to do porn,
wait for it...
...ography.
Yeah, we didn't really
need to wait for that.
And it's ridiculous.
I don't know.
He could be right.
She does have the fake
orgasm noises down.
Hey!
What? The walls are thin.
That's not what I'm
"hey"ing you about.
You know what it might be?
This is going to sound a little
crazy but what if Robin is married?
Married? What does that
have to do with the mall?
Well, maybe she got
married at the mall.
Back home in Minnesota,
a ton of people get married
at the Mall of America.
It's great.
There's this gorgeous indoor
golf course for pictures,
numerous fine dining options,
and talk about a reasonable--
- We are not getting married at the mall!
- Well, just meet with the guy.
She's not married.
Robin hates marriage.
Because she already
got married.
At the mall.
No, because before Robin
moved to New York, she...
What was she doing?
Well, I don't know.
Whenever I ask her about Canada,
she kind of clams up.
She's a pretty private person.
Except when she's
talking about...
Oh, a friend of mine in Canada
got married way too young
and it really turned
her off to marriage.
What  do you think of
this wedding cake?
Oh, I like it.
Hey, you remember that
friend of mine in Canada
who got married way too young?
Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Fields'
giant cookie.
No.
My friend in Canada who
got married way too young,
they had to do their vows twice,
once in French.
They speak French there, too?
God, that place is a mess.
So you don't think there's
any "friend" from Canada?
Oh, I'm sure there is.
Just like I have a "friend" who
wet his bed till he was ten.
Use your brain, Ted.
Guys, there's no way
Robin is married.
It's ludicrous to
even suggest it.
- Thank you, Barney.
- 'Cause it's porn.
I need another beer.
Robin was not in porn.
I bet you anything that she's married.
$20,000 says it's porn.
I don't have $20,000.
Well, then what do you have?
- Well...
- No.
I've got it.
The ultimate wager--
slap bet.
Oh, slap bet.
We used to do those when I was a kid.
What the hell's a slap bet?
Whoever is right gets to slap
the other person in the face
as hard as they possibly can--
but no rings.
Are you really going to do that?
That's so immature.
- You can be Slap Bet Commissioner.
- Ooh, I love it. What are my powers?
Um, if a problem arises and we
need a ruling, that's your job.
But you have to be unbiased
and put the integrity of
slap bet above all else.
This is an honor you will
take with you to your grave.
On your tombstone,
it will read,
"Lily Aldrin, caring wife,
loving friend,
Slap Bet Commissioner."
And your tombstone will read "Got
slapped by Marshall, so hard he died."
Okay. What if I just ask Robin
point blank if she has a husband?
You said you would
respect her privacy,
so maybe you should
just drop it.
Yeah, you're right.
Husband.
There's no "P" in husband.
Wow, you seem to know
a lot about husbands.
Fine. I'll take it back.
Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands,
this is great, you're going to love this.
Marshall, you know Marshall.
He thinks that the reason
you didn't want to go to
the mall the other day
is because you got married at a
mall and have a husband in Canada.
I told him he's crazy.
Because he's crazy, right?
I mean, how crazy is that?
Are you asking me
if I'm married?
Well, you can ask me.
Nope, I'm not married.
Your turn.
What happened to
respecting my privacy?
Look, just say, "No,
I'm not married."
Ted,  I don't understand
why you can't--
Just say, "No,
I'm not married."
I can't.
Marshall's right.
I was young and I got married.
It was a mistake and
he moved away, but...
yeah. I'm married.
You have a husband?
I was young and stupid
and we got married at a mall
and we broke up at a mall
and I...
I haven't been to a mall since.
Why didn't you get divorced?
He moved to Hong Kong for
work and I was like...
eh, good enough.
Good  enough?
That's not good enough.
You order pancakes, you get waffles,
that's good enough.
Look, I haven't
seen him in years.
It's just a part of my
life I want to forget.
Just please don't tell
anyone about this.
Okay.
Dude, your hand is monstrous.
Yeah, well, what'd you expect?
You've seen my penis.
I can't believe you
told us Robin's secret.
What? How could I keep
something like that to myself?
And you begged me to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Please tell us. Just tell us.
I'm begging you.
Tell us. Tell us. Tell us.
Please please please--
Fine. Robin's married.
Yeah, well,
you still shouldn't have told us.
I mean,
what kind of boyfriend are you?
See that's just it,
I'm not the boyfriend.
I'm the mistress.
No, not the mistress.
The mastress.
The master.
What do you call it?
Uh, pretty sure we're
going to call it mistress.
What am I going to do?
My girlfriend's married.
Do I ask her to get a divorce?
Ted, even if she is married,
it's a Canadian marriage.
It's like their money,
or their army.
Nobody takes it seriously.
It's serious to me.
You know what, in some countries,
if you been separated
for longer than five years,
technically, you're no longer married.
I can check it out at the
law library at school.
I can see my hand
print on your face.
Don't get too cocky, Slappy.
I just got a shipment of porn
from Canada I have to go through.
I won the bet.
Why are you still searching?
Just because you were right
doesn't mean I'm wrong.
Oh, right, like you need
an excuse to watch porn.
Canadian porn.
Trust me when I tell you their
universal health care system
doesn't cover breast implants.
If I have to sit through one
more flat-chested Nova Scotian
riding a Mountie on
the back of a Zamboni
I'll go out of my mind.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Listen, dude,
I got to talk to you,
but you got to promise me
that you won't tell Barney.
Fine, I won't tell Barney.
What is it?
- Robin's not married.
- What?
Why would she tell me she was?
I don't know, but I cross-
checked every record in Canada.
There's no record of
her ever being married.
There must be some mistake.
I promise you.
She's not married.
She's not great at
parking legally either.
So she lied to me?
W--What am I going to do?
I-I can't confront her,
'cause then she'll know I told you.
You got to lawyer her.
You got to ask her a bunch of questions,
try to trip her up,
maybe make her feel guilty,
whatever it takes
to get a confession out of her.
Thanks for telling
me your secret.
It means so much to me,
that you could be so--
God, what's the word
I'm looking for?
Honest.
Mm, thanks, Ted.
Yeah. You know what's probably
the best part about your honesty?
How truthful it is.
I say we just move on.
Well, for me to get total
closure on this whole
"my girlfriend has
a husband" thing,
I think I might need a
little bit more information,
like what month did
you get married?
June. We had a June wedding.
Ah, Canada in June.
That's the dream.
Sit-down  or buffet?
Well, it's...
weird that you don't remember.
No, I just didn't
know how to answer
because we did butlered hors
d'oeuvres in the atrium,
but the actual dinner was
a buffet in the Food Court
featuring a filet mignon or a
roasted potato-crusted salmon
with a lobster
scallion beurre blanc.
Band or DJ?
A string quartet played
at the ceremony,
but for the actual reception,
we had a seven-piece band.
We paid extra for the sax
'cause I just love that
smooth alto sound.
- How many bridesmaids?
- Seven.
- Flowers?
- Azaleas.
- Color scheme?
- Dusty rose and sienna.
Husband's name.
- You were never married!
- Yes, I was.
- No, you weren't.
- How do you know?
I looked it up at the library.
- What library?
- The one on Fifth.
- When did you go?
- Today at lunch,
and I had an apple brie
panini with potato salad...
I'm not questioning
the lunch part, Ted.
What database did you use?
I used the Canadian
Mall Marriage 6000.
Fine, Marshall looked
it up at school.
- You told Marshall?!
- You lied to me!
See, this is why I don't
tell people secrets.
You were supposed to be the
one person I trusted the most
and even you couldn't
keep a secret.
But it was a fake secret.
Yeah, I was testing
you and you failed.
And now you're never gonna know
why I don't go to the mall.
And it's good, too.
You  were testing me?
That's insane.
Oh, yeah? How long did it
take for you to tell Marshall
my biggest secret in the world?
Five minutes?
- That wasn't a real secret!
- Yeah, but it could have been.
You are driving me crazy!
No wonder your fake
husband moved to Hong Kong.
He moved there for business.
You.
You got something to say to me?
What are you talking about?
I know Robin was
never really married.
How could you
possibly know that?
And then I put on my
pajamas and got into bed.
How about you?
Oh, let's see, uh,
first I took the subway to school.
Then I got a bagel.
Then I went to the library and
found out Robin was never married.
Crazy.
Then I was hungry again,
so I went down to the vending machine,
but by the time I got down there,
I wasn't even hungry anymore.
- You told him?
- I had to.
I'm Slap Bet Commissioner.
Believe me, this hurts me more
than it's gonna hurt you.
Don't count on it.
I've been practicing on a tree trunk.
- Barney gets three slaps.
- Three?
One because you lied and two
for being prematurely slapped.
Three slaps.
But--
Oh, my God.
- Are you gonna cry?
- No.
You're gonna cry.
I just don't think it's healthy to
keep big secrets in a relationship.
My parents didn't really talk
to each other for 30 years
and now they're divorced.
I have shared more
of myself with you
than I've ever
shared with anyone.
I'm asking for this one secret,
which has nothing to do with us,
to just be mine.
So I just got a very
interesting phone call.
What are you talking about?
I know Robin's secret.
- What?
- That's right.
I know your secret, Robin.
Or should I say Robin Sparkles?
How do you know that name?
Because I know the truth,
and I am about to show
it to you right now.
Gather 'round, Ted,
you're gonna want to see this.
Yeah, no, I don't.
What?
Robin wants to keep
this a secret, so...
it's gonna stay a secret.
Yeah, it's not
gonna stay a secret.
You see, in my research,
I came upon a certain
gentleman in Malaysia
who is in possession of
a certain videotape.
He just emailed me that
it will be up and running
on My Space in about...
right now.
Robin's world is about to
be turned upside-down.
I mean, I'm guessing.
Barney, don't, okay?
Robin, please don't panic.
I'm only gonna show enough to
prove to Marshall I was right.
No, Barney,
I said we're not watching this.
No, it's time.
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do,
but if it's out there, there's no
point in trying to hide it anymore.
Let's just watch it
and be done with it.
Are you as terrified as I am?
I don't want to
get slapped again.
I want to stress
that I was young.
Yeah, you were.
And I didn't know any better.
They never do.
And it started out as an
innocent modeling job.
It always does.
Please, Mr. Johnson.
I'm sorry I was a bad girl.
Please don't give me detention.
Isn't there something I can
do to make it up to you?
Oh, my God.
Well, obviously,
I've been proven right,
so in the interest
of Robin's dignity,
I won't show anymore.
Plus, it's getting late.
It's already slap o'clock.
What the hell was that?
Uh, I slap bet Marshall that
you did porn, so I win.
Porn? I wish it was porn.
It would be less embarrassing.
I know.
How about I sing you a song?
Let's go to the
mall, everybody!
I was a teenage
pop star in Canada.
# Put on your jelly bracelets #
# And your cool graffiti coat #
# At the mall, having fun #
# Is what it's all about #
This is the most amazing
thing I've ever seen.
- That's you?
- Yes.
I had one minor hit.
I had to go all over Canada
and sing this song in malls.
For a whole year, I lived off of
Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.
# Everybody come and play #
# Throw every last care away #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Today #
If this is the '90s,
why does it look like 1986?
The '80s didn't come to Canada till,
like, '93.
Taking a break from the first of many,
many viewings,
I can't help but notice
that this isn't porn.
And yet,
a slap occurred without the permission
of the Slap Bet Commissioner.
Looks like somebody suffered
from premature slapulation.
Oh, my God, Robin's rapping.
Guys, Robin's rapping.
# Went to the mall with #
# a couple of friends #
# I had a whole week's #
# allowance to spend #
Okay, I'm going to
give you a choice.
Either ten slaps
right now in a row,
or five slaps that
can be doled out
at any point from
here to eternity.
You go with the ten now.
No way,
why get ten when you can get five?
Yeah, but the constant fear of
knowing that at any moment,
you could get slapped in the face,
would drive you crazy.
I'm going to go with
the five for eternity.
- Good call.
- Horrible call.
Relax, dude,
I'm just going for my soda, man.
Take it easy.
This is going to be fun.
# Let's go to the mall #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Today #
So just to be clear,
you wanted everybody to
go to the mall today?
Wow, we're going to
watch this a lot.
I can't believe I ever wore
a Bedazzled jean jacket.
Hey, just so you know,
16-year-old me would
have been all over you.
You could have been the girlfriend
in Canada I told everyone I had.
Hey, uh, I'm really sorry
I pried this out of you.
I probably should
have left it alone.
You know what?
You know me better now.
That feels kind of nice.
That's one.
# Everybody come and play #
# Throw every last care away #
Wow.
# Let's go to the mall #
# Today #
Did you have to laugh
like that every time?
Yes.
# This boy I like #
# Met him at the food court #
# He's got hair like Gretzky #
# And he does jumps #
# on his skateboard #
# I hope he asks me out #
# Take me to my favorite spot #
# It'll be just him and me #
# But don't forget the robot #
The robot. Hey!
# But, baby #
# I don't want to wait #
# Let's do it #
No, she doesn't want to wait.
# I'm gonna rock #
# your body anyway #
# I'm gonna rock your #
# body till Canada Day #
# Everybody come and play #
# Throw every last care away #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Today, today, today, today #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
# Let's go to the mall #

Kids,
there's nothing   more wonderful
than new york city   in the winter...
except   the view of new york city
in the winter   through your apartment window.
In the winter of 2006,
marshall,lily,robin and I were all deep
in couple hibernation mode.
Sadly,
this left uncle barney   out in the cold.
Okay. All-night rave,
abandoned tire factory  in newark.
We're on the list.
Who's in?
- Nope.
- No.
Private jet.
Teeterboro airport,skinny-skydiving.
- Who's in?
- Nope.No,thanks.
One beer.Bar,
downstairs,15 second walk.
Who's in?
Lily went sleepy-bye.
It got so bad,
barney   tried to be his own wingman.
Hi.
Have you met me?
A@   finally,
he decided   to bring in reinforcements.
No.
Yes.
And do you know why?
Hang on to your bedsores,
grandparents from willy wonka,
because guess who's  on his way up
to this apartment right now?
My...
wait for it...
brother,
james.React.
Hey!
- You have a brother?
- Yeah.
He's the "awesome-est," most best "looking-est,
"  greatest guy ever.
He's exactly like barney.
That's what I just said.
Well,barney and his brother  aren't exactly alike.
- James is gay.
- Really?
I neve  r in amillion years
would I picture you  with a gay brother,
that's awesome.
Yeah.
I just wanted you  to have a heads up,
so you don't  act all surprised
when he gets here.
Here he is.
What up,
new york.
Thanks for the heads up.

<font color="#ffff00">HOW I MEET YOUR MOTHER
Season 02  Episode 10</font>
What did it never come up  that barney has a  gay,
black brother?
Is he black?
I guess I'm the kind  of person
that focuses  on who people are
on the inside  rather than the
 color  of their skin.
I'm kidding,
I just  wanted to see your face.
Yeah,so now the  wedding's back on.
Anyway,james,
how have you been?
Awesome,as per "yoozh.
"  I just went  skinny-skydiving.
Legendary.
And my laser tag team,
just made it to  regional finals.
"Legendarier.
"  And by now you've  noticed the suit--
go 'head,
touch it.
Handcrafted  by pietro dellacamera,
milan's famous  101-year-old tailor
who upon completing  the very last
stitch  in this suit  dropped dead,
which is ironic  because that is
 how  gorgeous I look  in it.
C'mon.
gimme five.
- Is "gimme five" back?
- Oh,yeah.
I put it in my  blog this morning.
Guys,
"gimme five"  is back!
Oh,james,
this is  my girlfriend,robin.
- Hey.It's so nice to meet you.
- You,too.
So,I have to ask,
there's a story here.
Please.
Be the truth is,
barney and james   got a lot of...
different explanations
from their mom over the years.
Well,boys,
you  look different  because
when I was  pregnant with you,
I only ate  vanilla ice cream.
And when I was  pregnant with you,
can you guess what kind  of ice cream I ate?
Coffee?
No,james,
I ate chocolate  ice cream.
But I did drink  tons of coffee
when I was pregnant  with both of you.
Can't smoke  without my coffee.
I don't know,boys,
I guess  it's just one of those things.
Stop asking me!
You know what  you two are?
You're little racists!
So what are you guys  gonna do tonight?
I'll tell you  what james is gonna do.
He's gonna do the job
you've been neglecting.
And,as always,
he'll do it  a lot better
 than you ever did.
Ted...
james is my wingman now.
Okay.
Last time james  was in town,
barney got slapped once,
lucky twice,
and...
whose penthouse hot tub
did you end up in?
Ah,public figure,
confidentiality agreement.
But I will say this:
Way more back hair than any guy
who can afford laser hair
removal should have.
And then there was the time
they scored the  brother/sister combo.
It was everything  we ever dreamed
of when watching   donnie and marie.
She was a little bit country.
He was a little bit  way into black guys.
Yeah,barney and james together
was a lethal combination.
Since there was never
any crossover in targets,
james was always there
for barney with the assist.
Whoa.
Your scarf...
it is fierce!
Thanks.
H & M.
What?I would never know,'cause it is so hot
that my eyes are melting.
Oh,I can't see.
Hey!You know,speaking of things
that would look good  wrapped around you,
have you met my straight  brother,
barney?
Oh,he is fab--
don't you go nowhere--
"ulous.
" Okay?
and barney always returned   the favor.
Help,I don't think  he's breathing.
Does anyone know  mouth-to-mouth?
Oh,my god,
I do!
Okay,great.
How  'bout you instead?
Oh,man,
I am so  excited that you're here!
It has been forever  since I have
been around  anyone even remotely fun.
Uh,yes offense.
You guys are still going out  with us tonight,
right?
- No.Jammies.
- I don't think so.
Tonight?
It's after 9:00  and...
I have  warm soup belly.
Oh,no,no,no,no,no.
Guys...
you are young,attractive people here
in the greatest city on earth.
There are boys and girls  in nobody cares,
wyoming,
wishing they could be here.
But instead,they are  in someone's basement
drinking bad malt liquor,
debating  whether or not they're going
to spend their saturday night
in the parking lot  of the feed store
or in some other dude's  basement.
You owe it to them  to rise up and shimmy
your lazy asses  into something hot,
and you go out there
and you live their dream!
Can I get a "hell,
yeah"?
- Hell,
- yeah!
- Can I get a "hell,yeah"?
- Yll,yeah!
- Can I get a "woo-woo"?
- Woo-woo!
- Go do it for wyoming!
- yes!
Testify!
So that night,
barney got his wish.
We all went out.
Daddy's home!
Yeah.
All right,bro.
What do you like?
Guy in super  tight black t?
Super tight black guy?
Guy who looks like mr.    T?
yes,yes,and...
talk to me  after two martinis.
Let's focus on you,
my man.
I'm feeling lazy.
How 'bout girl with  the chocolatini?
Oh...boom,
back tattoo.
Hero and the pig?
Let's ride.
Fo' 'sho.
Damn baby,
nice tramp stamp!
Get off me,
you pig!
Hey!
Her body art  is not an invitation  to grope her,
it's an expression  of her inner self.
I'm sure,in many ways,
she is  the dolphin encircled  by flowers.
- What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
- Cool.
- ***************
Let me know if he  bothers you again.
Thanks.You should stay close...
just in case.
Sure.
If it'll make  you feel safer.
I'm barney.
Now,kids,when you're out   at a noisy,
crowded bar,
you can always tell   the difference
between the singles
and the couples.
You just have to look   for the signs.
- Break.
- Boiling hot.
Singles stay on their feet
for maneuverability.
- Hey!
- Hi,how are ya?
Have you met my brother?
Oh,hello.
Have a drink.
Nice to meet ya.
Couples,exhausted   by the sheer
act of leaving   the house,
are obsessed   with finding   a place to sit down.
There are a lot of other indicators,
too.
From choice   of social lubricant...
To basic body language.
But the point is,
there are many ways to tell
whether someone has   single stamina
r couples coma.
I wish I would've wo sneakers.
I just got finished running  from some fat,
hairy guy  who was periscoping
out of his pleather pants.
Permission  to come aboard denied.
I miss my jammies.
I can't believe i  wore a bra for this.
Bras suck.
They're so  confining and unnatural.
Yeah,they're like  a boobie zoo.
Well,why don't you  take it off
then and let  those puppies breathe?
Oh,please go sweat  on someone else.
Poor guy.
Poor guy?
Poor my boobs.
Well,it takes a lot  of guts to approach
a girl and you  just crushed him.
Oh,yeah,yeah.
He looks  all broken up inside.
Whatever,you guys have  no idea what
it's like  to be on the  receiving end.
"Oh,poor me.
I'm a pretty girl
"and everybody everywhere  wants
to buy me  drinks and have  sex with me.
"Oh,poor me.
I get  to order yummy,
pink drinks  "with chunks of real
fruit  that guys secretly like,
but can't order because  they'll be made fun of.
- "  Dude.
- They're delicious!
Excuse me.
Join me in a shot?
Oh,no thanks.
I've had enough.
He's too in shape,
we'd spend all night  talking
about  his body fat content.
Now,if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go have  a yummy,
pink drink  with fruit in it...
because I can.
You know,that was,like,the third hot
guy  that james  blew off tonight.
Yeah,he's turning  down shots,
he's yawning,
he's  whining about his feet.
He's as bad as we are.
He is.
Wait,he's exactly  as bad as we are.
You guys don't think  that james is...
in a relationship?
No.There's no way.
He's barney's brother.
Look at that.
He's texting!
Oh,my god!
He is in a couple.
This is gonna kill barney.
What's gonna kill me?
What's going on?
B-barney?
Have you noticed  anything...
different about james?
No.I mean,he's glowing from his  peel,
if that's what you mean.
We have reason  to believe that james is,
uh,maybe hiding  something from you.
I-I know you're not gonna  like hearing this,
but...
barney...
your brother is...
Monogamous.
That's ridiculous!
Just because  he's a little sleepy,
and he hasn't had sex  with anyone
in a bathroom stall...
He hasn't had sex with
in a bathroom stall.
And,barney...
I hate to be the one  to tell you this,
but...
he's texting.
No,he...
no!
That...
is impossible.
Excuse...excuse...
ex...
- hey,bro.
- Don't change the subject.
- Let me see your phone.
- Why?
I just want to  see your phone.
Let me see  your phone.
No,it's just a phone.
It's just a phone!
And it's got internet access,
and it's got a camera on it,
and you can surf the web  and do the whole thing.
It's so amazing how far  technology has come.
What kind of phone  do you have?
I got...
who is this?
And the answer better be:
"I don't remember his name.
"  That is tom.
And he's my fianc?
hi
I don't support this.
Gay marriage?
Not gay marriage--
marriage!
how can you do this?
We were raised in the same  house,
with the same values!
Believe me,
I fought this for a long time.
Come on,
it's embarrassing.
Look,this felt unnatural  to me,
too,at first.
But I fell in love.
And tom and I realized  you can't fight love.
Oh,god.
Is that what  you two do together?
You sit around the house  and talk about love?
I think...
I'm gonna be sick.
Okay,okay,look,I need you
to wrap your head  around this,
okay?
Because it is happening.
And I want you  to be my best man.
What?
No way.
Well,I'm sorry  you feel that way.
I hope you  change your mind.
Two beers,
one shot.
Oh,it's a freaking epidemic.
oh,sweetie!
Did you make that for me?
Yes.
Clam bake.Staten island.
Who's in?
Okay,I didn't   havehigh hopes for that one.
Okay,here's my thing.
If gay guys  start getting married,
then suddenly the whole world's
gonna be doing it.
That's how it works.
They start something,
then six months later,everyone follows.
Like now everyone  gets manicures.
I don't get manicures.
Okay,then like how...
like getting your chest waxed.
:  You get your chest waxed?
You know what I mean!
Gay marriage is going to cause  single life,
as we know it,to die out.
Think of how the american family
will be strengthened.
Barney,
I'm sorry you're upset,
but you got to suck it up
 and be a man about this.
No.
It's always been  me and him together,
being awesome,
while the rest  of you walked two-by-two
onto your ark  of sexless boredom.
Just because  james is getting married
 doesn't mean things  are going to change.
Yeah.
Like things haven't changed  with you people.
Look,my sister married  a guy I didn't like.
Sandals and socks--
come on,buddy.
But I took her out,
we celebrated.
It was the right  thing to do.
You got to support him.
You're right,ted.
This is a cause for celebration.
We need to take him out
and celebrate the commitment
he and tom are about to make.
yeah.This is where we're  celebrating the
commitment  that tom and i  are about to make?
What?
Yeah!
See,
that cage represents  your commitment.
oh,my god.
Freedom has never tasted  so delicious.
Hey.
You work out?
I do.
And thank you  for noticing.
You're obviously  in very good shape yourself.
Well,I try.
So you want  to dance?
You know what?I'm very flattered,
and,objectively,
you're a very  attractive man,
but this is actually  my fiancéE.
I'm sorry.
You know,I saw  your drink and I...
no,no,this isn't my drink.
This is hers.
No,it isn'T.
Whatever.
How 'bout you?
Oh,I'm straight,
too.
But I thank you  for your time,
and I appreciate  your interest in my body.
U@ryou see that?
Being hit on doesn't  have to be terrible.
I feel flattered,
and everyone  left with their dignity.
hey,I really  like your sweater.
You actually do,don't you?
You're notchecking[
my boobs or anything.
My name's gay ken,
what do you think?
I love this place!
Let's dance!
And not be groped!
Whoo! Thank you.
Damn.
Thank you!
- We're hot.
- Totally.
and then tom says
to the dealer
that the handmade georgian clock
has a chip on the corner.
Blam,we get that puppy half price.
What up?!
Bam!
sounds like you really rocked
that arts and crafts fair.
Oh,yeah,oh,yeah.
Hey,oh,my god.
This is so liberating,being
able to talk about this to you.
I cannot wait
for you to meet tom.
And I cannot wait for you
to meet my good friend...
this guy.
Excuse me,do you know anyone
who would like to buy my incredibly muscular,fun,
large-handed brother a drink?
Eh,eh,eh,let's focus
on you,barnaby.
Okay.
all right.
I spy a group of women who have
let their defenses down
because they are
in a gay club.
You see that chick
right there?
She looks like she'd fall for
sports agent and football player.
Okay,I'm in.
Which one am I?
please.
He's very shy,
loves tennis and brazil,
and drops his pants
after three dirty martinis.
Now go,man,go!
I just never thought I'd
see barney so vulnerable.
Well,I guess no one wants to feel like
they're going through the world alone.
Look at me,in a yummy sandwich!
Okay,we're actually right in the middle
of something right now,so...
ooh,I know what I want to be
in the middle of. Thoughts?
God,can't two straight guys
come to a gay dance club,
enjoy some techno and good conversation
without being bothered?
How's it going,guys?
Still enjoying the attentions of men?
That's like the eighth guy
who's hit on us in ten minutes.
It's like,hello,
my eyes are up here.
and it's never the hot ones.
It's always the losers. Bums me out!
Looks like the boys
learned their lesson.
Do you totally miss
being hit on?
Oh,totally.
Let's go find a sports bar.
James,james,since you like
arts and crafts,
look at what charles here made
with cherry stems.
He did it with
his tongue.
Yeah.
Barney.
So,charles,why don't you put your number
in my brother's phone,
and once he's in
a funner mood...
barney,barney,i
don't want his number.
I don't want anyone's
number,okay?
I'm getting married.
- Best of luck to you both.
- Thank you.
My number's in here.
I'm very discreet.
Okay,okay,
excuse me.
Barney,family talk.
Okay,dude,you have
got to stop this,okay?
I know that my getting married is threatening
to your way of life...
oh,so now it's
my way of life?
I thought it was
our way of life.
You've completely
turned your back on it.
Look at you,
not even suited up.
Do you remember why
we suit up,james?
To get laid.
To show people
that we are different
from the millions of t-shirt
and jeans lemmings out there.
The suit shows that we are a force
to be reckoned with,
a two-person army
that plays by its own rules.
But you've taken off the uniform,
you've crossed enemy lines,
and you've abandoned me.
Well,I'm not gonna let you do that.
It's not too late to back out
of this stupid marriage thing!
You don't have to do this,bro!
- Yes,I do.
- Why?!
Because tom and I are
gonna have a baby.
What? There's gonna be a baby?
Yes.
We're adopting.
Oh,my god.
I'm gonna be an uncle?
For the rest
of your life.
And that's how barney
became uncle barney.
A year later,at james's wedding,
barney could not  have been more proud.
To james and tom.
May you have a long
and happy life together.
And may I always have
the skin and libido of a much younger man.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Nice one.
Thanks. I decided to leave out
the hetero college phase.
No one wants to hear about that.
It was perfect.
You even made tom's dad cry.
Might have been doing that
because he's a republican.
whoa.
It's 9:00.
We should be getting back.
You guys want to split a cab?
Uh,no,I think I'm gonna
stay a little bit longer.
Yeah,me,too. I'm
not tired at all.
All right,well,it's getting late.
Got to get the wife home.
Oh,stop calling me that.
It makes me sound fat.
**************
Ugh,it's a freaking epidemic.
See ya.
- may I?
- Yeah.
hey,buddy.
Your parents are married.
Now,listen,you.
Just because you're being
raised by married people
doesn't mean you have to choose
that lifestyle. High-five.
Luckily,you got me.
In 20 and a half years,
you'll be 21,
and I will be...
well,I haven't decided
how old I'll be yet.
But we are gonna bro out,
uncle and nephew style.
Stick with me,kid.
I am gonna teach
you how to live.
Great suit,
by the way.
who is the cutest?
I don't get it.
Tom liked my breasts
in tenth grade.
Why doesn't he like them now?
Why?
Rosa,why always be attracted
to the unavailable ones?
Why not accept the fact that you're a
beautiful woman who is worthy of love?
Are you brave enough
to hear that?
You...

<font color="#ffff00">HOW I MEET YOUR MOTHER
Season 02  Episode 10</font>
Fsx <i>you spend with your family.</i>
 <i>So in December of 2006,</i>
 <i>I had three options.</i>
 <i>Spend it with my mom</i>
 <i>and her new boyfriend Clint,</i>
 <i>spend it with my dad and his</i>
 <i>new girlfriend micro-brewing,</i>
 <i>or head down to Staten Island</i>
 <i>to spend it</i>
 <i>with my super religious cousin</i>
 <i>Stacy in her family</i>
 <i>So I opted</i>
 <i>for none of the above</i>
 <i>and decided</i>
 <i>to spend Christmas 2006</i>
 <i>in Manhattan...</i>
 <i>celebrating</i>
 <i>with my other family.</i>
Okay, I have one last paper
due at 5:00 p.m. today,
so until then, I will be
at the law library at school,
but I'm not to be disturbed
for any reason.
Dude, open your eyes.
You're going to
hurt yourself.
No, no.
Christmas Eve winter wonderland
is my reward
for finishing my paper.
Oh.
Baby, do I smell your
Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?
Yes.
Damn me and
my heightened
other senses.
Must be strong.
Okay, I'll be
back here at 5:00.
Save me at least 20 cookies
and do not
clean the bowl.
Was that a reindeer?
I don't want to know!
Hey, look.
Our old answering machine.
Oh, yeah.
After you left, we,
uh, we unplugged it
because it
reminded Marshall
of how you used to, you
know, leave messages.
But hey,
you guys are
back together.
I say we're
plugging it back in.
It's good to have you back.
Thanks.
Oh, hey, look, there's
still some messages on here.
MR. MOSBY:
Hey Ted, it's Dad
calling to check in.
I'm going fishing this weekend
with my friend Clint,
so if I don't hear from you
beforehand,
I'll talk to you next week.
Yes, same Clint.
TED (on machine):
Hey, Marshall.
Are you lying on the couch
right now moping about Lily?
You are, aren't you?
Oh...
Well, stop it.
She's not worth it.
You gotta get over that Grinch.
 <i>But I didn't say "Grinch."</i>
 <i>I said a bad word.</i>
 <i>A very, very bad word.</i>
Oh, fudge.
 <i>But I didn't say fudge.</i>
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@Fadeout
Sync:FRM@openext</font>
a what?
I--
That was Barney,
that was Barney.
That was you, Ted.
That was Marshall.
Marshall left a message
for Marshall?
You know, it may have been
me, but it was so long ago.
Man, that machine, it
really garbles your voice.
You know, it almost
made it sound like I said...
Why would you call me that?
 <i>It was a fair question.</i>
 <i>Marshall's breakup with Lily</i>
 <i>had sent him</i>
 <i>into a deep depression</i>
 <i>and nothing could get him out</i>
 <i>of it.</i>
(moans)
 <i>Until one day...</i>
She was perfect.
I lost the perfect woman.
I should have knocked her up
when I had the chance.
Okay.
That's it.
You're never going
to get over her
until you stop putting her
on a pedestal.
So no more ice cream
until you tell me
one thing that's wrong
with Lily.
There's only one of her?
Okay.
She called off your wedding
and dumped you
to be a painter
in San Francisco.
What do you call that?
Fiercely independent?
Uh-uh.
Brave?
I guess it was
a little selfish.
There you go.
 <i>And in almost no time,</i>
 <i>that spark turned</i>
 <i>into a roaring fire.</i>
Yeah. No, you're right.
Lily would laugh at anything.
She'd give it up for a bad pun.
I'm telling you,
she's a laugh slut.
Remember that time
we heard her laughing
and we thought she was
watching <i>Weekend At Bernie's,</i>
but it turned out she was
watching <i>Weekend At Bernie's 2?</i>
And her art?
"I'm Lily, I'm an artist."
She doesn't even own a beret.
Yeah, and if she's
such a great "artist,"
why does she suck at Pictionary?
Who draws a ninja star
like a Star of David?
Come on, come on.
Right, right?
Yeah!
Another round!
(laughing):
Yeah!
I was trying to help him.
I'm his best friend.
That's the best friend's job.
The best friend's job is
to call me that word?
Yeah.
Oh, Ted.
Oh, Teddy boy.
Why is this such a big deal?
It's just a word.
We use lots of words, every day.
It shouldn't be any different
than any other word.
Then why don't you say it now?
Grinch.
You timed that didn't you?
Perfectly.
Well, at least
you apologized.
You apologized,
didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
"I'm sorry" were the first
words out of my mouth.
I'm sorry, but I am
not apologizing.
I was just trying to put
the guy back together.
You smashed him to pieces.
Are you seriously not going to
apologize for leaving that...?
No!
Why not?
Because, Lily, this summer,
you were kind of a Grinch.
BOTH:
Oooh.
Oh, you'll be
sorry, Ted Mosby.
Ted Vivian Mosby!
That's not my middle name.
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?
Like you've never
said that word.
I don't kiss your mother
with my mouth.
Yet.
Are you sick?
Is it sick to find maturity
and experience sexy?
No, I meant
do you have a cold?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
My nose is just
overflowing with awesome
and I had to get some of it out.
Now, if you'll excuse me, the
holidays are a time when people
are lonely and desperate.
It's the most wonderful
time of the year.
I should go apologize.
It's Christmas Eve.
Yeah. I mean, slamming
doors and screaming curses?
If I wanted that, I would have
gone home for the holidays.
I don't see any
mistletoe, but...
Oh! Oh, God!
Uh... "Bless you" would
have been nice.
You're sick.
I'm not sick.
You're sick.
You know what? I <i>am</i> sick.
Sick of you telling me I'm sick.
What up?
Ahh... Three flights of stairs,
not a drop spilled.
Hey, buddy.
You sure this
is gonna work?
Yeah, this is our thing.
In college, whenever
I wanted to make up
with her, I'd buy her
a beer. Cute, right?
Totally.
Plus free mug.
 <i>Usually that</i>
 <i>would've done the trick,</i>
 <i>but it turned out</i>
 <i>this was a problem</i>
 <i>not even alcohol could solve.</i>
 <i>Actually the beer</i>
 <i>helped a little.</i>
aaaaaaaaaaaaa
bbbbbbbbbbb
ccccccccccc
dddddddddddddd
eeeeeeeeeeeeee
fffffffffffff
 ggggggggggggggg
hhhhhhhhhhhhhh
iiiiiiiiiiiii
jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
lllllllllllll
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Billy.
Okay, yeah,
dinner next Wednesday.
Okay.
Damn voice dial.
Barney!
What the hell?
Get in here, it's
freezing outside.
Are you insane?
Hey, blame Lily and her
oppressive "no cigars
in the apartment rule."
God, it's like Marshall's
marrying the Taliban.
(sneezes)
High five.
Eww. No.
You have to go home
and get to bed.
Oh, Robin, my simple friend
from the untamed north,
let me tell you
about a little thing I like
to call mind over body.
You see,
Whenever I start feeling sick,
I just stop being sick
and be awesome instead.
True story.
Yeah, in two minutes,
I'm going to pound a sixer
of Red Bull, hop in a cab,
play a couple of hours
of laser tag,
maybe get a spray-on tan.
It's gonna be legen...
Wait for it...
(snoring softly)
Lily!
Merry Christmas, assface.
Um, Lily?
Where are the Christmas
decorations?
At my apartment.
You want to bring them back
so we can celebrate
Christmas together-- please?
Ted, do you know what I would do
if one of my kindergartners
used that kind of language?
I would be on the phone
with their parents.
Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.
Exactly.
You know what that word means.
You know that
calling people names
is mean and hurtful... assface.
Lily, if you don't
bring that stuff back
right now, we...
She hung up.
She's just mad.
She'll cool down.
Mm-hmm.
(phone ringing)
Aha.
Lily...
Don't forget to take the cookies
out of the oven... <i>assface!</i>
Damn it!
I could be in
Cleveland right now
making peppermint lager
with my dad.
Where are you going?
Marshall gets home
in three hours.
He's gonna show up--
no Lily, no winter wonderland.
I gotta get up
to the Bronx.
...dary.
(phone ringing)
Hey, dude,
how's the paper going?
Screw the paper,
how's the winter wonderland?
Is it magical?
Oh... <i>so</i> magical.
When you walk
through the door, does it feel
like you've been slapped
in the face by Christmas?
Sure does.
Look, I gotta go.
Come on, man, describe it!
Tell me about the decorations.
Is Rudolph there?
He is, isn't he?
Hi, Rudolph!
Ah, yeah, but, you know...
Decorations, is that really
what Christmas is about?
Hell, yeah!
What else would it be about?
Uh, try the birth of Christ.
You know, Christmas--
Christ Mas,
which means "More Christ"
to our Spanish friends.
Yeah, well, all I know
is walking in that door
and seeing the winter wonderland
and seeing Lily
and all you guys, just...
I can't wait.
Right. I gotta go.
Right. Okay. Oh, wait.
Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted.
One more thing.
How about the cookies?
Are they delicious?
(shrieking)
You know, honestly, they taste
a little store-bought.
Oh! I got another call.
Well, tell Lily I love her.
Right.
Hello?
Ted Evelyn Mosby!
Oh. Uh, hey, Mom.
Merry Christmas.
I just got the most
disturbing call from Lily.
How could you use
such a horrible word?
Oh, God, she called you?
Are you acting out
because of the divorce?
Is-is this all about Clint?
No, Mom, why
would it be about Clint?
Hey, buddy, it's Clint.
How you doing, champ?
Hey, Clint. Listen, um,
Hey, hey, no,
I don't really have time to...
no, no. Ted,Ted.
You don't know this yet,
but you and I are going
to be great friends.
Now,
the Native Americans
have this ritual...
(coughing)
(sighs)
This is a low moment
for the Barnacle.
I should be off playing
laser tag right now,
but instead...
Don't look at me. I'm hideous.
You just look like
a regular guy.
Exactly.
I'm a Ted.
I'm wearing
elastic-waist fleece pants.
And isn't it more comfy?
Yes.
Come on, you need eat something.
Too weak...
to hold... bowl.
Fine, I'll feed you.
Mmm.
Ouchie in my mouth!
I don't want it.
I want ice cream.
No, you're not having ice cream
for dinner
just 'cause you're sick.
But my throat hurts.
No.
I hate you!
Oh.
Don't leave me.
(knock at door)
Who is it?
Pizza delivery.
Whoa.
Hey, you tricked me.
You really thought
I was the pizza delivery guy?
No, I knew it was you.
I just thought you'd
at least bring a pizza.
Yeah, well,
I brought a beer,
but I gave it
to a homeless guy.
All right, he took it from me.
Now, will you please come home?
No, I'm not spending
Christmas with you.
Okay, I'm sorry for calling you
a... that word,
over the summer,
and for saying it again today.
And for thinking it a lot
on the subway ride over.
I had no right
to say that.
It was hurtful
and immature and I'm sorry.
Oh, shut up.
You think I don't know
your fake apologies
by now, Ted Mosby?
Huh?
You're clearly still mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.
Yes, you are.
I am not mad at you, Lily.
Now, can we please just...
I've apologized to Marshall
and he's forgiven me
and we've moved passed it.
Why can't you?
Because you never
apologized to me.
Marshall's not the only one
you walked out on.
You leave for three months,
you don't even call.
Come on, Lily, we're supposed
to be friends!
Yeah, some friend,
you called me a Grinch.
You were a Grinch!
How can you...
Grinchy,
grinch, grinch, grinch
grinch, grinch, grinch.
Happy?
Now, you've pissed off
the big guy upstairs.
Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I...
BIG GUY UPSTAIRS:
You use that language again
and I'll turn off your water!
That's my super.
He lives above me.
Great.
Thanks to your filthy mouth,
now I'm going to have Christmas
alone in the dark.
Fine. I don't want
to ruin Christmas.
You can have the apartment.
Don't worry
about seeing me there
I'll be in Staten Island
with my cousin Stacy.
Just....
Ow.
Merry Christmas.
You're spending Christmas Eve
with your family?
Baby, that sucks. I'm  so sorry.
Uh, they're fine. They're
just... they're a little weird.
You know they don't believe
in gifts or Christmas trees.
And they think Santa's
how Satan spells his name
when he wants to trick us.
Well, do you want me to go
with you?
Was that a sincere offer?
First tell me your answer.
Stay there. Save yourself.
We'll spend all day
together tomorrow.
Okay.
Oh, how's Barney feeling?
You mean the whiney bottomless
pit of neediness?
He was bugging me, so I spiked
his echinacea tea with codeine.
You're gonna be a great mom.
Mm-hmm.
Holy crap, the magical
Christmas season is upon us.
And thank God we don't pay
for utilities.
Merry Christmas!
What's in the box?
Only the best Christmas present
for the best girl ever.
It took me all day
to track it down.
I thought you were
writing a paper.
Ah, naw, I blew that off.
I'll get an extension.
School's not important.
What is that pitter
patter on the roof?
Could it be the sound of
an awesome Christmas story
about to come down
the chimney?
Why, yes, it is.
'Twas the day before
Christmas...
It was supposed to arrive,
like, five days ago,
but then it got lost
and rerouted.
I checked two other branches,
finally they told me
it was here.
Yeah, all I needed to know was
the tracking number.
Looks like it's headed out
to our regional branch
in Poughkeepsie.
What?
No, no, no, no,
I need that package today.
Listen, the truck already
left five minutes ago,
so unless you want to run
after it...
Stop!
Stop!
Stop, please, stop.
Stop the truck.
(panting):
I need a package on your truck.
Can I please take a look
in back?
Sure. But I gotta keep
driving my route.
I'm running behind.
(screeching)
Whoa.
WPD DRIVER:
My bad.
I'm okay.
Hey, man,
thanks for helping me make
my fiancťe's Christmas.
No problem.
Too bad I can't deliver
all these packages
by the end of the day.
Wait, so some people aren't
going to get their gifts
in time for Christmas?
Sadly, no.
* They call me back door Santa *
* I make my runs
about the break of day *
* They call me back door Santa *
* I make my runs
about the break of day *
* Oh, ho, ho *
* I make all the little
girls happy... *
We delivered every single
package on that truck.
Oh.
But I still have one package
left to give.
Mmm.
Yeah, I did.
(giggles)
Merry Christmas.
Open it, Baby.
Okay.
Ah.
Oh, my God.
An Easy Bake Oven!
I've wanted one of these ever
since I was a little girl.
In this exact model.
I never told you that.
How did you know?
It's our first Christmas
since we got back together.
I want to get her something
really special.
So I'm getting her
a jukebox.
Wow, that's a great gift.
Not really. It's this big
and it dispenses gum.
Oh, man, I know something
you could get her
that would blow her mind.
Ready?
Eight years ago...
(reggae playing)
When I was a kid, all I wanted
was an Easy Bake Oven.
I begged and I begged,
but all I got
was a stupid Lego set
because my feminist mom didn't
want me conforming
to traditional gender roles.
Easy Bake Oven-- that's what
I'm going to call my van.
Dude...
how was the concert?
I couldn't find the outside.
(laughing)
I can't believe Ted remembered
after all these years.
Yeah, and after all that weed.
Where is he anyway?
Staten Island.
Why?
Okay, don't tell your mom, but
I got you guys some presents.
Like the the gift
of God's love?
No, dude, real presents.
Uncle Ted got us presents!
That's okay, Ted, we'll
just give them to charity.
Yay!
Uh, not you, Charity.
I meant the less fortunate.
Ted, how would you like
to say grace tonight?
Uh, you know what,
why don't you say it.
I really wouldn't know
what to say.
Why don't you recite your
favorite passage of scripture.
That's a great idea, Charity.
But, really,
I don't know.
I mean how do you choose
your favorite passage?
It's the Bible;
there's so many...
great ones...
That one from <i>Pulp</i>
 <i>Fiction's</i> pretty cool.
(doorbell ringing)
Ooh, I'll get it.
Charity, I'm tapping you in.
Dear, Father, thank you
for this day,
and thank you for bringing
this family together.
Amen.
Who is it, Ted?
Uh, it's...
it's just, um, carolers.
* Silent night *
ALL:
* Holy night... *
I came here to apologize.
I'm so sorry, Ted.
I accept. Give me the beer.
Mm, oh, it is so good
to see you guys.
Are you coming home?
Totally.
But first, Lily, I owe
you an apology.
Oh, for the love of God, are you
as sick of apologies as I am?
Yes!
Can we just skip the apology and
go straight to the forgiving?
Yes.
And I promise, I will
never ever call you
a... you know, again.
That's okay.
I was kind of a Grinch.
What's a Grinch?
Nothing. It's something
you shouldn't say.
Mom, what's a Grinch?
Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...
(kids chanting):
Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...
...Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...
...Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...
...Grinch, Grinch...
Merry Christmas, everybody.
Merry Christmas, Marshall.
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome to www.1000fr.com</font>
Kids, you remember
my first day with Robin.
- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?!
Well, here's the thing, normal people,
you know, people who aren't your dad,
usually take longer to say "I love you."
Robin went through the usual stages.
- Spider! Spider!
- I left something in the hallway.
- Where?
- Right there.
Got it.
First there's the moment
when you think you think it.
Whoa, still alive.
There's the moment
you think you know it.
Oh, you don't want to kiss me,
you'll get sick.
Totally worth it.
There's the moment where you know
you know it, but you can't yet say it.
All right, it's getting to be that time.
I'll talk to you tomorrow?
Good night.
Good night.
Wait, Ted?
Yeah?
Good night.
Well, great, I'll see you then.
Bye, sweetie.
Hey. Guess what?
My sister Katie is coming
to visit next weekend.
She gets in on Thursday.
That's awesome.
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to take off work Friday.
We're gonna take her
to the Empire State Building.
Really? You'd do that?
Of course. Everyone should see
the Empire State Building.
And then there's the moment
where you know you know it,
and you can't keep it in any longer.
- Ted.
- Yeah?
Falafel.
- Falafel?
- Falafel.
Instead of telling Ted you love him,
you said "falafel"?
- I totally choked.
- I just don't get it.
Why can't you tell Ted you love him?
Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.
Oh, God, you'd think you never
said it to a guy before.
No.
Okay, well, I don't usually get
this far in the relationship.
I usually take the three-week exit.
Don't tell me you're actually buying
into Barney's freeway theory.
Watch your steps when you get up, kids,
'cause I am about to drop some knowledge.
Relationships are like a freeway.
Wait a minute, a month ago you told me
relationships are like a traveling circus.
No, this is new.
This trumps that.
Freeways have exits.
So do relationships.
The first exit, my personal favorite,
is six hours in.
You meet, you talk, you have sex,
you exit when she's in the shower.
So every girl you have sex with feels
the immediate need to shower?
Actually, yeah, I get that.
The next exits are four days,
three weeks, seven months--
that's when you guys are gonna
break up, mark your calendars.
What?
Then a year and a half, 18 years,
and the last exit-- death.
Which, if you've been with the same woman
for your entire life,
it's like, "Are we there yet?"
So I've never been on the freeway
this long before.
I mean, usually by now I find out
the guy has some weird personality thing
that makes me want
to take the next exit.
Yeah, been there.
I once dated a guy who could only go to
the bathroom when classical music was playing.
Okay, it was Marshall.
It's just things are going so well with
Ted I just don't want to complicate it.
Relax, it'll happen when it happens.
Which is also the advice I gave Marshall
to get him over the classical music thing.
Oh, here comes Katie.
- Aw, your sister's so cute.
- Yeah.
This reminds me of when I used to see
her coming up the driveway from school,
with her little pigtails
and her Hello Kitty backpack.
- Hello, Kitty.
- Oh, no.
No. No. No.
- Hey, Robin. How are you?
- Oh, good. Good.
So, who is this... tongue person?
Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.
Looks like hotness runs in the family.
Oh, you said that.
Great.
So how long have you two been...?
- Two whole months.
- Yeah.
He's actually coming to visit
family in New York, too.
Isn't that great?
My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad,
but he buys me beer, so...
That's cool.
This is my friend Lily.
Hot.
You say things!
Well, come on, let's get you back
to my place, we'll get you settled.
Um, actually, I'm going
to stay with Kyle tonight.
- Uh, no, you're not.
- Oh, come on.
It's kind of a special night.
If you know what I mean.
What?
Oh. Oh...
I can't believe my baby sister is planning
to lose her virginity to a...
...douche with a faux hawk.
This can't happen.
You guys have to help me
talk her out of it.
Speech to talk a girl out of having sex.
Yeah, I don't have any of those.
Discouraging premarital sex
is against my religion.
Please? I'm her older sister.
I'm supposed to teach her how to make
good and responsible decisions.
It's 2:00 and you've already
had three scotch and sodas.
That's why I need your help.
Robin convinced Katie to stay with her
that first night.
And the next day, I took everybody
to the Empire State Building.
You guys are lucky
you came here with an architect.
Empire State Building fun
fact number one:
When construction began
on March 17, 1930,
the framework rose at a rate
of four and a half stories per week.
Four and a half stories per week.
Four and a half stories per week.
There it is.
There it is. Come on.
These are fun facts, guys,
let's have fun with them.
You know, Katie, I have wanted to come
to the Empire State Building for so long,
but I waited to come here
with someone special.
Oh, here we go.
Marshall and I have never been to
the Empire State Building either.
But I'm so glad I waited to do something
so important with my fiancé.
Speaking of waiting, I signed
an abstinence pledge in high school.
It's totally cool to wait.
And stay away from drugs...
other than pot.
- You told them?
- Oh, okay, yes, I told them.
But only because I think you should
hear it from other grownups, too.
Everyone thinks you should wait.
Right, guys?
- Totally. You should wait.
- Sex is fun.
See?
You are such a hypocrite.
You were only 16 when you lost yours.
Well, how do you know that?
You left your diary in your old room
slash my new room.
I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.
Look, I've been dating Kyle
for two months now.
It's like forever.
I mean, we've already done
everything else.
- I mean, we've even...
- Oh. La, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la.
Even Kyle gets to do that.
You have no right to tell me
not to do it.
But Kyle?
Why can't you just wait?
Because if you wait,
you can get a nice guy like Ted.
Robin, this is happening.
Look, I already put it up
on my Myspace page.
- I need a clove.
- You smoke now, too?
- Oh, remember cloves?
- No!
No "Aw, remember cloves?"
This can't happen.
She's my baby sister, okay?
She should be watching The Little Mermaid
and drinking Yoohoo, and not having sex.
Come on, you were only 16
when you had sex.
- I was 17.
- We were 18.
Barney was probably 12.
Good one, Ted.
I was, uh, six... fourt...
How old were you again?
- 17.
- Dude, me, too.
- Barney, you okay?
- Yeah, of course.
What, you don't believe me?
- It was at camp, so I'm...
- What camp?
This place in the Catskills.
Look it up.
I was there teaching for the summer.
What did you teach?
Uh, dance.
Dance?
Yeah, Ted, dance.
Maybe you've heard of it.
It was just a simple summer job,
but it turned into so much more.
Her name was Frances Houseman,
but everyone called her Baby.
# Sylvia #
# Yes, Mickey? #
# How you call your loverboy? #
# Come here, loverboy #
# And if he doesn't answer #
# Oh, loverboy #
# And if he still doesn't answer? #
# I simply say, baby... #
# Oh, baby #
# My sweet baby #
That's Dirty Dancing.
- It was on last night.
- No, it was two nights ago.
"She's Like the Wind" has been stuck
in my brain for about 40 hours.
I just got it out.
Now it's back in.
Damn you, Swayze!
- Do you remember our first time?
- Yeah.
It was back in college.
Oh, wait, wait.
Look... I really want to do this, but...
we should make it special, you know?
Do this right.
Okay.
You're right.
Maybe we could go to the beach
and get a house for the weekend.
Yeah, New Year's Eve.
Okay.
Oh, and we'll light candles and
maybe put on some classical music.
That's not a good idea.
Why not?
Long story.
But maybe we could put on some Al Green
and take a bubble bath together.
Oh, yeah, that sounds so good.
Oh, I love you, Marshall.
I'm so glad we're waiting.
Oops.
- Oh, that's adorable.
- Yeah, tell her what happened next.
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.
Want to do it again?
Please don't.
- We said we were sorry.
- Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?
You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.
The point is no matter what, it's never
gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.
Well, mine was terrible.
Wait, I've never heard your story.
Well, as you know, I was 16.
And it was with my boyfriend Brian.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- This feels so right.
- Oh, I know.
- Oh, Robin.
- Oh, Brian.
Yeah, I'm gay.
- I'm so sorry.
- Eh, I should've known.
There were signs.
Oh, my God!
My mom's home.
Quick!
- Get under my bed.
- What?!
Oh, my God!
You only get one shot
at losing your virginity.
And even though I just barely had sex,
it counts.
What do you mean just barely?
Well, he didn't dive all
the way into the pool, but he...
splashed around in the shallow end.
Then you didn't lose
your virginity to him.
- Just barely doesn't count.
- Yes, it does.
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.
No, it doesn't. It doesn't count.
End of story.
Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin,
you saucy little harlot.
Could it be that before Marshall took
a swim, someone else tested the water?
No. Nobody else tested the water, right?
Scooter?
Who's Scooter?
My high school boyfriend,
who I did not have sex with.
I... I can't believe this.
We're Marshall and Lily--
when people see us, they say,
"Oh, look at them, they've only
had sex with each other."
No, Marshall, they say,
"Oh, look at them,
they've only had sex with each other."
But now that's not true anymore--
now you've had sex with twice
as many people as I have.
I knew that you were too good at it.
Know what? I don't want to see
the stupid Empire State Building anymore.
- It's not stupid.
- I'm going to see Kyle.
Katie, please.
You only get to lose your virginity once.
You should only be having sex
with someone who's special.
Oh, please-- you've had sex with,
like, a hundred guys.
It's not a hundred guys.
It's not a hundred guys.
I'm sure you were madly
in love with all of them.
I had different levels of feeling
for each of the...
very reasonable number of guys.
Really.
Well, do you love Ted?
Do you love Ted ?
I, um...
Okay, Empire State Building
fun fact number 22:
The Empire State Building has tons of places
where people can have private conversations.
- You're off the hook, okay?
- Just let me explain.
You don't have to explain anything.
You don't have to say it-- it's fine.
Okay, but if relationships are
like a freeway, then saying...
"hm hm hm" is like...
getting into the carpool lane.
And I don't want to take an exit, but...
at the same time, I'm not ready
to get into the carpool lane.
Because what's in the carpool lane?
Oh, it's a big diamond,
and I'm just not ready to get...
Okay, Robin, Robin, stop.
It's no big deal--
you don't have to say it.
It's just, it's a big thing to say to
someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.
What, you mean like I did?
No. I didn't...
Yeah, like you did.
I mean, you have to admit it,
Ted, it was a little weird.
- Weird... or courageous?
- Pretty sure weird.
I mean, who gives it up
on the first date?
Well, come on, it shows I'm brave
and bold, like a knight.
No, it shows that
you're an I-love-you slut.
Well, then you're an I-love-you prude.
You know what?
I take mine back.
- You... What?
- I take my "I love you" back.
- You can't take it back.
- Nah. Just did. Got it right here.
But, you know, I'm such a slut,
I'm just gonna give it away.
Hey, you, sir. I love you.
Thank you, man.
I was going up there to jump.
Marshall, why is this such a big deal?
Why is this such a big deal?
Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus,
guess who actually discovered the New World.
Some dude named Scooter.
Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong,
it actually goes like this:
"One small step for man,
one giant leap for Scooter."
Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve
- before you did...
- Okay, Marshall, I get it.
It's a big deal because
it rewrites our history.
No, it doesn't.
Look, have you been to
the Empire State Building?
No. You've only been in the lobby.
People don't buy tickets
to get in the lobby.
They buy tickets to get to the top.
Scooter only got in the lobby,
and the lobby doesn't count.
Really.
Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me
how to get to the Empire State Building?
Um, we're in it right now.
Thank you, sir.
You're a very wise and brilliant man.
You're right.
Why would I throw that all away?
I'm having the best day!
Katie, I'll admit,
maybe I'm not in any place
to lecture you on romantic
relationships, but...
but I just don't want you to make
the same mistakes that I've made.
- Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay.
- That's not what I meant.
I just wish you weren't
in such a rush to grow up.
Please don't do this.
But, kids, later that night,
Katie did it,
and she got pregnant...
with quintuplets...
and she lived out her days
in a trailer park...
where she died an alcoholic.
So the moral here, kids,
don't have sex until you're married.
Maybe even, like,
a year or two into marriage.
- Dad!
- Come on, what really happened?
All right, here's what really happened.
- Hey.
- Hey.
She didn't do it.
Hey, that's great!
You got through to her.
No, I didn't. You did.
She told me that you talked to her.
Hey, Katie.
Hey.
Got another Empire State
Building fun fact for me?
No. I wouldn't bore you
with the seven million man-hours
it took to build this 102-story
testament to human will.
So, you okay?
I don't know what everyone
is freaking out about.
Kyle, he's a really nice guy.
He could've cheated on me with my lab
partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't.
'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.
That's very gallant.
Well, I don't know what your sister's
freaking out about, either.
- I was your age my first time.
- Oh, really?
Yeah, yeah. It was, uh,
it was with this girl, Molly.
I love you, Ted.
Oh, I love you, too, Molly.
But I didn't.
That was amazing.
Look, I got to go.
Where are you going?
My cousin got some firecrackers
from Mexico.
We're going out to the woods to light 'em--
it's gonna be awesome.
Well, will you call me?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you.
But I didn't.
Molly?
Yeah?
Can I borrow 20 bucks?
I'll totally pay you back.
But I didn't.
And I never saw her again.
I told her I loved her, but...
I just wanted to have sex.
I-I would've said anything
to make that happen, and...
that's exactly what I did.
Look, I'm not telling you what to do.
I'm just telling you what
all 17-year-old boys are like.
Even the nice ones.
So I told Kyle I wanted to wait...
and he dumped me.
Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.
Aw, honey.
I promise everything is gonna be okay.
You want to watch The Little Mermaid
and drink some YooHoo?
Only if you put a buttload
of Kahlua in it.
Don't tell Mom.
Thanks for doing that.
You're welcome.
I knew it meant a lot to you.
But, man, your story, I mean,
it doesn't even sound like you.
Yeah, well...
I love you, Molly.
Oh, I love you, too, Ted.
Wow. That was amazing.
Look, I got to go.
Wh-Where are you going?
Uh, my cousin got
some firecrackers from Mexico.
We're going into the woods
to light them.
It's gonna be awesome.
Will you call me?
Yeah. I'll totally call you.
- Oh, Ted?
- Yeah?
Can I borrow 20 bucks?
I'll totally pay you back.
- But she didn't.
- Oh, come here.
I love you.
I said it.
Feels right.
- I love you.
- I'm gay.
I'm kidding.
I love you, too.
Hey... you lost
your I-love-you-ginity.
Yeah.
I guess I was just waiting
for the right guy.
Katie ended up having
a great first time in New York.
And the last thing we did before she left
was go to the Empire State Building.
I am so glad we're finally doing this.
What are you talking about?
We were here yesterday.
Yeah, but that didn't really count.
- Oh, crap.
- Exactly!
So yesterday doesn't count as having
gone to the Empire State Building.
So I lost it to you, Marshall.
And I rode that elevator to the top,
and I saw that view,
and I basked in the awesomeness.
And that's our story.
Yeah. Yeah, that's our story.
We've only had sex with each other.
We've only had sex with each other.
They've only had sex with each other.
Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go.
Okay, Empire State Building
fun fact number 81:
There are 1,860 steps from this...
Whoa, whoa! Come on!
So, now you guys can finally say you've
been to the Empire State Building.
How have you lived here so long
and never been to the top?
Well, we're usually busy... drinking.
Speaking of first times,
we never got to hear
- your virginity story.
- That's right, I almost forgot.
Okay. I was 16,
and it was in a baseball dugout...
Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
I mean, I was in a subway
with a high-priced call girl...
Risky Business.
I was accidentally hacking
into NORAD'S computer...
That's War Games, and there's not even
a sex scene in it.
All right!
I was 23, and it was with my mom's
45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda.
She called me "Barry" the whole time,
and for two weeks,
my comforter smelled like menthol
cigarettes. You happy?
Hey...
Why don't you tell us again about your
first time at the camp in the Catskills.
Baby and her family spent
every summer at Kellerman's.
Her dad did not approve of our love.
- Did anyone put Baby in a corner?
- Oh, God, no.
What can I say, I...
had... the time of my life.
True story.

Some kids dream of
being astronauts.
Some kids dream of
playing baseball.
When I was a kid,
I had only one dream.
To build a skyscraper.
That's stupid.
There were some
obstacles along the way.
But eventually my
dream came true.
I became an architect.
Morning, everyone!
So, I had an idea
for the atrium.
Ready?
Columns.
That's stupid.

I... I can't believe you
knocked over my model.
Well, it's just...
it's not exactly new, is it-- columns?
I mean, what's your next
groundbreaking idea-- ceilings?
Floors?
Windows?
I know what you're thinking:
Who's this jerk?
Well, this jerk was
Hammond Druthers,
a legend in the
architecture community.
Very big in the '80s.
He was also far and away
the worst boss I ever had.
Then I designed the Spokane
National Bank Building.
And suddenly... I was his boss.
- And he didn't like it.
- Stairs?
And to be honest,
I wasn't sure I liked it either.
See, before,
when I was just another employee,
I was happy, carefree.
The guy who hung out in the break
room making fun of the boss.
Did you see what he
was wearing today?
It was like his pants were
being held up by his nipples.
Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers,
I get hay fever just looking at it.
But suddenly I was
a different guy.
Hey, guys.
What's so funny?
Nothing.
Um... nice shirt.
Thanks.
The hours were insane.
I was always working even
when I wasn't at work.
Oh, Robin...
I just had a great idea.
Oh, do whatever you want to
me just don't wake me up.
Before, I used to be this guy.
Dude, of course you should take the
day off for the Foo Fighters concert.
Just say you're sick.
But now...
I was this guy.
Sick, huh?
Unbutton your shirt.
Hmm... "Foo Fighters."
Get back to work.
But still,
the worst part was Druthers.
- Well, I was thinking...
- Ceilings? Oops.
Said that already. Then again,
you seem to like rehashing old ideas.
I'm kidding, of course.
Another hole in one, boss.
Oh, wow,
he must be really good-looking.
Why would you say that?
Well, 'cause only good-looking people
can get away with saying things like that.
I have found that to be true.
It's a blessing
and a curse really.
Ted, you can't let him
treat you like that.
Yeah, you gotta ask yourself,
who's the boss?
- Tony.
- Angela.   - Mona.
Mona?
Watch it more closely.
Rock your world.
So, what are you gonna do?
Well... it's awkward, I mean,
the guy used to be my boss.
So,  I went to talk to
the managing partner.
Fire him.
Well, sir, I was thinking he could
just be put on a different project.
Fire him!
He's an arrogant,
washed-up, pain in the ass.
In fact,
fire everyone on that project.
Druthers, Mosby,
the whole lot of them.
Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear
Mosby's doing some great work.
Fine, Mosby can stay.
But tell him he's on thin ice.
Come here.
I like you, Crosby.
You mind if I charge my phone?
Knock yourself out.
Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers,
the key is timing.
Remember when I had to
fire my makeup artist?
Vicki, um...
I'm so sorry about this,
but there's been some
budget cuts and, um,
we have to let you go.
I mean, after tonight.
I still need my makeup
for the broadcast.
So...
Our thoughts and prayers go out
to the families of the victims.
You know what? I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna fire
Druthers tomorrow.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
- Do you know about this?
- No.
What is that?
Only the greatest thing ever.
Wait, wait, wait--
that's not enough buildup.
If they were to cure
cancer tomorrow,
this would still be the greatest
thing to happen all week.
Okay. Now you're ready
for naked Marshall.
Oh, my God.
This is awesome times awesome.
It's awesome squared.
I know, right?
Behind the piano this whole time.
Wait. If Marshall went to
all this trouble to hide it,
he clearly doesn't
want us to find it.
Oh, come on, Robin.
No, I'm saying that he must be
really embarrassed by this.
We are gonna have so much fun.
I know!
We're gonna have so much fun!
Oh, sorry I'm late;
lunch ran a little long.
You wanted to see me, Mosby?
Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.
Well, excuse me,
for spending the last four hours
drawing designs
for your building.
This is a cocktail napkin.
Covered in profanity.
Look, Hammond, um,
there's no easy way
to say this, so...
why don't we just, um,
step into your office.
# Happy birthday to you #
- # Happy birthday to you #
- Oh, you had me. You so had me.
# Happy birthday, dear Hammond #
# Happy birthday to you #
So, you didn't fire him?
I can't fire a guy on his birthday.
Everyone would hate me.
Besides, they put a party hat on me.
My authority was compromised.
Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat.
I know how much
you love stools.
Thanks. Yeah,
stools are better for your posture.
And, uh... I... got you a rose.
Thank you. That's so sweet.
You guys are being... so sweet.
Hey, guys. Guess what I got.
A new dart.
Oh,  wow, a new dart.
Hey, that new dart is great.
I did not know you were such
a fan of new dart, Barney.
Oh, yes, Robin,
I just love new dart.
Nude art.
- Nude art.
- Nude art.
Okay, all right, so what,
you guys found the painting, huh?
I knew this day would come.
How did you know that?
Because I didn't
hide it very well.
So  the story on the painting is that,
back in college,
Lily wanted to do a nude
study for her art class.
Marshall wasn't
so into the idea.
Well, I just...
don't think that some dude
should drop trou just
to pose for you.
It's for class, and it's just that
weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.
The frisbee dude
with the soul patch?
He's like the hottest
guy in school!
No, he's actually
a little husky...
Oh, he's just huggable!
And complicated...
and a little bit of a jerk.
Just enough so you think
maybe you can change him.
Okay, just forget it.
Call me old-fashioned,
I just think that I'm the only
guy you should see naked.
Well, then you'll
have to do it.
Are you kidding me?
What if somebody sees it?
We're not in high
school anymore.
People don't make fun of you
for posing nude for a painting.
We're adults now.
We totally saw your butt.
This painting has caused
too much grief already.
I'm destroying it right now.
Oh, no,
what's the matter, Marshall?
Where is it?
I'll tell you where it is if
you'll answer these riddles three.
You hung it up in the bar,
didn't you?
Yo, why you gotta
ruin my riddles?
Field trip!
Oh, no. Someone put your
painting up behind the bar.
Classic!
What a memorable prank.
Hey, Marshall.
What'll you have?
What'll I have?
Um, I don't know, maybe a beer
and that nude painting of
me hanging behind the bar!
Ooh, I'm sorry,
that painting's property of the bar.
I know that Barney gave
you that painting.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll pay you double.
I doubt it.
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll give you that plus ten bucks.
I doubt it.
All right, you know what, Carl, you
just lost yourself a regular customer.
I doubt it.
This painting is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.
Okay, where should we put it up next?
In his law school?
Ooh on the side of a bus.
Oh, oh!
How much do billboards cost?
Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse.
I've got a five-year
rollout plan.
I'll have you know that painting's
got commitments all over the city.
Then, after New York...
One of my worst
fears has come true--
I just saw Marshall
grabbing himself naked.
Well, I gotta go.
Believe it or not,
I have to go back to the office.
Oh, I'll go out with you.
Bye, guys.
You know, I wish everyone didn't
have to make fun of that painting.
Eh, we're not making fun of the painting,
we're just making fun of Marshall.
The painting's
actually really great.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
Well, thank you.
You know, seeing it again
makes me miss painting nudes.
What?
Paint me.
What?
Paint me.
Who's that?
Who's out there?
Hammond, is that you?
Mosby?
Druthers and I were
alone in the office.
If I was gonna fire him,
this would be the best
chance I'd ever have.
Uh, look, just a second, Ted.
Uh, no, I,
I really need to talk to you.
Look, there's no
easy way to say...
What, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm standing here
wearing pants.
Are you sleeping here?
What's going on?
Okay, fine, yes.
Not that it's any
of your business
but my wife had a little
spat a few weeks ago,
and I've been sleeping
here until she cools off.
Okay, well, uh, you're right--
that is none of my business.
Uh, look,
there's no easy way to say this-- I...
Who am I kidding?
She's never gonna take me back.
It's okay.
What did you want to say to me?
Happy birthday, buddy.
So, you've been
living at the office?
Yes.
I'm an architect
without a home.
You see the tragic
irony in that?
- Yeah, I do.
- 'Cause I design homes.
- I see it.
- But I don't have a home.
Not lost on me at all.
But I don't understand--
why don't you just go to a hotel?
You could be sleeping on
a mattress instead of...
what appears to be torn-up
drawings of my building.
Why  would I go to a hotel,
when any second,
she's going to call and
tell me to come home.
She's a very special lady, Ted.
She's quite... mannish.
She gives me what I need.
Do you understand that?
Uh,  no, I don't.
If you were lost
in the wilderness,
she can provide for me.
Well, that's the dream.
I'm glad you came
here tonight, Ted.
Me too, Hammond.
- Call me Ham.
- No, thanks.
- Hammy D?
- No, I think just Hammond.
So, I'm guessing
you didn't fire him.
I was this close.
Meanwhile, Lily had
been up all night
in the grips of a dilemma.
- Oh honey, you're awake?
- I'm awake.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.
I've kind of been
wrestling with something.
What if I told you I had a
way to pay for our honeymoon?
Baby, our honeymoon's
already paid for.
We're going to Howe Caverns.
Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't
want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?
It's not just a cave,
it's a whole labyrinth of caves.
It's an underground adventure.
There's a cave that's so dark that
you don't even know you're in there.
I mean, we're going to experience
a whole new kind of dark.
Well, what if I found a way
to make a little extra money
so that we spend our
honeymoon not in Howe Caverns,
but in Scotland?
- Loch Ness?
- Yeah.
And you know, Edinburgh and
the Highlands and Glasgow...
Loch Ness. Nessy.
Baby, I would love to search for the
enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch,
but... we can't afford that.
Maybe we can.
Paint me.
Okay, I don't get this.
You've been making fun of
that painting all this time
and now you want
me to paint you?
We knew we could torture
Marshall because he has shame.
I do not.
In my body,
where the shame gland should be,
there's a second awesome gland.
True story.
Yeah, that's not the gland
I'm worried about painting.
Yeah.
A nude Barney is a challenge.
But I think you're talented
enough to immortalize this.
Now is the time-- I'm 31.
I'm at the peak of
my physical beauty.
If I were a woman,
I'd have passed it long, long ago.
Long ago.
Forget it.
I promised Marshall he was the
only guy I would ever see naked.
I'll give you $5,000.
We're going to Loch Ness!
Yeah!
That cabby would not shut up.
Yeah, we should
call him a gabby.
I think it, you say it.
Hey, uh... thanks for putting
me up last night, buddy.
Give 'em hell.
Morning, team.
So, I have given
it some thought,
and I say we revisit columns.
Oh, God, not this again.
Ted, a man in a toga just arrived
and delivered a parchment.
Let me read it:
Oh! It's from ancient Greece.
They want their basic
architectural elements back.
- Geez.
- What?
You didn't hear me?
Toga, parchment...
Can I see you for one second?
Ooh, I'm in trouble now.
What are you doing?
I thought we were friends.
You slept on my couch,
you ate my cereal.
I tossed you more toilet paper.
We are friends.
But that doesn't magically
make your bad ideas good.
What? I don't believe this!
You're, you're,
you're wearing my clothes!
And my
girlfriend's... sneakers--
man, you have
weirdly small feet.
Ted, I hope that you're not going
to let our professional woes
interfere with our friendship,
because  I really kind
of need you right now.
Okay, let's get this over with.
Hey, hey!
I don't want you phoning this in.
This painting could, someday,
become a serious work of art.
I mean, you have been
blessed with an amazing gift.
Thank you.
I meant me.
Now, I like how you captured
Marshall's essence.
Goofy and unburdened, with wit.
But me,
I want something more regal.
Something my progeny
could look at and say,
"There's stands
Barnabus Stinson."
He was wise...
and strong.
I don't think your
sword will fit.
I get that a lot.
And so, as Lily began painting,
Marshall thought
about the $5,000
and what his fiancée
was doing to earn it.
This isn't right.
This isn't right at all.
Finally, he could
take it no more.
Hold still.
Hold still.
- Hold still!
- Paint faster!
Okay, I guess it's time.
Drop your shorts.
Yeah.
Wait, wait!
That wasn't enough buildup.
I need...
In a world without justice,
one man--
- Oh, just drop them!
- All right.
- No! No, this is not right!
- We had a deal!
Well, I'm going back on the deal.
Barney, get out!
- You...!
- It's over!
Lily, I can't let you
go through with this!
I found a castle we can stay in,
but it's an extra two grand.
It's just not right!
It's beautiful and
they say it's haunted.
I can't let the woman I love
compromise her values for money!
I totally think we can get
some more money out of him.
I'm never letting my
fiancée, ever...!
Oh, you're still here?
Before you say anything,
I'll give you an
extra five grand.
We accept.
You people are so
easy to control.
Dance for me, puppets, dance.
And that's how Uncle Barney paid
for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.
Come on, Ted, listen,
why don't we get back
and finish drawing the
plans for a building
which, in my opinion,
is never going to get built,
so you and I can get out of here
and grab a couple of beers.
No.
Look, Hammond,
there's no easy way to say this but...
Looking for Hammond Druthers.
Oh, that's me.
I'm Hammond Druthers.
These are divorce papers.
You've been served.
Oh, God.
She's really going
through with this.
So that's it. It's over.
There is no easy way
to say this, but...
She's giving me the
remains of Wolfie?
My dog is dead?
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.
She always played
too rough with him.
Believe me,
there is no easy way to say this--
- # Happy birthday to you... #
- You've got to be kidding me!
Guys, you have no idea how much
this means to me right now.
Wait, his birthday
was yesterday!
Yeah, but a bunch of us were up
at the conference in Montreal,
- so we thought...
- No! No birthday! No!
I got something to say
and I'm gonna get it out.
Hammond, listen to me.
I am sorry that your dog died,
and that your wife is
divorcing you and that...
your life is falling apart and that
these guys missed your birthday.
And there is no
easy way to say...
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Oh, God...
Oh, come on, you're not going
to pull that, are you?
Oh! Look, yeah, right.
Now we're falling onto the ground.
Well, nice try, but guess what?
You're fired!
You're fired--
you get it? You hear me?
You're gone! You're fired!
In my defense,
I think we all suspected Hammond
might have been faking.
On the plus side, the EMTs seem to
think he's going to be just fine
and, as you saw, they did admit that
I did not cause the heart attack,
even if they said it
a bit begrudgingly.
And there it was, rock bottom:
They all hated me.
But just when all seemed lost,
I had the greatest idea
of my entire career.
Margarita Fridays--
great idea, boss.
Okay, it's done.
I'm gonna step out,
so you can admire it.
Thank you very much, Lily.
Marshall, do you
have the money?
- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here!
A smooth area?!
You gave me the Ken doll?!
She left out Little Barney.
Barnacle Junior.
My Barnana is...
Barnito Supreme.
Kids, I told you stories
about all the big holidays--
Christmas...
Halloween...
Thanksgiving...
but one holiday was
always my favorite--
Super Bowl Sunday.
And there was one
Super Bowl back in 2007
that I will never forget.
Marshall, you're
on beer detail.
Lily, you're making
the bean dip.
Uh, Robin,
you're on chips and pretzels,
and Barney,
I'm giving you nothing to do
so you can just focus on
controlling your gambling problem.
"Problem."
Oh, poor Superman,
he should really do something
about his flying problem.
It's not a problem if
you're awesome at it.
And I will be going to Quinn's to
pick up the world's greatest food,
the Super Bowl
Hot Wings Platter.
If I were a chicken,
I'd go cannibal for those bad boys.
Just eat my own damn wing off.
I don't care.
I'm crazy like that.
Here's the info
for tomorrow night.
What's tomorrow night?
Oh, God, you didn't hear?
Mark died.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.
The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00,
and I know
it would have meant a
lot to Mark if you came.
You guys were his
favorite customers.
- Stay strong.
- We're so sorry.
Who was Mark?
- No idea.
- Not a clue.
Well, I guess we
should go, right?
Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00,
that's the Super Bowl.
Okay, I feel terrible,
but the truth is we didn't know Mike.
- Mark.
- Mark,
and as long as we send flowers,
I can't think of any
reason we'd have to go.
Get out of here!
I never want to see your
face in this bar again!
This soulless bastard just told me
he can't come to Mark's funeral
because he wants to
watch the Super Bowl.
Could you believe that?
You guys are coming, right?
Yes... Wouldn't
miss for the world.
Okay, here's the plan :
record the game,
go to the funeral,
- pay our respects to Matt...
- Mark.
Mark, and start watching
only an hour late.
Okay, that's great,
but just to make sure it records,
maybe we should bow our
heads and say a quiet prayer
to the TiVo gods.
Almighty TiVo,
we thank you for all the
gifts you have given us:
the power to freeze live
TV to go take a leak
is nothing short of Godlike.
Let's not forget fast-forwarding
through commercials.
It seems greedy to ask
anything more from you,
O magic box,
but if you malfunction
and miss the Super Bowl,
we will destroy you in the
alley with baseball bats.
- Amen.
- Amen.
We are not fast-forwarding
through the commercials.
Yeah, they're the best part.
Oh, come on.
Remember last year?
Who wants to watch a monkey in
a coconut bra order a pizza?
Oh, my God.
This monkey was so cute.
Seriously, that's the last
time I'm gonna call you today.
Okay.
G ood-bye.
You didn't hang up either!
I know! You hang up!
You hang up!
My bookie. Great guy.
So let me get this straight. A funeral
is the one time you don't suit up?
Have I taught you nothing, Ted?
Virtually.
Suits are full of joy.
They're the sartorial
equivalent of a baby's smile.
"Sartorial"?
"Of or pertaining to
tailors or their trade."
Suits are for the living.
That's why when it's
my time to R.I.P.
I'm going out of this world
the same way I came into it--
buck naked. Yeah.
It's gonna be awesome.
Open bar for the guys,
open casket for the ladies.
What up?!
- Such a waste.
- I know.
He was so young.
A hand-stitched, cashmere,
double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana.
It must be so frightened.
This is going faster
than I thought.
We'll make an appearance
at the bar for the wake,
we'll be watching
the game by 8:00.
And even though we
didn't see any whales,
Mark and I both said it was
the best day of our lives.
Okay, I'm getting
us another round.
And when I come back,
everyone else is telling
their favorite Mark story.
Dibs on the one Carl just told.
Okay, I have to be at work
exactly one Super Bowl from now.
Oh, let's face it,
we're not going to get to watch it.
We should just find
out the score.
Oh, thank God! I'll find out.
No, no, no, we can't!
We have to watch the game together.
It's tradition.
Think of all the great times
we've had watching this game.
Second down, everyone drink.
Ted, it's not a drinking game
if you drink anytime
anything happens.
Are these chicken
wings or angel wings?
God, I love these things.
I love you guys.
This is so great, all of us
watching the Super Bowl together.
This is special.
We need to do this every year--
promise me!
Calm down, buddy.
Oh, commercials!
Everyone drink!
God, this is such a great tradition,
all of us watching the game together.
How did this start?
Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks
that Casey misses this field goal.
I don't bet.
Betting's for suckers.
Make it like a dollar or something,
you know. Who cares? No big deal.
Fine.
See, there you go, he made it.
You win.
Wait. This is mine,
just like that?
God, that feels good.
No, that feels really... good.
What else can we bet on?
Nothing, it's the
halftime show.
Oh, so lame.
Nobody even pays attention.
I mean, Janet Jackson,
who cares?
God, how cool is Robin?
I can't believe you invited this girl
we've only known for a few months
to  our sacred day.
Now she's gonna be
in all the pictures.
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
I'll give you the Seahawks
plus six points for 500 bucks.
Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.
$50?! What fun is $50?!
Why don't we just bet air?!
God, Marshall!
Okay, $50.
Hey, I'll take that action.
Seahawks, but make it four
points and make it a grand.
Hey, these wings,
are they chicken wings or angel wings?
Oh, commercials!
Monkey with a coconut
bra. Hilarious.
Look, we always watch
the Super Bowl together.
So we make a pact to
watch it tomorrow at 6:00
and go the next 18 hours
without finding out who won.
That's impossible.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It's not gonna be easy.
That means no TV, no Internet,
no newspapers, nothing.
Media blackout.
But our tradition lives on.
Who's in?
- I'm in.
- I'm in.
- I'm in.
- What the hell, I'm in.
- High five!
- Dude, we're at a wake.
Sorry. Solemn low five.
As the day began, none of us had
any idea how hard it would be
to go nine hours without hearing
the outcome of the Super Bowl.
I decided to work from home
to avoid contamination
by the outside world.
Hey,  take this key
and swallow it.
What? No.
Come on, Ted, you eat salads.
It'll be out by game time.
Lots more, no.
I'm not messing
around, Theodore.
I've got a lot of money
riding on this game.
If I don't handcuff
myself to this radiator,
I'll check the score.
Please take the key.
Fine.
But only because you didn't
think through a bathroom plan
and I think that's funny.
The media blackout was
particularly hard on Robin
because, well,
she was the media.
But unfortunately,
the City won't be fixing
the unusually large
pothole any time soon,
so buckle up if
you're on the BQE.
It's gonna be a bumpy one.
Like morning commutes
needed to get any harder.
You're right, Kevin.
Well, Robin, what do you say?
I think it's time to check in with Sid
- for a sports update.
- No!
- What?
- No.
But it's, uh, time for Sports.
No, it's not.
It's time for Weather.
We, we just did Weather.
Well, weather's pretty fickle,
it may have changed.
What's it doing out there, Lou?
Pretty much the same thing
it was two minutes ago.
Back to you, Robin.
Okay, now it's time for Sports.
No! Let's go to Traffic Todd
in the Metro News
1 Gridlock Chopper.
Robin, it's time for Sports!
Over to you, Sid.
Thank you, Kevin and Robin.
Let's talk about
the Super Bowl.
Weeks earlier,
Marshall had promised Lily
he'd come into her kindergarten
class for show-and-tell day.
And he's a little
bit double-jointed...
And his favorite animal
is the Loch Ness monster.
Lily, how many times...?
Nessie is a gentle creature.
We're trying to stay away
from terms like "Monster."
Well, I think we can all agree,
he is much more interesting
than Sally's one-eyed goldfish.
Three weeks in a row?
Come on, Sally.
Okay, well,
that's all the time we have.
Arts and crafts, everybody.
Hey. I'm Doug.
Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.
Are you going to be staying
here for the rest of day?
Yeah, I'm actually
trying to hide out
'cause I don't want to know
who won the Super Bowl.
I know who won.
Oh, um, that's great,
but I really don't want to know,
so if you could just
keep that to yourself.
How badly do you
not want to know?
Excuse me?
Ten  bucks.
Are  you serious?
Just went up to eight.
Unlock me, Ted.
I've never gone this long
without calling my bookie.
He worries.
Not until game time.
Where are you going?
Pick up the hot wings.
What? How the hell are
you planning on getting
in and out of a sports bar
without seeing the score?
There's TVs everywhere.
Ah, don't worry.
I got it all planned out.
First of all:
I placed duct tape on
a pair of sunglasses
so I can only see out
of two tiny holes.
Next, I constructed blinders
out of an old cereal box.
Top it all off:
high-tech noise-reducing headphones
I bought when Marshall and
Lily first got back together
and were doing it a lot.
I call it the Sensory
Deprivator 5000.
Hello! Uh,
my name is Ted Mosby.
I'm here to pick
up my hot wings.
In my hand, you'll find the
exact total for the wings
plus a generous tip.
Please take the cash.
Put the wings in my hand
and I'll be on my way.
Thank you!
And that closes the book on
one heck of a Super Bowl.
Back to you, Kevin and Robin.
We'll be right back.
And we're clear.
I'm sorry.
Um, Robin, is it just me,
or were you doing
something different there?
I haven't watched the game yet.
I'm begging you,
for the rest of the newscast
there can't be any references
to who won the Super Bowl.
I mean,
change the teleprompter.
No team names,
nothing specific.
That is crazy. I can't do that.
My friend Mark passed
away this week.
Okay, sweety okay.
Okay, I'm so sorry.
Back in five... four...
- three...
- It's just so hard.
Ha! Who's the idiot now?!
You said the Sensory
Deprivator 5000 was stupid.
But it totally worked!
I couldn't see or hear
anything happening around me.
Right?! Right?!
No...!
And if that weren't bad enough,
I was about to have a
horrible realization.
Where's the dipping sauce?
The team that won, want to know
what their name rhymes with?
Come on, dude.
You promised you'd stop
if I ate all those crayons.
Why are you doing this?
I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.
Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin,
she's mine.
Okay, now who did this?
I did.
Does that mean Marshall
gets a time-out?
Well, Marshall's
a grownup, so...
When one of us breaks something,
we get a time-out.
Sorry.
And after the Super Bowl,
the mayor of the losing
team's city had to pay up,
sending the mayor of
the winning team's city
15 pounds of a delicacy his
or her city is famous for.
Better fire up whatever type of grill,
steamer or fryer
one might use to cook that delicacy,
Winning Team's Mayor.
Hey.
- Hey.
- I'm not talking to you.
Yes, you are.
You'll do whatever I say.
- Hold your breath.
- I'm not holding my breath.
The winning team was the...
Now here's how this
is going to work:
you're going to take me to
three R-rated movies a week...
And then Uncle
Marshall got an idea.
It was not one he was
proud of in retrospect,
but desperate times...
Oh, no.
Somebody wet their pants.
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, really?
Who's everyone gonna believe?
I'm a grownup third-year
law student at Columbia
and you're just a little pants wetter.
So now I ask you a question:
You want to be able to quietly sneak
off to the restroom and dry off
or am I gonna have something
for show and tell today?
- Hey, everyone...
- Okay, okay.
You win.
I want my money back.
And your pudding snack pack.
Sir, who won the Super Bowl?
Sorry. I missed the game.
You missed...?!
How could he miss...?
Excuse me!
Who won the Super Bowl?!
I... don't really
follow sports.
Oh, my...!
Emmitt Smith!
Oh, thank God.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
You got to tell me,
who won the Super Bowl?
The game was last night?
You know, once you win two
or three of those things,
it's kind of like, eh.
But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a
football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday.
What could possibly be more
important than football?!
Dance, my friend. Dance.
No...!
Hello! It's me again.
Oh! I didn't recognize you.
Yeah, you forgot to give
me the dipping sauce!
Ah. Yes.
This is the one.
It was 4:00, and so far,
all of us had done the impossible.
But then,
almost simultaneously,
things started to go wrong.
And let's end the
day on a happy note.
There is a new arrival
at the Bronx Zoo.
Trish Sanchez has the story.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, dude, look out.
And in honor of
yesterday's big win...
- Hey, buddy, look out.
- Dude, watch out!
...the zoo decided to
name the baby panda
after Super Bowl champions...
No...!
No...!
No...!
Yes...!
Awesome. Just in
time for kick-off.
None of you guys found
out the score, right?
- Mission accomplished.
- Didn't find out.
Great. Let's do it.
I already fast-forwarded
through the four hours of pre-game
coverage. So we are ready.
Barney, I can't
even look at you.
I don't want any
sign of who won.
Don't worry,
I'm not going to give anything away.
Feel free to start without me.
Ah...!  Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
So much money!
You screwed it up, Barney!
You screwed everything up!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Okay, let's watch the game.
Barney, what the hell was that?
We know who you bet on.
Now you've ruined the
game for everyone.
Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.
Way to blow it.
Yeah, I didn't know
and now I do know.
There's no point in
even watching the game.
Well, at least the
commercials aren't ruined.
Wings are still good.
Beer still works.
Ah, what the hell.
Let's watch Barney
lose some money.
Hey, so check this out:
I got extorted by a
five-year-old today.
I almost got fired today.
I met Emmitt Smith today.
Ooh, you go first.
I tried out the Sensory
Deprivator 5000.
Yeah, go ahead, Barney.
Well, I was frantically
running down the street
trying to find out the
score to the game...
And here's the funny part,
as unforgettable as
that Super Bowl was,
here it is 23 years later and
I don't remember who won...
Hell, I don't even
remember who played.
What I do remember is
that we drank beer,
we ate wings and we watched
the Super Bowl together.
Because sometimes, even if you know
how something's going to end,
that doesn't mean you
can't enjoy the ride.
We even raised a toast
to good old Mike.
I mean Mark. Matt.
Crap! Why do I keep doing that?
I didn't only lose the game,
I lost every single prop bet.
Total penalty yardage,
number of replay-challenges,
coin toss...
What are the odds of
losing the coin toss?
50-50, give or take.
Interceptions, field-goals,
total sacks,
whether or not there'd
be a safety, first...

Kids, never underestimate
the power of destiny.
Because when you least expect it,
the littlest thing
can cause a ripple effect
that changes your life.
Take for instance
my trip to Chicago.
That security guard was
a little bit handsy.
That's funny.
She barely touched me.
Uh, Gate 23. Come on.
If we miss this flight,
I will never forgive myself.
Why was this flight
so important?
Let's back up a few months
to the fall of 2006.
I had just sold my first
building design and become
the youngest project manager
in my firm's history.
Suddenly I was
being headhunted.
One firm was even considering me to
run their entire New York office.
They were flying me in
for a final interview
at their corporate
headquarters in Chicago.
It was the opportunity
of a lifetime.
It was my destiny.
There was just one problem.
Hi, wait, two more.
Sorry, you're too late,
I already shut the doors.
Well, I'm sure if we pull
real hard we can open them.
Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but
see, once I close those doors,
that's it.
Nobody else is allowed
down that jet-way.
Except for that guy.
Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss
the chance to interview for my dream job.
I'm sorry, sir.
His dream job!
Didn't you ever have a dream job?
Something from when you were a little
girl, that was all you wanted to do?
I mean, for God's sakes,
I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night
dreaming about being a...
I mean, uh...
This is a cool job.
Please, I have to
be on this flight.
I'll see what I can do.
But it doesn't look good.
Thanks.
Your uniforms are pretty.

Okay.
They haven't armed the doors yet,
so you still have a chance.
It's up to the captain now
and they're calling us back.
Great, please let us know
soon as you hear anything.
Sure, and for the future,
we recommend you arrive
at the airport an hour and
a half before your flight,
not, you know,
one minute after.
Normally, I'm
incredibly responsible.
I just had to go to court this
morning and get sentenced.
Not that I'm a
criminal or anything.
Yeah, he just jumped
a subway turnstile.
You seem to have a lot of problems
with the rules of travel.
Hello?
Oh, that is great news.
It's my mom--
she found her missing earring.
Have a seat.
I'll call you when I hear something.
Where was it?
That thing better
have call waiting.
Could you just call the firm
and explain what happened?
It's down to three people
and I know they need to
make their decision today.
I sort of feel my not showing up
might put me at a disadvantage.
I'm so stupid.
Why did I have to
jump that turnstile?
Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself.
And isn't this whole thing
really Barney's fault?
She had a point.
It was kind of Barney's fault.
Let's back up a few months.
Oh, Marshall,
how's the broken toe?
Oh, man, it kills.
You  want some aspirin, baby?
You know I don't
believe in pain killers.
Wow, your first broken bone.
Kind of kills your whole
"Unbreakable" theory.
Marshall used to think
he was indestructible.
Well, it added up.
I've never broken anything.
I've never been sick,
and when I need to,
I can summon
incredible strength.
Ted, tell her the story
of the really heavy door.
There was a really heavy door.
He opened it.
On one pull.
Well, you must be really bummed, you're
not gonna be able to run tomorrow.
Yeah. It sucks,
all that work I put in training
for the marathon was a total waste.
Training for a marathon.
What?
You don't need to train for a marathon.
You just run it.
You're kidding, right?
Not at all. I could run a
marathon anytime I wanted to.
So like tomorrow, you think you
could wake up, roll out of bed,
and just run the New
York City Marathon?
Absolutely.
Barney, we're talking
about 42 kilometers.
Thanks, Canada.
I'll take it from here.
Barney, it's like 26 miles.
Here's how you run a marathon.
Step one, you start running.
There is no step two.
Okay, you know what? Prove it.
Take my number and
run in my place.
I will bet you 50 bucks you
don't even finish the race.
50 bucks?
Gee, Grandpa, if I win,
maybe I can buy myself
an ice-cream cone.
Make it $10,000.
You have a gambling problem.
You'll bet me 50.
Fine, then no bet.
Okay, $50.
The next morning,
as the marathon began,
we were focused on
Marshall's computer.
Each runner gets a tracking chip
so you can follow them online,
see when they pass certain checkpoints.
Barney's got mine in his shoe.
Ooh, he's starting!
This ought to be good.
Wow.
He's already passing
the second checkpoint.
This tracking thing is amazing.
When we get married,
you're getting one of these.
Wow. Look at his time.
It's pretty impressive.
He's gotta be cheating, okay.
He knew we'd check.
Yeah, he'll do
anything to win a bet.
Remember that time he bet me that Men
at Work sang "Hungry Like the Wolf,"
and when he found out that they didn't,
he tried to hire them to?
Well, it looks like, "Barney" should
be coming over the Queensboro Bridge
and up First Avenue within
the next hour or so. But...
there is no way that
that's really him.
It's really him.
Hey! That's mine.
Yeah, you'd better run!
- What up, non-finishers?
- Wow.
- Very impressive, Barney.
- Right?
Yeah, my time would have been
like a half an hour better,
but I met this total hottie on
Mile Seven. We took a quick detour
and had our own mini
marathon behind a Nathan's.
I  won.
I'm not sure anyone in
that story is a winner.
So where's my 50 bucks?
All right.
I got to admit,
you earned this.
Huh? Can't believe they haven't
made a coin for this yet.
Anyway, I'm heading home.
Might go hit the gym.
Oh, hey, just so you know,
uh, all marathon runners get
to use the subway
for free today.
Wow.  You know I really should
check out this "subway."
Heard so much about it.
Wow. Look at me. Slumming it.
Maybe I'll make a
weekend out of it
and I'll call my bridge
and tunnel girl tonight.
You're dating a girl
from New Jersey?
No.
So Barney did it.
He actually finished
the marathon.
But a little while later...
I got an interesting phone call.
- Hello?
- Ted, it's Barney.
Listen to me, I need you to come
and pick me up on the subway.
What, what are
you talking about?
I was sitting here,
totally minding my own business.
Finisher.
Yeah, you know what I mean.
86th street.
My legs don't work.
I've already ridden the
subway twice end to end.
I've seen where
it turns around.
Ted, you don't ever want to see
where the subway turns around.
Barney's legs won't work.
He's riding the subway
from end to end
because he physically
can't get off the train.
Best 50 bucks I ever spent.
Listen to me, Ted.
I'm going to lose you any second.
I'm on the fourth car of the six train
heading south from Pelham
Bay Park in the Bronx.
Meet me at the 86th Street station in,
like, half an hour?
All right. I'll be right there.
Stay where you are.
Ted, Ted.
Oh, come on. You're not even going
to give up your seat for him?
I'm sorry. I can't.
Douche.
- Barney?!
- Ted!
Hey!
No...!
See? If Barney never
tried to run the marathon,
you never would have
jumped that turnstile,
you wouldn't have had
that court date today,
and we would have
made this flight.
You're right.
Everything can be
traced back to him.
Like that rash we
all got at Christmas.
All right,
I have to see what's going on.
- So I was able to get you two seats.
- Really? That's great!
No, no, not you. I'm talking to
my mom about Blue Man Group.
Ma, can I call you back?
Okay, what about our flight?
Can we get on?
I'm still waiting for... Huh.
Looks like your
flight left already.
What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no.
I have to be in Chicago today.
Well, he never even
called you back?
Well, it's typical pilot.
They don't call you back at work
and they don't call you back after
you spend two nights with them
at a Radisson in Orlando.
It turned out there was one other
flight that would just barely get me
to Chicago on time
for my job interview,
but it was all the way on the
other side of the airport.
What was the name of
the airline again?
I think it was something
like Flights R' Us.
Was the "R" backwards?
God, I hope not.
- Geez.
- Stupid smart carts.
More like dumb carts.
If we miss this flight,
it's all Barney's fault.
You know, Barney never would have
run the marathon in the first place
- if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.
- Yeah, so?
What, you think
this is my fault?
For Marshall, the initial idea to run
the marathon came way back in April.
My pants are starting
to feel a little tight.
Oh, that's okay.
I love that cute little belly.
I cannot allow this.
What?
I am going to run the
New York City Marathon.
"It is important to load
up on carbohydrates
two to four hours
before a big run.
Try a breakfast of a bagel,
a banana,
oatmeal, strawberries
and some orange juice."
Here you go, Marshmallow.
Just like the book said.
Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating
all of my breakfast runner-style.
Liquids are digested faster.
That way, no energy is wasted,
and it's all about the run.
"Don't forget to give yourself
plenty of positive reinforcement."
This is gonna be
your best run yet.
You're going to accomplish
all of your goals.
You are a robot sent
from the future
to win the marathon!
You are... Marshall.
You are... Marshall.
You are Marshall! Yeah!
"Chafing or blisters can
occur in a number of areas,
including the feet, armpits,
or even the nipples.
Try using some petroleum
jelly on the affected areas."
Oh, gosh!
Dude, you are a
terrific runner.
Tomorrow you're gonna run and
finish the New York City Marathon!
You're the best.
You look good.
Nobody does it better than you.
Marshall? Oh, my God!
So, yes, it was your fault.
I  mean, if you don't show up at the
apartment in the middle of the day,
Marshall doesn't break his toe,
Barney doesn't run in his place,
I don't jump the turnstile
and get a court date,
and we make our flight
in plenty of time!
And I don't fall down and bite
my tongue at the airport.
That really wasn't my fault.
I  wouldn't have walked in on
Marshall if it weren't for Lily.
Hey, think about it.
Hey, what's going on here?
Oh, looks like they're
camping out for something.
Yeah, but for what?
I don't know. Usually there's a
Stormtrooper or Klingon in line
to give you some indication.
"Annual wedding dress blowout.
Designer sample
dresses up to 90% off.
Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."
Oh, my God. Can you believe what some
nut bags will do to save a few bucks?
We have to camp out.
- Are you serious?
- You don't understand.
This is an amazing sale.
I've heard about it before,
but I never knew where it was.
We'll have a wedding dress campout.
It'll be fun.
I can't go.
I've got this thing.
- What thing?
- A penis.
- This is the place.
- Oh, wow.
Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet!
Vera Wang!
Oh, Robin, do you have any idea
what you guys stumbled onto here?
You said wang.
Oh, this reminds me of the ticket
line to Lilith Fair, 1998.
Only fewer mullets.
You should feel good. You're only, like,
the tenth craziest bride in New York.
Ooh, this is comfy.
We might actually
be able to sleep.
That's kind of annoying.
Well, I'm sure somebody will be
out here to turn it off any minute.
I don't think I can take this.
Every time it turns off,
I think,
oh, maybe it won't
turn on again,
but then it does.
Why does it, Robin?
Why does it keep turning on?
It's gonna be okay,
sweetie. Why...
Why don't we make a
game out of it, okay?
Why don't we sing along?
If we get through this,
I swear I'm gonna live
my life differently.
I just want to tell my parents
I love them one more time.
Morning, ladies.
- It's him. It's the car guy!
- Get out of here!
The next morning, Robin was too tired
to go all the way back to Brooklyn,
so while I was at work,
she went to crash at my
apartment for a couple hours,
and that's when...
Nobody does it better than you.
Marshall?! Oh, my God!
So if Lily hadn't dragged me
down to the wedding dress store,
we would have made
the first flight.
Oh, thank God.
The doors are still open. We made it.
Hi. Please.
We really need to get on this flight.
Oh, my God!
You're that reporter
from Metro News 1.
Yes, yes, I am.
I can't believe
you recognized me.
- You did that story on the giant pizzas?
- Would you check to see
- if you have any more seats?
- One moment, sir.
Were those pizzas real?
Come on, were they?
- Robin...
- One second, Ted.
Um, you know,
a lot of people ask me that.
The truth is,
the pizzas were real.
- Calzones. Trick photography.
- I knew it!
God, it is so nice
to meet a fan!
And I would be a fan of your
work if you could get us
two seats on that next flight.
Well, the, uh, flight attendants are
just finishing up their final
seat count.
Let me see what I can find out.
Would it help if I got on and gave an
impassioned speech about my destiny?
I think it might hurt.
This is such a nightmare.
Okay, so we agree? This goes
back to Lily wanting to camp out
for a wedding dress?
No.
Wait. It goes back further.
Remember why we were eating
hot dogs on the East Side?
1939?!
This penny's from 1939!
A 67-year-old penny.
Do you realize this penny was
minted during World War II?
Oh, so was my grandfather,
but that doesn't make him interesting.
Look, I know a little
something about coins,
and  this baby is worth
something to a collector.
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!
You know what?
I'm gonna take you out to dinner
with the money I get
for this little guy.
And that's exactly what I did.
You're lucky there's still a place that
serves anything for a dollar fifty.
Hey, that's 150 times
its original value.
Actually, the meal
was only $1.49.
1984.
Hey, in 50 years,
we can get dinner again.
How dare you.
Hey, what's going on?
I don't know. Looks like they're
camping out for something.
Yeah, but for what?
It was me.
I started this.
If I hadn't picked
up that penny,
we wouldn't have gone to get hot
dogs all the way across town.
And we wouldn't have seen
that wedding dress store,
Lily wouldn't have wanted
to camp out there,
and I wouldn't have needed a nap
at your apartment the next day.
Marshall wouldn't
have broken his toe.
Barney wouldn't have
run the marathon.
I wouldn't have jumped
that turnstile,
gotten arrested,
had that court date...
And we would have
made our flight.
I don't think we can go
back any further than that
unless you know who
dropped the penny.
I wish I did.
Though that person's already
been punished enough,
losing a sweet penny like that.
Uh, sir?
Oh, please tell me you
have some good news.
Uh, I'm afraid not.
There are no extra
seats on the plane.
I'm sorry.
All, right, well,
thanks for trying.
I can't believe this.
That's it, it's over.
Ted, come on.
Your destiny just wasn't to
make it to Chicago today.
Anyway, if that firm really wants you,
they'll reschedule.
But that's not what happened.
They didn't reschedule.
They hired someone else.
And as it turned out,
three months later,
that guy ended up having
to relocate to Chicago.
Kids, funny thing
about destiny--
I thought I was destined
to get that job.
But I was wrong.
My destiny was to
stay in New York.
Because if I hadn't,
I never would have
met your mother.

Kids, the key to a good
relationship is communication.
- You need to talk.
- How about Mimi's?
Nah, I don't really
feel like Mimi's.
Well, I'm hungry.
Let's just pick a place and go.
Oh, you know where we
should go? Cynthia's.
You love that place--
remember what a great time we had
the last time we were there?
- We did?
- Yeah, yeah.
We had that crazy waiter who kept going,
"You two should get married!
You two should get married!"
It's also important to
know when to stop talking.
Come on. Then we stepped outside.
It was raining.
It was so romantic?
How can you not remember this?
Because it wasn't me.
Oh, right!
It was...
my sister.
You see,
by the time you've hit your late 20s,
you've dated a few people,
but when you're in a relationship,
it's common courtesy to pretend
that you haven't.
Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on.
Remember when we
went to see it?
We sat in the back row.
I've never seen Van Helsing.
That's right.
I saw it with my sister.
My boss just got
back from Maui.
He said it was really romantic.
Oh, it's so romantic.
When were you in Maui?
- I... went... with my sister.
- With my sister.
Why do you always say that?
Look, we're not 16.
We've both dated other people.
It's silly to try to
act like we didn't.
You're right.
We should just be honest.
Totally.
See that girl over there?
Three years ago,
I totally made out with her.
I don't want to hear that.
- What? You said...
- God, that is so insensitive.
- Remember honesty...?
- You're a jerk!

Okay, so you have to
have sex with one.
Either classic mermaid;
bottom half fish, top half human,
or inverted mermaid,
top half fish, bottom half human.
Go!
I don't know. Is she fat?
Yeah, but it's a fish,
so it's the good kind of fat.
Hot off the presses!
I-I don't take flyers.
You took one two seconds
before you walked in here.
That's different.
It was for a strip club.
Two bucks off wings.
How much is your flyer
going to save me on wings?
Fine. It's a flyer
from my play.
Oh, Lily, I'd love to,
but we're not in college
and I'm not trying
to sleep with you.
- So anyway, this mermaid...
- Hey, Lily's friend asked her
to be in this play,
and it's gonna be really good.
Lily, I love you,
but we're too old for this.
Asking someone to
come see your play
is like asking someone
for a ride to the airport
or to crash on your couch
or to help you move.
Call a cab, book a room,
hire some movers
and repeat after me:
Friends  don't let friends
come see their crappy play.
Okay, first of all,
I've thought about it and top half fish.
Second of all, we need you guys
to decide something for us.
Yes, you should break up.
So, earlier tonight...
Mm, we should get
down to the bar.
I know we should,
but you just look so sexy
in my red sweatshirt.
Oh, God,
why is this part of the story?
We're getting to it.
Damn, my face is so dry.
Is there any moisturizer around here?
Yeah, there's some
in the bathroom.
Got to moisturize!
Got to keep that
pretty face moist.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- What's wrong with her?
- She hates that word.
- What word, "moist"?
- No! Seriously, stop!
So, anyway, Ted goes into the
bathroom to get the moist...
face lotion...
Wow, this is great stuff.
Now I know the secret to
your great complexion.
What are you talking about?
It's yours.
No, it's not.
Oh, well...
then I guess it's Lily's.
No, it's not.
Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?
Um, my sister's.
So, in other words,
some girl you went out with.
Um... I love you.
Disgusting. You let me put on the
same moisturizer as one of your exes?
It was probably Carla's.
Her face was a train wreck.
I'm don't think Ted was
dating her for her face.
Thank you, Marshall.
Thank you so much.
Why is that still
in your apartment?
I don't know.
I just never threw it out.
Well, why not? Do you still
have feelings for this girl?
Yeah. I'm madly
in love with her,
and the only way
I can deal with it
is by holding onto a
three-dollar tube of lotion.
Not three dollars! Try 14.
Why is this such a big deal?
Because I don't want to use
some whore's moisturizer!
Whoa, she wasn't a whore.
Well, she's leaving expensive
lotions all over town.
It sounds like a whore to me.
What else do you have from old
girlfriends just lying around?
Nothing. That's it.
Well, except for
the phone booth.
And the lamp by the desk...
and the...
No.
No! No! Oh, Ted!
Ah, the age-old question:
after  you break up with someone,
what do you do with the stuff?
Question? Ain't no
question, girl.
Obviously, he's got
to get rid of it.
Which is obviously crazy and obviously,
I'm not gonna do it.
So we agreed that we
would let you guys decide.
Yeah, like we did with
Marshall's pants.
Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v.
The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.
Nice, right?
I'm gonna have to say no.
I don't want some 16-year-old
girl falling in love with you
and then shooting
Lily in the face.
Yes!
I vote they can stay.
"Check out the jackass in the
parachute pants" is a good icebreaker.
T ed.
Ted? Ted?
Sorry, buddy,
it's a "no" for me, too.
Oh, and by the way,
Bel Biv Devoe called.
Even they don't want
those pants back.
They were insanely comfortable!
They were like pajamas
you could wear outside.
Marshall, it's over.
We even gave you an appeal and they
didn't look any better with combat boots.
All right, well, let's hear the
arguments. Ted, you go first.
Okay. The fact that I still have things
from ex-girlfriends is no big deal.
I mean,
when I see the phone booth on the piano,
I don't think of
Jeannie Radford,
I think of the good times I
had backpacking through Europe.
And when I see the lamp,
I don't think of Allison Moses.
I remember when I was broke,
just out of college,
and I really needed a lamp.
And when I see that throw pillow,
I don't think of Lauren Stein.
I think of that weird orange-brown
stain and how it got there.
Creamsicle and turkey gravy,
not at the same time.
Well, that's adorable,
but from now on, when I walk into the
apartment, here is what I will see.
I'm Ted's college girlfriend.
He made me 12 mix tapes.
How many has he made you?
He calls you "sweetie pie"?
He called me "sweetie pie."
I'm stupid,
but my rack is bigger than yours.
Really? You can't
look at a pillow
without seeing my ex-girlfriend--
a pillow!
Yes, Ted, the fact that you still
have that pillow is creepy and gross.
- You're creepy and gross.
- Your mom's creepy and gross.
Order! Order!
I got to side with Robin.
She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff
upsets her, you got to get rid of it.
I've got to side with Ted.
Just 'cause you still have
something an ex-girlfriend gave you
doesn't mean you're
holding onto her.
All right, Barney.
It all comes down to you.
- I side with Robin.
- What?
Ted, your place
is too cluttered.
It's like you're living
in a Bennigan's.
Or a Danby's.
What, they don't have
Danby's in the US?
Really?
Well, then were do you get
Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?
Just stop, sweetie.
So I had no choice.
I packed up everything I had
gotten from ex-girlfriends.
It was painful,
but not as painful as what I
had to endure later that night.
New York is famous
for its theater,
but there's many
different levels.
There's Broadway,
off-Broadway,
off-off-Broadway,
homeless people
screaming in the park,
and then below that,
the play Aunt Lily was in.
Eight flights, of stairs.
Who puts a theater up
eight flights of stairs?
What kind of building is this?
From the smell of it,
I'm guessing a urine factory.
Where do you guys want to sit?
I know where I
don't want to sit.
Guys, four together!
I brought a bag in case
anyone needs to puke.
Come on.
It's not gonna be that bad.
No? Okay.
I... am... Rage!
I... am Greed.
I am Rage... Envy!
I am outta here.
No, you're not.
You have to stay.
This is the face
of Consumerism!
Oh, my God.
Ted's part of the play.
Hello, Greed, Rage...
Envy...
and Consumerism.
I... am your father...
America!
Oh, baby, that was wonderful!
Totally, I had no idea
Greed was the killer.
And when it became a
play within a play,
I was, like,
"Now we are really cookin'!"
Wow, Lily, that sucked!
Barney!
What? It was terrible.
I mean, come on.
You guys agree, right?
Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest
'cause, you know, we're friends.
No, friends make each
other feel good.
They build each other
up and support them.
That's what being a
good friend is about.
Yeah, if you're a Smurf.
You know if you did a play,
I would sit through the whole thing
and I would compliment
you on it afterwards.
Oh, really? You would?
Yes.
Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.
We'll be starting our
Q&A with the director--
yours truly--
in five minutes right here.
Can you believe Barney said
that about Lily's play?
I know.
He can be really insensitive.
It was pretty bad, though.
Oh, my God, it was so bad.
Oh, my God, you've been robbed!
Nope.
All that stuff was
from old girlfriends?
Don't you buy anything
for yourself?
What can I say?
Papa gets swag.
And that should've been the end of it.
But the next day...
You know, at first I was really bummed
about getting rid of all my stuff.
But seeing how happy it makes you--
totally worth it.
Mm, that's kind of how I feel when
I begrudgingly have sex with you
when I'm really tired.
Exactly. Sometimes you
gotta take one for the team.
Well, sit. Sit, yeah.
So you never keep anything
your ex-boyfriends gave you?
Nope.
Well, except for my dogs.
So I had to get rid of everything
from my past relationships
because you don't keep things
from your past relationships
except, uh, where are your five
dogs from? Oh, that's right:
your past relationships.
What's your point, Ted?
Well, you know how you said
you come over to my apartment,
and all you can see
are my ex-girlfriends?
What, so when you look at my dogs,
all you see is my ex-boyfriends?
I do now.
That's ridiculous.
I thought you said you got rid of
everything your ex-boyfriends gave you.
Well, yeah, but not my dogs.
You said everything.
But not living things.
Well, tell that to the rare
Bolivian cactus I threw away.
Things with a
heartbeat can stay.
Enjoying this?
Pickles, go get your ball.
Go get your ball.
Just admit it.
It was a little hypocritical of you
to make me get rid
of all my stuff.
Well, what do you want me to do, Ted?
Get rid of my dogs?
Guess what position
we did it in.
Yes. Yes,
I want you to get rid of your dogs.
Um, no.
Really? Well,
I say we take it to the group,
but I don't like your chances.
She's not getting
rid of the dogs.
What's the matter with you?
- Even I wouldn't do that.
- Yes!
You can ask somebody to get rid of their
iguana after it poops in your hair,
but not their dog.
I miss Jebediah.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Flyers for my new play.
Very funny.
Oh, it's not a joke.
It's my one-man show
premiering tomorrow night.
And even though it's terrible
and excruciatingly long,
I expect you all to be there
since we're such good friends.
Oh, we'll be there.
Unless, of course, you just want
to admit that you were wrong...
- Never.
- Good.
Okay, I gotta go rehearse.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Bring a poncho;
the first three rows get wet.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
where the dogs came from.
I'm sorry I asked you
to get rid of them.
That was ridiculous.
So we're-we're okay?
Yeah, we're great.
And I thought we were,
but just as it did in the
seventh act of Aunt Lily's play,
Jealousy reared its ugly head.
Oh, yeah, that's the spot.
Dude, I gotta pee.
I gotta go.
Oh, he's really having trouble
dealing with this, huh?
Yeah, he really is.
It's got me thinking,
maybe I should get rid of my dogs.
Might be time to send
them to the farm.
- You're gonna kill your dogs?!
- No! No, no, no,
there really is a farm.
My aunt has a farm upstate.
Oh, thank God.
Aw, you know,
if I were five dogs,
I'd rather live on a farm than
in an apartment in Brooklyn.
Yeah. I could visit
them on weekends.
My aunt is awfully lonely up there.
It's just her and her lover, Betty.
Oh, that's perfect.
They love dogs.
"They"? What do
you mean by "they"?
Uh... uh.... uh...
People upstate.
Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?
I mean,
you know that this is gonna be...
I know, but I'm gonna sit
through the whole thing,
and I'm gonna say something
nice about it afterwards.
You know why?
Because that's what friends do.
Moist.
Moist.
Moist.
Moist.
That was the first 40
minutes of Barney's show.
Moist.
And then we endured
about 20 minutes of this.
I have to go refill.
I'll be back in a moment.
Play's not over.
I never get picked for
audience participation.
And then it just got weird.
Feelings.
Inside.
Oh, no!
And when that didn't work...
Okay! Stop!
You win. Fine.
Barney, I'm sorry I made
you come to my show.
Thank you, Lily.
Is there anything you'd
like to say about my show?
No.
No, I have nothing nice
to say about your show.
You were right, Barney.
Let's go to the bar.
Yes! I win!
I love winning!
Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily.
I was just getting
warmed up, man!
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:39,483
If you had any idea what was
coming up in act two... oh!
Well, I imagine it was pretty awful,
so let's go.
Pretty awful? Pretty awful?!
It was a masterpiece of awful.
It's genius how bad it is.
I kind of wish you guys could see it.
Yeah, well, anyway.
Act two is where I
really hit my stride.
Spoiler alert:
the robot falls in love.
How about this, Barney?
How about we stay
and-and watch the
rest of your show?
It's your funeral.
Five, six, one, two.
So we stayed and let Barney torture
us for another hour and a half,
'cause that's what
friends do, apparently.
Hey.
Where've you been?
I called you earlier.
I gave my dogs away to my aunt.
You what?
Yeah. Just for a few months
as a test run, but...
I think it's for the best.
Wow.
Oh, man.
Can we go inside?
Uh, no.
Uh, let's go to the bar.
Why? What's going on inside?
- Um, the floors are gone.
- What?
Yeah. I-I sent them out to get,
um, fixed.
This is a terrible lie.
I'm just going to bail.
I didn't know you were
getting rid of the dogs!
You said you threw
all that stuff away!
Kids, this was the worst
fight Robin and I ever had.
It was one of those fights
that last for hours
and you start to get woozy and lose
track of what you're fighting about.
We fought for so long,
seasons changed outside the window.
Pages of the calendar blew off.
It was crazy.
But, ultimately, and I couldn't
tell you how for the life of me,
but somehow we got to here.
We're really doing this?
Yeah.
- We're moving in together!
- We're moving in together!
The robot found love
Confusing my circuitry
My software's been hacked
Toaster oven
You're the one for me
Two, three, four.
That's two.

This is awesome.
I can't believe this
moment's finally here.
One more mile and my
little boy turns 200,000.
Your baby Fiero's grown into
a really old man Fiero.
And just like an old man,
he leaks fluid, smells stale,
makes weird noises
out the back.
Yeah, he does.
Hey, light up those cigars
in the glove compartment.
They're real Cubans.
I got 'em in Chinatown last year
just for this moment.
Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying
you were definitely ripped off,
but these are chopsticks
wrapped in napkins.
- What are you talking about?
- Whoa, pothole.
What? No. Oh. No.
No, no, no.
No, there's only .8 miles to go.
Come on, buddy.
Buddy!
Is it cool if I
still light these?

Kids, sometimes life forces us to
be someone we didn't want to be.
When that happens, we often try to hold
on to a little piece of who we were.
Maybe a tattoo.
Or a piece of jewelry.
A tiny souvenir that reminds us,
"This is who I really am."
Marshall's souvenir
was not so tiny,
but the more he found himself being
pushed toward the corporate world
and away from his dream of
saving the environment,
the tighter he held
on to that Fiero.
Hey.
One good thing: we're off the
hook for the folding party today.
Hey. It's very important
to both Lily and me
that there be a handmade origami
crane in each of our wedding's...
I couldn't even get through it.
Thank God.
Hey, your car's
going to be fine.
This is the best
auto shop around.
Look at this certificate.
One of the mechanics here
finished a 64-ounce steak.
Surprise.
We felt bad that you
guys were missing
the super-fun origami
folding party, so...
we suggested moving it here.
We insisted.
Terrific.
How's the Fiero?
She's still in triage.
She? I thought it
was your little boy.
Oh, it goes back and forth.
It's sort of a tranny car.
How long have you had her...
slash him?
My brothers handed it
down to me when I was 16.
Oh, how nice of them.
Not really.
Congratulations.
The Fiero is yours.
If you pass the final test.
Come on!
I already shaved my legs and
swallowed five dollars in quarters.
Only $4.50 has come out.
Just go to the
Weinerburger drive-thru
and get us 12 cups of coffee.
- That's it?
- Oh, yeah.
But we get to decide
what you wear.
Agreed. Totally agreed.
You're naked.
I'm aware of that.
You have 50 cents?
No...
Look,  can I just have
my coffee, please?
Sorry, we're all out
of trays and lids.
Two tall guys just came through here
a few minutes ago and bought 'em all.
And that is the origin
of Marshall's insane
"no food or drinks in the Fiero,
not even groceries" rule.
It is not insane.
Barney. That's like the third one
in a row that you've screwed up.
Well, I'm trying, but it's...
Look. You fold twice to the middle,
fold back and forth, pull the ends out,
flip over, open the flaps, fold the
edges, crease the front, fold in half,
fold the wings down, push in the bottom
corners, and fold the wings back out.
Or would you like one of my
kindergartners to show you?
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, I think I've got it.
No.
Forget it; the paper's too expensive.
You're out.
Aw, nerts.
The food rule is insane.
We could have died because of it.
- Remember the 100K fiasco?
- Ah, the Fiero-asco.
Dude, I told you that doesn't work.
It's the 100K fiasco.
- What's the 100K fiasco?
- The Fiero-asco?
It was just before winter break
our freshman year of college.
Marshall and I were roommates,
but we weren't really good friends yet.
I thought Ted was a
little bit pretentious.
And Marshall was a total slob.
Hey.
I'm driving my Fiero
back over break.
I know we see enough of
each other as it is,
but if you want a ride,
I could use the gas money.
You live in Ohio, right?
I could swing through and pick you up.
All right, first of all,
my parents live in Ohio.
I live in the moment.
Plus, Karen and I haven't seen
each other since Thanksgiving.
We're both really invested in making
this long-distance thing work, so...
All right, well,
call me if you change your mind.
My odometer's
going to hit 100K.
She'd be so bummed
if I left early.
It was totally mutual.
I mean, Karen brought it up first,
but I...
it was...
it was totally mutual.
I hear you.
So what's up with you and Lily?
Anything serious?
Yeah.
Dude, we're college freshmen.
I'm not going to get tied down by
the first chick I hook up with.
Lily's cool, but this bird
you'll never chain, you know?
The next few hours of our
drive were classic road trip.
So... this song.
Oh, it's the best
song in the world.
It's the only song I like.
Just kidding.
Tape's been stuck in the player for,
like, two years.
Better than nothing, though.
Maybe.
I am so... sick...
of this song.
Don't worry.
It comes around again.
What do you mean?
# Just to be the man
who walks 1,000 miles #
# And falls down
at your door... #
Yeah, we totally
nailed the ending.
That was probably our best one.
Hey, you want to
play Zitch Dog?
- What?
- Uh, it's a car game.
Every time you see a dog, you got to
be the first one to say, "Zitch dog."
- I'm pretty good, so...
- Zitch dog.
Well, no, I didn't know we had...
we'd started, but...
Okay, that's cool.
You got the first point.
- Zitch dog.
- Zitch dog. Damn it!
Are we still playing?
'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...
12-nothing.
Marshall.
-  Marshall.
- Zitch dog, blue Suburban.
Damn it!
18-nothing.
Then Marshall,
who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog,
got us totally lost.
Where the hell are we?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.
I think you skipped something.
Really? Seems impossible.
Hey, we got some time.
What do you say we get off the highway,
take the road less traveled, you know?
Robert Frost.
Doesn't seem like a smart idea.
Too late.
I'm taking this exit.
Who's not fun
enough now, Karen?
Then we got lost.
Where the hell are we?!
- I'm pulling over.
- No, keep driving.
We're almost out of gas, and we
might not even be on a road anymore.
It's below zero out. If we pull over,
we could be snowed in for days.
Plus, I only have, like, six granola
bars and three bottles of water.
- Nah, I threw them out.
- What?!
No food or drink in the Fiero.
No food or drink in the F...? You
haven't washed your sheets since...
Thus began the longest
night of our lives.
Pretty sure that my
foot is frozen solid.
Marshall...
there's a very real chance that we're
gonna be snowed in here for days.
If I die first,
do whatever you need to survive.
Eat my flesh.
Slice me open like a
tauntaun, whatever.
Thanks, Ted.
You're a good friend.
And if I die first,
you just leave my body alone.
What?
I just said you could cut me
open and crawl inside me.
Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me;
it skeeves me out.
But... but you're dead,
and I'm gonna die if I don't.
Wasn't an easy decision.
This is all because of
your insane no-food rule.
It's perfectly rational.
Hey! My spectacles!
Hey.
I know we're low on gas,
but can we turn on the
heat for just a minute?
Okay.
D ude...
I hate to say this...
but it's so cold...
there's only one way that we're
gonna make it through this night.
- We should've kept driving.
- Come on, Marshall.
No. No. We might die now.
I may never see Lily again.
I never told
anybody this, but...
I've known for a long time that
I'm gonna marry that girl.
If we survive this,
someday I'm gonna marry her.
I'm sorry about
your spectacles.
That's okay.
They were decorative.
Hey, Marshall.
Y eah?
Are you still
thinking about Lily?
Yeah.
Please stop.
And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna
die out there in the middle of nowhere.
But funny thing...
Hey. You lovers better
just keep on driving.
- Zitch dog!
- Damn it!
You said you were gonna
marry me that long ago?
That is so sweet.
That trip is when Marshall
and I became best friends.
With privileges,
from the sound of it.
E riksen.
Wow.
Looks like he
really needs a hug.
Ted.
He said it would be at least
3,000 bucks to make it run again.
And even then,
there's no guarantee.
Well, it's a pretty old car.
Yeah. You can keep
prolonging its life,
but it's really mostly
machine at this point.
I know that it's
a lot of money,
but it's my Fiero, you know?
I'm about to graduate and take
some sellout corporate law job,
and without that Fiero,
I'm just another guy in a suit.
- How dare you...
- Hey.
I've been through so
much in that car.
The suicidal cat.
Hitchhiking Waldo.
The homeless guy who broke
in through the window
and threw up all
over the backseat.
Lily, don't.
Be strong. Do not go all
"prisoner's dilemma" on me.
The car's on its deathbed, Robin.
I have to clear my conscience.
Guys, what are
you talking about?
Okay. Shortly
after we met Robin,
she and I were jonesing for
Thai food from this one place.
An hour and a half delivery.
We can't wait that long.
I wish we could take the Fiero, but
Marshall has this insane no-food rule.
But Thai food, Lily.
Pad Yum Mao.
Tom Kai Gah.
Thai See Ran.
Oh! You're just saying random syllables,
and it still sounds delicious.
Okay. Here's what we'll do.
We'll drive over, pick it up,
have them double-bag it,
very carefully drive it back
here with the windows open,
and he'll never know.
Wow, these brakes
are really sensitive.
Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me!
This and the difference between "affect"
and "effect" are the only two things
he's really serious about.
- Lily, it's gonna be fine.
- No, it's not.
Marshall's gonna freak.
Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do?
- Oh, God, oh...!
- Shut up!
Now, listen to me.
The clock is ticking.
Okay, first thing, we scoop up all
these little pieces of tofu and cabbage.
Next, what we need to take care
of are the really messy parts--
the pools that have collected.
We got to soak that soup up.
Last is the smell.
We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai.
You mentioned cigars.
There's two in the glove compartment,
but he's been saving them.
Hand me those chopsticks.
Hey, how about some tunes?
Oh, great song.
These cigars aren't
helping at all.
Yeah. This was a terrible idea.
Now it just smells like a
homeless guy threw up in here.
The broken windows?
We had to make it
look realistic.
Why did you break two of them?
It looked like fun when she did it.
So I wanted to try.
Can't believe this whole
time it was you guys.
I've been blaming really
tanned dancing leotard guy.
Marshall, I'm so sorry,
but sharing that secret--
that's when Robin and
I became best friends.
Wow. What a special car.
So, can I crush it into
a little cube yet?
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.
Come on, Marshall.
This is your Fiero.
You know the right
thing to do here.
Wow, Barney,
why do you love that car so much?
Love it?
Hold on a second.
Love it?
I hate it!
What? Why?
Why? Why?
Why?!
- Why?!
- Let me tell it.
It was last year during
the transit strike.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Uh, is Marshall around?
I have a massage in Queens in
half an hour. I need a ride.
Uh, no, he's at the library all day.
Just take the keys.
Hey! Why don't you drive me?
It'll be like a
total road trip.
To Queens?
Yeah, we'll get,
we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.
Uh, actually I have a
lot of work to do, so.
Okay. Well, anyway,
I'll cancel.
- See you later.
- Wait!
You know how to drive, right?
What, of course I know how to drive.
I love driving.
Hitting the road.
Cruising the lanes.
And braking.
Honking. Love it.
Except for lady drivers.
Don't get me started
on lady drivers.
- Which pedal's the gas?
- Trick question.
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.
- Middle, left, right?
I never learned how to drive!
I grew up in the city.
I never had a chance.
Well, guess what?
You're getting your chance.
Because I'm going to teach you.
Barney Stinson, buckle up.
This isn't right.
God never meant for us to travel
at such breakneck speeds.
Relax. You're doing great.
Ignore the old lady on the rascal;
this isn't a race.
Dude, a dog.
Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.
What do I do?
Tell me what to do, Ted.
Step on the brakes.
Sometime in the next 20 minutes.
Which? Which one's
the break again?
- The left one.
- Left. Oh, man, left.
- I'm totally blanking.
- Make the Ls.
Oh, we're not going to make it.
Why did you just
turn on the radio?
I don't know why I
turned on the radio!
We're going to die.
Tell me what to do, Ted.
Relax. You're being crazy.
- Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.
- Stop, drop and roll.
Screaming is fun!
Screaming is fun!
I can't move.
I can't... I can't feel my...
Wait.
Wait.
We're okay.
- We're okay.
- We're okay.
It's a miracle, Ted!
Wow. Sounds like you had
some accident in that car.
Actually, he had two accidents
if you add the fact that he...

I shouldn't even be here,
thanks to that deathtrap.
But fate...
fate gave me a second chance.
And helped me realize that our days on
this planet are too few to squander.
So I decided from
that moment on
to continue living
life to its fullest.
So you made a life-changing decision
to not change your life at all.
True story.
Guys.
This Fiero's meant
a lot to all of us.
Friendships were made.
Adventures had. Horrors faced.
That's why we have
to get rid of it.
- Yes!
- What?
It's lived a great life and it
deserves to die with dignity.
But 200,000...
But that's life. You know?
You never end up where you
thought you wanted to be.
I'm not helping
the environment.
Ted's not a philosopher.
Lily's not not a
world-famous artist.
Barney's never driven more
than ten miles an hour.
Robin, I'm sure, has also experienced
disappointment in her life.
Maybe?
And my Fiero's not a Fiero
that went 200,000 miles.
It's okay. You know?
Those are old dreams.
We'll get a new car and we'll fill
that one up with new memories.
And that'll be the car we had
when we were first married.
When we owned our first house.
Maybe even the first car
our four kids remember.
That's so sweet.
The first car our
two kids remember.
I would like to say good-bye.
You know what?
This Fiero,
it's effected all our lives.
- Affected.
- That's what I said.
Just making sure.
Got us all a lot of places.
I mean maybe it's time
we return the favor.
This Fiero should have
made it to 200,000.
So, let's get it out that door.
And we'll push it
the last .7 miles.
It'd do the same for us.
Hey, geniuses.
The back wheels are on blocks.
That car ain't going anywhere.
- Close enough!
- Close enough!
And so Marshall said
good-bye to his Fiero.
And as the car's
final gift to us all,
the money he got for scrap parts paid
our bar tab for the next two nights.
Arrivederci, Fiero!
You  were the freaking
giving tree of cars.
May you rust in peace.
Rot in hell, devil steed.
And what better friend
is there than that?
Bro. Have you heard
this new song?
I just got the cassingle.
Put it in.
I am never going to
get sick of this song.
Never, ever, never,
never, ever.
Yeah!

Kids, in the spring of 2007, everything
was great between me and Robin.
So we decided to try
and make it even better.
We decided to move in together.
So, I can have the moving
truck here by 8:00 am.
Does that sound
good to everybody?
By the way,
what are you guys doing with Ted's room?
'Cause if you need help with the rent,
I'll take it.
Why would you want
to live with us?
I don't call what
you guys do "living."
Here's the deal,
I need a room closer to the bar.
It takes me exactly 23 minutes
to get a girl from the
bar back to my apartment.
A lot can go wrong
in 23 minutes.
This is going to be so hot.
She's paying.
I swear,
if he doesn't call me back,
I'm going to go
through with this.
Please hurry, sir.
I want to do dirty
stuff with you.
Stuff I won't let him do.
Every red light run
is an extra $20.
Baby?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
It was all my fault.
I am so drunk.
When I'm this drunk,
I go crazy!
I bet you do.
Check this out.
What up NYPD?
So close.
See? If I had a room here all I
have to do is get them upstairs.
Come on, guys. It'll be great!
We'll come in after
you guys are asleep
and I'll be gone
before you wake up.
So, you get to have sex and we get to
wake some skanky girl up in the morning
and kick her out?
God, Lily.
Some guy just told her that he loved
her then pretended to go to the bathroom
and never came back
you can't make her a cup of coffee?
Real nice.

I put all your heavy jackets
in this box marked "winter."
And all your colorful sweaters
in this box marked "Bill Cosby."
Make fun,
but America loved that guy for a reason.
Wow!
Almost done.
Not so fast.
Take your sword.
Wow.
- End of an era.
- Yeah.
It's a bummer to break up the set,
but you're going to need that sword.
It's true--
my building is infested with dragons.
Looks like our little boy
is finally moving out.
It seems like just yesterday
he was a cute little freshmen.
Discovering Reggae
and ultimate Frisbee.
He did it later than the other
kids but we never pushed him.
We knew he'd get there.
You haven't moved in yet,
have you?
Good. You guys have
to take this quiz.
I found it in a magazine.
It's called the "Are you ready
to move in together?" quiz.
Well, if it's anything like you're
"Are you wearing panties" quiz,
I'm out.
Question one,
Ted, "Do you want to
move in with Robin?"
Mm. Yes.
Oh, you got the
first one wrong.
The answer is "no," you
secretly want to be single
and hang out with your
awesome friend Barney."
Question two.
Robin, "Do you think you can
score a hotter guy than Ted?"
Correct. The answer
was awkward silence.
Question three, "Did I just make
up this quiz to prove a point?"
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Really? You mean it's not from
Old Yellow Legal Pad Magazine?
So? We all agree?
We move Ted's
stuff back up here?
Mm... no.
We're still moving in together.
Why? This is crazy.
Ted you're throwing your life away.
This girl is blinding you.
With her shiny hair and
her boobed shaped boobs.
This is bad for you,
too, you know.
How are you going to feel when
he sees you without any makeup?
I'm not wearing
makeup right now.
Holy crap, you're beautiful.
All right then, how will you feel when
you can't sneak the occasional cigarette?
Oh, come on,
Robin doesn't smoke.
Wait, do you?
Of course not. Why?
Don't tell me how
to live my life!
Ted, I can't let you do this.
Come on. This is happening.
So instead of fighting it why,
why don't you just help?
- You want me to help you?
- Yeah.
Okay, Ted.
I'll help you.
Can't believe we actually
got him to take a box down.
Maybe he's finally
getting on board.
Where's the truck?
Where's Barney?
Wait for it.
I can't believe this! Everything
I own in the world is in there.
Except for this
box of pot lids.
And the sword.
I'm going to kill him.
I swear to God I'm going to kill him!
Right. Maybe I'll just hold on to that.
For now.
Marshall, we live alone.
This is so great!
We can finally do all the things we always
said we wanted to do if we lived alone.
Oh, I know what I
want to start with.
So, here we are, right?
Sitting around the
apartment naked.
- Awesome.
- Yep.
It's not as awesome as
I thought it would be.
- My butt itches.
- I'm cold.
I noticed.
Yeah, like you're
one to talk, Pointy.
Barney, I don't know if you
got my other 47 messages,
but if my stuff isn't here within
the hour I'm calling the cops.
This is the last time
I'm calling you.
Because my charger's in
the back of the truck.
Don't worry, it's Barney.
He'll bring the stuff back.
No, it's just... I was really looking
forward to settling in, you know?
Maybe setting up my TV.
Watching a movie in bed.
What?
Do we really want a
TV in the bedroom?
I thought we did.
I'm not sure that we do.
Well, where else
would we put my TV?
We could just put it in our
storage unit in the basement.
But wouldn't we miss my TV?
- Would we?
- Yes, we would.
We've had that TV
for a long time
and we would feel more at home
if it were setup in our bedroom.
- We need wine, don't we?
- Yes, we do.
Should we, um,
move this to the bedroom?
Why?
Ted doesn't live here anymore.
We can do it wherever we want.
You know what else?
We don't have to
be quiet anymore.
We can be as loud as we want.
Okay, I think we need to
lay down some ground rules.
Just because we can be loud
doesn't mean we have to be loud.
And although it
might turn you on,
you screaming,
"I'm the best," doesn't do much for me.
Well, it's a lot better than yelling,
"Ted's not here," over and over again.
Well, at least what
I said is true.
Well, that was unnecessary.
Well, since I only have one box I
figure I might as well unpack it.
Mm, where do you think
we should put it?
Well, unless you have a separate pot
lid room, I was thinking the cupboard.
What?
Uh, the thing is my
kitchen is kind of small.
And, um,
I already have a bunch of pot lids
and mine come with pots, so...
You're saying there's no way to make
room for the single box of stuff
I try to move into our place?
Well, why don't you just
take it down to the...
Do not say storage space.
I was going to say Dumpster.
Damn it, Robin,
this is all I have left in the world--
eight pot lids and a sword.
Yeah, about the sword.
Hello.
Put on the suit, Mr. Mosby.
Barney, I know it's you.
Where's my stuff?
It's not me.
If you want to see your
precious possessions again,
put on the suit.
What suit?
Ding-dong. Oh, what's that?
The doorbell.
That's the suit
I'm talking about.
I haven't gotten
to the door yet.
Oh, okay,
let me know when you get there.
Okay, I opened it.
And there's a suit there.
That's the suit
I'm talking about.
- Barney....
- This isn't Barney.
But I hear that guy's awesome.
All right.
Listen very carefully.
You will get your stuff back if you are
able to complete a series of challenges.
Number one, put on the suit.
Number two,
meet me at McClaren's in an hour.
How will I know who to look
for since we've never met?
I look like Barney.
Oh, hey, Ted.
Suit and sneakers.
A little Ellen DeGeneres
but you pull it off.
I don't have any other shoes
because you stole them along
with everything else
I own in the world.
Where's the truck, Barney?
Barney.
People's whose trucks I'm not
holding for ransom call me Barney.
I think you should
call me The Commodore.
- I'm not calling you...
- You're not getting your stuff back.
Can I please have
my stuff back...
The Commodore?
No.
Here's the deal,
Ted, you're my bro.
And you're about to become a henpecked,
beaten down, shell of a man.
So tonight, we are going to have one
last awesome night together as bros.
It's a bro-ing away party.
A special bro-casion.
A bro-choice rally.
Bro-time at the Apollo.
Oh, bro me.
Well, so what do I have to do?
No, it's not what you have to do,
it's what you want to do,
and you want to
have a good time
before you go take Fun Ted
out back and shoot him.
So... first thing
on the docket...
- get me that girl's number.
- Absolutely not.
Mm. That's too bad.
Hey, hypothetical question:
if I was all your stuff,
would I rather be at the bottom
of the East River or The Hudson?
Hey, look,
world's strongest man is on.
Ooh, it's the one where
Lou Ferrigno pulls the bus
from the Partridge
family with his teeth.
It's the best one.
Hey, Ted, get in...
- We live alone.
- Yay.
Well, I win.
You need to give my
friend your phone number.
Wow, I really didn't think Lou
Ferrigno could pull that bus.
Are you sure this is live?
It looks pretty old.
Yeah, that's 'cause the,
uh, TV is old.
So, I'll, uh,
call you tomorrow?
Yeah. Um, not too early.
I have church.
You were impressive, buddy.
Nice work.
All right, next challenge.
No. No next challenge. Look, this is
my first night living with Robin.
She's probably pissed I'm
spending it out with you.
This might be our last hurrah,
my little friend.
Marshall, I am gonna cook you
the best dinner of your life.
How would you like a...
one-egg omelet with
some ketchup and film?
Guess Ted's the one
who did the shopping.
Ooh, look, a microwave pizza!
Guess the microwave
was Ted's, too.
Yeah.
So were all the towels.
Turns out that everything that was
useful in this apartment was Ted's.
Everything that was a Foghat poster we
bought ironically in college was mine.
Marshall.
Yeah, baby?
I miss Ted.
Is it too soon to call him?
No, we shouldn't.
I don't want to interrupt his
first night living with Robin.
Ha, nice shooting.
You know, if we win this one it's free onion
rings at the Intergalactic Snack Shack.
What a bargain.
We only had to spend
20 bucks a game.
Admit it, you're having fun.
Maybe.
I mean, it was pretty funny when that
little girl fell over that space barrel.
Nice... We win.
Oh, walk of shame, walk of game--
what up?
Okay. Let's go one more.
- I don't know.
- You know you want to.
All right, let's do it--
I just got to call Robin real quick.
Oh, so that's what it's
gonna be like from now on?
No. Okay, okay. You call your old
lady and ask permission to have fun.
Me, I will be at the Snack Shack eating
our victory onion rings Han style.
Solo.
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey, sweetie listen,
I'm really sorry but I'm gonna be
pretty late, so don't wait up.
Oh, it's totally fine.
You do what you got to do.
Thanks. You're the best.
I love you.
I love you, too. Bye.
Hey, sorry about that.
Thanks for holding.
Um, so if you could go ahead and cancel
my subscription to Guns and Ammo,
that would be great.
No, it's a great magazine.
Really great.
They've printed
three of my letters.
It's just that my
boyfriend is moving in
and he kind of doesn't approve
of the whole gun thing.
A free hand grenade phone?
You know what?
Let me give you my work address.
I did it, baby!
I got beer. I got food.
We don't need Ted anymore.
I am the provider of
this apartment now,
and I have provided!
"Provode"? Provided.
Anyway, I got us
everything we need.
Could you toss me
the toilet paper?
Be right back, baby. Sit tight.
Hey, I got to admit, um...
I didn't think I would, but, uh...
I had a really
good time tonight.
You're a good friend, Barney.
Hey, man, why don't you, uh...
why don't you tell me
where my truck is.
No, I don't think so.
Where's my truck?!
Do you know why I haven't given you
any of your possessions back yet?
Uh, because you're Admiral Jerk
of the British Royal Douchery?
Because you don't
want them back.
You could've left at any time tonight,
but you didn't, Ted.
Why is that?
Because I didn't want to go back
to Robin's without my stuff.
False. You know what I think?
I think you spent one day with
her and it already sucked.
I think you didn't like being there,
she didn't like having you there
and you both realized that
you made a huge mistake.
And that's why you spent your
first night living with Robin
out playing laser tag with me.
And that's why
three seconds ago
you didn't call it "my place"
or "our place" or "home,"
you called it "Robin's."
You know what?
You can keep my stuff.
- Hey.
- Hey, did you get the truck back?
No.
Why not? What happened?
Oh, he pissed me off so much,
I left.
Anyway, I just wanted to come back here,
space out and watch a movie.
Do you anything that
wasn't made by John Woo?
Why, do you?
You know, forget the movie.
I just want to sit.
What?
It's just I eat at that table.
Fine, I'll take my shoes off.
You know, why don't you just
throw me down in the storage space
where you have room for me.
- Ted, come on.
- No, you come on.
I had to jump through
hoops all night for Barney
and then it took me an hour
to get home because his place
is so far away from the bar.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
I know where Barney
put my truck.
Let's go back to my place.
I bet you my place is closer.
Here we are.
You live in the loading
dock behind the bar?
I don't live here, baby.
This is just my ride.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not getting into any van,
I've seen Silence of the Lambs.
Oh, my God. We're drinking champagne
in the back of a moving van.
Why, yes, Sara. Yes, we are.
Those other Rockettes who
called you slow are crazy.
Oh, my God. I knew it.
You're kidnapping me.
- Help! Help!
- No, no, no, no.
I can explain.
Hello?
Enjoying the ride?
Ted? Ted, you let us out of here.
You let us out of here this instant!
This isn't Ted.
But I hear that guy's awesome.
So I took Sara home and I took
Barney to a bar near his apartment.
Apparently, that strategy
had never occurred to him.
That poor girl must've
been so confused.
Yeah.
Well, at least Barney
learned a valuable lesson.
You do not want to get scissor
kicked in the groin by a Rockette.
So, uh,
I guess we should get you unpacked.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess we should.
Lily... deep within the
Amazonian rainforest,
there is a type of tree that only grows
around the body of an existing tree.
It cannot survive
without this tree.
It is supported...
by this tree.
Lily, we are that tree.
- The inside tree or the outside tree?
- The outside tree.
- Shouldn't there be three trees?
- You and I are one tree.
Okay, look, Lily,
the point is that we grew around Ted
and without him,
we're slowly dying.
What do we do?
I think we can
marry each other.
But we also have to marry Ted.
I'll tell you right now, my Dad is
not gonna pay for that wedding.
Ted!
What are you doing here?
Robin and I aren't gonna
move in together after all.
What happened?
I thought we decided
we were ready?
I know.
How did we come to that again?
I don't remember.
We were fighting?
- It's all so blurry.
- Yeah.
The "let's move in together"
sex was pretty amazing.
I know.
I did that thing with no hands
I normally need both to do.
You know...
I'm really happy with you.
I really happy with you.
The way things are.
Maybe we shouldn't
mess with that.
I don't know that we should.
Hey... I hear the "let's not move in
together" sex is pretty incredible.
Let's go back to my place.
- Ooh, thank you.
- You're welcome.
- No, thank you.
- You'll be very happy.
Look, I know you guys are really excited
about having the place to yourself.
Until after the wedding, I mean,
if it's not too much of an imposition...
God, this feels so right.
Never leave us again.
Guys, Robin's down in the truck and
there's actually a lot of boxes,
so maybe we should...
Do we have time for this?
Ladies and gentlemen, I have in my
hand a copy of tonight's Top Ten list.
The category: top ten things
I would've called my truck...
It was never your truck.
...if Ted hadn't been a
jerk and given it back.
It was a rental.
Number ten, "The Winne-Bango."
Number nine,
"The Pick-Up Truck."
Number eight,
"The Ford Explore Her."
Number seven,
"The You Scream Truck."
You Scream.
Number six,
"Feels On Wheels." Hello!
Number five,
"The Ride Her Truck."
Number four, "The 18-Squeeler."
Number three, "The Esca-Laid."
Number two, "The Slam-Boney."
and... the number one thing
I would've called my truck
if Ted hadn't been a jerk
and given it back...
"The '69 Chevy."
Sorry.

It took me a while to figure out
but the key to understanding
your Uncle Barney is this.
When times are hard,
it's impossible to keep him around.
Like when your aunt Lily
and Uncle Marshall were broken up.
Hey. What are you guys talking about?
- Lily.
- I got to go.
But when times are good,
it's impossible to get rid of him.
What are you guys doing?
We just finished planning
Marshall's bachelor party.
Good, you haven't started yet.
Let's talk logistics.
Now, have you laid out
ground rules with Lily?
Where you are or aren't allowed
to touch or be touched?
Show me on Ted.
Actually, we're, uh, we're thinking
of skipping the strippers.
You... you want to have a party
without strippers.
This was the worse thing
I could have said.
You see, uncle Barney loved
cooking up bachelor parties.
And it was always the same recipe.
You start with a slightly
cramped hotel suite.
Arrange the chairs in a circle...
Fill them with your closest friends.
Turn the heat up to about 90.
Pump in a metric ton of cigar smoke.
And then, right in the middle
of the room, you throw in a girl.
But not a beautiful girl--
no, if this girl was ever beautiful,
it was two kids,
three tattoos and one pesky
substance abuse problem ago.
Which one of you is Stuart?
Please, I really don't want to do this.
Shut up, put in your mouth guard.
Then she proceeds to do things
that demean the groom,
herself and really,
the entire human race.
Disgusting.
Ah, horrifying.
- Classic.
- Oh, please, please, no, no.
I don't want anything like that
happening to me.
Stuart's still trying
to forget that night.
It's my bachelor party.
We're not having strippers.
Oh, he thinks he has a sain it.
So, strippers it is!
Now, just, uh, tell me where we're going
to be and I'll make some calls.
I think I can get
the fourth one for free.
Quick question.
Prosthetic arm. Deal breaker?
- Barney, there is...
- Before you say no, it has attachments.

Look, I know you have some stuff planned
for Marshall's bachelor party,
- but he really doesn't want strippers.
- Yes, he does.
- Uh, well, he told me he doesn't.
- Uh, well, he told me he does.
- When?
- Every minute of every day
as his inner animal thrashes against the
cage of his own puritanical upbringing.
Or do you guys not like naked girls.
Um, we love naked girls.
They're one of the best things
in the world.
It goes... naked girls, democracy,
the scene in Every Which Way But Loose
where the monkey gives a guy the finger.
- We just don't like your naked girls.
- What, my girls aren't hot enough?
I mean, all right, fine, the stripper at
Stuart's bachelor party was a 15.
- She was 15?
- No, a 15. Like in blackjack.
As in, not sure whether you'd hit it?
- Exactly.
- Nice.
This is important to Marshall.
So, promise me, no strippers.
All right, I promise.
- I'm serious.
- So am I. No strippers.
Now say it without winking.
No strippers.
- You just winked.
- No I didn't.
So, when the day arrived, we all climbed
into a rented Escalade and set out.
Now, every bachelor party is usually
made up of the same stock characters.
You've got the groom...
the best man...
- the guy who speaks only in clichés...
- Dead man walking!
...the guy who disappears
at the beginning of the night
and doesn't show up again until the end.
All right, who's up for a little
blackjack before we check in.
- No, no, no.
- None for me.
See you guys back at the room, then.
And, of course, well... Barney.
Every bachelor party has a Barney.
Oh, what's this?
This car has a DVD player?
You mean,
we could have been watching
these pornos the whole time?
- Yeah.
- This one's in HD.
This one's in H-double-D.
Oh!
That same night, aunt Lily
was having a wedding shower.
And Robin showed up gift in hand.
Funny story about that gift.
Hey, Barney, check out
what I got Lily for her shower.
It's kind of racy.
Think you can handle it?
Uh, I've been in a ten-way.
So, yeah.
- It's kind of see-through.
- Whoa, ho ho!
You weren't kidding! You know
when you should give that to her?
1850.
Robin, it's her bridal shower!
All her friends are gonna be there,
they're going to be drinking.
You need to get her something daring,
something outrageous.
Well, what do you think
I should get her?
There's a store on Eighth Avenue
that specializes in--
how to put this delicately?--
uh, battery-powered, adult-
recreational fake penises.
And so Aunt Robin went
to a store on Eighth Avenue,
and a battery-powered,
adult-recreational...
Well, it was something inappropriate.
And we're back in.
Robin!
I'm so glad you're here.
Come in, I want you to meet everybody.
Robin, this is my Grandma Lois
and my Aunt Florence.
Oh, lovely to meet you, dear.
They put this whole party together.
It's different from what I expected,
but lovely.
Lovely.
And oh, look, there are little kids here!
Yeah, my cousins.
Listen, I, uh, I forgot something
somewhere so I'm going to just go...
Robin, this is my mom, Janice.
Oh, honey.
I'm so glad to finally meet you.
Me too.
I, I've heard so much about you.
Me, too. Oh, here.
Let me take your gift.
Can I guess what it is?
Is it a, a, a mini food processor?
- No.
- No? Oh.
Oh, give me a hint.
What color is it?
Black.
Well, I guess I'm just going
to have to wait and see!
- Oh, great.
- Robin...
- this is my Cousin Margaret.
- Oh, finally, someone our own age!
Wait, do I introduce you as
"Cousin Margaret" or "Sister Margaret?"
Well, I'm not officially confirmed
as a nun until next month
and I don't want to tick off the Big Guy,
so let's stick with "Cousin" for now.
God's watching.
Excellent!
Man, they spent a lot of money
on this porno.
Whoa-- Morgan Freeman?
Man, that guy's in everything.
Aw, man, I grabbed
the wrong Deep Impact!
No, leave it in, it's a good movie.
- But, dude, there's no sex in it.
- Yeah, just like marriage. Huh? Right?
Oh, oh, hey, check this out!
Don't ask how,
but I procured for us five loco-bueno,
hand-rolled, highly illegal Cubans.
Seriously, you could go to jail
for smoking these things.
Marriage is like jail!
Right, fellas?!
But at least in jail,
you get to have sex!
But we're not lighting these babies up,
till we get to the A.C.
A.C.?
Um, Atlantic City.
Try to keep up, Brad.
We're not going to Atlantic City.
Just a second, Brad.
- Hi.
- Hi.
We're still going
to Atlantic City, right?
Oh, did I not tell you? Yeah, we
switched it. We're going to Foxwoods.
Foxwoods?
But I've got an ipperstray
waiting in tlanticaay itycay.
What the heck's in Foxwoods?
Well, we've got five third row seats
to the Popinski-Salazar rematch.
They've set aside
our very own craps table,
and I reserved a private room
for us at Connelly's,
where the five of us are going
to be sharing a 102-ounce steak
from a cow that I picked out
on the Internet.
- Yeah.
- Great. The night's ruined.
Sorry, Barney.
It was an honest mistake.
This is going to be great!
Meat, violence,
throwing money down the toilet.
America-- one;
every other country-- zero.
- Thanks, guys.
- Yeah.
- You okay, Barney?
- What can I say, Ted? You won.
Hi.
You one... sad, pathetic loser.
Boys, say hello to Treasure.
Hi, Treasure.
- I can't believe that you did this.
- I had to.
- I'm your best man.
- Ted's my best man.
You've yet to make a decision
and that's fine.
But as your best-man-to-be, it's my job
to make sure at your bachelor party
you see a woman take her clothes off while
dancing to Whitesnake's "Here I Go Again."
All right, fine, but...
let's make it fast, all right.
The fight starts in an hour
we don't want to miss it.
It's a girl taking her clothes off.
How long can it take?
It's a bit more complicated than that.
I need two grounded sockets, a large
sterile pot filled with hot water
and you all need to sign these releases.
An egg beater!
Aw, thank you, Aunt Sylvia!
I love that it's cordless.
Well, at least I got that part right.
All of these gifts are so thoughtful.
Lily?
I need you to look at me right now
and read my mind.
- Oh, my God! You're hearing me!
- Yeah!
Sorry this party's so boring.
What's up?
Do not open my gift.
See what I'm doing here?
I'm looking over at the gift,
then back at you,
and I'm shaking my head, "no."
Gift. You. No.
- Are you getting that?
- I totally got it.
Here you go.
Lily said it was your time of the month.
You're welcome.
What are you doing?
Oh, just, um... rearranging the gifts.
The pile looked a bit precarious. So...
Oh, don't worry, I'll keep an eye on it.
Great. You do that.
You're gonna make a damn good nun.
As many times as Robin told
this story over the years,
she would never quite be able
to explain the logic of her next move.
Is this a strip show or a Kiss concert?
Shh! She's starting.
Please turn off your cell phones,
pagers and sense of shame.
All right, boys. Lie back, get
comfortable, and enjoy the show.
Of course there's no way
I'm telling you about her show.
- So, let's skip ahead a little.
- Ow!
Oh my God, are you all right?
No, I am not all right, you idiot.
My ankle is broken!
- Take me to the hospital!
- Um, actually, we have tickets.
You know what?
Thanks a lot, Barney.
She told you at the beginning of the show
not to use the smoke machine
when she's on the hippity hop.
Now I'm going to have to spend the rest
of my bachelor party in a hospital.
Well, hey, maybe
we'll get to see her X-rays.
The ultimate strip show.
- X-rays. More like triple X-rays.
- Just stop.
Which exit is the hospital?
What if she doesn't make it
to the hospital?
Barney, please calm down.
Maybe we should just
take her to the desert,
bury her and wash our hands
of this whole thing!
Dude, what is the matter with you?
I'm just trying to illustrate
to Marshall that as his best man...
- You're not my best man.
- As his best man,
I would help him bury
a hooker in the desert.
- I'm not a hooker.
- And you're not my best man.
You've ruined my bachelor party.
I don't know why you wouldn't just listen
to me when I said I didn't want this.
Well, the fight started ten minutes ago.
Maybe-maybe we should listen.
Oh, Doctor, what a fight!
That knockout will be talked about
for years to come!
Anyone lucky enough to be
in the arena tonight
just witnessed boxing history
in the making!
Thank you so much, Margaret. I can't
believe you carved that crucifix yourself.
So talented.
Didn't think you could carve.
For you.
Oh. And this one's from...
- Grandma Lois.
- Oh. No, wait, darling.
Before you open this,
I-I want to say a few words.
Okay, something you need to know.
Grandma Lois thought she was giving her
granddaughter an antique sewing machine.
And we're back in.
Honey, this handy little device has been
in our family for generations.
I used it,
your great grandmother used it.
Now, her mother didn't use this one,
but she used one just like it.
Of course, back then,
they were made out of wood.
And, uh, I guess before that,
you just had to do it by hand.
- Would you pass the wine, please?
- No.
Hey, Marshall,
while we're here, you may as well
go down to the morgue and
climb into a drawer, 'cause
that's what marriage is like.
Can I get an amen?
- Is everything all right at home, Stuart?
- No.
It's broken.
Oh, damn it, this is bad.
I really can't lose this job.
My daughters are about to start school,
and my fiancé, well...
ever since he got back from Iraq,
pretty much all he does is drink.
I think about leaving him, but...
I don't want my girls growing up
without a dad like I did.
I don't want them
to know what that's like.
- So, show time?
- What is the matter with you?
Her ankle's broken.
I know for a fact that
the second half of her act
takes place largely
in a seated or supine position.
Oh, that's true.
Treasure, please,
don't worry about the show.
Uh, we'd feel bad.
What does that mean?
No. We just mean, uh,
you're off the hook.
You don't have to do it.
I don't have to do it?
Well, guess what?
I know I don't have to do it.
I do it because I am good at it.
Look, I don't need your pity.
All I want to do is give you a great show
because you're getting married!
Is that so much to ask?
Is that such a major inconvenience?!
Oh, that is wrong.
Oh, that's just so wrong.
Well, the doctor did say for her
to keep it elevated.
When I was a girl, my mother taught me
and my sister to use it.
We used to have contests
to see who could finish faster.
It was so exciting. The whole family
would gather around to watch.
And when I was a new bride,
this is what kept me buzy
all those long nights when
your grandfather was in Korea.
And speaking of your grandfather,
though I don't think he'd care to admit
this to any of his army buddies, but...
he'd have a go at it
every once in a while.
And he enjoyed it.
Oh, open it up, sweetie.
May this give for you as much joy
as it's brought me.
Grandma, um...
Wow.
Well, take it out, honey.
I want to show you how to use it.
Okay, no, no!
Don't take it out.
Lily, that's not your grandma's gift.
It's mine.
I panicked, and I switched the cards
because I was embarrassed.
Well, what is it?
It's just like the one Miranda gave
to Charlotte on Sex and the City.
Oh, I love that show.
I always watch it on TBS.
Oh, you would.
You're such a Samantha!
Oh, I'm a Carrie!
You're a Samantha!
And then the night became
a whole new kind of uncomfortable.
- So where do I get one of these?
- Mom!
Man, what a show, huh?
She did some disgusting stuff.
Really sticks with you.
I may be done eating.
Me, too.
I mean, like, forever.
Me, too.
I miss my wife.
Hey, let's go around the table
and say what our favorite part was.
Mine was that thing with the typewriter.
I mean, she made some
spelling mistakes, but still.
Ooh, and you guys were all,
"Barney, put out the cigar!
It's a non-smoking room!" And I was all,
"Hell, no, this is a Cuban!"
Of course, eventually,
I did put it out.
Did I put it out?
I put it out.
Did I put it out?
I put it out.
Did I put it out?
It was a small fire, not even big enough
to force an evacuation of the hotel,
but definitely big enough
to get us kicked out,
and bring Marshall's
bachelor party to an early end.
Is that...?
It is.
Hey, guys.
How was the fight?
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
What happened to the bachelor party?
We missed the fight, dinner was ruined,
we spent half the night in the hospital,
and got kicked out of the hotel.
- What do you think happened?
- Barney. Barney.
Hey, I was just trying
to be a good best man.
You know what a best man does, Barney?
He does what the groom wants.
But all you ever think about is
what you want, what's best for you.
Best man?
I'm not even sure I'm inviting you
to the wedding at this point.
You don't mean that.
Why should I invite you?
You don't even want us to get married.
That's not true.
Lily, don't.
What?
I'm sorry, Barney.
It happened last summer
when we were broken up.
Hey, what are you guys talking about?
- Lily.
- Ah, I got to go.
Newark Airport, please.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Barney, what are you doing here?
I can't believe it's really you.
Come in, have a seat.
Do you want some tea?
I know the apartment's small,
but I don't need much space.
Let me show you some of my paintings.
I think it's some of my best work ever.
Just stop it.
Lily, you have to come home.
You and Marshall belong together.
The two of you
have something that most people search
their whole lives for and never find.
I know you love him, and if you knew
what he was going through right now,
you wouldn't be here
for one more second.
I bought you a ticket home.
Marshall is one
of the best people I know,
and it won't be long until
someone else realizes that,
and you'll lose him forever.
I can't stand the thought
of that happening,
and I cannot keep stealing
chicks from him forever.
Never, ever tell anyone I was here.
I will deny it tooth and nail.
This trip never happened.
Hey, if you had three hours to kill
before your flight, what would you do--
Alcatraz or Fisherman's Wharf?
You really did that?
Marshall, I think Barney's
your best man.
Yeah.
Yes, he is.
See, Lily?
This is why I didn't...
- Really?
- Really.
Real...
In your face, loser!
Take it easy, all right.
Ted's still my best man, too.
You guys are co-best men.
Right.
Yes, we're both best man.
No, um, seriously.
You guys are co-best men.
Of course.
I can't believe you got me this.
Oh, I only did it as a joke.
I can return it for you you want.
Oh, no, it's okay. You don't have
to go all the way back down there.
- I'll, I'll just throw it away.
- Well, I mean,
if you were going to throw it away,
maybe I'll take it
in case I get invited
to another wedding shower.
- It's a great gag gift.
- Yeah, it's really funny.
You know who would get a kick out of it?
Marshall.
So, so maybe I'll just hold on to it.
I would be embarrassed if Marshall
found out that I bought it for you,
- so I'd better just take it.
- Robin, leave it.

...some weird stuff started happening.
Why does my stomach hurt?
I'm sorry, baby.
I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today.
Oh, baby, you know
we're lactose-intolerant.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you suggesting that
when one of you feels something,
- the other feels it, too?
- Oh, God, you guys are so codependent.
- No, we're not.
- Oh, really?
What about the other day?
- Oh, I need to get some eggs.
- Oh, I'll come with you.
Just because we like spending time
together doesn't mean we're codependent.
Really?
Then whatever happened to your plan
of spending the last two weeks
before your wedding sleeping apart?
Okay, we decided not
to do that because of...
Logistics.
- Wedding logistics.
- Frickin' logistics, man.
They mess everything up.
You didn't do it
because you couldn't do it.
- Sure we could.
- Then why don't you?
You can stay with me.
It would make our wedding
night more special.
- Okay, let's do it.
- Done.
- I'm gonna go grab a beer.
- I'll come with you.
No. I'll stay.

Okay, I know.
You know? I got to go.
Good-bye.
My mom's driving me cra....
God, you guys are covered in sauce.
We'll get to that.
Me first.
My mom is driving me crazy
about the wedding music.
The woman takes one cruise
to Jamaica, and suddenly, it's
"not a party without steel drums."
Doesn't everybody know
you're not supposed to stress out
a bride right before her wedding?!
Okay, sauce, go.
- Long story. I'll tell you later.
- Yeah.
It's a dirty story, isn't it?
You guys went out to dinner,
did it in the kitchen and got caught.
Scherbatsky reeks of
someone who likes to get caught.
Okay, now I have to wash up
for two reasons.
Oh, you didn't.
That's right.
So you and Lily really think
you can spend two weeks apart?
You know what, Barney?
Lily and I are a lot less chees
than you make us out to be.
Marshmallow, don't forget
to pack my night-night tape.
Night-night tape?
Did you make a tape of
you saying "night-night" to her?
- No.
- He doesn't say it. He sings it.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Why don't you kiss?
I love it when two chicks make out.
Damn it.
Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.
- What's on there?
- Ooh, lots of stuff.
Kitchen Aide Artisan Series
tilt-head stand mixer...
Retail price $319.99.
What else?
Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.
Ah, $549.99.
A little greedy, don't you think?
- Did you memorize our registry?
- No, I'm training.
- Training? For what?
- I'm glad you asked.
Ted, Robin, get in here!
You guys know how it's hard to be
friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?
Yes, it's hard to be friends with you.
Go on.
Well, this isn't going
to make it any easier.
I am going to be on...
The Price Is Right.
- No way!
- What?!
Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields
is going to call out my name,
- and I will come on down.
- Whoa, that is so awesome.
Barney, I didn't know you were
such a fan of The Price is Right.
Are you kidding?
T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably
entertaining hour of television,
it's a microcosm of
our entire economic system--
a capitalist utopia, where consumers
are rewarded for their persistence,
market acumen and intrepid spirit.
I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right,
and I see the face of America.
And it is divine.
Plus, you know,
hot chicks on sports cars.
Then Lily headed out to Robin's
for her first night away from Marshall.
- I'm ready!
- Ta-da-da-da-da...
- Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful.
- I know! I'm beautiful!
I'm a fairy princess!
I'm too skinny for my dress!
Meanwhile, I was testing out
my best man toast on Marshall.
Here goes.
Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby,
Marshall's best man.
Strong opening, right?
That's fantastic.
When Marshall graduates
this spring, he'll be a lawyer.
But did you know that
Marshall has a criminal record?
That's right, on a road trip
up to Cape Cod,
Marshall was pulled over for driving
by himself in a car pool lane.
Oh, crap.
Oh, crap.
Are you crazy?
You cannot tell that story
at my wedding.
My entire family's gonna be there.
My little cousins, my mom, my grandma,
my grandpa the minister.
That grandpa died three years ago.
His favorite grandson
is getting married, Ted.
I think he can take a day off from
haunting the barn to make an appearance.
Whoo!
Whoo-whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
- So which one, "A" or "B"?
- What was that?
I have to decide how to run
to contestant's row when they say,
"Barney Stinson, come on down!"
Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was.
Can you do them again?
Yeah, of course.
Hey! Very funny.
Just for that, when I win all the prizes,
the only thing you guys are getting
is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.
It's $300 just to take the bust in?
Oh, please, you have to have
some sympathy for me.
I'm getting married next Saturday,
and I'm too skinny for my dress.
I lost all this weight
without even trying.
Hello?
- What happened?
- She called me a bitch and hung up.
Oh, I don't know what to do.
I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.
Pay the $300?
Lily, are you crazy?
This isn't a problem.
It's a license to eat.
Look, what have you always wanted to eat but
didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?
Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate soufflé
with a raspberry brandy sauce
topped with caramelized bananas
and hazelnut gelato.
I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.
Done!
Okay, think you're gonna be
happy with my new toast.
There's nothing sexual.
It's, uh, it's just the story of an
important moment in your relationship.
I'm all ears.
Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby,
Marshall's best man.
- Nice.
- Right? That's great.
Back when we were all freshman
and Marshall and Lily were just a few
short weeks into their relationship...
It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not
gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted.
We were starving.
So I'd gone out to get us some
snacks, and when I got back...
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
I know it's soon to say it,
but I'm so glad you did.
Yeah.
So here's what you want to talk
about in front of my entire family:
drinking, having a girl in my room,
eating junk food.
Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would
be mad at you for eating junk food?
Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's
not important.
Also, so Lily's never heard
that story before.
How's she going to react when she finds out
the first time I said "I love you" to her,
I was actually saying it to you
and a bag of Funyuns?
But who cares? You did love her.
And you still do.
And you're totally over Funyuns,
so it's not weird.
- Hey, Lil.
- Hey.
Hey? That's it?
What are you talking about?
Well, you guys have been spending
the last few nights apart.
I figured there'd be a lot of giggling,
crying, jumping up and down,
and then whatever Lily would do.
Now, one thing I remember about
the bar menu at McClaren's
is that there were no fewer than
11 different deep-fried appetizers.
That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.
Check it out.
Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will,
that this is the $1 space
on The Price Is Right wheel.
Ready?
Oh, wow, that was pretty close.
Close?
Close?! It's called The Price Is Right,
not The Price Is Close!
Oh, man, this is bad.
If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't
get into the Showcase Showdown,
everything's ruined!
It's all ruined!
What is ruined?
Why, why is this such a big deal?
Okay, guys... sit down,
I've got to tell you something.
The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right
is because I've decided that it's time
for me to meet my real father.
- Your father?
- That's right.
My father... is Bob Barker.
- Your dad... is Bob Barker?
- That's right.
The host of The Price Is Right,
Bob Barker?
That's Pops.
- Barney?
- Yes, Robin?
Why in the world do you think
Bob Barker is your father?
Uh, because my mother told me
he was, that's why.
Mom, who's my dad?
All the other kids at school
know who their dad is.
- Who's mine?
- Oh, I don't know.
That guy.
Look, Dad, I got straight A's!
Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going
as for Halloween?
Want to play some catch, Pop?
So now I'm gonna go to L.A.,
be on the show,
win the Showcase Showdown,
make him proud of me,
and then tell him who I am.
You're gonna tell Bob Barker that
you're his son on national television?
Why is this so hard for you
people to believe?
Drop the popper!
Lily has to gain five pounds
in a week and a half,
and it is my job to help her get there.
This is the best wedding diet ever.
- I lost a pound.
- That is impossible.
You ate McDonald's
every meal for three days.
I knew that Super Size
Me guy was full of it.
Well, it must be the wedding stress.
We just got to up the intake.
Lily Aldrin, drop and give me
20 bites of fudge!
Okay?
Don't nibble at it.
Attack it!
Come on, Lily.
You can do better than that!
I can't.
Well, eat faster, before
your body figures out it's full.
I'm trying.
Oh, are you gonna cry?
You gonna cry?
Skinny little baby's gonna cry?
- Well, eat, damn it, eat!
- Okay!
Hey, so I think I figured out how to do
your toast in a completely appropriate way.
- Finally.
- Yeah.
Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby,
Marshall's best man.
- Still strong, right?
- Great, yeah.
I'd like to share with you all a story
about the momentous evening last fall
when Marshall and Lily got back together.
Afterward, we stayed up
till 10:00 at night,
- doing shots of chocolate milk.
- Man, I'm well nourished right now!
Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.
Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us
you don't need alcohol to have fun.
Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents
for teaching me good values.
Now, I wasn't supposed
to hear this next part,
but Marshall leaned over
to Lily and whispered.
You know what I'd like
to do to you right now?
I'd like to hold your hand.
I'd like to hold your hand so hard
that you're not able
to shake hands for a week.
Are you just going to talk about holding
my hand or are you going to hold it?
Then a little later, Robin caught them...
Oh, um... ...holding hands.
It was a lovely and responsible night.
To Marshall and Lily.
That's the worst toast
I've ever heard, dude.
- It's totally boring.
- Exactly.
It's impossible to write a good toast
with you censoring me, man.
I give up.
I'm just going to read that thing
about Jesus and the footprints.
I give up, too.
I don't care if my dress doesn't fit.
I can't eat anymore.
I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.
I know.
And so, Lily and I were
both about to give up,
but as you can all see,
Lily does look beautiful in that dress,
and here I am giving a toast.
You know, all this time, I'd been
wracking my brain trying to
pick out the perfect moment to capture
Lily and Marshall as a couple.
But then I realized the perfect
moment wasn't
some needle lost in the haystack
of their ten years together.
The perfect Lily and Marshall
moment happened two nights ago.
Marshall, what are you doing?
Going to the bathroom.
In the hall?
Sleepwalking?
You're wide awake.
- Robbing us?
- Dude.
Turns out, all week long he'd been
sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd,
to meet Lily.
- God, I missed you.
- I can't sleep without you.
Hey, baby?
- Would you be the big spoon for a while?
- Sure, baby.
- How's the weight gaining going?
- Ugh, terribly.
I'm too stressed out without you around.
Well, I'm here now.
And so Lily and Marshall failed in
their experiment with apartness,
but they succeeded
in getting Lily into her dress.
You know, there really are a million things
I could tell you about Lily and Marshall,
but really, the only thing
you need to know is
that ten years into their relationship,
they still couldn't spend
a single night apart.
May they never have to again.
To Lily and Marshall.
To Lily and Marshall.
Now, kids, the story of Lily and
Marshall's wedding is a good one.
No matter how perfectly you plan your...
You know, wait a second, guys.
I'll get to that.
First, I've got to tell you
what happened with Barney.
Rich, what is the name
of our next participant?
- Bob, it's Barney Stinson!
- Come on down!
You're the next contestant
on The Price Is Right.
Nooo. Oh, my God!
Working his way out.
High-five here, high-five there.
- A big old hug here.
- Oh, my God!
Yeah, I know, the camera loves me.
Welcome to contestant's row, Barney.
Nice suit.
- Thanks, Da... Bob.
- Here is the next item up for bid!
Bob, the stylish his-and-her watches
feature an 18k gold bezel and crown
and stainless steel bands.
And Barney, what do you bid on that?
Um... Wrong.
Wrong.
Wrong.
Wrong.
Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since
you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob.
- $1,350 for Barney.
- So, was it $1,350?
I don't know.
- Was it?
- Oh, my God!
Happy wedding.
Barney, you won that camcorder
in just one second!
That is impressive.
I mean impressive.
Thank you, Bob.
Now, to win the computer,
you're going to have to bid again,
and again I will say higher or lower.
And let's show the audience
the price of the computer,
and audience, please,
do not try to help us.
And the clock will start
with your first bid.
- $1 billion.
- Lower.
So, I brought some photos
that I thought you might like to see.
- This is me on my first birthday.
- Yes, Barney.
- This is...
- What are you doing?
Uh, spending some quality
time with my dad.
That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving.
You have only about 16 seconds.
Keep bidding.
- No, no, I want you to see this. This is great.
- Keep bidding.
This is me at my graduation.
I know, the hair.
That, no, that's nice.
That's nice.
You have only five, four,
three, two, one...
- $999.
- Nine...
Barney, you got it exactly right!
- Happy wedding again!
- Oh, my...
I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel
is the only weak part of my game.
I'm sure you'll do just fine, son.
Did you just...
- I'm ready, Bob.
- Do it! Do it! Here we go!
He's looking for the dollar.
- It's going around, and around...
- Oh, no, you spun it too hard.
No, he didn't spin it hard enough.
Here it comes, Barney.
You got it!
You won...
But Barney...
Barney, you're not through.
You've won $1,000.
You've won a place in the showcase.
You are doing splendidly so far.
Thank you, would you, would
you say you're proud of me?
Sure.
That was kind of a weird moment.
Very well, Barney, you have seen
the first showcase.
Do you want to bid on it
or do you want to pass it to Millie?
Please, no car and an above-ground spa?
Pass.
Millie, he has passed this showcase
to you. What do you bid on it?
- $17,640.
- $17,640.
Overbid!
Now, let's see Showcase #2.
Barney, your showcase
begins with a mystery.
Oh, I love this.
I can't believe how excited I am right now.
Barney, you have seen your showcase.
What do you bid on it?
Please, please.
Please.
Let me.
1-8-4-2-1.
I don't even know what we're going to do
with a dune buggy, but I want it!
And the actual retail price
of your showcase is...
- $14,628.
- $14,628. Millie, you are over.
Too bad.
Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase.
And the actual retail price of Barney's
showcase is... $18,421 exactly right!
- You win both showcases, Barney.
- Oh, my God!
Bob Barker, reminding you,
help control the pet...
Before, before we wrap up the show, there's
just something I want to say to you.
Congratulations on 35 wonderful
years hosting The Price Is Right.
Well, thank you, Barney.
Thank you...
Have your pets spayed or neutered.
Why didn't you tell him?
Well, it's just...
If you lived your whole life
thinking one thing,
it would be pretty devastating
to find out that wasn't true.
I just don't think Bob
could have handled it.
- Bob. Yeah.
- Probably a good choice.
Anyway, on the bright side.
Happy wedding again!
And that's the story of how
Uncle Barney gave
Lily and Marshall a dune buggy
for their wedding.
Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks,
I would sing you your night-night song.
Night-night, Lily
Night-night, Lily
It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly,
little Lily Time to rest your little head
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
- Come on, Ted.
- No, it's weird.
You promised.

In May of 2007,
Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married
at the historic Van Smoot
House in upstate New York.
Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.
Yeah. It's just how
I always pictured it.
Well, that was a load of crap.
You see, kids, when you get married,
you learn a hard lesson.
The wedding you set out to have is
almost never the wedding you end up with.
So, we've decided on a small,
outdoor wedding,
just family and close friends.
No more than 25 people
in a beautiful
garden somewhere,
maybe an acoustic
guitar playing
while we walk down the aisle.
And maybe you already know someone
who went down to the courthouse
and registered as an officiant
so that he or she-- he--
could perform the ceremony.
But you hate marriage.
Why do you want to perform the ceremony?
Because it subtly implants in
the mind of every woman there
that when I ask a question,
you say, "I do."
Yeah.
The closer you get
to the big day,
the more concessions you make.
Great. Now my mom's making
me invite the Lessners.
This puts our numbers
in the triple digits.
Wow. I guess sometimes,
Lessner is more... ner.
You know how like
sometimes less is more.
Yeah. This is one of
those times, sweetie?
You know what? That's okay.
It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.
So it's not going to be an
outdoor wedding anymore.
Marshall's dad is convinced if we
have an outdoor wedding in New York,
he's going to get mugged,
so it's going to be inside now.
It'll be great. We're still going
to have our acoustic guitar player.
So now,
instead of an acoustic guitar,
we're having a harp player.
Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and...
that guy's daughter plays the harp.
Is she hot? I'd love to be able to
cross "harp player" off my list.
How long is this list?
Dude, I'm not gonna count
how many pages the list is.
I'm not crass.
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
She's pregnant.
Sweet! I can cross
off two things.

And the day arrives for Lily and
Marshall's very big indoor wedding...
with a harp.
Hi, Lily.
Wow. Andrea.
You really are pregnant.
Yeah.
How do you play the harp
with your belly so...?
Oh, I don't really--
I can only reach about half the strings.
You only play half the harp?
Yeah.
Oh, no. Uh, okay.
Lily, I will take care of this.
Um, I'll just pluck the other half.
Is it hard to learn?
I've been studying
the harp for 12 years.
Yeah, but I'm a fast learner.
You ever hear of "Guitar Hero"?
Learned that in a day.
Is there a "Harp Hero"?
Robin, it's fine.
So, so, when are you due?
Tuesday.
Wow, that's soon.
Last Tuesday.
Holy crap, we have to fire her.
She's gonna drop a shorty in
the middle of your ceremony.
Robin, I'm not going
to freak myself out.
I hate those women who say,
"Oh, my wedding
has to be perfect."
Things go wrong. Sometimes the
deejay screws up your playlist.
Sometimes you slip on placenta
during the recessional.
Can I grab a scotch
and soda real quick?
No. I'm not allowed to serve
anything until the reception.
Wow. You just cost
yourself a big tip, buddy.
I'm not allowed to
accept tips, buddy.
You allowed to
accept criticism?
You, sir, are an ass... buddy.
Hey, you want to know what line
doesn't work on a harp player?
"Hey, baby, want to pluck?"
Really? That didn't work.
Not even a little.
Hey! Who's Bill?
Bill?
Yeah. This guy came
up to me at the bar.
Can I ask you something?
Where in the ceremony is the place
where they ask if anyone objects?
Uh... Don't think
they do that anymore.
Oh, so when do you think
someone should do it?
Just wait for a lull or what?
Oh, no.
Did he look like a guy who tried
to be an umpire but failed?
He kind of did.
That's Scooter.
Your high school
boyfriend, Scooter?
His real name is Bill.
My mom must have invited him.
Why? Why would she do that?
Our families are really close.
But my ex-boyfriend?
Come on, Mom.
I didn't invite that professional
squash player Dad busted you with.
Oh, I need a glass of wine.
I'll get it.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, how's Marshall doing?
He's great.
He's about to get his hair cut.
Oh. I'm worried my cousin's
going to cut it too short.
Me, too. I was up all night.
Hello, Lily.
Hey, Bill.
Hey, Barney.
Scooter, what are
you doing here?
It's not "Scooter" anymore.
It's Bill.
A lot of things have
changed about me, Lily,
but one hasn't.
I still love you.
And I came here
to win you back.
You're really cute.
Oh, no. Really?
Lily, I-I know it's crazy,
but I love you,
and if you can
look me in the eye
and tell me that you
want to marry Marshall,
I will leave right now and
be out of your life forever.
I want...
I want...
Scooter!
I need a glass of wine.
And I need you to
get out of my face.
It's for the bride, so...
White or red?
White.
And, uh...
she'd also like a scotch and soda.
You got it.
She'd also like a bowl
of smoked almonds.
I don't have any,
but I guess I could run out
to the corner and get some.
Well, it's only the biggest
day of her life, so...
Let the games begin.
Here. Can't stay.
Got to try something.
Maybe my words won't
change your mind,
but maybe the words
of a poet will.
I read from "November Rain."
By W. Axl Rose.
That is a good song.
Barney said you needed me to
bounce some guy named Scooter?
What's up with Bill?
That's Scooter.
I'm on it.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Can I have your phone number?
No.
It's for the bride.
Oh. Hold on.
Let me go get a pen.
The bride wants
you to walk slower.
Oh, wow.
Oh. Robin...
My makeup looks
perfect right now,
and I'm about to cry.
Do something.
I have hairy nipples.
Really?
No, but it worked, didn't it?
Hey. Funny story.
I tackled this guy I
thought was Scooter.
Turns out it was
your photographer.
Don't worry. I got this sweet
camera phone, so we're covered.
There's a photographer?
Oh, my God.
- Okay, I just have to call...
- Robin, stop. Stop.
It's okay.
I am not gonna let
anything get to me today.
I just got a call from the florist.
The flowers won't be here
till halfway through
the ceremony.
I'm okay.
I hate to bother you, but... I think
I found your veil in the parking lot.
I'm fine.
Just FYI: my water broke.
But I can probably...
...make it through.
Totally cool.
Oh, no.
Lily, I think I forgot
your bridal panties.
I-I thought I had them.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, it's okay,
I'll just wear the ones I have on.
Are you sure?
I'm marrying Marshall today.
So it doesn't even matter that
I'm gonna walk down the aisle
without a veil in a room
that has no flowers
to the music of half a harp
played by a woman who's crowning,
as my high school boyfriend
reads Guns N' Roses lyrics.
But that's okay,
because there's no photographer there
to take any pictures of it anyway.
Lily, are you okay?
What do you think?!
Of course I'm not okay!
Everything that could possibly
go wrong at my wedding has!
It's ruined!
What happened to "I don't
want a perfect wedding"?
Oh, grow up, Robin!
Of course I want a perfect wedding!
Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not
to care about the wedding, but...
I do. I... I'm supposed to
feel like a princess today.
And you will.
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
Why don't we go outside? I have
something that'll make you feel better.
What could you have that could
possibly make me feel better?
God, I hope Marshall's having
a better day than I'm having.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
Well, it's not too short.
My hair! Look at my hair!
She ruined my hair!
I look like one of
the Backstreet Boys!
You totally do.
And not even the good
Backstreet Boys,
the older, lame dance move,
comeback tour Backstreet Boys.
The good Backstreet Boys?
Guys! Guys!
What am I gonna do?!
What-what the hell
happened to you?
Lily's cousin is
in beauty school,
and Lily didn't want
her to do her hair,
so she said she could do mine.
So, um,
just not-not too short, okay?
Oh, no,
we don't even have to cut it at all.
Could just give it some style.
Oh, okay, yeah, that's great.
'Cause, um, when it gets too short,
it starts to look weird.
And I don't want to look weird
when I'm up there, you know.
Ooh, I could give you
some cool guy tips.
I don't think I need
advice on how to be cool,
but yeah, great,
lay that on me.
I can't get married like this!
There's no way!
Ah, let me see what I can do.
What? What can you do?
I have a superpower.
Lily is gonna kill me!
Look at me!
She's not gonna want
to marry me like this.
That's crazy.
Of course she will.
Would you marry me?
No. But not because of the hair.
It's because I have a rule:
never marry anyone you've
had a farting contest with.
Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily
and I shouldn't even get married?
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?
It's for the bride.
One, the bride would...
like all of this tension
out of my shoulders.
And she would like, let's say,
you in the inappropriately
short dress to rub them.
Two...
What was two?
Okay, we have a
bit of a situation.
Let's not panic.
Let's just find a solution.
Dude, you shaved
your freakin' head.
Yeah, yeah, but it's good.
I ought to shave it all off.
What a great solution.
Just be bald 'cause
it's cool, right?
Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan,
Britney Spears...
Oh, God, what did I do?!
How could you let
me shave my head?!
- What?!
- You're the worst best man ever!
I hate you!
I'm not going out there!
I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.
I'm gonna go find that money
under the rock by the tree
and go live with the guys on
the beach in Zihautanejo.
Dude, those guys are criminals.
Only Red Andy was
falsely accused.
Ted, you're my best man!
You got to do something!
Okay, all right, come here.
Just breathe, breathe, all right?
Don't worry. Don't worry.
- I'll just... I'll take these.
- No!
- Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?
- Yes.
Yes, we're, we're having a little
bit of a problem back there.
Um, and I was wondering
if you could help us out.
Yeah.
Marshall accidentally
shaved part of his head.
- Oh, no!
- Yeah.
Yeah, so here's what
I was thinking.
What if I found something
to cover up the bald area?
Yeah, that would probably work,
but with what?
That's a tough one.
Maybe a wig of some
sort or a, um...
toupee.
Something that matches
his hair color,
which is, which is kind of the same
color as the top of your hair.
Mm, yeah.
Does anyone here wear a toupee?
Shouldn't be hard to find out.
Most of them are pretty bad.
That is true. That is true.
We just need to find
someone who wears a toupee
that is the same color
as Marshall's and your hair.
Boy, that's a
pretty tall order.
Really?
You can't think of any
place in the general area
where there might be a toupee of
the kind I'm describing to you?
No, not off the top of my...
No. Can't.
Let me come at this from a different
angle. I got $50 in my pocket
- which is probably a lot more...
- The bride needs this.
Actually, I think
it kinda works.
It totally does.
Barney?
To be honest, I'm, uh,
I'm jealous I don't
get to wear it.
Okay, problem solved.
Crisis averted.
Let's get me married.
It looks terrible, doesn't it?
It kinda looks like fur,
which gives you the appearance
of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.
- Oh, you know...
- In a bad way.
Hey. Cool hair, bro.
What happened to your shirt?
I got sauce on it when
I tackled the caterer.
You gonna put another shirt on?
No, I'm good.
Hey, you guys seen Scooter?
What? What? Scooter's here?
That guy's at my wedding?
Not for long, bro.
Not for long.
Okay, you know what?
I need some air.
I think we should go
for a walk, okay?
It would cover up the problem.
It's festive
and it celebrates the heritage
of this great nation.
Okay, unless you actually
have one in your car,
stop suggesting authentic
Native American headdress.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God!
Marshall...
Lily, you're not
supposed to see me.
Holy crap, I don't think
anyone's supposed to see you.
What happened?
Did Amy do this to you?
Just the frosted tips.
I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby.
I've ruined the whole wedding,
haven't I?
Oh, no,
you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie.
It was already ruined.
There's no flowers,
no photographer.
Oh, and Scooter's here,
by the way.
Yeah, I know. I heard.
My veil got thrashed,
the harp player is in labor,
and I'm not wearing
my wedding underwear.
What? No "Property of
Marshall" across the back?
How are people going to
know whose butt that is?
What happened?
Remember the wedding we wanted,
the intimate outdoor ceremony?
I wish we could
have that wedding.
So do it.
What?
Get married now.
Right here.
Look, it's outside like
you always wanted.
Intimate, close friends.
There's no guitar,
but it's pretty close.
Barney can officiate.
Yes. Yes, I can.
Uh, excuse me, guys.
You all dropped something:
your jaws--
because Barney Stinson is about
to aid and abet a marriage.
Could we even do that? I mean,
what about all those people in there?
Do that one, too.
And then when everything goes wrong,
you won't care because you already
had the real wedding out here.
What do you think, baby?
I love it.
Me, too.
Let's do it.
Let's get married before we get married.
Great.
Wait, hold on.
Excuse me, sir.
Could we borrow your hat?
Okay.
Thank you.
Hat.
We thought of authentic
Native American headdress
before we thought of hat.
Thank you all for coming.
For those of you
who don't know me...
I'm not the biggest
believer in marriage.
But... you two are so great together,
you know?
It's like you were, uh,
made for each other.
- He's gonna cry.
- No, I'm not.
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,
I'm not, I'm not.
Lily and Marshall...
when everyone sees you, they...
see true love.
It's the best love...
Can we just, um,
move on to the rings or something?
Oh, no.
I don't have my vows.
I don't have mine either.
You don't need your vows.
Just say why you love each other.
Okay, I'll go first.
Lily,
there are a million
reasons why I love you.
You make me laugh
and you take care of
me when I'm sick.
You're sweet, caring and you even
created an egg dish and named it after me.
She puts a little Italian dressing in
scrambled eggs before she cooks them.
It's called "Eggs Marshall,"
and it's awesome.
But the main reason
that I love you is
that you're my
best friend, Lily.
You're, uh...
you're the best friend I ever had.
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- No problem.
It's totally okay.
My turn.
Oh, thank you.
Marshall, I love you
because you're funny
and you make me feel loved
and you make me feel safe
and for our anniversary you
gave me a sweatshirt that says,
"Lily and Marshall.
Rockin' It Since '96."
I kinda wish I was
wearing it right now
'cause it smells like you.
But the main reason I love you,
Marshall Ericksen,
is you make me happy.
You make me happy all the time.
Hey, I found your panties!
I'm good.
Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife
to have and to hold from this day forward?
- Slow down.
- I can't.
From this day forward so as
long as you both shall live?
I do.
Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to
be your husband to have and to hold... live?
I do.
Okay, then,
by the power invested in me by
the very bitter old Pakistani man
who works down at the
courthouse on Lafayette Street,
I now pronounce
you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
- Do you smoke?
- No.
Wow. First lie of marriage.
That was fast.
After that, we all went back
inside for the second wedding.
And yes,
a lot of things did go wrong,
but it didn't matter
because when I look
back on that day,
what I remember is
the first wedding;
the intimate outdoor ceremony
with just close friends
and an acoustic guitar.
How do you feel?
Tired. I got
married twice today.
So where do you want to do it for
the first time as a married couple,
nice hotel room or a
reception hall bathroom?
What do you think?
Bathroom, of course.
Please don't.
- Sorry, Ted.
- Sorry, Ted.

Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time ever
Mr. and Marshall Eriksen
and Lily Aldrin.
Does it make you kind of sad that
we don't share the same last name?
You know, in a totally evolved
21st-century kind of way,
yeah, a little.
You know what we should do?
We should come up with
a whole new last name.
Oh, that's easy--
Lily and Marshall Skywalker.
Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff.
I got it. You ready?
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Lily and Marshall Awesome.
Have you met the Awesomes?
Marshall, Lily, their son,
Totally and their daughter, Freakin'?
I love you, Mr. Awesome.

Yes, it is.
I guess starting tomorrow,

Tell people what?
Hi, Barney.

Nothing.
Oh, okay. Tell people what?
Can we talk about this later?
Absolutely. Tell people what?

- Hey. Barney Stinson.
Lovely dress.
I know, I'm sick of these things, too.
It's like the same wedding over and

You want to dance? Great,
see you out there. Tell people what?
Look, this is just not something we want

Okay.
Whoo, that was a close one.
Think he'll actually let it go?

So just forget about it until

We planned this amazing
meal with the caterers,
and we haven't
had a bite of it.
Every time we get near the food,
we get cocktail weiner blocked.
Marshall!
We haven't eaten all day.
All right,
let's run some interference.
Yeah, we'll get you back to your table.
Come on.
Oh, there you are.
My dear, you look so beautiful.
Thanks, Grammie,
but we really need to...
And you...
you look like a 1940s movie star.
And you look like a pepper-crusted
rack of lamb with mint jelly.
All right,
let's get these two back to their table.
We will see you on the floor for
the conga line later, won't we?
The answer to that one
was decided weeks earlier.
Conga line.
Oh, yes, definitely.
How about a slide show of
you guys through the years
set to Green Day's
"Time of Your Life"
and ending with your baby
photos side by side.
Oh, that's great.
Going on the list.
What list?
Horrible wedding clichés we're not going
to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.
Oh, like First Corinthians?
That Bible verse?
They do that at every wedding.
How's it go?
"Love is patient and kind.
"Love does not envy or boast.
"It is not arrogant or rude.
"Love does not insist
on it's own way.
"It is not irritable
or resentful.
"Love bears all things,
"believes all things,
"hopes all things...
"endures all things."
- Lame.
- Going on the list.
We've done it.
A wedding with zero clichés.
Wait, isn't doing it in the reception
hall bathroom kind of a cliché?
Well, okay, one cliché.
Well, technically two.
No! They cleared
our plates again!
Pepper-crusted rack of lamb,
where did you go?!
It's my wedding night.
I was supposed to have my way with you.
Well, you still have me.
Yeah...
Anyway, guys, we're kind of
in the middle of something,
so if you could go bicker or
share a tense, sexless silence
or whatever married people do
somewhere else, that'd be great.
No, Barney, this is my wedding,
and I will sit wherever
I damn well...
Are those mini quiches?
Tell the secret.
Okay, uh...
it was our anniversary,
so we went to this
restaurant Carmichael's,
which is where we went
on our first date.
Remember, the place where I stole
the blue French horn for Robin?
Oh, right, that was you.
I knew that was
somebody I knew.
What?
Dude, you were there.
That was like a big iconic
moment in all of our lives.
Maybe in your life--
I got a lot of stuff going on.
Okay, so we're sitting there
and the waiter comes over...
Champagne?
Um, we didn't order champagne.
Compliments of the house.
Wow.
Thanks.
Cheers.
And there, sitting at the bottom
of my champagne glass is...
Mini quiche.
You're a mega-douche.
Oh, that's right, they moved that
table back toward the kitchen,
because that's where they're setting
up a surprise chocolate fountain.
Oh, no, I gave it away.
So what was in the glass?
Right.
So the waiter comes up
with two glasses of Dom.
He says, "Champagne?"
"We didn't order any champagne."
"Compliments of
the house." "Wow."
You said that already!
Right. So Robin looks down,
and there at the
bottom of her glass...
Is an engagement ring.
Anything you want to say
to the bride and groom?
Don't get married.
Why don't I come back.
An engagement ring?
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Ted, you cannot do
this to me. No.
No, no, no!
That's what she said.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
Ted, you cannot do this to me.
No. No, no, no.
What are you talking about?
This. This is what I'm talking about.
What is this doing in my champagne?
Oh, God, listen...
I just got to get out of here.
That's not mine.
What?
That's not mine.
Then whose is it?
It's mine.
Janna...
will you marry me?
Yes.
Wow.
That was hilarious.
I was like... what?
Anyway.
What the hell was that?
What the hell was what?
That reaction?
I thought you were
proposing to me.
Really? Because it sounded like you
thought I was trying to set you on fire.
Ted, you know how I
feel about marriage.
Now more than ever.
I'm sorry,
were you planning on proposing tonight?
No.
Then why is this an issue?
Because even though you
don't want to get married,
I'd like to think the fact that
we've been together for a year,
and that we love each other
might get me a gentler reaction
than, "No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
"Ted, you cannot do this to me.
"No. No, no, no."
Okay, you're right, I just...
freaked out.
I don't know why.
I'm sorry.
Can we please just let it go?
No.
Hey, Stinson.
Never lie to a man about
a chocolate fountain.
So did you guys find
anything to eat?
I had four strawberries.
Was there a side of champagne
with each of the strawberries?
Yes.
Lily, you could have burped
or said the word "Yes,"
but the fact that you did both
is exactly why I married you.
Oh, look, more strawberries!
So what happened next?
- Ted, don't do this.
- No, seriously.
Where do you see
yourself in five years?
Where do you see yourself?
Honestly, in five years...
I probably want to be married.
And I probably want
to be in Argentina.
- Argentina?
- Or Tokyo, or Paris.
Look, Ted, I don't know where
I'm going to be in five years.
And I don't want to know.
I want my life to be an adventure.
We have an expiration date,
don't we?
Oh, my God.
You guys broke up.
You guys broke up.
I can't believe it.
Barney...
story's not over.
Can we please not talk about this here.
Can we go home?
Yeah, of course.
Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this.
Can we actually...
Oh, my God, it's you.
Wha... what?
You're the son of a bitch who
stole our blue French horn.
Run!
Run? Your strategy was run?
It was a perfectly good idea.
They didn't have our
credit card information.
They didn't know us from Adam.
I stand by it.
Yeah?
And how did that
work out for you?
I don't see why they had to keep
my credit card and driver's license
till we bring the horn back.
Well, come on, Ted,
can you blame them?
Look, I'm sorry about
the French horn.
I want to make this right.
So what we're going to do right now is,
we're going to run!
So... Argentina.
Argentina.
Why is this the first
I've heard of Argentina?
Mmm, American schools
suck at geography.
What would be the point in telling
you that I want to live in Argentina?
You don't want to live there.
I could want to
live in Argentina.
No, you couldn't.
I mean,
you life is here and your career.
I'm a journalist,
my career could take me anywhere,
and I hope it does.
Hey. I could be an
architect anywhere, too.
They have buildings
in Argentina.
And Paris. And even Tokyo.
I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but
he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.
So, what? You're saying you
want to move to Argentina?
Well, I always regretted not taking
a year in college to live abroad.
I just finished a
big project at work.
I got some money saved up.
If ever there were a time in my life to
do something like this, it's right now.
Let's move to Argentina.
Oh, shut up.
You're scared
I might not be kidding.
Aren't you?
Nope.
Your move, Scherbatsky.
Okay.
Let's do it--
let's move to Argentina.
No es posible!
Nobody moves to Argentina.
The Argentinean peso has dropped
two-thirds in five years,
the government is opposed
to free market reforms,
and the railroad has been a mess since
the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos.
I hooked up with an
Argentinean exchange student
in a Porta-John
outside Yankee Stadium.
Man, she was chatty.
Right? Right?
You caught the bouquet?
Barney.
The story's not over yet.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?
I don't know if I
can do this to you.
Do what?
Well, you say you want
to move to Argentina,
but you want to have kids.
Oh, right.
'Cause there are no kids there.
On Santa's map of the world,
there's a big black "X" over Argentina.
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.
Okay, say we had kids.
They wouldn't have to grow
up in some suburb somewhere.
They would grow up on the road
having adventures with us.
Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe
T-shirts they could collect.
Ted, you know that kids were
never a part of my plan.
But if I was going to
have someone's babies,
I'd have your babies.
That's when you run.
Tell me you ran, Ted.
Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to
start having babies right this second.
Do you have a...?
No, I don't.
Well, we probably shouldn't.
Yeah.
- Risk it?
- Risk it.
No.
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
if you're all gather around,
Lily and Marshall are
going to cut the cake.
No. Robin, you're not...
No, say the story's not over.
Come on,
they're cutting the cake.
Say the story's not over!
Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried
I've ever been that someone's pregnant.
Okay, Lily.
I'm really hungry, so let's just,
uh, aim for my mouth, okay?
Besides, the smearing the cake
thing's a cliché, remember?
No, it's going to be so funny.
Lily.
Lily, just feed me the cake.
Please, baby, I am so hungry.
Whoopsy-daisy.
And she's okay.
- She's all right.
- That was funny.
And it's time for
the honeymoon.
Guys, guys, guys.
Thank you so much.
We love you.
I love you.
Getting married, having kids.
It's all a mistake.
It's a horrible, horrible mistake.
God, this guy's
giving me nothing.
All right,
have fun in Scotland.
If you see the Loch Ness Monster,
tell him Ted Mosby says, "What's up?"
Nessie's a she, Ted, come on.
Hey, kiddo.
You are going to miss out
on a lot of awesome stuff.
You'll be at home with the kid
while I am out awesome-ing
all over the place.
And you're going to get fat.
The story's not over, Barney.
Okay, time to get the
horn back to the bistro.
Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again.
That tuckered me out.
Not a euphemism.
Right. Okay, let me just go change,
and we'll leave.
Whoa, whoa,
you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh.
Solidarity, sister.
That is crazy. I have a change of
clothes and you don't. Suck it up.
Well, if we'd actually moved in
together, all my stuff would be here,
but we didn't, so...
Yeah.
We were all talk, weren't we?
We're not doing this, are we?
I don't want to have
kids in Argentina.
And I don't want to
have kids in Argentina.
So where does that leave us?
Well...
we could stay together and...
pretend this stuff
doesn't matter.
Or...
we could give back
the blue French horn.
You stole a blue
French horn for me.
I would have stolen
you a whole orchestra.
You did break up.
Yep.
You're not pregnant?
Nope.
An-And Marshall and
Lily don't know?
Well, afterwards, uh,
we came by to tell you guys,
but Lily was pretty
stressed out, so...
We decided not to say anything
till after the wedding.
You guys okay?
Well, it hasn't been the easiest
two weeks of our lives, but...
But we're okay.
The open bar helps.
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Hi.
Could I have this dance?
Well, we knew this day
would come eventually.
Take care of her, little man.
This is by far the drunkest
I've ever seen you.
Uh, driver.
Hello!
Ranjit.
Hey, can we make a stop before
we head back to the hotel?
You do not have to stop.
You can be together as man
and wife right back there,
and because we are friends...
I will not watch.
Um, no,
we actually had something else in mind.
Okay.
Lily, go sit down.
Welcome to Wienerburger.
Hi.
Can we get a number one,
please, with no pickles?
And a number four
with no onions.
Let me guess.
Jefferson High prom?
No.
But thank you.
Actually, we just got married.
- Wow. Congratulations.
- Thank you.
That's $7.80.
- Hey, dude.
- Yeah.
I don't know how to say this, but
your wife just threw up in the trash.
My wife.
So Marshall and
Lily were married,
and Robin and I were broken up.
And as hard as it
was at the time,
in the end we both
got what we wanted.
She did eventually go
on to live in Argentina
and Morocco and Greece, Russia,
even Japan for a little while.
And I... well, I met your mom.
I think for the most part if
you're really honest with yourself
about what you
want out of life,
life gives it to you.
Of course, at that moment, all I
really wanted was a scotch and soda
and a cigar.
I'm really sorry
about you and Robin.
I know I was always joking around
about wanting you two to break up,
but you were really
good together.
Yeah...
we were.
She just wasn't the one,
you know?
The one. Oh, Ted, no.
Do not tell me you're going to
start searching for "the one" again.
The only time I want to
hear you saying "the one"
is if it's followed by the
word "hundredth." What up?
No, I need a break
from all that, I...
I just want to get out there and
have fun for a while, you know?
Really?
'Cause...
you know, you've been in
a relationship for a year.
You're going to...
be a little rusty.
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying...
you're gonna need, need,
need some help out there.
Could be.
Ted?
Yes, Barney.
Do you think...
Do you think maybe you might...
need a wingman again?
I do.
Yes!
Yes! We're back.
We are back.
And Ted, my boy,
it's going to be legend...
Wait for it.

L'an 2030
Les enfants, je vais vous raconter
une histoire incroyable:
Comment j'ai rencontré votre mère.
- Sommes-nous en punition ?
- Non.
- Est-ce que ça va être long ?
- Oui.
Voilà 25 ans, avant de devenir père,
j'avais une toute autre vie.
<i>Cette histoire remonte à l'an 2005.</i>
<i>J'avais 27 ans et faisais mes débuts
comme architecte.</i>
<i>J'habitais New York avec Marshall,
mon meilleur ami d'université.</i>
<i>La vie était belle.</i>
<i>Mais l'oncle Marshall a tout gâché.</i>
Veux-tu m'épouser ?
Oui. C'est parfait.
Une fois fiancés, vous boirez
du champagne, porterez un toast
et ferez l'amour par terre dans la cuisine.
- Ne faites pas l'amour dans la cuisine.
- D'accord.
Merci pour ton aide, Ted.
Tu plaisantes, mon gars ?
On parle de toi et Lily.
J'ai partagé tous vos grands moments
avec vous:
Votre première rencontre, votre premier
rendez-vous, d'autres premières.
Désolé, on te croyait endormi.
C'est de la physique:
Quand la couchette du bas bouge,
celle du haut bouge aussi.
Mon Dieu ! Tu vas te fiancer, ce soir.
Oui. Et toi, qu'est-ce que tu fais ce soir ?
<i>Qu'est-ce que je faisais ? L'oncle Marshall</i>
<i>franchissait la plus grosse étape de sa vie.
Et moi ?</i>
<i>J'ai téléphoné à votre oncle Barney.</i>
J'ai toujours aimé
les filles à moitié asiatiques, oui ?
Ma préférence a changé:
J'aime les Libanaises.
Les Libanaises ont remplacé
les filles à moitié asiatiques.
Tu veux sortir, ce soir ?
Je te donne rendez-vous
au bar dans 15 minutes. En costume !
- Salut.
- Où est ton costume ?
J'aimerais que tu en portes un,
quand je te le demande.
- Je l'ai fait, une fois.
- Tu portais un veston.
Je me tiens avec Marshall et Lily
depuis l'université.
Ce sera désormais Marshall avec Lily,
puis moi.
Ils vont se marier, faire des enfants.
En un rien de temps,
je serai le vieux garçon
que leurs enfants appelleront "oncle Ted".
Je vois de quoi il s'agit.
Tu as oublié notre première rencontre ?
Ted, je vais t'apprendre à vivre.
- Barney. On s'est rencontrés à l'urinoir.
- C'est vrai. Salut.
Leçon numéro un: Rase ton bouc.
Elle ne va pas avec ton costume.
- Je ne porte pas de costume.
- De deux: Achètes-en un.
Les costumes sont cool.
Pièce à conviction A.
Leçon numéro trois:
Ne songe même pas au mariage
avant l'âge de 30 ans.
Trente ans. Oui, tu as raison.
Puisque mon meilleur ami se fiance,
- je commence à y penser, aussi.
- Je croyais être ton meilleur ami.
Ted, dis que c'est moi, ton meilleur ami.
- Tu l'es, Barney.
- Bien.
En tant que ton meilleur ami,
je suggère le jeu:
"Connaissez-vous Ted ?"
Non, on ne jouera pas à ça.
Salut. Connaissez-vous Ted ?
- Salut. Je m'appelle Ted.
- Et moi, Yasmin.
- C'est un très beau nom.
- Merci. C'est libanais.
Salut.
Je suis épuisée.
On a peint avec les doigts à l'école,
et un garçon de cinq ans
m'a touché les seins.
- Ça alors ! Tu cuisines ?
- Oui.
Est-ce une bonne idée, après l'incident ?
Tu avais l'air très bizarre, sans sourcils.
Je suis capable.
Je crois que tu seras très surprise, ce soir.
Tu vas me surprendre autrement ?
Comment ?
<i>Marshall faisait sa seconde année de droit</i>
<i>à l'université,
il a donc su s'en sortir rapidement.</i>
Hou ! Hou ! C'est la fin des surprises.
Je vais faire la cuisine.
Je suis vraiment content pour Marshall.
Mais je ne songe pas au mariage,
pour l'instant.
- Crois-tu te marier un jour ?
- Un jour, peut-être.
Un jour d'automne.
À Central Park, peut-être.
Une cérémonie simple,
avec des voeux personnalisés.
Avec musique sur scène.
Les gens vont danser.
Je n'ai pas à m'en faire.
Merde. Pourquoi Marshall a-t-il voulu
se fiancer ?
Rien de plus beau qu'un gars
qui s'imagine un mariage fictif, pas vrai ?
- En fait, je trouve ça charmant.
- Vous êtes sûrement soûle.
Un autre verre pour la dame !
Regarde ce que j'ai acheté.
Oh ! Mon chéri, du champagne.
Oui.
Tu es trop vieux pour avoir peur
d'ouvrir une bouteille de champagne.
Je n'ai pas peur.
- Ouvre-la, alors.
- D'accord.
Ouvre-la, je t'en prie.
Tu es incroyable, Marshall.
<i>Il existe deux questions
qu'un homme se doit de poser,</i>
<i>dont une qu'on prévoit poser
et une qui sort toute seule</i>
<i>quand on est à moitié soûl dans un bar.</i>
Veux-tu m'épouser ?
Veux-tu sortir avec moi, une bonne fois ?
Bien sûr, espèce d'idiot !
Je suis navrée,
mais Carl, c'est mon copain.
Ça va, Carl ?
J'ai promis à Ted qu'on ne ferait pas ça.
Savais-tu qu'il y a une tartelette
Pop-tarts sous ton frigo ?
Non, mais elle est à moi.
Où est le champagne ?
J'aimerais en boire avec ma fiancée.
J'ignore de quoi j'avais peur.
C'est facile, non ?
Pourquoi je perds la tête, tout à coup ?
C'est fou.
Je ne suis pas prêt à me marier.
Comment Carl a-t-il eu une fille libanaise ?
On a toujours dit
que c'était tabou avant nos 30 ans.
Exactement.
Ce type n'est même pas en costume.
Marshall a trouvé l'âme soeur.
Même si j'étais prêt,
ce qui n'est pas le cas,
mais même si j'étais prêt, je dirais:
"Ça y est. Je suis prêt. Où est-elle ?"
<i>Puis je l'ai vue.</i>
<i>C'était comme dans un vieux film,</i>
<i>quand le marin voit une fille
sur la piste de danse</i>
<i>et se tourne vers son ami en disant:</i>
<i>"Tu vois cette fille ?
Je vais l'épouser, un jour. "</i>
Barney, tu vois cette fille ?
Oh ! Oui. Elle a l'air cochonne.
- Va lui parler.
- Je ne peux pas.
J'ai besoin d'une stratégie.
Quand elle ira aux toilettes,
je vais me placer
juste à côté du juke-box pour que...
Salut. Connaissez-vous Ted ?
Salut.
Laissez-moi devinez. Vous êtes Ted.
Je suis désolé, Lily.
Je suis navré. L'hôpital, je vous prie.
Holà ! L'avez-vous frappée ?
S'il m'a frappée ? Voyons donc.
Il sait à peine me donner une fessée au lit,
pour s'amuser.
Il me demande:
"Ma chérie, t'ai-je fait mal ?"
Je lui réponds: "Allez ! Vas-y plus fort,
espèce de pédale."
- Je ne vous connais pas.
- Non, ça va. Continuez.
Dites, ces fessées ont lieu
en pyjama
ou "au naturel" ?
- Quel est votre travail ?
- Journaliste, Metro News 1.
- Ah.
- Je suis comme une journaliste.
Je suis chargée des segments légers
en fin d'émission,
comme un singe qui sait jouer de l'ukulélé.
J'espère être chargée
de trucs plus importants.
Comme un gorille
qui sait jouer de la contrebasse ?
Désolé. Vous êtes très jolie.
- Vos amies ont l'air mécontentes.
- Oui.
Celle du milieu vient de subir une rupture.
Tous les hommes ici sont donc
ses ennemis.
Si ça peut la remonter,
vous pourriez me lancer
un verre au visage.
Ça ferait son bonheur.
Et ça a l'air amusant, au cinéma.
Aimeriez-vous souper avec moi, samedi ?
Je serai à Orlando pendant une semaine
à partir de vendredi.
Il y a un type qui va faire
la plus grosse crêpe du monde.
- C'est pour le travail.
- Une semaine pour ça ?
Il va la manger, aussi.
Un autre record mondial.
Qu'est-ce qui te retient ?
Je sais que je n'ai pas grand-chance,
mais que diriez-vous de demain soir ?
D'accord. Pourquoi pas ?
Crétin !
C'était amusant.
Re... Attends ! ...jeté.
Rejeté.
On sort demain soir.
Je croyais qu'on allait jouer à Lazer Tag,
demain soir.
Je n'avais aucune intention
de jouer à Lazer Tag.
<i>Le lendemain soir, je l'ai amenée
à un petit restaurant à Brooklyn.</i>
Ça alors.
- C'est un méchant cor d'harmonie bleu.
- Oui.
On dirait un pénis de Schtroumpf.
<i>Fiston, écoute ce conseil:</i>
<i>Si tu sors avec quelqu'un pour la première
fois, ne dis pas "pénis de Schtroumpf".</i>
<i>Les filles n'aiment pas ça, habituellement.</i>
<i>Mais cette fille n'était pas habituelle.</i>
Lily.
Depuis quand es-tu assis là ?
Foutu cache-oeil.
Maman, papa,
j'ai trouvé ma future épouse.
Comment ai-je toujours décrit
la femme rêvée ?
Voyons.
Elle aime les chiens ?
J'ai cinq chiens.
Elle aime le scotch ?
J'aime les scotches vieillis
pendant des décennies.
<i>Elle sort des répliques de SOS Fantômes ?</i>
"Ray, quand on te demande
si tu es un Dieu, réponds par oui !"
J'ai réservé la meilleure partie pour la fin.
Les veux-tu ? Je déteste les olives.
- Elle déteste les olives. Super !
- La théorie des olives.
La théorie des olives est basée
sur mes amis Marshall et Lily.
Il déteste les olives, pas elle. Étrangement,
ça les rapproche encore plus.
C'est l'équilibre parfait.
J'ai un bocal d'olives dans mon frigo
depuis très longtemps.
Je pourrais t'en débarrasser.
Elles sont à toi.
C'est parti !
C'est parti, jusqu'à l'infini !
Il n'est que 22 h 30. Que s'est-il passé ?
Ça me prend un cor d'harmonie bleu
pour mon foyer.
Il faut qu'il soit bleu et français.
- Une clarinette verte ?
- Non.
Un tuba mauve ?
Un pénis de Schtroumpf, sinon rien.
Te voilà !
On a un suicidaire,
un détraqué sur le pont de Manhattan.
Viens-t'en, c'est à toi.
D'accord. J'arrive tout de suite.
Je suis navrée.
Je me suis beaucoup amusée, ce soir.
Oui...
L'as-tu embrassée ?
Ce n'était pas le moment.
Je risque d'épouser cette femme.
Notre premier baiser doit être super.
Ted, c'est adorable.
Tu as donc eu peur,
comme une poule mouillée.
Quoi ? Je n'ai pas eu peur.
Je ne veux pas de conseils d'un pirate
qui n'a pas été célibataire
depuis le début de l'université.
Même les célibataires te diraient
la même chose.
Même la personne
la plus stupide au monde.
Et si tu ne me crois pas, téléphone-lui.
T'aimes ça, ne pas jouer à Lazer Tag ?
Parce qu'y jouer, c'est super !
Je t'ai tué, Connor.
Ne m'oblige pas à moucharder.
J'ai besoin de ton opinion sur un truc.
Rendez-vous au bar dans 15 minutes.
En costume !
Ces deux-là pensent que j'ai eu peur.
Et toi ?
Je n'arrive pas à croire
que tu n'es toujours pas en costume !
Elle ne m'a pas fait le signal.
Elle est censée te faire
des signaux en morse avec ses paupières ?
"Ted,
"embrasse-moi."
- Non ! Tu l'embrasses, c'est tout.
- Pas sans obtenir le signal.
- Marshall m'a-t-il fait le signal ?
- Non !
Je le jure.
Et je me coucherai ce soir,
sachant qu'il n'y aura rien
entre moi et Marshall.
Tu aurais dû l'embrasser.
J'aurais dû l'embrasser.
Dans une semaine, à son retour d'Orlando.
Une semaine ?
Ça correspond à un an pour les filles.
Elle t'aura oublié.
Sache que tu ne la reverras plus jamais.
La voilà.
Elle est jolie. Carl, monte le son.
<i>... l'a persuadé à changer d'avis.</i>
<i>À ce moment-là,
l'homme est descendu du bord,</i>
<i>et cette histoire bizarre
s'est bien terminée.</i>
<i>Ici Metro 1 News.</i>
<i>- À toi, Bill.
- Le type n'a pas sauté.</i>
Je vais l'embrasser.
- Tout de suite.
- Mon gars, il est minuit.
En tant que ton futur avocat,
je te dirais que c'est complètement fou.
Je ne fais jamais rien de fou.
J'attends toujours l'occasion propice,
je la planifie.
Elle s'en va demain, et ça risque d'être
ma seule occasion.
Je dois faire ce dont l'autre type fut
incapable: Je dois faire le saut.
Ma métaphore est imparfaite,
car je ferai le saut pour me marier,
et lui, pour mourir.
En fait, ta métaphore est parfaite.
En passant, vous ai-je félicités ?
- J'y vais.
- C'est parti.
- Oui.
- On t'accompagne.
Barney ?
D'accord, mais à une condition.
Regarde-toi, espèce de salaud,
tu es en costume.
Je vais mettre ça sur mon blog.
Arrêtez la voiture. Arrêtez-la juste ici.
Je dois faire un truc.
Pardon. Excusez-moi un instant.
- Je vous laisse.
- Hé !
Hé !
Démarrez !
Il faut apporter des fleurs.
Ça y est, c'est l'heure.
- Souhaitez-moi bonne chance.
- Ted va coucher avec une journaliste.
"Flash Spécial." D'accord.
- Embrasse-la comme il faut.
- Jusqu'à ce qu'elle n'en puisse plus.
Marshall, souviens-toi de ce soir.
Dans ton discours de garçon d'honneur
à notre mariage,
tu raconteras cette histoire.
Pourquoi c'est lui, le garçon d'honneur ?
C'est moi, ton meilleur ami !
<i>En chemin vers sa porte,
j'ai pensé à un million de trucs.</i>
<i>Mais je n'ai pas pensé
à un truc en particulier.</i>
J'ai cinq chiens.
<i>Ce n'est pas bien. Pas bien.</i>
- Non !
- Retourne.
Tu portes un costume !
Ted ?
Salut.
Je...
Monte.
Le tour est joué.
Dites donc, Ranjit, vous avez sûrement
couché avec une Libanaise, non ?
Je viens de franchir ma limite de Barney.
Je vais voir s'il y a des toilettes à ce resto.
En fait, je viens du Bangladesh.
- Les femmes sont belles, là-bas ?
- Voici une photo de ma femme.
Il aurait pu simplement répondre par non.
Elle est charmante.
Dis donc, Ted, que fais-tu à Brooklyn
à 1 h du matin, en costume ?
Je voulais simplement
venir chercher les olives
que tu m'as promises.
Aimerais-tu les prendre
avec du gin et du vermouth ?
Veux-tu me soûler ?
Pour commencer.
Merci.
Dis donc, Marshall, à propos
de la théorie des olives, sur toi et Lily...
- Oui.
- Tu as horreur des olives.
- Lily les aime, tu en as horreur.
- J'en ai horreur, oui.
Voilà deux semaines,
au bar espagnol, 79e Rue.
Un plat d'olives. Tu en as mangé.
Comment ça ?
Tu dois me jurer de ne rien répéter.
- Je le jure.
- Je le jure.
À notre premier rendez-vous,
j'ai commandé
une salade grecque.
Lily voulait mes olives.
J'ai dit: "Vas-y. J'ai horreur des olives."
Mais tu les aimes.
J'avais 18 ans, tu vois ? J'étais vierge.
J'avais attendu toute ma vie
qu'une jolie fille veuille de mes olives.
Marshall, voici ton cadeau de mariage,
en avance:
Ne te marie pas.
Je crois aimer ta théorie des olives.
Je crois aimer
ton nouveau cor d'harmonie.
Je crois aimer ton nez.
Je crois que je suis amoureux de toi.
Quoi ?
Quoi ?
Quoi ?
Tu as dit que tu avais mal au ventre, non ?
Tu sais de quoi il s'agit ?
Tu es avide d'expériences.
Tu es avide de quelque chose d'inédit.
D'olives.
Mais tu as trop peur pour t'assumer.
Oui, j'ai peur, d'accord ?
Mais quand je songe
à passer le reste de ma vie avec Lily,
à m'engager envers elle,
à ne plus jamais fréquenter
d'autres femmes, ça ne me fait pas peur.
Je vais épouser cette fille.
Lily.
Lily, j'aime les olives.
On va s'arranger.
Tu vas à Orlando ?
Iras-tu aussi à Disneyworld ?
- Tu m'aimes ?
- Seigneur.
Je n'arrive pas à y croire.
Pourquoi ai-je dit ça ?
Qui dirait ce genre de truc ?
- Je vais y aller.
- Attends.
Un instant.
Je te les ai promises.
- Les olives.
- Oui.
Merci. Je t'aime.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas, chez moi ?
Pourquoi on est encore là ? Partons.
On a le temps de sortir.
Qu'en dis-tu, Lily ?
"Yo ho ho, et une bouteille de rhum !"
- Tu es un pirate, non ?
- Je retire mon cache-oeil.
On ne peut pas abandonner Ted.
Si ça se passe mal,
il aura besoin de notre appui.
Ça fait 20 minutes.
Crois-tu qu'ils s'envoient en l'air ?
Devant les chiens ?
Comme le font les chiens.
Une fille à l'université avait un chien...
Ça y est.
Allons au bar, mais arrête de parler.
Allez-y, Ranjit.
Quand tu raconteras cette histoire
à tes amis,
omettrais-tu le terme "psychopathe" ?
Je préfère qu'on me traite d'excentrique.
Bonne nuit, le psychopathe.
Super.
- Comment je me rends au train ?
- Ah.
- Deux pâtés de maison par là, à droite.
- Merci.
Tu sais quoi ?
Finie, la vie de célibataire. J'y suis pourri.
C'est évident qu'on ne dit pas
à une femme qu'on vient
de rencontrer qu'on l'aime,
mais c'est nul, ça.
Je vais te dire un truc. Si une femme,
pas toi, mais une femme hypothétique,
était capable de me supporter
à travers tout ça,
je ferais un très bon mari,
parce que je suis doué pour ces choses-là.
Je saurais comment la faire rire,
comment être un bon père,
comment promener ses cinq chiens.
Comment l'embrasser.
- Tout le monde croit bien s'y prendre.
- J'ai des références.
Bonne nuit, Ted.
- Et je sais comment donner la main.
- Très bien.
Et c'est tout. Je ne la reverrai
probablement plus jamais.
- Quoi ?
- C'était ça, le signal.
Cette longue poignée de main.
Tu aurais dû l'embrasser.
Il n'existe pas de signal.
Mais oui, c'était ça, le signal.
Le signal.
Carl, merci. Je dois faire un truc.
En passant, t'aurais dû l'embrasser.
Carl, vous n'étiez pas là.
Je trouve ça très séduisant.
Faites-moi confiance.
J'ai déjà vu le signal.
- Elle ne l'a pas fait.
- Ted, on a changé de sujet.
- À ma fiancée.
- À l'avenir.
À une belle soirée !
Elle ne m'a pas fait de signal.
<i>Je lui ai posé la question, quelques années
plus tard. C'était le signal.</i>
<i>J'aurais pu l'embrasser.</i>
<i>Mais le destin fonctionne ainsi.
Il arrive, qu'on le veuille ou non.</i>
<i>Je ne croyais plus jamais la revoir.</i>
<i>Mais en fin de compte,</i>
<i>j'étais trop impliqué dans le casse-tête
pour en voir les morceaux.</i>
Parce que ça, les enfants, c'était l'histoire
de comment j'ai rencontré
votre tante Robin.
Ma tante Robin ?
Ce n'était pas ton histoire avec maman ?
Calmez-vous. J'y arrive.
Je vous ai déjà avertis:
C'est une longue histoire.
Kids, I'm gonna tell you an incredible story ;
the story of how I met your mother.
Are we being punished for something ?
No.
Yeah, is this gonna take a while ?
Yes. 25 years ago, before I was Dad,
I had this whole other life.
It was way back in 2005.
I was 27, just starting to make it as an architect
and living in New York  with Marshall,  my best friend from college.
My life was good.
And then Uncle Marshall went and screwed the whole thing up.
Will you marry me ?
Yes. Perfect !
And then you're engaged.
You pop the champagne.
You drink a toast.
You have sex on the kitchen floor.
Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.
Got it.
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.
Dude, are you kidding ?
It's you and Lilly.
I've been there for all the big moments of you and Lilly :
night you met, your first date, other first things.
Yeah, sorry.
We thought you were asleep.
It's physics, Marshall.
If the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves, too.
My God.
You're getting engaged tonight.
Yeah. What are you doin' tonight ?
What was I doing ?
Here Uncle Marshall was taking the biggest step of his life.
And me ?
I'm calling up your Uncle Barney.
Hey, so you know how I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls ?
Well, now I've got a new favorite... Lebanese girls.
Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.
Hey, you want to do somethin' tonight ?
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes. And suit up !
Where's your suit ?
Just once, when I say suit up, I wish you'd put on a suit.
I did that one time.
It was a blazer !
You know, ever since college it's been, Marshall and Lilly and me.
Now, it's gonna be Marshall and Lilly... and me.
They'll get married, start a family.
Before long, I'm that weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call Uncle Ted.
I see what this is about.
Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met ?
Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.
Barney. We met at the urinal.
Oh, right. Right.
Lesson one : lose the goatee.
It doesn't go with your suit.
- I'm not wearing a suit.
- Lesson two : get a suit.
Suits are cool.
Exhibit "A."
Lesson three : don't even think about getting married till you're 30.
30. Right. You're right.
I guess it's just, your best friend gets engaged,
you start thinking about that stuff.
I thought I was your best friend.
Ted, say I'm your best friend.
You're my best friend, Barney.
Good. Then, as your best friend,
I suggest we play a little game I like to call
- "Have you met Ted ?"
- Wait. No, no, no.
We're not playing "Have you met Ted ?"
Hi, have you met Ted ?
Hi, I'm Ted.
Yasmine.
That's a very pretty name.
Thanks. It's Lebanese.
I'm exhausted.
It was finger-painting day at school,
and a five year-old boy got to second base with me.
Wow ! You're cooking ?
Yes, I am.
Aw...
Are you sure that's a good idea ?
After last time, you looked really creepy without eyebrows.
I can handle this.
I think you'll find I'm full of surprises tonight.
So, there's more surprises ?
Like what ?
Marshall was in his second year of law school,
so he was pretty good  at thinking on his feet.
Boogedyboo !
And that's all of 'em.
I'm gonna go... cook.
I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am.
I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.
So, do you think you'll ever get married ?
Well, maybe eventually...
some fall day, possibly in Central Park.
Simple ceremony.
We'll write our own vows.
Band, no DJ.
People will dance !
I'm not gonna worry about it !
Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged ?
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh ?
- Actually, I think it's cute.
- Well, you're clearly drunk.
One more for the lady !
Oh, hey, look what I got.
Oh, honey ! Champagne.
Yeah.
No. You are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne.
- I'm not scared.
- Then open it.
Fine.
Please open it ?
You are unbelievable, Marshall.
There are two big questions a man has to ask in life.
One, you plan out for months.
The other just slips out when you're half drunk at some bar.
Will you marry me ?
You wanna go out sometime ?
Of course, you idiot !
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.
'Sup, Carl ?
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.
Did you know there's a Pop Tart under your fridge ?
No, but dibs.
Where's that champagne ?
I wanna drink a toast with my fiancée.
I don't know why I was so scared of this.
It's pretty easy, right ?
Why am I freaking out all of a sudden ?
This is crazy.
I'm not ready to settle down.
How does Carl land a Lebanese girl ?
The plan has always been don't even think about it until you're 30.
Exactly. The guy doesn't even own a suit.
Plus, Marshall's found the love of his life.
Even if I was ready, which I'm not...
but if I was, it's, like, "Okay, I'm ready. Where is she ?"
And there she was.
It was like something from an old movie,
where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor,
turns to his buddy and says, "See that girl ?
I'm gonna marry her someday."
Hey, Barney, see that girl ?
Oh, yeah. You just know she likes it dirty.
Go say hi.
I can't just go say hi.
I need a plan.
I'm gonna wait until she goes to the bathroom,
then I'll strategically place myself by the jukebox...
Hi, have you met Ted ?
Let me guess... Ted.
Sorry, Lilly.
I'm so sorry.
- Take us to the hospital.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you hit her ?
Hit me ? Please !
This guy can barely even spank me in bed for fun.
He's all like, "Oh, honey. Did that hurt ?"
And, I'm like, "Come on !
Let me have it, you pansy !"
- Wow, a complete stranger.
- No, no, no, no ! It's okay.
Go on.
So, these, uh, spankings...
you in pajamas or au naturel ?
So, what do you do ?
I'm a reporter for Metro News One.
Well, kind of a reporter.
I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news.
You know, like, um...
monkey who can play the ukulele.
I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon.
Bigger, like, uh... gorilla with an upright bass ?
Sorry. You're really pretty.
Oh, your friends don't seem to happy.
Yeah, see, the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend.
So, tonight, every guy is "the enemy."
You know if it'll make your friend feel better,
you could throw a drink in my face. I don't mind.
She would love that !
And it does look fun in the movies.
Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night ?
Oh, I can't.
I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday.
Some guy's attempting to make the world's biggest pancake.
Guess who's covering it ?
That's gonna take a week ?
Yeah, he's gonna eat it, too.
It's another record.
Hey ! What's takin' so long ?
Uh, I know this is a long shot, but how 'bout tomorrow night ?
Yeah. What the hell ?
Jerk !
That was fun.
De... wait for it... nied !
Denied !
We're goin' out tomorrow night.
I thought we were playin' laser tag tomorrow night.
Yeah, I was never gonna go play laser tag.
The next night, I took her out to this little bistro in Brooklyn.
That is one badass blue French horn.
Yeah.
Sort of looks like a Smurf penis.
Son, a piece of advice :
when you go on a first date, you really don't wanna say "Smurf penis."
Girls don't ordinarily like that.
But this was no ordinary girl.
Lilly ?
How long have you been sitting there ?
Stupid eye patch.
Mom, Dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.
Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman ?
Now, let's see... she likes dogs ?
I've got five dogs.
She drinks scotch ?
I love a scotch that's old enough to order its own scotch.
Can quote obscure lines from Ghostbusters ?
Ray ! When someone asks you if you're a god, you say "Yes !"
And I'm saving the best for last.
Do you want these ?
I hate olives.
She hates olives ! Awesome !
The olive theory.
The olive theory is based on my friends Marshall and Lilly.
He hates olives, she loves them.
In a weird way, that's what makes them such a great couple.
Perfect balance.
You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.
I could take 'em off your hands.
They're all yours.
Oh, it is on !
It is on till the break of dawn.
But wait.
It's only the break of 10:30.
What happened ?
I gotta get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace.
It's gotta be blue.
It's gotta be French.
- No green clarinet ?
- Nope.
Come on. No purple tuba ?
It's a Smurf penis or no dice.
There you are !
We got a jumper.
Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.
Come on. You're coverin' it !
Um... all right.
I'll be right there.
I'm sorry.
I had a really great time tonight.
Yeah.
So ?! Did you kiss her ?
No. The moment wasn't right.
Look, this woman could actually be my future wife.
I want our first kiss to be amazing.
Aw, Ted, that is so sweet.
So you chickened out like a little bitch.
What ? I did not chicken out.
You know what ?
I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate
who hasn't been single since the first week of college.
Anyone who's single would tell you the same thing,
even the dumbest single person alive.
And if you don't believe me, call him.
Hey, loser.
How's not playing laser tag ?
Because playing laser tag is awesome !
- Oh, I killed you, Conner !
- Don't make me get your mom !
Hey, listen.
I need your opinion on something.
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.
And suit up !
So, these guys think I chickened out.
What do you think ?
I can't believe you're still not wearing a suit.
She didn't even give me the signal.
What, is she gonna, she gonna bat her eyes ayou in Morse code ?
"Ted... kiss me."
No ! You just kiss her !
Not if you don't get the signal.
Did Marshall give me the signal ?
No ! I didn't. I swear.
But, see, at least tonight,
I get to sleep knowing Marshall and me,
never gonna happen.
You should have kissed her.
Oh, I should have kissed her.
Well, maybe in a week when she gets back from Orlando.
A week ? That's like a year in hot girl time.
She'll forget all about you.
Mark my words... you will never see that one again.
There she is.
Ooh ! She's cute.
Hey, Carl, turn it up.
...persuaded him to reconsider.
At which point, the man came down off the ledge,
giving this bizarre story a happy ending.
- Reporting from Metro One News...
- Guy didn't jump.
I'm gonna go kiss her.
Right now.
Look, dude.
It's midnight.
As your future lawyer, I'm gonna advise you that's freakin' crazy.
I never do anything crazy.
I'm always waiting for the moment, planning the moment.
Well, she's leaving tomorrow.
This may be the only moment I'm gonna get.
I gotta do what that guy couldn't.
I gotta take the leap !
Okay, not a perfect metaphor,
'cause for me it's fall in love and get married,
and for him it's... death.
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.
By the way, did I congratulate you two ?
I'm doing this.
Let's go.
- Word up.
- We're coming with you.
Barney ?
All right, but under one condition.
Look at you, you beautiful bastard. You suited up !
This is totally going in my blog !
Stop the car.
Uh, pull over right here.
I gotta do something.
Excuse me. Pardon me. Just a sec'.
Enjoy your coffee.
Go ! Go ! Go !
Everybody brings flowers.
Okay.
Moment of truth.
Wish me luck.
Ted's gonna get it on with a TV reporter.
"This just in." Okay.
Kiss her, Ted !
Kiss her good !
Kiss the crap outta that girl !
Marshall, remember this night.
When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech,
you're gonna tell this story.
Why does he get to be the best man ?
I'm your best friend !
As I walked up to that door, a million thoughts raced through my mind.
Unfortunately, one particular  thought did not.
I've got five dogs.
Not good. Not good.
- No !
- Get back in there !
You're wearing a suit !
Ted ?
Hi.
I was just, uh...
Come on up.
He's in.
So...
Ranjit, you must have done it with a Lebanese girl ?
Okay, that's my Barney limit.
I'm gonna see if that bodega has a bathroom.
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.
The women hot there ?
Here's a picture of my wife.
A simple "no" would have sufficed.
She's lovely.
So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn at 1:00 in the morning in a suit ?
I was just hoping to...
get those olives...
that you said I could have.
Would you like those olives with some gin and vermouth ?
Are you trying to get me drunk ?
For starters.
So, Marshall, this olive theory, based on you and Lilly ?
You hate olives.
Lilly loves 'em.
You can't stand 'em.
Yeah. Hate olives.
Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th street, dish of olives, you had some... what up ?
You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.
- I swear.
- I swear.
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad.
Lilly asked if she could have my olives.
- I said, "Sure. I hate olives."
- But, you like olives.
Well, I was 18, okay ?
I was a virgin.
Been waitin' my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.
Marshall, I'm gonna give you an early wedding present.
Don't get married.
I think I like your olive theory.
I think I like your new French horn.
I think I like your nose.
I think I'm in love with you.
What ?! What ?! What ?!
Come on, man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right ?
You know what that is.
Hunger.
You're hungry for experience.
Hungry for something new.
Hungry for olives.
But you're too scared to do anything about it.
Yeah, I'm scared, okay ?
But, when I think of spending the rest of my life with Lilly...
committing, forever, no other women...
doesn't scare me at all.
I'm marrying that girl.
Lilly.
Lilly, I like olives.
We'll make it work.
So, Orlando.
You gonna hit Disneyworld ?
You love me ?!
I-I-I can't believe I said that.
Why did I say that ?
Who says that ?
I should just go.
Hold on.
Wait a minute.
Promised you these.
Olives.
Thanks. I love you.
What is wrong with me ?
Why are we still sitting here ?
Let's go. We can still make last call.
What do you say, Lil ?
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum ?
'Cause you're a pirate.
Okay, eye patch, gone.
And we can't just abandon Ted.
If it doesn't go well up there, he's gonna need some support.
It's been, like, 20 minutes.
You think they're doin' it ?
You think they're doin' it in front of the dogs ?
Doggy style.
Hey, there was a girl in college, she had this golden retriever...
Okay, we can go to the bar.
Just stop talking.
Hit it, Ranjit.
So, when you tell this story to your friends,
could you avoid the word "psycho ?"
I'd prefer. "eccentric."
Good night... psycho.
Great.
Um, how do I get to the F train ?
Oh, um, two blocks that way and take a right.
You know what ?
I'm done being single.
I'm not good at it.
Look, obviously, you can't tell a woman you just met you love her.
But... it sucks that you can't.
I'll tell you something, though.
If a woman... not you, just some hypothetical woman...
were to bear with me through all this,
I think I'd make a damn good husband.
Because, that's the stuff I'd be good at,
stuff like making her laugh and being a good father.
And walking her five hypothetical dogs.
Being a good kisser.
Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.
Oh, I've got references.
Good night, Ted.
And I'm a good handshaker.
That's a pretty great handshake.
And that was it.
I'll probably never see her again.
What ?
That was the signal.
That long, lingering handshake ?
You should have kissed her.
There's no such thing as "the signal."
But, yeah, that was the signal.
Signal.
Ah, Carl, thank you.
Something I gotta do.
By the way, you should have kissed her.
Carl ! You guys weren't there.
I am so turned on right now.
Guys, trust me.
I've seen the signal.
That was not the signal.
Yeah, Ted, we're not on you anymore.
- To my fiancée.
- To the future.
To one hell of a night !
That was not the signal.
I asked her about it years later.
And, yeah, that was the signal.
I could have kissed her.
But that's the funny thing about destiny.
It happens whether you plan it or not.
I mean, I never thought I'd see that girl again,
but it turns out I was just too close to the puzzle
to see the picture that was forming.
Because, that, kids, is the true story of how I met your Aunt Robin.
Aunt Robin ?
I thought this was how you met mom !
Will you relax ?
I'm getting to it.
Like I said, it's a long story.

L'an 2030
- Où en étais-je ?
- À ta rencontre avec maman.
- En détails insoutenables.
- Voilà.
En 2005, quand j'avais 27 ans,
mes deux meilleurs amis se sont fiancés.
<i>Ça m'a fait penser
que je devais peut-être me marier.</i>
<i>Puis, j'ai rencontré Robin.
Elle était incroyable.</i>
<i>Je devais la rencontrer.
D'où l'entrée en scène de l'oncle Barney.</i>
Je suggère le jeu "Connaissez-vous Ted ?"
Non, on ne jouera pas à ça.
Salut. Connaissez-vous Ted ?
<i>Je l'ai donc invitée à sortir,
et je sais que c'est dingue,</i>
<i>mais après le 1er rendez-vous,
j'étais amoureux d'elle</i>
<i>et j'ai dit un truc stupide.</i>
Je crois être amoureux de toi.
Quoi ?
- Oh ! Non, papa.
- Et après ?
<i>Rien.</i>
<i>Je m'étais complètement humilié.</i>
<i>Après une semaine, j'ai décidé
de ne plus lui téléphoner.</i>
Tu ne vas pas lui téléphoner ?
Tu te croyais amoureux d'elle, et là,
tu ne vas pas lui téléphoner.
Je n'étais pas amoureux d'elle.
J'étais quelque peu amoureux
de l'idée abstraite du mariage.
Ça n'avait rien à voir avec Robin.
- Robin ?
- Salut.
Voyez qui j'ai croisée.
Depuis quand vous connaissez-vous ?
Depuis à peu près ici.
Lily m'a reconnue des actualités...
- Ohé, marin !
- Ils viennent de se fiancer.
Je devrais retourner à la station.
À la prochaine.
- Contente de t'avoir vu, Ted.
- Moi aussi.
Merci.
- Merde !
- Quoi ?
- Je suis amoureux d'elle.
- Non.
En tant que ton parrain,
je ne te laisserai pas
- faire de rechute. C'est fini.
- Je ne sais pas.
J'ai le sentiment
que c'est ma future épouse.
Lily, tu as glapi ?
Elle a dit quelque chose à mon sujet ?
Allez, raconte.
D'accord.
Comment trouves-tu Ted ?
Ted est tout un personnage.
Ah ?
Je vais prendre ça du bon côté.
Je suis un personnage unique.
Il est très hardi.
Mais c'est ça, mon charme.
- Mais c'est ça, son charme.
- Absolument.
Il est gentil et charmant,
mais il veut une relation
plus sérieuse que moi.
Je ne supporte rien de sérieux,
pour le moment.
- Tu gardes ça secret, d'accord ?
- Tu plaisantes ?
Je me tiens sur la réserve.
Désolée.
Elle veut un truc décontracté ?
Je serai décontracté.
Sans complexe ni souci.
Vous savez pourquoi ?
Parce que c'est un jeu.
Je voulais outrepasser le jeu
et passer à la finale.
Mais il faut jouer au jeu, auparavant.
- Tu vas l'inviter à sortir ?
- Oui. Non !
Je ne l'inviterai pas à sortir,
car ça sera comme l'inviter à sortir.
Comment faire pour l'inviter à sortir
sans l'inviter à sortir ?
Avez-vous pris de la drogue ?
Je l'ai. Je ne l'inviterai pas à sortir.
Je vais l'inviter à notre fête,
vendredi prochain.
- On fait une fête, vendredi prochain ?
- Maintenant, oui.
Une fête décontractée.
C'est très décontracté
que d'inviter cent personnes
chez toi pour séduire une fille.
C'est ma jambe, Lily.
Tu as attendu cinq minutes
pour me le dire ?
- Téléphone-lui, alors.
- Non, ce n'est pas décontracté.
Je dois la croiser, quelque part.
Si je connaissais son horaire,
je m'arrangerais pour la croiser.
C'est super, Ted. Tu seras
le plus décontracté des harceleurs.
<i>Depuis que Marshall lui avait donné
sa bague,</i>
<i>Lily lui témoignait
encore plus d'affection qu'avant.</i>
Non, bébé.
J'ai un travail de 25 pages à écrire
sur le droit constitutionnel.
J'ai à peine commencé.
Je porte ma bague, c'est tout.
Ma bague magnifique.
Elle rend superflu
tout autre accoutrement.
Comme mon débardeur.
Je n'ai plus envie de le porter.
Mes sous-vêtements non plus.
Ah ! Oui. Je n'en porte pas.
- Tu n'as pas de sous-vêtements ?
- Pas du tout.
Les amis.
Les limites, ça existe.
<i>- La voilà.
- Merci, Bill.</i>
<i>Je suis en direct
du supermarché Razzle Dazzle,</i>
<i>au carrefour
de la 75e Rue et de Columbus...</i>
75e Rue, angle Columbus.
C'est parti !
...où Leroy Ellenberg, un garçon
de quatre ans, est resté coincé
dans une machine distributrice.
Tout ça pour une girafe en peluche mauve.
Ici Robin Scherbatsky, pour Metro News 1.
- C'est beau.
- Merci, Don.
Ted ?
- Robin ? Quelle coïncidence !
- Que fais-tu ici ?
Je suis venu acheter une trempette.
J'aime la trempette. Non, je n'aime pas ça.
J'aime bien ça.
Comme une amie.
Tu es là pour communiquer une nouvelle ?
Un enfant coincé dans la machine.
Tu es gentil d'appeler ça des nouvelles.
Ça alors, un enfant coincé
dans une machine à grue.
Tu tenais vraiment à ce jouet, hein ?
Tu n'as pas joué comme tout le monde.
Tu transpires.
Quel enfant charmant.
C'est drôle de te croiser comme ça.
On fait une fête, vendredi prochain,
alors si tu veux,
viens faire un tour.
Je rentre chez moi ce week-end.
- Dommage que ce ne soit pas ce soir.
- Ça l'est. C'est ce soir.
Ce vendredi.
J'ai dit vendredi prochain ? Désolé.
C'est parce que je le répète sans cesse.
Mais c'est ce soir. La fête est ce soir.
Mais, peu importe.
- Allô ?
- Salut. Est-ce que je vous dérange ?
Non, j'écris mon travail.
Je fais de la recherche.
Toi et Lily devriez vous habiller.
On fait une fête dans deux heures. À plus.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire
quand Robin va arriver ?
J'ai déjà tout prévu.
<i>Elle franchira la porte. Où est Ted ?</i>
<i>Il ne l'attend pas près de la porte.</i>
<i>Je suis à l'autre bout, à ma table à dessin,</i>
<i>en train de montrer
mes trucs d'architecture à une belle fille.</i>
<i>Robin vient me voir,
et je lui dis, d'un air décontracté:</i>
<i>"Salut. Ça va ?"</i>
<i>Elle répond: "Salut ! Chouette endroit etc, etc."</i>
<i>Je dis à mon tour:</i>
<i>"Tu es chez toi, ici."</i>
<i>Et je reprends ma conversation,
d'un air décontracté.</i>
<i>Puis, une heure plus tard:</i>
<i>"Oh, tu es toujours la ?"</i>
<i>Je lui montre que je m'en fous
mais que je suis agréablement surpris.</i>
<i>Ensuite, d'un air très décontracté:</i>
<i>"Tu veux monter sur le toit ?"</i>
- Le toit.
- Le toit.
On monte sur le toit,
et le toit s'occupe du reste.
C'est quoi, le truc du toit ?
La lune, les étoiles,
la ligne d'horizon scintillante.
Impossible de ne pas tomber amoureux
sur ce toit.
On est déjà montés.
- Très bon plan, mes petits amis.
- On a la même grandeur.
Puis-je suggérer un petit changement ?
<i>La belle fille avec qui tu parlais ?</i>
<i>Monte sur le toit avec elle, plutôt.</i>
<i>- Couche avec elle...
- Ce n'est pas mon plan.</i>
<i>Tu devrais y repenser.
Regarde-la. Ted, regarde-la.</i>
<i>- Elle est à croquer.
- Merci.</i>
<i>- Oui.
- Mais ce n'est pas Robin.</i>
Exactement.
Ted, parlons.
Statistiquement,
à chaque fête new-yorkaise, il y a
une fille qui ignore qui l'a invitée.
Elle ne connaît aucun de tes amis,
tu ne la reverras plus jamais.
Vois-tu ... où je veux ... en arriver ?
Barney, laisse tomber.
- Je balaie, bip, je balaie, bip.
- Quel abruti.
Bip, bip, bip, bip. Cible atteinte !
C'est l'heure de jouer à un petit jeu:
- "Connaissez-vous Ted ?"
- Non, ne fais pas ça.
- Salut. Connaissez-vous Ted ?
- Non.
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Connaissez-vous Marshall, Lily ?
- Non.
- Connaissez-vous quelqu'un à cette fête ?
- Je travaille avec Carlos.
Pardon. Est-ce que
quelqu'un connaît Carlos ?
- Non.
- Non.
Sur un plateau d'argent. Bon appétit.
Non, merci.
Dommage pour toi. Heureusement
pour elle. Est-ce qu'on monte sur le toit ?
- C'est magique.
- D'accord.
Attends. J'ai déjà réservé le toit.
- Robin ne viendra pas, mon gars.
- Elle viendra.
Elle viendra.
<i>Elle n'est pas venue.</i>
Au moins la fête était super.
J'ai mangé quatre pots de trempette.
Tu as toujours le mot juste, mon ami.
- C'est Robin.
- Réponds.
Non, pas tout de suite.
Je dois paraître décontracté.
- Allô ?
- Je suis désolée d'avoir manqué la fête.
- Qui est à l'appareil ? Meredith ?
- C'est Robin.
Ah ! Robin.
Oui,
- tu n'es pas venue, hein ?
- Non, on m'a retenue au travail.
Mais on a sorti le garçon
de la machine distributrice.
- Lui a-t-on donné la girafe mauve ?
- On lui a donné tous les jouets.
Il a passé du temps là-dedans,
et les enfants ont de petites vessies.
J'aurais tant voulu que la fête soit ce soir.
Elle l'est. La fête, c'est ce soir.
Oui, c'est une fête sur deux jours,
parce qu'on aime ça.
Alors si tu veux faire un tour, c'est beau.
À la prochaine.
- C'était Robin.
- Tu veux m'achever ou quoi ?
- J'ai un travail à écrire.
- Je sais. Désolé. C'est terrible.
- Je vais acheter d'autres trempettes.
- Ted ! Attends !
Achète celle à l'oignon !
Je n'arrive pas à y croire !
J'ai un travail à faire.
Bon, d'accord.
Mais il faut faire ça très vite.
- Et pas de câlins, après.
- Comme je suis chanceuse.
Tu avais tout à fait raison, pour le toit.
Le toit...
Le toit est en feu, Ted !
La fille d'hier soir m'a raccompagné
chez moi.
Je l'ai emmenée dehors ce matin,
l'ai fait tournoyer
et lui ai dit au revoir.
Ainsi, elle ne retrouvera plus jamais
le chemin. Et la voilà.
- Mais comment ? L'as-tu invitée ?
- Je ne la connais pas.
Elle bosse avec Carlos. C'est qui ?
Je ne connais aucun Carlos.
- Salut. Te revoilà.
- Absolument.
- Chéri, j'aimerais prendre un verre.
- "Chéri" ? Vraiment ?
À l'aide.
Holà, les lapins.
Le toit m'est réservé.
D'accord.
C'est fini, mon histoire
avec la fille qui travaille avec Carlos.
- C'était rapide.
- Oui.
Je me suis demandé
comment me débarrasser
d'une fille le plus vite possible ?
- Je crois que je suis amoureux de toi.
- Quoi ?
- Merci, mon gars.
- Pas de quoi.
Mais qu'est-ce que... Non ! Voyons !
Désolé, Ted.
Super. Je suis censé faire quoi
si Robin se pointe ?
Elle se pointera.
<i>Elle ne s'est pas pointée.</i>
Bon, on a organisé deux fêtes.
Tout le monde s'est amusé,
tout le monde a pris du bon temps,
s'est réjoui.
C'est l'heure pour moi
de me mettre au travail. Sans interruption.
Répète ceci:
"Je ne ferai pas l'amour avec Marshall."
- Je ne ferai pas l'amour avec Marshall.
- Je ne ferai pas l'amour avec Marshall.
C'est Robin.
- Allô ?
- Salut, Ted.
Amanda ? Oh, non. C'est Denise, désolé.
Je t'ai confondue avec Amanda.
- C'est Robin.
- Ah ! Robin.
<i>- Salut.
- Je tenais à venir à la fête,</i>
mais on m'a encore retenue.
On dirait que je vis au travail.
Désolée d'avoir manqué une autre fête.
Ce n'est rien, zouin-zouin.
Qui suis-je ?
La fête sur deux jours aurait-elle lieu
sur trois jours, par hasard ?
Oui, au fait. La fête se poursuit ce soir.
Oui, hier soir, les gens disaient:
"Continue, mon gars ! Fais le triple saut !"
Super. Je viendrai, alors.
Super. À ce soir.
C'était Robin.
<i>J'ai donc organisé une troisième fête
pour Robin, dimanche soir.</i>
C'est ennuyant.
Ennuyant ou décontracté ?
- Ennuyant.
- Ou décontracté ?
Dis donc, monsieur Droit,
ferais-tu une pause de 15 minutes ?
Désolé, bébé, mais je dois travailler.
Mon flux artériel doit rester ici.
<i>Quelqu'un aurait-il vu
Introduction aux contrats, aux délits</i>
<i>et textes de lois sur la restitution
de 1865 à 1923 ?</i>
- Quelqu'un aurait-il vu une brique ?
- Non.
Salut, Barney.
Evidement...
Tu parais bien.
N'est-ce pas étrange qu'on soit invités
tous les deux ?
Qui ?
Qui t'a invitée ? Personne ne te connaît.
Je sais que je t'ai blessé,
mais tu n'as pas besoin d'être méchant.
Carlos avait raison à ton égard.
Qui est Carlos ?
Où diable se trouve mon...
Oh !
Bon.
<i>Introduction aux contrats, aux délits
et textes de lois</i>
<i>sur la restitution de 1865 à 1923</i>
n'est pas un sous-verre !
Je compromets ma carrière en droit
pour que tu puisses faire non pas une,
non pas deux, mais trois fêtes
pour une fille que tu viens de rencontrer
et qui ne se pointera probablement pas.
Où est-elle, Ted ? Où est Robin ?
Salut, Robin.
Alors, tu as fait toutes ces fêtes pour moi ?
Non, tu as cru que... Non !
Bon, d'accord, tu m'as eu.
Une des raisons pour lesquelles
je t'ai invitée était que je voulais
te présenter à lui,
puisque ça n'a pas fonctionné entre nous
et qu'on peut en rire de bon coeur.
- Peu importe. Robin, je te présente...
- Carlos.
Elle parle toujours avec Carlos.
Je peux toujours gagner. Ce n'est pas fini.
Bon, c'est l'heure
de discuter honnêtement.
Robin a l'air super,
mais examinons les faits.
Tu veux te marier et en ce moment,
un million de New-yorkaises cherchent
un gars comme toi.
Mais Robin n'en fait pas partie.
Mais c'est mon âme soeur.
Ton âme soeur est partie sur le toit.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Rien. C'est un jeu.
Je dois continuer à y jouer.
DÉPART
BAISSER GRUE
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Carlos, pourrais-tu nous excuser ?
- Avec plaisir, hombre.
Salut.
Je n'ai pas organisé cette fête
pour te présenter Carlos,
ni celle d'hier, ni celle d'avant-hier.
J'ai organisé ces fêtes
parce que je voulais te revoir.
Eh bien, me voici.
Il y a quelque chose entre nous,
à moins que je sois fou.
Tu n'es pas fou.
Je ne sais pas, Ted. On se connaît à peine,
et tu me regardes de cet air, comme si...
- Comme si quoi ?
- Tu veux qu'on tombe amoureux,
qu'on se marie, qu'on fasse des enfants
et qu'on les amène aux entrainements de foot.
Je ne les obligerai pas à faire du sport,
à moins qu'ils le veuillent.
C'est super,
mais tu t'adresses à la mauvaise fille.
- Non.
- Oui.
Je ne veux pas me marier.
J'ignore si ça va changer.
Et si on sortait ensemble,
je me sentirais obligée
soit de t'épouser, soit de te briser le coeur...
et je ne veux pas faire ni l'un, ni l'autre.
Tout comme tu ne peux pas éteindre
tes sentiments.
Clic.
Je les ai éteints. Embrasse-moi.
Quoi ?
Quoi ? C'était l'interrupteur. Je l'ai éteint.
Oui, bon, c'est vrai que je veux
tomber amoureux, me marier
et tout le tralala, mais dans un autre sens,
il y a toi et moi,
sur le toit.
- Il n'existe pas d'interrupteur.
- Il en existe un.
Et il est éteint.
Il ne l'est pas.
Si, il l'est.
- Il ne l'est pas.
- Si,
il l'est.
Ah.
Il ne l'est pas.
Tu as raison. Il n'existe pas d'interrupteur.
- J'aimerais tant qu'il en existe un.
- Moi aussi.
Alors...
Que faire maintenant ?
On pourrait devenir amis.
Je sais que ça semble hypocrite
quand les gens disent ça,
mais on pourrait le faire.
Je ne sais pas, Robin.
Je me suis tellement humilié,
que si on se tient ensemble, chaque fois
qu'on se verra,
je me sentirai comme un con.
Tu n'es pas con.
Je suis désolée, mais je suis déménagée
ici en avril et je ne fais que travailler.
Je n'ai pas encore rencontré
beaucoup de gens sympas.
Mais je comprends.
Eh bien,
peut-être que dans quelques mois,
quand la poussière sera retombée,
on pourrait boire une bière tous ensemble.
Oui. Ça serait sympa.
À la prochaine, Ted.
On pourrait aussi y aller maintenant.
On pourrait prendre une bière maintenant.
J'aimerais ça.
Mes amis t'aimeront beaucoup.
Ils t'aimeront bien, comme amie.
Le con.
Incroyable.
Ça ne peut que mal tourner.
Ils travaillent ensemble.
- Es-tu jaloux ?
- C'est ça, oui.
- Pourquoi je serais jaloux de Carlos ?
- Parce qu'il a un rendez-vous.
Arrête la cassette.
Rembobine. Recommence.
Un rendez-vous ?
Je ne suis pas sûr de l'aimer, elle.
Tu n'avais pas un travail à écrire ?
- Sais-tu à qui tu t'adresses ?
- Oui.
Je vais boire cette bière,
j'en boirai une autre,
puis je rentrerai à la maison
composer 25 pages,
que je remettrai
et ils me donneront un "A".
Je suis un vrai de vrai !
(My name is Rufus and that's the Troofus)
<i>Il a eu un "B-".</i>
<i>Mais quand même. 25 pages en une nuit
pour un "B-", ce n'est pas mal.</i>
Laisse-moi au moins t'offrir une bière.
Allez, j'invite tout le monde.
Je vais t'aider.
- Tu sais quoi, Ted ?
- Quoi ?
Tu es un beau parti. Tu vas rendre
ta future épouse très heureuse.
Et je vais t'aider à la trouver.
Bonne chance.
Peut-être que c'est trop grand, New York.
Il y a des millions de gens dans cette ville.
Comment faire
pour y dénicher l'âme soeur ?
Par où commencer ?
Salut. Connaissez-vous Ted ?
Okay, where was I?
You were telling us how you met Mom.
In excruciating detail.
Right. So, back in 2005, when I was 27, my two best friends got engaged,
and it got me thinking, maybe I should get married.
And then I saw Robin.
She was incredible.
I just knew I had to meet her.
That's where your Uncle Barney came in.
I suggest we play a little game I like to call "Have you met Ted?"
Wait, no, no, no. We're not playing "Have you met Ted?"
Hi. Have you met Ted?
So I asked her out.
And I know this sound crazy, but after just one date,
I was in love with her which made me say something stupid.
I think I'm in love with you.
What?!
Oh, Dad.
So then what happened?
Nothing.
I mean, I'd made a complete fool of myself.
So, a week went by, and I decided not to call her.
So you're not gonna call her?
You went from, "I think I'm in love with you" to "I'm not gonna call her"?
I wasn't in love with her, okay?
I was briefly in love with the abstract concept of getting married.
It had absolutely nothing to do with Robin.
- Robin.
- Hi.
Look who I ran into.
Since when do you guys know each other?
Oh, since about... here.
Lily recognized me from the news and...
Hello, sailor!
They just got engaged.
Well, I should get back to the station.
See you, guys.
- Nice seeing you, Ted.
- Yeah, you, too.
- Dawn it!
- What?
- I'm in love with her.
- No!
As your sponsor, I will not let you relapse.
You blew it, it's over, move on.
I don't know, I just have this feeling she's the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.
Lily, you squeaked?
She said something about me, didn't she?
Come on, spill it, Red!
Fine.
So, what do we think of Ted?
Ted's something else.
Huh.
I'm gonna spin that as good.
Lots of guys are something, I'm something else.
Comes on a little strong.
But, that's part of my charm.
But, that's part of his charm.
Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming,
he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am.
I mean, the most I can handle right now is something casual.
This just stays between us, right?
Are you kidding?
This flapper? Fort Knox.
Oops.
She wants casual.
Okay, I'll be casual.
I'm going to be a mushroom cloud of casual.
You know why?
Cause it's a game--
I want her to skip to the end and do the whole happily-ever-after thing.
But you don't get there unless you play the game.
So, are you going to ask her out?
Yeah... No!
I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out, I'm asking her out.
So, how do I ask her out without asking her out?
Did you guys get high?
I got it.
I don't ask her out.
I invite her to our party next Friday.
We're having a party next Friday?
We are now.
Casual.
Yeah, cause nothing says "casual" like inviting a hundred people over just to mack on one girl.
Oh, and Lily, that's my leg.
You waited five minutes to tell me that?
All right, so call her up.
No, calling's not casual.
I just got to bump into her somewhere.
Now, if only I knew her schedule, I could arrange a chance encounter.
That's great, Ted-- you'll be the most casual stalker ever.
Ever since Marshall put that ring on her finger,
Lily had been, well, extra affectionate.
Baby, no.
I have a 25-page paper on constitutional law due Monday.
I barely started.
Hey, I'm just sitting here,
wearing my ring,
my beautiful ring.
Kind of makes wearing other stuff seem wrong.
Like my shirt.
Kind of don't want to wear my shirt anymore.
Or... my underwear.
That's right, I'm not wearing any.
No underwear?
Not even slightly.
Guys.
Boundaries.
There she is.
Thanks, Bill.
I'm reporting from the Razzle Dazzle Supermarket on 75th and Columbus...
75th and Columbus.
Game on!
...where four-year-old Leroy Ellenberg has climbed inside a grab-a-prize machine and gotten stuck.
And, all in the pursuit of a stuffed, purple giraffe.
For Metro News 1, I'm Robin Trubotsky.
We're clear.
Thanks, Don.
Ted.
Robin, wow!
What are the odds?
What are you doing here?
Oh, you know, just, uh, shopping for, uh, dip.
I love dip.
I mean, I don't love dip, I like dip... as a friend, you know.
So, uh, hey, you, uh, reporting a news story or something?
Yeah, kid stuck in a crane machine.
How sweet of you to call it news.
Wow. Kid in a crane machine.
You just had to have that toy, didn't you?
Couldn't play the game like everyone else.
You're all sweaty!
Cute kid.
Um, you know, it's so funny I should run into you.
We're, uh, we're having a party next Friday, if you feel like swinging by.
But, you know, whatever.
Oh, I'm going back home next weekend.
It's too bad it's not tonight.
It is... it's tonight.
This Friday. Did I say next Friday?
Sorry, I guess I've been saying next Friday all week.
But, yeah, it's tonight, the, uh, the party's tonight.
But, you know, whatever.
Hello?
Hey, am I interrupting anything?
No, no, I'm just writing my paper.
Hitting the books.
Yeah, well, you and Lily might want to put some clothes on.
We're throwing a party in two hours.
Okay, bye.
So, Gatsby, what are you gonna do when Robin shows up?
Okay, I got it all planned out.
She steps through the door-- and where's Ted?
Not eagerly waiting by the door.
No, I'm across the room at my drafting table,
showing some foxy young thing all my cool architect stuff.
So, Robin strolls over,
and I casually give her one of these: "Hey, what's up?"
She says, "Hey, nice place, et cetera, et cetera."
And then, I say,
"Well, make yourself at home."
And, I casually return to my conversation.
Then, an hour later...
"Oh, you're still here?" I say,
like I don't really care, but it's a nice surprise.
And then, very casually:
"Want to see the roof?"
The roof!
Get her up to the roof, and the roof takes care of the rest.
What's so special about the roof?
Oh, the moon, the stars, the shimmering skyline.
You can't not fall in love on that roof.
We do it up there, sometimes.
Solid plan, my little friend.
We're the same height.
But, may I suggest one little modification.
That foxy young thing you were chatting up, take her up to the roof and have sex with her.
- Crazy monkey style...
- That's not the plan.
Well, it should be the plan. I mean, look at her.
Ted, look at her. She's smoking!
- Thank you!
- Yeah...
But, she's not Robin!
Exactly!
Ted, let's rap.
Statistic: At every New York party, there's always a girl who has no idea whose party she's at.
She knows no one you know, and you will never see her again.
Do you see where I'm going with this?
Barney, I don't think so.
Scoping.
Scoping.
Man, you're a dork.
Target acquired!
Now it's time we play a little game I like to call "Have you met Ted?"
Oh, come on, not this.
Hi. Have you met Ted?
No.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Do you know Marshall? Lily?
- No.
Hmm. Do you know anyone at this party?
I work with Carlos.
Excuse me.
Anyone know a Carlos?
- No.
- No.
On a silver platter.
Bon appétit.
I don't think so.
Your loss, her gain.
Excuse me.
Can I show you the roof? It's magical up there.
- Sure.
- Wait, wait.
Hey, hey, I got that roof reserved.
Dude, Robin's not coming.
Hey, she's going to show up!
She'll show up.
She didn't show up.
At least it was a great party.
I ate, like, four whole cans of dip.
You always know what to say, old friend.
It's Robin.
Answer it.
No, no, not right away-- got to seem casual.
Hello?
I'm so sorry I missed your party.
Who is this? Meredith?
Robin.
Oh, Robin!
Hey! Yeah, I, uh, guess you never showed up, did you?
No, I got stuck at work.
But, they finally got that kid out of the crane machine.
Did he get to keep the purple giraffe?
Yeah, they let him keep all the toys.
He was in there a long time, and little kids have small bladders.
I wish your party was tonight.
It is-- the party's tonight.
Yeah, uh... it's a two-day party, 'cause that's just how we roll.
Uh, so, if you want to swing by, you know, it's casual.
See ya.
So, that was Robin.
What are you doing to me, man?! I got a paper to write!
I know! Sorry! It's terrible!
- I'll buy more dip!
- Ted! Ted, wait!
Get French onion!
Can you believe this guy? I got a paper to write.
Okay, fine.
But, it's got to be, like, super-quick, and no cuddling after.
I'm the luckiest girl alive.
You were so right about the roof!
The roof!
The roof is on fire, Ted!
That girl from last night-- I took her back to my place,
then this morning, took her outside, spun her around a couple times
and sent her walking. She will never find her way back, and there she is.
How did she get here? Did you invite her?
I have no idea who that is.
She said she works with Carlos. Who's Carlos?
I don't know any Carlos.
Hi, you!
You're back!
I sure am.
Come on, sweetie, I need a drink.
"Sweetie"? Really?
Whoa! Whoa, rabbits!
Come on, I got that roof reserved.
All right.
So, it's over between me and works-with-Carlos girl.
Whoa! That was fast.
Yeah. I was trying to think, what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?
I think I'm in love with you.
What?!
Thanks, bro.
Glad I could help.
What the...
No, no, no. Come on.
Sorry, Ted.
Great. What am I going to do when Robin shows up?
She'll show up.
She didn't show up.
All right. We threw two parties.
Everybody had fun.
Everybody wanged, everybody chunged.
Now, the kid has got to get to work, and the kid is not to be disturbed.
Repeat after me.
I will not have sex with Marshall.
I will not have sex with Marshall.
It's Robin.
Hello?
- Hi, Ted.
- Amanda?
Oh, Denise! Sorry, you totally sounded like Amanda.
It's Robin.
Oh, Robin.
Hi.
I totally wanted to come. I got stuck at work again. I feel like I live there.
I'm sorry I missed your party, again.
Hey, ain't no thing but a chicken wing, mamacita.
Who am I?
I guess there's no chance your two-dayer turned into a three-dayer?
It did, indeed. The party continues tonight.
Yeah. Uh, last night, people were like, "Keep it going, bro. Party trifecta."
Wow! Okay, well, I'll be there.
Great! See you tonight.
So, that was Robin.
So, I threw a third party for Robin...
on a Sunday night.
Well, this is lame.
Lame...
or casual?
Lame.
Or casual?
Hey, law books.
Ready for a little 15 minute recess?
Sorry, baby, I got to work. I need all my blood up here.
Has anybody seen An Introduction to Contract Tort and Restitution Statutes from 1865-1923?
Anybody seen a big-ass book?
No.
Hello, Barney.
Of course.
You look well.
Is it weird they invited both of us?
Who?
Who invited you? No one even knows who you are!
I understand you're hurt, but
you don't have to be cruel.
Carlos was right about you.
Who is Carlos?!
Hey, where the hell is my...?
Oh...!
Okay...
An Introduction to Contract Tort and Restitution Statutes from 1865-1923
is not a coaster!
Ted, I'm jeopardizing my law career so you can throw not one,
not two, but three parties
for some girl that you just met who's probably not even going to show up!
I mean, where is she, Ted, huh?
Where's Robin?
Hi.
Hi, Ron.
So, you threw all these parties for me?
No. Oh, you thought that... no!
I... okay, yes. You got me.
One of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you
to, um, this guy.
Uh, I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us
and now we can just laugh about it...
Anyway, Robin, this is...
Carlos.
- Oh!
- Oh!
She's still talking to Carlos.
I can still win this. I-it's not over.
Okay, buddy. Time for the tough talk.
Robin seems great, but let's look at the facts.
You want to get married.
And right now, there's a million women in New York looking for exactly you.
But Robin ain't one of them.
She's not just one of them. She's the one.
Yeah, well, the one is heading up to the roof.
What are you going to do?
Nothing.
It's a game. I got to just keep playing it.
Ted...
Hey, Carlos, can you give us a minute?
Hey, no sweat, hombre.
See ya.
Robin...
look, I didn't throw this party to set you up with Carlos,
or the one before that,
or the one before that.
I threw these parties because I wanted to see you.
Well, here I am.
There's something here, look, unless I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.
I don't know, Ted.
I mean, we barely know each other
and you're looking at me with that look. And, it's like...
Like, like what?
Like, "Let's fall in love and get married
and have kids and drive them to soccer practice."
I'm not going to force sports on them unless they're interested.
It's a great look.
But you're looking at the wrong girl.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
I don't want to get married right now, maybe ever.
And, if we got together, I'd feel like I'd either have to marry you or break your heart, and...
I just couldn't do either of those things.
Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.
Click.
Off. Let's make out.
What?
What? That was the off switch.
And I turned it off.
I mean, look, sure, yes, I want to fall in love, get married, blah, blah, blah.
But, on the other hand... you, me,
the roof.
There's no off switch.
There is an off switch.
And it's off.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
Yes... it is.
No, it's not.
You're right. There's no off switch.
God, I wish there was an off switch!
Me, too.
So, um...
What do we do now?
We could be friends.
Oh...
Look, I know it sounds insincere when people say that, but...
we could.
I don't know, Robin.
I've made such a jackass of myself here.
We start hanging out, every time I see you it'll be like, "Oh, that's right. I'm a jackass."
You're not a jackass.
Look, I'm sorry. I only moved here in April
and I'm always working and
I just haven't met a lot of good people so far.
But I understand.
Well, uh, maybe in a few months, after it's not so fresh,
we could all, uh, you know, get a beer.
Yeah.
That sounds good.
I'll see you, Ted.
Or, you know, now.
We could all get a beer now.
I'd like that.
My friends are going to love you... like you, you know, as a friend.
Jackass.
Unbelievable.
That's just a recipe for disaster. They work together!
Are you jealous?
Oh, please. What does Carlos have that I don't?
- A date tonight.
- Oh!
Stop the tape. Rewind. Play it again.
- A date tonight.
- Oh!
I'm not sure I like her.
Hey, don't you have a paper to write?
- Dude, you're talking to the kid.
- I know it.
I'm going to knock back this beer.
I'm going to knock back one more beer.
I'm going to go home. I'm going to write a 25-page paper.
I'm going to hand it in and I'm going to get an "A."
My name is Rufus and that's the trufus.
He got a B-minus.
But still, 25 pages in one night, B-minus?
The kid was good.
At least let me buy you a beer.
Come on, I'll buy everyone a beer.
I'll help carry.
- You know something Ted?
- What?
You are a catch.
You're going to make some girl very happy.
And I am going to help you find her.
Well, good luck.
I mean, maybe New York's just too big a town.
I mean, there's millions of people in this city.
How, in all this mess, is a guy supposed to find the love of his life?
I mean, where do you even begin?
Hi. Have you met Ted?

C'était un soir,
avant que je rencontre votre mère,
où je voulais vraiment aller au bar.
Le bar. Grosse surprise.
Tu en as passé du temps dans les bars.
Eh bien, c'est ce qu'on faisait à l'époque.
<i>Moi, Marshall et Lily, Barney, Robin.</i>
<i>On se tenait dans ce bar, chez MacLaren's.</i>
<i>Puis un soir...</i>
- Si on allait chez MacLaren's ?
- Oui, allons-y.
Êtes-vous en train de discuter ?
- Quelqu'un écoute ?
- Pourquoi pas chez MacLaren's ?
Chez MacLaren's, c'est ennuyant.
Ce soir, Ted, on sort.
On va rencontrer des dames,
ce sera légendaire. Tape là-dedans.
<i>Je ne savais pas pourquoi
je me tenais avec Barney.</i>
Tu n'as pas tapé, n'est-ce pas ?
Je sais quand tu ne le fais pas, Ted.
Allez. On va toujours chez MacLaren's.
Oui, on s'amuse bien chez MacLaren's.
MacLaren's est amusant à ce niveau là.
Moi ce que je te propose,
c'est de s'amuser à "ce" niveau la.
Tu vois, tu dis qu'on va
s'amuser à "ce" niveau la,
mais la plupart du temps, ça finit
par être amusant à "ce" niveau la.
S'amuser à ce niveau la,
c'est correct, sûr et garanti.
Toutes ces simagrées gestuelles
sont inutiles au téléphone, hein ?
En effet.
Monte dans le taxi. Toi aussi, Marshall.
J'aimerais bien. Mais Lily et moi allons...
- Je comprends. Monte.
- Pourquoi peut-il dire non ?
Parce qu'il a des relations sexuelles.
De façon constante.
Ted, Ted, Ted. Regarde-moi.
Tu vas toujours dans le même bar.
Tu suis la même route.
Et je suis innovateur. Alors, innovons.
Ce n'est pas une route, d'accord ?
C'est une routine que j'aime.
Ted, quelle est la première syllabe
de "rou-tine" ?
À plus tard, perdants !
Bon, quel est ce plan légendaire ?
On doit prendre quelqu'un à l'aéroport.
- D'accord, j'en ai assez.
- Estaban, les portes !
Une fois cette tâche accomplie,
on a toute la soirée devant nous.
Pourquoi as-tu ces valises,
et qui venons-nous chercher ?
Je l'ignore. Peut-être elle. Ou elle.
Attends. Quand tu disais venir chercher
quelqu'un à l'aéroport,
tu voulais dire "venir chercher"
quelqu'un à l'aéroport ?
Voici le scénario.
Deux filles viennent à New York
pour une fin de semaine de plaisir,
où elles rencontrent deux hommes
d'affaires internationaux
rentrant d'un voyage lucratif au Japon.
Exemple de dialogue:
"Vous êtes sur roulettes ?
"Eh bien, moi aussi."
- Tu plaisantes.
- Faux.
En passant. Rentre ta chemise.
Tu as l'air négligé.
- J'ai l'air négligé ?
- Crois-moi, ce sera légendaire.
Ne dis pas légendaire, d'accord ?
Tu utilises bien trop le mot légendaire.
On construit un igloo à Central Park.
Ce sera légendaire.
Mets ta combinaison de ski  !
Ted, Ted, Ted. Regarde-moi !
C'est pour vrai.
Tu mets les bagages sur le carrousel
ou tu écoutes mon long discours
destiné à te persuader de le faire. Décide.
Ted, depuis la nuit des temps,
les humains se sont battus...
<i>Ce soir-là,
Marshall avait beaucoup d'étude à faire.</i>
<i>Lily est sortie avec Robin,</i>
<i>arrivée depuis peu à New York
et se cherchant une amie.</i>
Je suis contente qu'on soit finalement
- toutes les deux.
- Oui.
Ça ne te dérange pas
de passer ton vendredi soir
avec une vieille femme presque mariée ?
Je t'en prie.
J'en ai assez des salles d'exposition.
Les gars sont comme le métro:
Tu en manques un,
un autre passe cinq minutes après.
Et si c'est la fin de la nuit,
tu montes sur n'importe quoi.
De la part de ce type.
Vraiment ? C'est gentil.
Oh. Ça fera 6 $ pour vous.
C'est le prix d'être fiancée.
- C'est pour ça qu'il l'a fait.
- Salut.
Oh, bonsoir.
Vous arrivez de Détroit ?
Du Japon.
Le carrousel quatre
n'est pas intéressant. Prêt ?
Je vais t'apprendre quelque chose:
Les belles filles ne sont pas de Buffalo.
Arrêt de jeu. À dix heures.
Tu es prêt, Tedder ?
Oui. Mais on devrait raffiner notre histoire.
- Comment a-t-on...
- Ted ! Espèce de maladroit !
Salut. Barney.
- Salut.
- Mon Dieu, est-ce que ça va ?
- Excusez-moi.
- C'est correct.
Votre atterrissage était un peu hésitant.
Je vous donnerais 9,2.
Bonjour, je m'appelle Ted.
Laura. On est désolées de partir si vite,
mais on a un avion à prendre.
- Oh, où allez-vous ?
- À Philadelphie.
- Philly ? C'est aussi notre destination.
- Vraiment ?
- Eh bien, on se verra dans l'avion.
- Bien sûr.
- Suis-les. Je prends les billets.
- Non. Barney !
Ne prends pas cet escalier roulant !
Et ne prends pas le suivant !
<i>Etudier le Droit.</i>
<i>Faire un choix responsable pour mon avenir.</i>
<i>Un vendredi soir...</i>
<i>Etre un avocat
a intérêt à être génial !</i>
<i>Quoi de neuf, Teeeed ?</i>
- Est-ce que ça va ?
- Oui.
Devine où je suis ? Je suis dans... Prêt ?
Un avion pour... Prêt ? Philadelphie.
- C'est génial.
- Est-ce Marshall ?
Laisse tomber tes activités,
monte dans ta Fiero
et viens nous rejoindre à Philly.
Ce sera légendaire !
Merde, j'aimerais bien, les gars...
Oui. Regarde les photos
que j'ai envoyées sur ton cellulaire.
Philly !
Admets-le, tu t'amuses.
Comme ça... 35000 pieds de plaisir.
Je ne pensais pas voler vers Philadelphie
en me levant ce matin. Je l'admets.
Excellent. Allons parler à ces filles.
Attends. On doit boucler la ceinture.
Ted, tu as gardé ta ceinture bouclée
toute ta vie.
Il est temps de la défaire.
- Monsieur, gardez votre ceinture.
- Oui, désolé, désolé.
J'ai grandi dans Park Slope.
Oh, j'adore Park Slope.
Quand es-tu arrivée à Manhattan ?
- Tu viens de Park Slope ?
- Pas moi, elle.
Et toi d'où viens-tu ? Du ciel ?
Oui, je suis un fantôme.
Je suis morte il y a 15 ans,
comme ta façon de draguer.
- Je suis désolée.
- Crois-moi, je connais ça.
J'utilise cette réplique
pour les gars... Écoute bien.
Salut.
Prends celui-ci,
je te le montrerai au prochain.
- Qu'allez-vous faire à Philly ?
- On va voir nos copains.
Je pense que Chris fera
la grande demande.
N'est-ce pas super ?
Vraiment super.
<i>Donc on était là,</i>
<i>pris dans un avion vers Philadelphie
avec deux filles pas libres du tout.</i>
<i>Tout ça grâce à votre oncle Barney.</i>
Ne sont-ils pas mignons ?
- Ils sont secondeurs pour les Eagles.
- Les deux !
Les deux copains sont secondeurs.
Tu vas à Philly ? Pourquoi ?
Je ne l'ai pas demandé.
On dirait que tu t'amuses plus que moi.
Je parle au dos des gars
qui font la cour à Robin.
Oui, j'imagine qu'elle est très populaire.
Et tu penses que je ne le suis pas ?
Pas avec la bague au doigt.
Les gars voient la bague et se disent:
"Réservée à Marshall".
Oh, bien sûr. C'est ça. La bague.
Je ne suis pas encore habituée.
C'est la bague. Si tu l'enlevais,
tu aurais un tas de gars
autour de tes charmes.
Je n'enlèverai pas ma bague.
Tu ne serais pas jaloux
de tous ces bourdons autour de ma fleur ?
Oh, oui. Tu me connais,
je suis plutôt jaloux.
Si un idiot te regarde trop,
je lui pète les dents !
Non, sérieusement,
amusez-vous ce soir, les filles.
Salut.
Robin ! Robin !
Par ici.
En rou-rou-route vers Philly !
Marshall, ne viens pas à Philly.
Mais on part à l'aventure.
On est sur une aire de trafic à Philly.
Foooolle aventure.
Bien.
Non. Non. La nuit commence.
Écoute. Le bar de l'aéroport.
Les hôtesses de l'air.
Elles positionneront ton plateau
à la verticale.
- Pardon ?
- Passagers Mosby et Stinson ?
Veuillez nous suivre, messieurs.
- Laissez vos mains visibles.
- Barney, je vais te tuer.
Ne dis pas ça devant
des agents de sécurité de l'aéroport.
Ce n'est pas terrible.
C'est un outrage.
On est des hommes
d'affaires internationaux
en voyage d'affaires
international très important.
J'exige que nous soyons libérés
sur-le-champ.
Tu exiges ? Non, non, non, il n'exige rien.
On n'a pas d'exigences.
Je vais vous demander de rester calme.
D'accord, je suis calme, tout à fait calme.
On a des images de vous déposant
deux valises sur le carrousel à J.F.K.,
et les abandonnant pour acheter
des billets de dernière minute.
- Tu devais t'occuper des sacs.
- C'étaient les tiens.
Monsieur, s'il vous plaît.
On s'occupe des valises.
Écoutez. Ce n'est qu'un...
C'est un malentendu.
Je t'en prie.
On est des hommes
d'affaires internationaux.
Par mégarde,
mon collègue a laissé les valises là.
Laissez-nous partir avant qu'on manque
la réunion d'affaires internationale.
Ça fait longtemps
que j'ai vu un homme d'affaires
avec la chemise sortie.
En plus, on a reçu ces images filmées
au cours des derniers mois.
Crois-le ou non,
ce truc du sac de voyage, ça marche.
La vérité,
c'est que mon ami se rend à l'aéroport
avec de fausses valises
pour rencontrer des filles.
On en a suivi deux jusqu'ici, à Philly.
C'est tout. Ce n'est que ça.
Personne n'est aussi minable.
Oui, il l'est.
Dis-lui que tu es aussi minable.
- On est des hommes d'affaires...
- Oh, voyons !
Monsieur ! Baissez le ton
ou je devrai vous maîtriser.
Calme-toi, mon vieux, sérieusement.
- On a le droit d'appeler notre avocat.
- Exactement.
On en a un ?
Écoutez-moi.
Vous êtes citoyens américains.
Ne les laissez pas jouer la carte
du Patriot Act. Vous avez le droit
de refuser de répondre
en l'absence d'un avocat.
Ne dites rien avant que j'arrive, d'accord ?
D'accord, au revoir.
<i>Oh Philly !</i>
<i>L'aventure continue !</i>
<i>Déchire !</i>
Cet endroit est ridicule.
Si on allait ailleurs ?
Non. C'est un endroit super.
- Que fais-tu ?
- Quoi ?
Avec tes lèvres et tout ?
Mes lèvres sont toujours comme ça.
Fallait que tu joues la carte du racisme.
Du calme, Ted, on n'a rien fait de mal.
Et, en passant, on serait déjà sortis
si tu avais rentré ta chemise.
J'écoute, J.F.K.
Quel est l'état des valises ?
Elles sont correctes.
Elles sont juste remplies de préservatifs.
Et une barre énergétique.
Vous pouvez partir.
<i>Ne viens pas à Philly.</i>
- Je suis à mi-chemin.
- On a été libérés
et on prend le prochain vol.
Rejoins-nous chez MacLaren's
pour un dernier verre.
- Peut-on juste...
- Non, on ne peut pas "juste", on rentre.
- On va chez Sascha.
- Qui c'est, Sascha ?
Sascha.
Elle invite des amis chez elle
pour prendre un verre.
Ce sera légen... Attention,
j'espère que tu aimes la nature,
car le mot se termine par "d'air".
- Non !
- Légendaire !
- Légendaire ? C'est génial !
- Non, Marshall, on rentre.
Bien.
Attends, j'ai un autre appel.
- Allô ?
- Marshall, on va chez Sascha.
Non, on n'y va pas.
Ted, Ted, Ted. Regarde-moi. On y va.
Désolé, l'ami. Deux contre un.
- Regarde, une banquette libre.
- Vraiment ?
Je pensais qu'on pourrait enfin parler,
mais tu n'écoutes pas,
- alors, je vais y aller.
- Oui, oui, une banquette.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Je suis fiancée. Je suis désolée.
J'ai enlevé ma bague.
C'est très gentil d'être venu me parler,
mais je...
Oui. Je suis gai.
Je suis venu te dire
que tu t'es assise sur un raisin.
Merde !
<i>Donc, Barney et moi sommes sortis.</i>
<i>Philadelphie, Pennsylvanie.</i>
<i>Notre seul et unique arrêt:
La fête chez Sascha.</i>
Vous êtes les amis de Sascha, hein ?
Oui.
Les gars, baissez le volume.
Vous allez réveiller mon grand-père.
Qui veut de la limonade forte ?
Philly !
Philly.
<i>Au bar, la soirée de filles n'était pas
ce que Robin avait prévu.</i>
- Le téléphone de Lily.
- Robin ? Où est Lily ?
- Elle est...
- Parle-t-elle à un type sexy ?
Tu peux me le dire. Ça va.
C'était mon idée.
Je lui ai dit d'enlever la bague.
Ah oui ? Je trouvais ça bizarre,
mais si ça ne te dérange pas...
Oui, elle l'a enlevée
et elle parle à un type.
- Tu veux que j'aille...
- Non ! Laisse tomber. C'est génial.
Elle a vraiment enlevé la bague, hein ?
Génial.
Dis-lui que j'ai appelé,
et qu'elle est... géniale.
<i>Vraiment, vraiment géniale !</i>
<i>Notre relation est basée sur une confiance mutuelle.</i>
<i>J'arrive pas à respirer.</i>
Tu as entendu ça, Ted ?
Dana surveille la Liberty Bell.
Je m'en tire bien.
Le cordon de sécurité doit être
bien en place.
Ça t'arrive de traverser le cordon
pour y toucher ?
Souvent.
As-tu déjà mis ta tête dedans ?
Oui.
- Tu l'as léchée ?
- Non.
Je ne l'ai jamais léchée.
Je gage que personne n'a jamais léché
la Liberty Bell.
Si quelqu'un le faisait,
ce serait... Quel est le mot déjà ?
- C'est tout pour moi.
- Ted, légendaire.
Barney, je pars pour l'aéroport.
Sascha, merci.
Dis à ton grand-père de m'excuser
de l'avoir surpris à la toilette.
Je vais chercher du club soda
pour cette tache.
Je pensais qu'on passerait
la soirée ensemble ?
Que fais-tu ?
Je repousse les avances de ce type sexy.
- Je pense qu'il est gai.
- Je sais qu'il est gai.
Marshall et moi sommes ensemble
depuis neuf ans.
Je n'ai pas été célibataire
depuis le secondaire.
Tu veux être célibataire ?
Ça t'amuserait de repousser des idiots
toute la soirée ?
Je voulais juste aller à la pêche
pour voir
combien j'attraperais de poissons.
Un, pour l'instant. Un dauphin gai.
Et Marshall.
Lily, toutes ces filles ici ce soir
espèrent attraper ce que tu as déjà.
Tu as raison. Je sais.
Que dirais-tu d'un café
et d'une vraie conversation ?
Si le café est accompagné
d'un gâteau au fromage, c'est oui.
J'ai le club soda. Voyons voir ce derrière.
Merci beaucoup.
Tu cherches la bagarre ?
C'est le derrière de ma fiancée
que tu tripotes !
- Marshall, non !
- Chérie, je t'en prie.
Ne retire plus jamais cette bague
même si je dis que c'est génial.
<i>- Ça va.
- Bas les pattes, hombre !</i>
Je n'ai pas si peur de me battre !
Tu veux essayer ? Vas-y, allez.
Marshall, il est gai.
Oh, Dieu merci.
Je ne me suis jamais battu.
Je ne l'aurais jamais cru.
<i>Oncle Marshall était vraiment
du type jaloux.</i>
<i>Malheureusement,
le copain de ce type l'était aussi.</i>
On aurait pu lécher la Liberty Bell.
On va à l'aéroport.
Dong.
Dong.
Pourquoi je me tiens avec toi ? Pourquoi ?
Je voulais juste ma bière habituelle,
dans mon bar habituel,
avec mes amis habituels
dans ma ville habituelle.
Ted, Ted, Ted.
- Tu ne regardes même pas.
- Non, en effet.
Nos ancêtres sont morts
pour la poursuite du bonheur. D'accord ?
Pas pour rester assis
et attendre le bonheur.
Si tu veux, tu peux aller au même bar,
boire la même bière
et parler au même monde tous les jours.
Ou tu peux aller lécher la Liberty Bell.
Tu peux prendre la vie par la fente
et lécher ce qui en sort.
C'était très bien dit, vieux.
Merci, Leonard.
Ted, tu passes
à côté d'une belle leçon de vie.
Je n'ai pas besoin de tes conseils.
Je sais comment vivre ma vie.
Si tu veux lécher la Liberty Bell,
vas-y toi-même.
- Non, il faut y aller tous les deux.
- Pourquoi as-tu besoin de moi ?
Parce que
tu es mon meilleur ami, d'accord ?
Tu n'as pas à me dire que je suis le tien.
Mais je nous vois comme une équipe.
Sans toi, je suis juste le solo dynamique.
D'accord.
Si tu veux qu'on rentre, on rentrera.
D'accord. Allons lécher la Liberty Bell.
Parfait, car on est arrivés.
<i>J'ignorais comment Barney avait fait
changer le taxi de direction.</i>
<i>On est sortis, Dana nous a laissés entrer,</i>
<i>et mon Dieu, on a léché la Liberty Bell.</i>
- Tu sais ce que ça goûtait ?
- Quoi ?
La liberté.
Non, ça goûtait les pièces de monnaie.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Avez-vous vraiment fait ça ?
<i>On l'a vraiment fait.</i>
<i>Et j'ai compris pourquoi je me tenais
avec Barney.</i>
<i>Je n'allais jamais où je voulais aller,
mais j'avais toujours une histoire super.</i>
Donc, cette fille à qui tu parlais,
c'était maman ?
Chaque histoire
dans la vie d'un homme est
- un point d'un tableau impressionniste...
- C'est un non ?
Oui, c'est un non.
Quoi ? Allez.
So there was this one night before I met your mother,
when I really wanted to go to the bar.
The bar... big surprise.
You sure spent a lot of time in bars.
Well, that's just we did back then.
Me, Marshall and Lily,
Barney, Robin--
we all used to hang out at this one bar called McClaren's.
But then, one night...
Why don't we go to McClaren's?
Let's go to McClaren's.
You guys talking to each other?
Nobody's listening?
What's wrong with McClaren's?
McClaren's is bore-snore.
Ted, tonight we're going to go out.
We're going to meet some ladies.
It's going to be legendary.
Phone five.
I had no idea why I hung out with Barney.
You didn't phone five, did you?
I know when you don't phone five, Ted.
Come on.
We always to go to McClaren's.
Yeah, 'cause McClaren's is fun.
McClaren's is this much fun.
What I'm offering is the chance to have...
this much fun.
See, you say that.
You say it's going to be this much fun,
but most of the time it ends up being this much fun.
This much fun is good.
It's safe. It's guaranteed.
This hand gesture thing doesn't really work on the phone, does it?
No, it doesn't.
Get in the cab.
Marshall, you, too.
Oh, I wish I could. I think Lily and I are just going to...
I understand. Ted, get in the cab.
Why can Marshall say no?
Uh, because he's getting laid.
Consistently.
Ted, Ted, Ted... right here.
You keep going to the same bar. You're in a rut.
And I am a rut-buster.
I'm going to bust your rut.
It's not a rut, okay?
It's a routine, and I like it.
Ted, what's the first syllable in "rut-tine"?
Peace out, suckers.
All right, so what's this legendary plan?
First we've got to pick someone up at the airport.
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Estaban, doors.
Okay, we just do this one little thing, and the rest of the night is ours.
Why do you have those suitcases, and who are we picking up?
I don't know.
Maybe her.
Or her.
Wait, so when you said you were going to pick someone up at the airport,
you meant you were going to "pick someone up" at the airport?
Scenario: a couple of girls fly into town looking for a fun weekend in NYC,
when the meet two handsome international businessmen
just back from a lucrative trip to Japan.
Sample dialogue:
"You have a wheelie bag? Well, I have a wheelie bag."
You've got to be kidding me.
False.
Sidebar... tuck in your shirt. You look sketchy.
I'm sketchy?
Trust me, it's going to be legendary.
Don't say "legendary," okay?
You're too liberal with the word "legendary."
We're building an igloo in Central Park.
It's going to be legendary. Snowsuit up!
Ted, Ted, Ted... right here.
This is happening. Now you can either put the bags on the carousel now,
or you can listen to me give you a really long speech convincing you
to put the bags on the carousel. Your move.
Ted, since the dawn of time-- mankind has struggled...
That night, Marshall had  a ton of studying to do.
So Lily went out  with Robin--
who was new to New York and looking for a friend.
I'm so glad we finally get to hang out, just the two of us.
Yeah.
You sure you're okay giving up your Friday night to hang with an old, almost married lady?
Oh, please. I'm so sick of the meat market scene.
Guys are like the subway.
You miss one, another one comes along in five minutes.
Unless it's the end of the night and then you get on anything.
Hey-oh!
Compliments of that guy.
Really?
Sweet.
Oh, for you it's $6.
Oh, yes, that's one drawback to being engaged.
I'm sure that's why he didn't...
Hey.
Oh, hello.
So, uh... did you just get in from Detroit?
Japan.
Okay, carousel 4 is tapped out.
Ready? Because I'm about to drop some knowledge.
Cute girls are not from Buffalo.
Time-out, 10:00.
You ready to rock this, Tedder?
All right, I think we need to refine our back story first. How did we...?
Ted, you klutzy great guy you.
- Hey, I'm Barney.
- Hi.
- My God, are you okay?
- I am so sorry.
It's fine. No, you were shaky on your landing. I give you a 9.2.
Ooh. Hi. I'm Ted.
I'm Laura.
Look, I'm really sorry that we have to hit and run, but we've got a plane to catch.
- Where you headed?
- Philadelphia.
Philly? That's where we're headed.
You are?
Well, then we'll see you on the plane.
Yes, you will.
Follow them. Ticket's on me.
No. Barney!
Don't you get on that escalator!
And don't you dare get on that subsequent escalator!
Studying law.
Making a responsible choice for my future.
On Friday night.
Being a lawyer had better be awesome.
Whazzup, Ted?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Hey, guess where I am. I'm on a... ready?
Plane to... ready? Philadelphia.
That is awesome.
Hey, is that Marshall?
Marshall, stop whatever you're doing, get in that hoopty-ass Fiero of yours
and come meet us in Philly. It's going to be legendary.
Man, I wish I could, guys...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I sent you some pictures on my phone. Check it.
Philly.
Admit it: you're having fun.
This much fu... 35,000 feet of fun.
Well, I didn't think I'd be flying to Philadelphia when I woke up this morning, I'll give you that.
Attaboy. Let's go talk to those girls.
Whoa, whoa, the seat belt sign's on.
Ted, you've been living your whole life in a seat belt.
It's time to unclick.
- Sir, the seat belt light's on.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Well, I grew up in Park Slope.
Oh, I love Park Slope. When did you move to Manhattan?
You're from Park Slope?
Uh, no, she is.
So where are you from?
Heaven?
Yeah, I'm a ghost.
I died 15 years ago, like that pickup line.
Hey-oh!
God, I'm so sorry.
Oh, believe me, I've been there.
I have this line that I use when guys come...
Check it out.
Hey...
You take this one. I'll save it for the next one.
So what brings you guys to Philly?
We're visiting our boyfriends.
I think hers is going to propose this weekend.
Isn't that great?
So great.
So there we were:
stuck on an airplane to Philadelphia with two very un-single girls,
all thanks to your Uncle Barney.
Aren't they cute?
They're both linebackers for the Eagles.
Both?
Both of their boyfriends are linebackers.
You're going to Philly? Why?
I didn't ask.
Well, it's sounds like you're having a lot more fun than I am.
I'm just talking to guy's backs while they hit on Robin.
Yeah, I bet she gets that a lot.
Don't you bet I get that a lot?
Not with a ring on your finger.
I mean, you know, guys see the ring, it's like ka-chong, Marshall parking only.
Oh, of course. That's it, the ring.
I guess I'm not used to it yet.
Oh, it's totally the ring. If you took that ring off your finger,
you'd have a ton of guys crowding your junk.
I'm not gonna take off my ring.
Wouldn't you be jealous of guys swarming all over my beeswax?
Oh, yeah, you know me-- I'm the jealous type.
Any goon so much as looks at you, I'll sock him in the kisser.
No. Seriously, you girls have a good time tonight.
Bye.
Robin!
Robin!
Hey, I'm over here.
G-G-Goin' to Philly!
Marshall, don't come to Philly.
But we're on an adventure.
We're on a tarmac in Philadelphia. Crazy... adventure.
Fine.
No! No!
The night has just started.
Look, airport bar. Flight attendants.
They'll get your tray table in its full upright position.
Say what?!
Passengers Mosby and Stenson, please come with us, gentlemen.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Barney, I am going to kill you.
Don't say you're gonna kill someone in front of airport security.
Not cool, not cool.
This is an outrage!
We are international businessmen on very important international business trip.
I demand you release us immediately!
You demand?! No, no, no, no, no.
He does not demand. We-We-We-We have no demands.
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to remain calm.
Okay. Yeah, I'm calm. I'm totally calm.
We've got footage of you placing two bags on JFK carousel 3,
and abandoning them to purchase a last-minute flight with cash.
Those bags were your responsibility.
- They were your bags!
- Sir, please.
We're assessing the bag situation.
Look, this is all just... It's a misunderstanding.
Please.
We are international businessmen.
My colleague accidentally left the bags there.
Now, please let us go before we miss our international business meeting.
Can't remember the last time I saw an international businessman with an untucked shirt.
In addition, we received this footage taken over the last few months.
Believe it or not, that duffel bag thing worked.
The truth is, my friend--
he does this thing where he goes to airports with fake luggage
to pick up girls, and we followed some here to Philadelphia.
That-That-That's it. That's all this is.
Nobody's that lame.
Yes, he's that lame.
Tell him you're that lame.
- We are international businessmen.
- Oh, come on!
Sir, lower your voice, or I will restrain you.
Dude, seriously, relax.
We at least get to call our lawyer.
Exactly!
We have a lawyer?
Listen to me-- you're both American citizens.
Dot let him pull any Patriot Act voodoo.
You both retain the right to refuse to answer any questions without an attorney present,
so don't say anything until I get there, all right?
Okay. Good-bye.
Philly!
The adventure continues!
Destroy!
It's ridiculous in here. Why don't we go somewhere else?
No, this place is great.
What are you doing?
What?
With your lips and everything?
My lips are always like this.
You had to play the race card.
Oh, relax, Ted. We didn't do anything wrong.
And, B.T.W., we'd be out of here by now if you had tucked in your shirt.
Go ahead, JFK. What is the baggage status?
They're clean.
It's just a whole bunch of condoms.
And a PowerBar.
You're free to go.
Don't come to Philly.
Man, I'm almost halfway there.
Yeah, we just got released and we're heading back on the next flight.
Uh, meet us at McClaren's. Maybe we can still make last call.
Can't we just, just...
No, we can't just.
We're going home.
We're going to Sasha's.
Who the hell is Sasha?
Sasha.
She's having friends over for drinks at her house.
It's gonna be legen... wait for it--
and I hope you're not lactose-intolerant 'cause the second half of that word is... dary!
- No.
- Legendary.
Legendary. That sounds awesome.
No, Marshall, we're going back.
Fine.
Hold on. I have another call.
- Hello?
- Marshall, we're going to Sasha's.
No, we're not.
- Ted, Ted, Ted.
- Right here.
Yes, we are.
Sorry, buddy-- two against one.
Ooh, look, a booth opened up.
Really?
Yeah, I thought we could finally go talk...
and you're not listening to me, so I'm going to walk away.
Yeah, yeah, booth.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I'm engaged. You know, I'm sorry.
I took my ring off. It's very, very sweet of you to come over and talk to me, but I just...
Yeah, I'm gay.
I just came over to let you know that you sat on a grape.
Oh, damn it.
So Barney and I hit the town. Philadelphia, PA.
Our first and only stop:
Sasha's party.
So, uh... you're Sasha's friends, uh?
You know it.
You guys, keep the volume down.
You're gonna wake my grandpa.
Who wants hard lemonade?
Philly!
Shh!
Philly.
Back at the bar, girls' night out wasn't going as Robin had hoped.
Lily's phone.
Robin, uh, where's Lily?
She's, uh...
Is she talking to some hot guy?
Oh, you can tell me. It's totally cool. It was my idea.
Hell, I told her she could take the ring off.
Really? Well, I thought it was kind of weird, but if you're cool with it,
yeah, uh, it's off, and she's talking to some guy.
- Do you want me to go over and...
- No, no, don't interrupt.
It's awesome.
So, the ring's really off, huh?
It's awesome.
Well, just tell her I called.
And tell her that she is... awesome.
Really, really awesome.
Our relationship is built on mutual trust.
I can't breathe.
You hear that, Ted?
Dana works security at the Liberty Bell.
I do okay.
Wow, it must be really well cordoned off over there.
Do you ever go behind the rope and touch it?
Only all the time.
You ever, like, stick your head inside it?
Yeah.
You ever lick it?
Nope.
I have never licked it.
I bet nobody in history has ever licked the Liberty Bell.
If someone were to pull that off, I dare say it would be...
what's the word?
Well, this is my stop.
Legendary. Ted, legendary.
Barney, I'm going to the airport. Sasha, thank you,
and, uh, tell your grandpa I'm sorry I walked in on him in the bathroom.
I'll get some club soda for that stain.
Lily, I thought tonight was about us hanging out.
What are you doing?
Just fending off the advances of that totally hot guy.
- Dude, I think that guy is gay.
- Oh, I know that guy is gay.
It's just, Marshall and I have been together for nine years.
I haven't been single since high school.
You want to be single?
You want to fight off loser guys all night?
Does that seem like fun to you?
I guess I just wanted to throw this net back into the ocean
and see how many fish I could catch.
So far, one. One gay dolphin.
And Marshall.
Lily, all these girls here tonight are all hoping to catch what you've already got.
You're right. I know.
Hey, do you want to go get coffee and have an actual conversation?
If by "coffee" you mean "cheesecake," then yes.
Hey, I got that club soda.
Let's see that booty.
Oh, thank you so much.
You want to mess, pal?
That's my fiancée's hot backside that you're dabbing.
Marshall, no.
Baby, please, don't ever take that ring off again, no matter how awesome I say that it is.
- It's okay, man...
- Back off, hombre!
I'm not that afraid to fight you.
You want to test this guy, be my guest, come on.
Marshall, he's gay.
Oh, thank God. I've never been in a fight before.
You don't say.
So, it turned out Uncle Marshall really was the jealous type.
Unfortunately, that guy's boyfriend--
also the jealous type.
Hey!
Could have licked the Liberty Bell.
We're going to the airport.
Bong...
bong...
Why do I hang out with you? Why?
All I wanted was to have a regular beer at my regular bar
with my regular friends in my regular city.
Ted, Ted, Ted.
You're not even looking.
No, I'm not.
Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness, okay?
Not for the sit around and wait of happiness.
Now, if you want, you can go to the same bar, drink the same beer,
talk to the same people every day, or you can lick the Liberty Bell.
You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it.
That was beautiful, man.
Thanks, Leonard.
Ted, you're missing out on a valuable life lesson here.
Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay?
I know how to live.
If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell, just go lick it yourself.
No, it has to be the two of us.
Why? Why do you need me?
Because you're my best friend, all right?
You don't have to tell me I'm yours,
but the way I see it, we're a team.
Without you, I'm...
I'm just the Dynamic Uno.
So, fine, if you wanto go home, then we'll go home.
Fine.
We'll go lick the Liberty Bell.
Good 'cause we're here.
I had no idea how Barney redirected the cab without me knowing, but we got out,
Dana let us in, and by God, we licked the Liberty Bell.
You know what it tastes like?
What?
Freedom.
No, actually, it tastes like pennies.
Oh, my God.
Did you guys really do that?
We really did.
And that was when I realized why I hung out with Barney.
I never got where I thought I wanted to go,
but I always got a great story.
So, that girl you were talking to-- that was Mom?
Kids, every story in a man's life is like a dot in an Impressionist painting...
So that's a no?
Yeah, that's a no.
What? Come on!

L'an 2030
Quand on est célibataires,
on cherche l'âme soeur,
mais une seule de vos histoires
se terminera ainsi.
Dans les autres, quelqu'un est blessé.
Voici une de ces histoires.
- Et elle commence par une chemise.
- Une chemise ?
Écoutez bien.
<i>Rien de cela ne serait arrivé</i>
<i>s'il n'y avait pas eu cette chemise.</i>
- Belle chemise.
- N'est-ce pas ?
Regardez ces couleurs.
Le vert et le brun, enfin réunis.
- Belle chemise, frérot. C'est nouveau ?
- C'est ça qui est drôle.
J'ai cette chemise depuis, quoi, six ans.
Jusqu'à ce matin, je la détestais,
mais là, mes goûts ont changé.
- Crotte de nez.
- Oui, salut, Barney.
Barney m'a offert 50 $ pour que je dise
des stupidités lors d'un reportage.
Pas des stupidités. ''Crotte de nez''.
- Je ne le ferai pas. Je suis journaliste.
- Quoi ? Journaliste ?
Tu dis des banalités à la fin des nouvelles :
les aînés, les bébés, les singes.
Ce n'est pas du journalisme.
C'est juste un cadeau dans une couche.
Pour ton information, je vais être affectée
- à l'hôtel de ville.
- L'hôtel de ville. Madame !
Je ne jouerai pas ma promotion
en disant ''crotte de nez'' pour 50 $.
Bien sûr que non.
Maintenant ce sera ''téton'' pour 100 $.
Laisse-toi séduire.
À qui est ce bourbon ?
Je l'ignore. ll était là quand on est arrivés.
On dirait que j'aime le bourbon à présent.
J'aurais juré que je détestais ça.
D'abord la chemise,
maintenant le bourbon.
J'ai passé 27 ans à prendre des décisions,
n'est-ce pas ?
Le film que j'ai vu et détesté,
la ville que je ne visiterai plus
car il a plu la 1re fois.
ll est peut-être temps
d'avoir une seconde opinion.
Tu vas finalement regarder Les Goonies
à nouveau ?
''Cinoque aime Choco.''
Pas Les Goonies. Les filles.
Et si quelqu'un de mon passé,
qui ne me convenait pas à l'époque,
était en fait, tout comme cette chemise,
parfaite pour moi ?
Un instant. Deux raisons sont acceptables
pour que tu sortes avec une ex :
implants mammaires.
Ce n'est pas une mauvaise idée.
Réfléchissons.
Les plus grands succès de Ted.
- Et cette fille, Steph ?
- Steph.
C'est un peu difficile à dire.
Quand je vivais à Los Angeles,
j'étais cassée.
J'ai donc fait des films pour adultes
pendant un mois.
Oh ! Tu en as fait combien ?
175.
Qu'on dise ce qu'on voudra du porno,
ils travaillent avec acharnement.
Et cette fille, Jackie ?
... et j'ai perdu mon maillot de bain.
Je sais ce que c'est. Quand j'avais 16 ans,
je conduisais
et j'ai renversé cet autostoppeur.
J'ignore ce qui lui est arrivé.
J'ai poursuivi ma route.
Euh... Non!
Et Natalie ?
- Natalie !
- Natalie !
Qui est Natalie ?
<i>Natalie. J'avais tant
d'agréables souvenirs d'elle .:</i>
<i>les bougies sur son buffet,</i>
<i>la collection de singes en tricot sur son lit,</i>
<i>la chanson de Belle and Sebastian
qu'elle écoutait sans cesse,</i>
<i>son sourire.</i>
Je ne l'ai pas vue depuis, quoi, trois ans.
Pourquoi avez-vous rompu ?
Je ne voulais pas m'engager, à l'époque.
Mais là,
un engagement ne semble pas si mal.
Je devrais peut-être l'appeler.
Qu'en dites-vous ?
Tu as laissé tomber
une vedette de film porno ?
Notre amitié est terminée.
Notre amitié est terminée !
Entrez. D'accord, rappelez-moi.
- Vous vouliez me voir, M. Adams ?
- Oui, en effet.
J'aimerais vous confier un reportage.
C'est à l'hôtel de ville.
L'hôtel de ville ? Oh, mon Dieu.
À votre visite à l'hôtel de ville,
arrêtez-vous au plus ancien vendeur
ambulant de hot-dogs de New York.
Aujourd'hui, un délicieux hot-dog
vous coûtera 2,50 $,
mais en 1955, les premiers hot-dogs
se vendaient seulement
pour un téton.
C'était Robin Scherbatsky en direct
pour Metro News 1 .
J'ai dit ''téton'' aux infos.
Pas très professionnel.
J'ai dit ''téton'' aux infos !
C'est mieux que ''crotte de nez''.
Crotte de nez.
La voici.
Fait-il froid ici ?
Car je vois les tétons de Robin.
Maintenant, ton prochain défi.
ll n'y aura pas de prochain défi.
Peu importe ce que tu m'offres.
Trouve ta motivation, Robin.
On sait que ce n'était pas pour l'argent.
C'est vrai que Metro News 1
ne paye pas fort.
Et quelques billets font l'affaire
de toi, moi et tout le monde.
Sérieusement, qui parle comme ça ?
La jolie aime se payer la tête
des dirigeants financiers
qui la sous-estiment
et qui ne l'ont pas encore promue.
Donc, pour deux autres billets de 100 $,
la jolie regardera la caméra
et dira ceci.
Je ne fais que supposer.
Je dois retourner au travail.
- À la prochaine.
- Au revoir.
La jolie va y réfléchir.
Je l'ai. J'ai trouvé le numéro de Natalie.
Salut, Ted. Belle chemise.
On est déjà hier ?
Merci.
Je l'appelle. C'est fou.
Je ne lui ai pas parlé depuis trois ans.
J'ignore si elle se souvient de moi.
- Allô ?
- Natalie.
- C'est Ted Mosby.
- Va au diable !
Elle se souvient de moi.
- Pourquoi elle te raccrocherait au nez ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- As-tu couché avec sa soeur ?
- Non.
- As-tu couché avec sa mère ?
- Non.
Ton histoire m'intéresse moins.
Tu as dû faire quelque chose.
Pourquoi avez-vous rompu ?
ll n'était pas prêt à s'engager.
Et son anniversaire
devait approcher.
Je ne voulais pas donner
un cadeau sentimental
à une fille que j'allais laisser tomber.
Tu l'as laissée tombée juste
avant son anniversaire ?
Non ! Je ne l'ai pas laissée tomber
juste avant son anniversaire.
<i>Natalie ! Salut, bon anniversaire!</i>
<i>Écoute...</i>
Ne rompt jamais avec une fille
le jour de son anniversaire !
Lily, je t'en prie ! La chemise !
Je sais ! C'était une erreur.
- A-t-elle beaucoup pleuré ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Comment tu ne sais pas...
Tu n'as pas fait ça.
<i>Natalie ! Salut, bon anniversaire !</i>
<i>Écoute,</i>
<i>tu es géniale.</i>
<i>Tu es vraiment géniale.</i>
<i>Je suis très occupé, ces jours-ci,</i>
<i>alors, peut être qu'on devrait...
se rappeler un de ces jours.</i>
<i>Mais tu es géniale.</i>
- Sur son répondeur !
- Ça va.
- Le jour son anniversaire !
- Lily, voyons.
Qui rompt avec quelqu'un
sur son répondeur
- le jour de son anniversaire ?
- Ouais vieux, envoie un mail.
Ce n'est pas ça
que je voulais dire, Marshall.
C'est un très mauvais moyen de rompre.
Pour la défense de mon client,
existe-t-il un bon moyen de rompre ? Non.
Je préférerais apprendre
la nouvelle sur le répondeur
que de subir l'humiliation en personne.
C'est moins douloureux ainsi.
- Qui appelles-tu ?
- Allô, Marshall, c'est Lily.
Pas de sexe pour au moins un mois,
mais tu es génial. Salut.
C'était une grave erreur, Ted.
Tu aurais dû le faire en personne.
Merci.
Le sexe : ''s'il-te-plaît-ne-me-quitte-pas'',
c'est époustouflant.
C'était enfantin et stupide.
Je ne voulais pas la voir pleurer.
Eh bien, devine ? Elle a pleuré.
Tu n'avais pas assez de courage
pour voir ces larmes.
C'était le moi d'avant, d'accord ?
Voici le nouveau, avec une vieille chemise
et du courage, Ted.
- Je vais bien faire.
- Autre exemple ?
Le sexe : ''Ma petite soeur se marie
et je vais avoir 30 ans.''
Fantastique !
Un événement qui devait être joyeux
s'est terminé tragiquement
lorsque Ethel et Sadie Margolis,
les jumelles les plus âgées de New York,
sont mortes la veille
de leur 100e anniversaire de naissance.
Je suis vilaine, vilaine fille.
C'était Robin Scherbatsky en direct
pour Metro News 1 .
Joel Adams vous attend dans son bureau.
Avant que vous disiez quoi que ce soit,
sachez que j'aime travailler ici.
Super. Voici, mon chien fait...
Quoi ?
Vous avez des chiens, non ?
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Amenez-le chez le vétérinaire.
Génial. Je vous en dois une.
- C'est tout ?
- Oui.
- Rien à dire sur l'histoire des jumelles ?
- Oui. Bon travail.
New York vous adore.
Vous êtes une vedette. Bye Bye.
<i>C'est là que Robin a compris</i>
<i>que personne, ni même son patron,
ne regardait Metro News 1.</i>
Salut.
Natalie, allez. Je veux m'excuser.
Je suis venu
parce que tu n'as pas pris mon appel.
Voici une suggestion : Pourquoi
tu ne laisserais pas un message ?
Ah ah, elle est pas mal.
Ok, je vais laisser ce singe ici.
Au revoir.
D'accord. Écoute, écoute,
je sais que tu es fâchée,
mais bon anniversaire,
en retard de trois ans.
Oh, oui ?
Fais de l'air, en retard de trois ans.
Écoute, j'ai été idiot
de laisser ce message.
- Je sais que ça ne se fait pas.
- Non, tu ne le sais pas.
<i>peut être qu'on devrait...
se rappeler un de ces jours.</i>
<i>Mais tu es géniale.</i>
<i>Au revoir.</i>
Surprise !
ll y avait une fête surprise ce soir-là ?
Pourquoi personne ne me l'a dit ?
On pense que je ne peux pas
garder un secret, c'est faux.
Désolé. Là n'est pas la question.
Natalie, j'étais jeune et stupide,
effrayé par les engagements.
Et je suppose
que tu es prêt pour le mariage ?
Eh bien, oui, en fait.
Je suis différent, à présent.
Donne-moi une autre chance.
Tu crois sans doute que je n'ai
aucun respect pour moi.
Allez. Juste un café.
S'il te plaît, Natalie, donne-lui une chance.
On donne trop d'importance
au respect de soi.
Super !
C'était peut-être le café,
mais tu as vraiment amélioré
ta performance.
Merci. Je viens de m'abonner à Esquire.
lls ont des articles intéressants.
Le prochain est tiré du numéro d'octobre.
<i>Donc Natalie et moi avons
recommencé à se voir.</i>
<i>Et tout est revenu, comme ça :</i>
<i>les bougies,</i>
<i>les singes en tricot,</i>
<i>Belle and Sebastian. Tout.</i>
<i>On aurait dit que j'avais trouvé
mon âme soeur.</i>
Je m'en vais. J'ai un cours de Krav Maga
dans une demi-heure.
Krav Maga. N'est-ce pas génial
qu'elle fasse du Krav Maga ?
Merci, chéri.
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Sois prudente.
Vieux, c'est quoi le Krav Maga ?
Aucune idée. Une sorte de yoga ?
Natalie est une fille amusante.
C'est la meilleure depuis longtemps.
- Ne la laisse pas aller.
- Oui.
Je dois rompre avec elle.
Je ne comprends pas. Natalie est géniale.
Je sais. Elle est magnifique,
mais je dois rompre avec elle.
Pourquoi tu n'as pas laissé
cette pauvre fille tranquille ?
Je sais. Je déteste ça.
Ça a été 3 semaines superbes.
Je devrais être amoureux,
mais je ne ressens rien.
C'est... inexplicable.
Inexplicable. Bien dit.
Quand vas-tu le faire ?
Elle doit être dans le métro.
Appelle sa boîte vocale.
Bip. Rejetée. Clique. C'est fait.
Je dois lui dire en personne.
Je ne sais pas ce que je vais dire.
- ''Je ne suis pas prêt à m'engager.''
- C'est un cliché.
Ce n'est pas un cliché. C'est un classique.
C'est comme le Stairway to Heaven
des messages de rupture.
- Natalie mérite mieux que ça.
- Mieux.
ll n'y a pas de ''mieux'' en rupture,
juste des moins pires.
Un cliché en est un pour une raison.
C'est réconfortant.
Ça ne fait rien. Je lui ai déjà dit
que j'étais prêt à m'engager...
Mon Dieu, il n'y a pas d'issue.
Je vais devoir l'épouser.
Non, non. On va te sortir de là.
Que dites-vous de :
''Ce n'est pas toi, c'est moi'' ?
Six mots :
''Tu es grosse dans ces jeans.'' Tu es libre !
Ted, as-tu pensé lui dire la vérité ?
Chérie, c'est une affaire d'hommes.
Ted, quelle est la vérité ?
Pourquoi veux-tu rompre ?
La vérité ? Ce n'est pas la bonne.
- Dis-le-lui.
- Ne lui dis pas ça. C'est horrible.
Pourquoi ? Qu'y a-t-il de si horrible ?
Qu'y a-t-il de si horrible ?
Elle n'est pas la bonne.
Pourquoi est-ce si douloureux à entendre ?
Les chances d'être la bonne personne
pour l'autre sont
de six milliards contre un.
On a plus de chances de gagner au loto.
Exact. On ne le prendrait pas
personnellement si on perdait.
D'accord, vieux, dis-lui la vérité.
Elle va pleurer.
Oui, il va s'asseoir
et le prendre comme un homme.
- Je le ferai de façon mûre.
- Vous en voulez de la maturité ?
Je viens de finir un reportage
en klaxonnant avec mes seins.
Ça, c'est de la télé géniale pour tous.
D'accord, Scherbatsky, nouveau défi.
Et c'en est un gros,
tout comme la récompense.
Pour 1 000 $... Tu as bien compris.
Tu n'as qu'à te lever pendant le bulletin
et faire ceci.
- C'était quoi, ça ?
- Un lckey Shuffle.
En même temps, tu dis ceci :
''Elbert 'lckey' Woods, en 91,
les Bengals ont été idiots de te renvoyer.
''Tes courses de 1 395 mètres
''et tes 27 touchés resteront à jamais.
''Entraîneur Dave Shula, va te faire voir
ainsi que ta grilladerie minable.''
Écris-le-moi.
Qu'est-ce que j'en ai à faire ?
Personne ne regarde, non ?
Et elle va pleurer.
Cinoque aime Choco.
Merci, Lil.
<i>Le soir suivant, j'ai invité Natalie à souper</i>
<i>pour rompre avec maturité.</i>
Écoute, Natalie, je dois te dire une chose.
Attends, attends. Moi d'abord.
Aujourd'hui au bureau, j'ai reçu pas un,
pas deux, mais trois gâteaux d'anniversaire.
Ce soir, pouvons-nous oublier le dessert ?
- C'est ton anniversaire, aujourd'hui ?
- Oui.
Mais c'est rien. Je ne l'ai dit à personne.
C'est ton anniversaire, aujourd'hui !
- Je ne t'ai rien acheté.
- C'est pas grave.
Tu m'as donné
le meilleur cadeau possible :
je peux de nouveau faire confiance.
Ce n'est rien.
Encore beaucoup, beaucoup plus de vin.
Henry, en tant que le plus vieux
conducteur de calèche à New York,
vous en avez vu des choses.
<i>En 60 ans de carrière, quel est
votre souvenir le plus mémorable ?</i>
<i>Eh bien...</i>
- La voici.
- Nous y sommes.
Tout le monde,
portez votre attention vers la télévision.
Vous êtes sur le point de voir
une chose étonnante.
<i>Puis, en 72,</i>
<i>Mickey Mantle est monté
dans ma calèche pour la quatrième fois.</i>
Allez poupée, la grande finale.
<i>Mais le moment le plus excitant,</i>
<i>c'est celui-ci, présentement.</i>
<i>- Quoi ?
- Regardez-moi, je passe à la télé.</i>
<i>Je n'ai jamais pensé
que mon histoire serait racontée.</i>
<i>Merci, Mme Robin Scherbatsky.</i>
<i>Merci.</i>
<i>À ce moment précis, tante Robin a su
que son travail était important.</i>
<i>C'est un honneur
de raconter votre histoire, Henry.</i>
<i>Vous savez, Metro News 1 n'est
sans doute pas la chaîne la plus regardée,</i>
<i>mais cette journaliste est fière de...</i>
<i>Oh, mon Dieu,
je suis couverte de merde de cheval !</i>
<i>J'en ai dans les cheveux !</i>
<i>- Tu avais prévu ça ?
- Mon genou !</i>
Non, Marshall.
C'était au-delà de mes rêves les plus fous.
Si tu viens en Alabama,
ma mère organise d'immenses soupers
de langoustes,
et elle a hâte de te rencontrer.
Natalie, je dois te dire une chose,
et il n'y a pas de bonne façon de le dire.
Je veux rompre.
Je crois que tu n'es pas celle qu'il me faut.
Je ne veux pas te faire perdre ton temps,
car je t'aime bien.
Je veux être correct envers toi,
et le meilleur moyen,
c'est d'être honnête. Je suis désolé.
Laisse-toi aller.
Ce ne sont que des larmes.
Je ne suis pas celle qu'il te faut !
Désolé. Je pensais que la chose
à faire serait...
- C'est mon anniversaire.
- Je sais. Je ne le savais pas...
C'est mon anniversaire, et tu me dis
que je ne suis pas celle qu'il te faut ?
ll n'y a pas de quoi en faire un drame.
Ce sont les chances.
Tu as perdu au loto.
Sortir avec toi, c'est gagner au loto ?
- Non, non. C'est pas ce que j'ai voulu dire.
- Quel est le problème ?
- Je ne peux pas l'expliquer.
- Essaie.
- C'est... ineffable.
- C'est une... fable ?
Non, non, non. lneffable veut dire
que ça ne s'explique pas.
- Donc, je suis stupide ?
- Que se passe-t-il ?
Voici ce qui se passe :
tu m'as brisé le coeur
sur mon répondeur,
le jour de mon anniversaire.
Ça m'a pris trois ans à m'en remettre,
et à ce moment-là,
tu m'as retrouvée,
insisté pour sortir avec moi
pour me laisser tomber au bout
de trois semaines,
une fois de plus le jour
de mon anniversaire !
Non, ce n'est pas ça. J'ai juste...
- C'est...
- Quoi ?
C'est juste que je suis
très occupé, ces jours-ci.
<i>Souvenez-vous quand elle a dit...</i>
J'ai un cours de Krav Maga
dans une demi-heure.
<i>Eh bien, le Krav Maga n'est pas
une sorte de yoga,</i>
<i>mais un combat de rue de guérilla
mis au point par l'armée israélienne.</i>
De la part des deux hommes au bar.
De la part des deux hommes au bar.
- ''Mon genou ! ''
- ''J'en ai dans les cheveux ! ''
C'est bien que les gens regardent, non ?
- Oh, mon Dieu ! Ça va ?
- Qu'est-ce qui t'es arrivé ?
J'ai dit la vérité.
ll s'est avéré que la vérité a
toute une droite.
Oh, vieux.
Tu as fait la bonne chose.
Je suis fière de toi.
J'ai des hémorragies internes.
Tu sais
ce qui me remonte toujours le moral ?
La malchance des autres.
Tu as manqué quelque chose.
Pourrait-il y avoir une seule personne ici
qui l'ait manqué ?
Bien.
Ça va ?
Je pensais avoir bien agi cette fois.
Je pense qu'il n'y a pas de bonne façon.
Parfois, même si on essaie très fort
de bien agir,
on se retrouve sur le dos,
battant l'air dans la merde de cheval.
- Tu l'as vu ?
- J'ai lnternet sur mon téléphone.
Ça va.
<i>Ça s'est terminé comme ça avec Natalie.</i>
<i>Pas de fin heureuse.
Seulement de la douleur.</i>
<i>Comme par magie,
tous ces souvenirs ont fait place</i>
<i>à celui-ci.</i>
<i>Malgré cette mauvaise soirée,
Natalie s'est mariée dans l'année.</i>
<i>Elle a maintenant trois beaux enfants.</i>
<i>C'est l'envers de la peine.
Ça arrive parfois pour une raison.</i>
Super.
Tu t'es fait massacrer par une fille ?
C'est tout ce que vous retenez
de cette histoire ?
Tu t'es fait massacrer par une fille.
Elle pratiquait le Krav Maga.
Kids, when you're single all you're looking for is happily ever after.
but only one of your stories can end that way.
The rest end with someone getting hurt.
This is one of those stories, and it starts with a shirt.
A shirt?
Just listen, because none of this would have happened if it hadn't been for that shirt.
Nice shirt.
- Right? Right?
- Look at those colors.
Green and brown, together at last.
Hot top, bro!
Is it new?
That's the crazy part.
I've had this shirt for like six years.
Until this morning, I wasn't into it at all,
but now, it's like my tastes have changed.
- Booger.
- Yes, hello, Barney.
Barney's offered me 50 bucks to say some stupid word on a live news report.
Not some stupid word-- "booger."
But I'm not doing it.
I am a journalist.
What?! Journalist?!
You do the little fluff pieces at the end of the news.
Old people. Babies. Monkeys.
That's not journalism.
That's just... things in a diaper.
For your information, my boss is about to bump me up to...
the city hall beat.
City hall? Miss Thing.
So I'm not going to jeopardize my promotion by saying "booger" for 50 bucks.
Of course not.
'cause now you're saying "nipple," and it's a hundred.
Step into my web.
Whose bourbon is this?
Ooh, I don't know.
It was here when we sat down.
The point is...
I seem to like bourbon now.
I could've sworn I hated bourbon.
First the shirt, now bourbon.
I spent 27 years making up my mind about things, right?
The movie I saw once and hated;
the city I'll never go back to 'cause it was raining the day I visited.
Maybe it's time to start forming some second impressions.
You're finally gonna watch Goonies again?
"Sloth love Chunk."
Not Goonies-- girls.
What if there's someone from my past
who I thought was wrong for me at the time,
when in fact she, like this shirt,
is actually a perfect fit?
Hold up.
There are only two reasons to ever date a girl you've already dated:
Breast... implants.
You know, this isn't a bad idea.
Let's think...
Ted's greatest hits.
What about that girl Steph?
Steph...
Okay, this is difficult to say:
Back when I lived in L.A., I was pretty broke so I spent a month making adult films.
Wow. Okay...
H-How many did you make?
A hundred and seventy-five.
Say what you will about the porn industry, they're hard workers.
What about that chick, um... Jackie?
...and my bathing suit had fallen completely off.
I know the feeling.
Once...
when I was 16, I was driving, and I hit this hitchhiker.
Don't know what happened to him--
just kept driving.
Uh... no.
What about Natalie?
Natalie...
- Who's Natalie?
- Natalie.
I had so many fond memories of her:
The tea candles on her dresser, the sock monkey collection on her bed,
that one Belle & Sebastian song she always listened to, her smile...
Man, I haven't seen her in, like, three years.
Well, why'd you guys break up?
I just wasn't looking for a big commitment at the time.
Of course, now a big commitment doesn't seem so bad.
Maybe I should call her.
What do you guys think?
You dumped a porn star?
Friendship over.
Friendship over!
Come in!
All right, get back to me, then.
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Adams.
- Yes, I did.
I need you to cover a story.
It's down at city hall.
City hall?
Oh, my God.
So, next time you're passing city hall,
make sure and stop by New York's oldest hot dog cart.
Today, a delicious hot dog will cost you $2.50,
but back when the stand first opened, in 1955,
you could get one for only a nipple.
Reporting live, Robin Trubotsky, Metro News One.
I said "nipple" on the news.
That was so unprofessional!
I said "nipple" on the news!
At least it's better than "booger."
Booger.
There she is.
Hey, is it cold in here?
'Cause I can kinda see Robin's nickels.
Now, for your next challenge...
There is not going to be another challenge.
I don't care how much you offer me.
Oh, search your soul, Robin.
You and I both know this wasn't about the money.
Sure, Metro News One pays you jack,
and, hey, a little green salad on the side is good for you, me, and Mr. McGee.
Seriously, who talks like that?
What baby really likes is the thrill of pulling one over
on those bean-counters who underappreciate you,
and still haven't promoted you,
and so for two more hundie sticks,
baby's going to look in the camera and say this.
I'm just assuming.
I gotta get back twork.
- See ya.
- Bye.
Baby's gonna think about it.
Found it!
I found Natalie's number.
Hey, Ted! Nice shirt!
Is it yesterday already?
I am calling her.
This is crazy.
I haven't talked to her in, like, three years.
Wonder if she even remembers me.
- Hello?
- Natalie.
- It's Ted Mosby.
- Go to hell.
She remembers me.
Why would Natalie hang up on you?
- I don't know.
- Did you sleep with her sister?
No.
- Did you sleep with her mom?
- No.
I'm losing interest in your story.
Well, you must have done something.
Why did you guys break up?
He wasn't ready for a commitment.
And her birthday might've been coming up.
Okay, so I didn't want to get a boyfriend-level gift for a girl I was just about to break up with.
So you dumped her right before her birthday?
No, I didn't dump her right before her birthday.
Natalie! Hey.
Happy birthday.
Listen... :
- Never break up with a girl on her birthday!
- Lily, please! The shirt!
I know!
It was a mistake!
- Well, did she cry her eyes out?
- I don't know.
How do you not...?!
- You didn't.
- Natalie! Hey, happy birthday.
Listen...
You're awesome.
You really are.
Awesome.
I'm just like super-busy right now, so...
maybe we should just... call it a day.
But you're awesome.
On her answering machine!?
- And on her birthday?!
- Lily, come on.
Oh, who breaks up with somebody on their answering machine on her birthday?!
Yeah, dude. E-mail.
Not exactly the point I was trying to make, Marshall.
That is a terrible way to break up with someone.
Okay, in my client's defense,
is there an unterrible way to break up with somebody? No.
Personally, I'd rather hear the bad news on an answering machine than face the humiliation in person.
It's the least painful way you can do it.
- Who are you calling?
- Hi, Marshall, it Lily.
We're not gonna have sex for at least a month, but you're awesome.
Okay, bye-bye.
No, that was a big mistake, Ted.
You should've done it in person.
Thank you.
Desperate, please-don't-leave-me sex is amazing.
Okay, it was childish and stupid.
I just...
I didn't want to see her cry.
Well, guess what?
She cried.
You just didn't have the sack to face those tears.
That was me then, okay?
This is the new, old-shirt- wearing, sack-having Ted.
I'm gonna make this right.
You know what else?
"My younger sister just got married and I'm about to turn 30" sex.
Fantastic.
An occasion that was supposed to be joyous,
suddenly turned tragic when Ethel and Sadie Margolis,
New York's oldest twins, suddenly passed away on this,
the eve of their 100th birthday.
I'm a dirty, dirty girl.
Reporting live, Robin Trubotsky, Metro News One.
Clear.
Joel Adams wants to see you in his office.
Before you say anything,
I just want to say I really like working here at Metro News One.
- That's great.
- So, my dog keeps going...
- What's...?
- What? You have dogs, right?
What do you think that means?
Take him to the vet?
Genius.
That's one I owe you.
- Was that all?
- Yeah.
And nothing about the twins story?
Oh, yeah, great job on that one.
New York loves you. You're a superstar. Bye-bye.
That's when Robin realized that no one, not even her boss, watched Metro News One.
Natalie! Come on!
I just want to say I'm sorry.
I only came down here 'cause you wouldn't take my call.
Hey, here's an idea--
Why don't you leave a message?
Good one.
Okay, fine, I'm just going to leave this sock monkey here.
Good-bye.
Look, look, look.
I know you're mad, but... happy birthday.
- Three years ago.
- Oh, yeah?
Up yours three years ago.
Look, look, I was an idiot leaving that message.
I realize how much that sucked.
No, you don't.
Maybe we should just call it a day.
But you're awesome.
Okay, bye.
Surprise.
There was a surprise party that night?
How come nobody told me?
People think I can't keep a secret, but I totally can.
Sorry, not the issue.
Look, Natalie, I was just a stupid kid back then, terrified of commitment.
And I suppose you're suddenly ready to get married and settle down.
Well, yeah, actually.
I'm a different guy now.
Give me another chance, huh?
You must think I have absolutely no self-respect.
Come on, just a cup of coffee.
Please, Natalie.
Give the guy a chance.
Self-respect is overrated.
Maybe it was the caffeine, but you really brought your game up to a whole new level.
Thanks.
I did just start subscribing to Esquire.
They have some helpful columns.
The following is from the October issue.
So Natalie and I started dating again.
And just like that, it all came back.
The tea candles... the sock monkeys...
Belle and Sebastian, all of it.
It seemed like happily ever after wasn't far off.
Well, I better run.
I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour.
Krav Maga. How cool is it that she does Krav Maga?
Thanks, honey.
- Bye, guys.
- Bye!
- Take it easy.
Dude, what's Krav Maga?
I have no idea.
Some kind of yoga?
You know, that Natalie, she's good times.
Yeah, she's, like, the best girl you've dated in years.
- Yeah, Ted, hold on to that one.
- Yeah.
I have to break up with her.
I don't get it, man.
Natalie's awesome.
I know, she's terrific, but I have to break up with her.
Why couldn't you leave that poor girl alone?
I know. I hate this.
These past three weeks have been great.
I should be in love with her, but I'm not feeling that thing.
- It's ineffable.
- Ineffable.
Good word.
So when are you going to do it?
She's probably on the subway by now.
You could call her voice mail:
Beep! "Dumped."
Click. Done.
No, I have to do this face-to-face.
I just, I don't know what I'm going to say.
"I'm not ready for a commitment."
- Oh, that's such a cliché.
- It's not a cliché, it's a classic.
It's the "Stairway to Heaven" of breakup lines.
Well, I think Natalie deserves better.
Better. There's no "better" in breaking up.
There's only "less awful."
A cliché is a cliché for a reason.
- It's comforting.
- It doesn't matter.
I already told her I am ready for a commitment, so...
Oh, my God. There's no way out.
I'm gonna have to marry her.
No, no, we're gonna get you out of this.
Okay, how about... "It's not you, it's me"?
Mm, mm, six words--
"You look fat in those jeans."
You're free to go.
Ted, have you considered telling her the truth?
Seriously, honey, men are working here.
Ted, what is the truth?
Why do you want to break up with her?
The truth?
She's not the one.
- So tell her that.
- Oh, you can't tell her that.
That's horrible.
Why? What is so horrible about that?
Yeah, what is so horrible about that?
She's not the one.
Why is that such a heartbreaking thing to hear?
The chances of one person being another person's "the one" are, like, six billion-to-one.
Yeah, you have better chances of winning the lottery.
Exactly!
You wouldn't take it personally if you lost the lottery.
All right, man, tell her the truth.
She's gonna cry.
Yeah, and he's gonna sit there and he's gonna take it like a man.
I have to do the mature thing.
Want to talk mature?
I just wrapped up a live newscast by honking my own boobs.
And great TV was had by all.
All right, Trubotsky, new challenge, and this one's big.
But so is the cash reward.
For $1,000-- you heard me--
all you have to do is get up there on the news and do one of these.
- What the hell is that?
- The Ickey Shuffle.
And as you do it, you say this:
Elbert "Icky" Woods, the Bengals were fools to cut you in '91.
Your 1,525 rushing yards and your 27 touchdowns will not be forgotten.
So Coach Dave Shula, screw you and your crappy steakhouse.
Just write it down for me.
What do I care?
It's not like anyone's watching, anyway, right?
Man, she's gonna cry.
It's the law of love, chunk.
Thanks, Lil.
So, the next night, I took Natalie out to dinner... to do the mature thing.
Look, uh, Natalie, there's something I have to say.
Oh, wait, wait.
There's something I have to say first.
Today, at work, I had not one, not two, but three birthday cakes.
So tonight, can we just skip the cake?
Today's your birthday?
Yeah. No, it's okay, I wasn't telling anyone about it.
Today's your birthday!
I...
I didn't get you anything.
Oh, it's okay.
You know, you've already given me the bt present of all.
I can trust again.
You're welcome.
Oh, sir, much more wine.
Henry, as New York's oldest hansom cab driver, you've seen quite a lot.
In your past 60 years on the job, what is your most exciting memory?
- Well...
- Ah, this is it.
Oh, boy, here we go.
Everyone, everyone, if I may direct your attention to the television.
You are about to see something amazing.
And then, in '72, Mickey Mantle rode my cab for the fourth time.
Come on, baby.
Bring it home.
But the most exciting moment--
that would have to be this one, right now.
What?
Look at me.
I'm on TV.
I never thought I'd have my story told.
Thank you, Miss Robin Trubotsky.
Thank you.
And right then, Aunt Robin realized how important her job truly was.
It's an honor to tell your story, Henry.
You know, Metro News One may not be number one in viewership,
but this reporter takes pride in...
Whoa! Oh...!
Oh, my God, I'm covered in horse crap!
Oh, my God, it's in my hair.
- You planned that?
- No, Marshall.
That was beyond my wildest dreams.
So, if you ever come to Alabama,
my mom throws the huge crawfish boils,
and she's just dying to meet you, by the way.
Look, Natalie, there's something I have to say, and, uh, there's no good way to say it.
I want to break up.
I don't think you're the one for me.
I don't want to waste your time, because I really like you.
I want to do right by you, and I think the best way for me to do that is just to be honest.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God, just let it out.
They're only tears.
I'm not the one for you?!
I'm sorry, I just... I-I-I thought the mature thing to do...
- It's my birthday!
- Yes, I know.
I didn't realize...
It's my birthday, and you're telling me I'm not the one for you?!
It's really not such a big deal.
I mean, the odds--
It's like you lost the lottery.
Oh, so dating you is like winning the lottery?!
No, no, no, no, I didn't mean that.
- Okay, so what's the problem?!
- I... I... I can't explain it.
- Try!
- It's... ineffable.
I'm not effable?
No, no, no, no. "Ineffable."
Ineffable means it can't be explained.
- Oh, so I'm stupid?
- Oh, God, what's going on?
Okay, what's going on is you broke my heart over my answering machine on my birthday,
waited three years for me to get over you,
tracked me down, begged me to go out with you again,
only so you could dump me three weeks later, again, on my birthday!
No, it's-it's-it's not like that.
- I'm just... it's-it's-it's...
- What?!
I'm just, like, so busy right now.
Remember when Natalie said...
I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour.
Turns out Krav Maga is not a kind of yoga.
It's a form of guerilla street fighting developed by the Israeli army.
This is compliments of those two gentlemen at the bar.
My knee!
It's in my hair!
But isn't nice to know people are watching?
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?
What happened to you?
I told the truth.
Turns out the truth has a mean roundhouse kick.
Oh, man.
Oh, well, you did the right thing.
- I'm proud of you.
- I'm bleeding internally.
Hey, Ted, you know what always picks me up when I'm down?
Other people's misfortune.
You missed something so amazing.
Please, can we just have one person in this whole bar who didn't see it?
Fine.
Are you okay?
I really thought I was doing it the good way this time.
I guess there is no good way.
Sometimes, no matter how hard you try to do the right thing,
you just end up flat on your back,
flailing around in a big pile of horse crap.
- You saw it?
- My phone gets the Internet now.
And that's how it ended with Natalie.
No happily ever after, just a whole lot of hurt.
And just like that, all those wonderful memories were replaced... by this one.
But, you know, bad as that night was,  within a year, Natalie was married.
And now she has three beautiful children.
So that's the upside of hurt.
Sometimes it happens for a reason.
So you got beat up by a girl?
Is that all you're taking away from this story?
You got beat up by a girl.
Hey, she knew Krav Maga.

Alors les enfants, vous voulez entendre
l'histoire du soir où je suis devenu sourd ?
- Pourquoi le demander ?
- Il le fera de toute façon.
Ça, c'est sûr !
Tout a commencé
<i>quand Robin est entrée dans le bar
et a dit...</i>
- Dis que tu es mon esclave.
- Je suis ton esclave.
Pourquoi, cette fois ?
Parce que ce soir,
je nous fais tous entrer chez... "Okay".
Okay ? Super !
Qu'est-ce qui se passe,
j'ai eu une attaque ou quoi ?
"Okay", c'est le nom d'une discothèque.
C'est censé être incroyablement privilégié.
Un ami a déjà attendu dehors
deux heures sans entrer.
Un ami nommé Toi ?
Non, un ami nommé Ferme-la !
Ouais bon,
Le proprio s'entraîne à mon gymnase.
Apparemment,
il m'adore comme journaliste.
Alors je suis sur la liste de ce soir !
Bravo, Scherbatsky !
Tu deviens un nom célèbre
long et difficile à épeler.
Il me fera entrer dans la section V.I.P.
Oui, il veut te montrer son V.I.P.,
si tu vois ce que je veux dire...
Ok et que veut dire V.I.P.
dans ton univers ?
Eh bien, je sais que le P. veut dire "pénis".
Donc, vous pouvez venir.
J'invite Marshall et Lily ?
<i>Pourquoi était-ce drôle ? Je vous explique.</i>
<i>Vous voyez, Lily était prof de maternelle.</i>
<i>Et pendant une sieste...</i>
Austin et moi avons passé
la soirée de samedi
dans un gîte touristique charmant.
C'était si agréable.
Qu'as-tu fait ce weekend ?
- Bois ! Bois ! Bois ! Bois !
- Vas y bois, bois, boooiiis !
- Dix secondes !
- Je vous emmerde, bande de perdants !
J'ai relaxé avec mon fiancé.
Je ne sais pas, je me suis sentie gênée.
Claire a mon âge, et son mari et elle font
des activités d'adultes raffinées.
Peut-être qu'on devrait faire
des activités d'adultes.
Ce qu'on a fait ce matin était
pas mal adulte.
Oui, mais ce n'était pas raffiné.
On devrait faire
une dégustation de vins et fromages.
J'aime le vin. J'aime déguster.
Et je peux faire la fête. D'accord.
Faisons-le. En adultes !
Depuis, elle l'a inscrit
à des clubs de lecture,
- à des cours de cuisine.
- Ce qu'on fait
quand on sait avec qui on couchera
les mille prochaines fois.
Alors, Lily et Marshall ne viendront pas.
Compris. Bon, Ted,
la deuxième partie de l'histoire:
Mon amie Kelly y sera.
- Kelly, que je suis supposé adorer.
- Oh, tu vas l'adorer.
Elle est drôle, intelligente,
et vit au jour le jour.
Traduction: Elle est laide, elle est laide,
elle est vraiment laide.
- Oh, et elle est très sexy.
- D'accord.
Je pourrais m'occuper d'elle une soirée.
As-tu d'autres amies sexy et célibataires ?
Non. Kelly travaille dans...
- Oh, non, Ted ! Ton veston.
- Quoi ? Quoi ? Quoi ?
Il est beaucoup trop joli. Je l'adore.
Merci.
...Et ses cheveux étaient parfaits.
Hé ! On porte la même chose.
Oh, non, c'est le reflet
de mes vêtements sur les tiens.
Une des 24 similarités
entre les filles et les poissons,
c'est qu'ils sont attirés
par les objets brillants.
Tu ne lis jamais mon blog, hein ?
D'accord, l'Homme de fer blanc.
Bon, amusez-vous bien
à votre discothèque.
- Qu'est-ce qui leur arrive ?
- Marshall et moi, on vieillit.
Oui, et ça va être amusant.
Ce soir, on va déguster des vins
qu'on va combiner à des fromages fins.
Ça alors !
Qui aurait cru
qu'une relation hétérosexuelle
pouvait rendre un gars aussi gai.
Bon, les gens cool s'en vont.
Grand-papa, grand-maman,
ne nous attendez pas.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Il y a des filles superbes ici, ce soir.
Bon. Voici notre stratégie pour draguer:
Trouve une fille, colle-la
et frotte-toi dessus
jusqu'à ce qu'elle soit à moi.
Tes stratégies ont-elles déjà marché ?
La question, c'est:
N'ont-elles déjà pas marché ?
La réponse, c'est la moitié du temps.
Mes esclaves ! Regardez ça.
Ils sont avec moi.
On est aussi ses esclaves.
On va attendre ici.
Et avec le taux d'intérêt, de nos jours,
il faut une hypothèque
à taux fixe sur 30 ans.
- Oh, tout à fait.
- Oui.
Et toi, Marshall ?
Pensez-vous à une maison, à un bébé ?
Non, pour le bébé, on va attendre.
J'adore les bébés. Ils sont super.
Avec leurs bras grassouillets.
Mais j'aurais l'impression d'être vieux.
Comme une ancre nous maintenant
au même endroit.
Pour toujours.
Je suis enceinte de trois mois.
Il n'y a pas de quoi se sentir mal à l'aise.
Il n'y a pas de quoi l'être,
sauf si on le veut.
- Ça a l'air super, ici.
- Oui.
- Kelly est là ?
- Oui, ici, quelque part.
Trouvons-la et je vous la présente.
Ensuite, j'irai sûrement
dans la section V.I.P.
C'est si stupide et arbitraire,
- qui peut y entrer ou non.
- On peut y aller ?
Ce n'est pas si arbitraire.
- La musique est forte, ici.
- Tu crois ?
Ok, la musique est forte.
Voici Kelly !
Veux-tu qu'on aille quelque part
où on peut discuter ?
Oui !
...d'accord...
Trouves-tu ça étrange
que Ted ne m'ait pas invité avec lui ?
Pourquoi ? Tu préférerais être
dans une discothèque ?
Avec plein de bruit, de sueur et de...
C'est ça que tu veux ?
Et ça, c'est ce que tu veux ?
"Hypothèque à taux fixe sur 30 ans."
"Je suis enceinte de trois mois."
Là, il y a de quoi se sentir mal à l'aise.
- Commençons à boire.
- Pas si vite.
Pour que les tanins s'adoucissent,
il faut laisser le vin s'aérer
pendant 30 minutes.
Maudits tanins.
Comment as-tu connu Robin ?
Sagittaire !
Est-ce près de Westchester ?
J'adorerais en avoir une !
Juste une bière !
D'accord.
Sais-tu ce qu'ils font là ?
lls regardent l'échographie de Claire.
Je te jure
que même le bébé a l'air de s'ennuyer.
Allez. Ce n'est pas si pire.
On commence vraiment
à devenir leurs amis.
Claire et Austin nous ont invités
à leur soirée de fondue
samedi prochain.
Penses-tu vraiment m'exciter
avec de la fondue ?
On trempe des choses dans du fromage.
Comment ne pas aimer ça ?
D'accord, ça serait sûrement très bon.
Mais on tremperait des choses
dans du fromage avec des gens ennuyants.
Marshall, il est temps pour nous
de devenir adultes.
<i>Marshall savait qu'elle avait raison.</i>
<i>Il devait cesser d'agir comme un enfant.</i>
<i>Mais pas ce soir-là.</i>
<i>Notre appartement était
au troisième étage.</i>
<i>Je ne suis pas sûr
que cette partie de l'histoire soit vraie.</i>
<i>Mais l'oncle Marshall jure que c'est arrivé.</i>
Taxi !
Le nouvel album est génial.
Il est doux et harmonieux.
Pas sombre et lourd comme les autres.
Oh, oui.
Norah Jones ne cesse de s'améliorer.
S'il vous plaît, dites-moi
qu'on peut boire le vin.
Encore cinq minutes.
Je ne veux pas presser les tanins.
Maudits tanins.
Tu aimes cet endroit ?
Tu n'entends rien de ce que je dis,
n'est-ce pas ?
Je viens de l'espace !
On m'a mis dehors de Sea World
pour avoir baisé un dauphin !
Je mouille mon pantalon !
Non, non, je disais juste que...
<i>J'ai alors compris que les discothèques
n'avaient rien de génial.</i>
<i>Même qu'elles n'avaient rien de bien.
C'était des endroits pourris.</i>
<i>Je devais m'en aller.</i>
- Hé ! Robin !
- Salut !
- T'es dehors ?
- J'appelle le proprio.
On ne me laisse pas entrer
dans la section V.I.P.
Que fais-tu ici ?
Oh j'avais cette façon de bouger,
alors je suis venu ici pour qu'elle s'arrête.
Peux-tu me faire entrer ?
Super, une boîte vocale.
- Merci. À plus tard.
- Salut.
Allez ! Il vient d'arriver.
- Il est sans doute célèbre.
- Oh, oui.
N'y a-t-il pas un troisième frère Affleck ?
Keith ou Brian Affleck,
quelque chose du genre ?
Oh, mon Dieu !
On vient de voir Brian Affleck.
Ça ne me fait rien de ne pas entrer
dans la section V.I.P.
Je suis allée dans des tonnes
de sections V.I.P. Ce n'est pas la 1re fois.
Mais sérieusement, rappelez-moi.
Oh, je viens de sortir. Robin Scherbatsky.
Je suis sur la liste.
Le nom est déjà rayé. Désolé.
Mais je suis Robin Scherbatsky.
Journaliste pour le Canal 1.
Il y a un Canal 1 ? Faites la file.
Vous auriez dû entrer avec Brian Affleck.
Je m'en vais. Au revoir.
Attends, je ne peux pas voir son visage.
Elle est belle ?
Salut.
De beaux yeux.
Un beau sourire.
Elle n'est pas dans ta ligue.
Bonne du vestiaire,
ne lui rendez pas son veston !
Désolé, je blaguais.
Vous n'êtes pas une bonne.
Bonne du vestiaire, j'aime ça.
Je devrais l'écrire sur une affiche.
Attends. Que fais-tu ici ?
Lily t'a laissé venir ?
Lily ? On s'en fiche, non ?
- Tu es dans le pétrin.
- Ça, oui.
- Moi, je rentre.
- Non !
Je viens de risquer ma peau
pour faire la fête ici avec mon copain.
- Alors faisons la fête.
- D'accord.
Génial. Enfin, je n'aurai pas à attendre
une demi-heure pour un verre.
UNE DEMl-HEURE PLUS TARD...
Ouais !
Pas de tanins !
<i>Je ne peux pas croire
que j'aie oublié de dire ça.</i>
<i>C'est crucial dans l'histoire.</i>
<i>Plus tôt, Marshall était allé
chez le dentiste</i>
<i>pour une couronne temporaire.</i>
<i>Bon, alors...</i>
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH !
Quoi ?
Allez, viens !
Je reste !
Quoi ?
Marshall, ça va ?
<i>Je n'y étais pas,
alors les détails sont un peu nébuleux.</i>
Taxi !
- Salut.
- Salut.
Marshall vient de s'enfuir
de notre réception.
Peux-tu me faire entrer ? Je dois le tuer.
En fait, même moi, je ne peux pas entrer.
J'étais une idiote.
On me reconnaît une fois
et je me prends pour Julia Roberts.
Je ne suis pas une V.I.P.
je ne suis même pas une I.P.
Je suis juste un pauvre petit P.
assise dans la rue.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je prendrais un P. dans la boue
plutôt que Julia Roberts n'importe quand.
Barney est là.
Je m'en vais.
...cassé ma dent !
As-tu...
...une aspirine ?
Il y a peut-être...
un distributeur dans...
 ...les toilettes.
<i>À ce jour, je ne sais toujours pas
ce qui s'est passé.</i>
<i>Mais quand Marshall est revenu
un peu plus tard...</i>
- Dure soirée ?
- Oui.
Les discothèques sont censées être
amusantes ? Pourquoi je les déteste tant ?
Parce que d'habitude,
tout ce qu'on est censé aimer est pourri.
Comme les discothèques.
Ou les croisières.
- Ou la veille du jour de l'An.
- Ou le Super Bowl.
- Ou les parades.
- Ou les Rockettes.
- Ou les parades.
- Tu l'as déjà dit.
- Je déteste les parades.
- D'accord.
Il est parti en plein milieu
de notre réception. Ça ne se fait pas.
À moins, bien sûr,
de courir après quelqu'un
qui l'a déjà fait. Ça, je crois que ça va.
Je déteste prendre son parti.
Mais un vins et fromages ?
Que faites-vous samedi prochain ?
Une soirée Scrabble ?
Ne lis pas tes courriels.
Pourquoi essaies-tu de changer ?
À l'université, tu as montré tes seins
parce qu'on t'avait mise au défi.
Juste une fois pour le défi.
Les autres, c'était pour le plaisir.
Je ne suis plus à l'université.
J'aimerais bien redevenir cette personne,
mais on ne peut pas revenir en arrière.
- On peut juste aller en avant.
- Faux.
On peut aller où on veut.
La question, c'est: Où veux-tu aller ?
Je veux aller dans cette discothèque
et retrouver mon fiancé.
- Ça, tu ne peux pas le faire.
- Tu veux parier ?
Fais comme moi.
Hé ! Le grand.
Je t'ai dit de faire comme moi.
- Oui, s'il te plaît.
- Fais-le, fais-le.
- Fais comme elle.
- Tu dois le faire. Fais-le.
S'il te plaît.
C'étaient les plus beaux
et les seuls seins que j'aie vus.
Oui. Si tout le monde dit
qu'une chose est amusante,
ça ne l'est presque jamais.
- C'est vrai.
- C'est vrai.
D'après cette logique, si on avait,
disons, un rendez-vous...
On ne pourrait pas aller
à un endroit censé être amusant.
Oui. Allons renouveler notre permis.
- Puis, chez le dentiste.
- C'est horrible. D'accord.
D'accord.
Mais une question importante demeure.
Combien de manteaux crois-tu
que je puisse porter en même temps ?
Je vais par là, toi par là.
Allons-y. Pour la part de fromage !
Barney ? ?
- Barney.
- Ted.
- Prends ton manteau, on part.
- Quoi ?
Qu'est-il arrivé à la fille
sur qui tu te frottais ?
- C'était ma cousine Leslie.
- Quoi ?
Non. Non. Non. Ne ris pas, Ted.
Ça ne sera pas une histoire drôle
qu'on racontera dans quelques mois.
Je ne veux pas qu'on dise:
"Te souviens-tu,
"quand tu te frottais sur ta..." Non !
Et tu sais pourquoi ?
Parce que - italique -
cette soirée n'est jamais arrivée.
Et tu vas me promettre
que tu ne diras jamais
à personne ce qui est arrivé ce soir.
- Promets-le-moi.
- D'accord. Je te le promets.
Trouvons Marshall et partons, d'accord ?
Merci d'avoir sauvé ma soirée.
On se revoit bientôt ?
- Donne-lui un pourboire.
- Je n'avais pas de manteau.
En plus, par principe, les pourboires sont...
Histoire marrante :
Barney s'est frotté avec une fille ce soir...
D'accord !
Juste...
C'est un nouveau truc pratique.
<i>Donc, Marshall et Lily ont redécouvert
leur jeunesse.</i>
<i>C'était bien.</i>
<i>Puis, c'est devenu... déplaisant.</i>
Beurk.
Je suis très content
que vous soyez venus ce soir !
Je peux te dire quelque chose ?
Ça m'a un peu blessé
que vous ne m'ayez pas invité.
Je sais que les choses ont changé
depuis que je suis fiancé,
mais ça aurait été gentil de m'inviter.
- Désolé ! Je te croyais occupé.
- Ils ont mis de la bonne musique ce soir.
- Je veux dire, ces temps-ci...
- Je sais, on dirait
que soudainement,
on vit dans deux mondes différents.
Tu t'entends peut-être mieux avec Barney.
- Quoi ?
- Tu es fou ?
Tu crois que j'aime aller
dans des discothèques ?
Je préférerais aller à ton vins et fromages.
Oh, mon Dieu, je vais vomir !
Où est ma sacoche, où est... Non, ça va.
Le problème, c'est qu'on ne peut pas faire
d'activités de couple
sans être en couple.
Et je ne trouverai quelqu'un
qu'en sortant et en faisant
- des trucs de célibataires avec Barney.
- Quoi ?
Mais quand je la trouverai,
on aura des vins et fromages super.
C'est un bon plan.
Peut-être que ce sera
la jolie fille au vestiaire.
Oui. Peut-être.
<i>Ce n'était pas elle.</i>
Tu sais, Ted,
je ne le dis pas assez souvent,
- mais j'apprécie beaucoup...
- Cet endroit fait de bonnes salades.
So, kids, would you like to hear the story of the time I went deaf?
Why does he even ask?
I know, he's just going to tell us anyway.
I sure am.
It all began when Robin strolled into the bar and said...
Say you're my bitch.
I'm your bitch.
Why this time?
Because tonight I'm getting us all into Okay.
"Okay," awesome!
What's going on? Did I just have a stroke?
Okay is the name of a club.
Yeah, it's supposed to be incredibly exclusive.
This friend of mine once waited outside for two hours, couldn't get in.
A friend of yours named You?
No, a friend of mine named Shut Up.
Yeah, well, the owner goes to my gym.
It turns out that he is a fan of my reporting for Metro News One.
So now I'm on the list for tonight.
Nice going, Sherbotsky.
You're becoming a long and difficult-to-spell household name.
He's even getting me into the V.I.P. room.
Yeah, he just wants to show you his own V.I.P., if you know what I mean.
All right, what does V.I.P. stand for in your little universe?
Well, I know that "P" is Penis.
Great, so you guys are in. Should I invite Marshal and Lily?
Why was this funny?
I'll explain.
You see, Lily was a kindergarten teacher,
and so one fateful nap time...
Austin and I spent Saturday night at the most charming little bed and breakfast.
It was so nice.
What did you do this weekend?
Go, come on, chug, chug, chug!
Ten seconds!
Suck it, losers!
You know, quiet time with the fiancé.
I don't know, I just felt embarrassed.
Claire is my age and she and her husband do all this classy grownup stuff.
Maybe we should start doing some grownup stuff.
That's some pretty grownup stuff we did this morning.
Yeah, but it wasn't classy.
Maybe we should have a wine-tasting party.
I like wine.
I like tasting.
You know I can party. Let's do it. Let's rock it. Maturity style.
And ever since then she's been signing him up for book clubs, cooking classes...
All the things you do when you know where your next thousand lays are coming from.
So, no, Lily and Marshall will not be joining us.
Got it. Anyway, Ted, part two of my story:
My friend Kelly's going to be there.
Kelly, who supposedly I'm going to love.
Oh, you are going to love Kelly. She's fun, she's smart, she lives in the moment...
Translation: She's ugly, she's ugly, she ugs in the ugly.
Oh, and she's totally hot.
Okay, I guess I could take her off your hands for an evening.
Hmm...
So do you have any other hot, single friends?
No. Kelly...
Oh, no, Ted, your blazer!
What, what, what?
Somebody spilled gorgeous all over it.
- Love it.
- Thank you.
And his hair was perfect.
We're wearing the same shirt.
Oh, wait, no, that's just my shirt reflected in yours.
One of the 24 similarities between girls and fish
is that they're both attracted to shiny objects.
You really never read my blog, do you?
All right, tin man, let's hit it.
All right, well, have fun at your little disco, guys.
What the hell happened to these two?
Marshall and I are just growing up.
Yeah, it's going to be sweet, too.
Like tonight, we're tasting all these different wines,
pairing them up with these cool gourmet cheeses.
Wow, who knew being in a committed heterosexual relationship could make a guy so gay?
All right, cool kids are leaving now.
Grandma, Grandpa, don't wait up.
My, oh, my. There are some ferocious-looking cutlets here tonight.
All right, hookup strategy.
Colon, find a cutlet, lock her in early,
grind with her all night till she's mine.
Do these strategies ever work for you?
The question is: Do these strategies ever not work for me?
Either way, the answer is about half the time.
My bitches!
Check this out.
Um, they're with me.
Um, we're her bitches, too.
We'll wait here.
And with today's interest rate climate, you've got to go for the 30-year fixed mortgage.
- Oh, totally.
- Yeah.
So, Marshall, what about you?
You guys thinking house, baby?
Oh!
No, I think we're going to wait on the baby thing.
I mean, I love babies. Babies rule.
Pudgy arms and stuff...
But, uh, they make you old.
Kind of like this anchor weighing you down to one spot... forever.
I'm three months pregnant.
Not awkward, guys.
Not awkward unless we let it be awkward.
This place seems great.
Is Kelly here?
Yeah, she's around somewhere.
Uh, let's go find her. I'll introduce you guys.
Then I should probably duck into the V.I.P. room.
It's so stupid and arbitrary, isn't it? Who gets to be a V.I.P. and who doesn't?
Can we come?
It's not that arbitrary.
Whoa, this place is loud.
You think?
Think it was kind of weird that Ted didn't invite me out with him?
Why? You'd rather be out at some dance club, all noisy and sweaty, with the...
Is that what you want?
Is this what you want?
"30-year fixed mortgage... I'm three months pregnant."
That was awkward.
Let's start drinking!
Not so fast.
In order for the tannins to mellow, we should let it breathe for about 30 minutes.
Freaking tannins.
Do you know what they're doing in there right now?
They're watching Claire's ultrasound video.
And I swear to God, even the baby looks bored.
Come on, it's not that bad.
We're really starting to click with these guys.
Claire and Austin just invited us to their fondue fest next Saturday night.
Are you honestly trying to get me excited about fondue?
It's dipping stuff in hot cheese. What's not to love?
Okay, that does sound good.
But it's dipping stuff in hot cheese with boring people.
Marshall, it's time for us to grow up.
Marshall knew she was right.
He had to stop acting like a kid.
But not tonight.
Now, our apartment was on the third floor,
so I'm not sure if this part is actually true,
but Uncle Marshall swears it happened.
Taxi!
The new album is great.
It's all smooth and polished, not dark and heavy like the early stuff.
Oh, yeah, Nora Jones just gets better and better.
Please, tell me we can drink the wine now.
Five more minutes. We don't want to rush those tannins.
Freaking tannins.
I'm wetting my pants!
I think that's when I realized, clubs weren't awesome.
Clubs weren't even okay.
Clubs sucked.
I had to get out of there.
- Hey, Robin.
- Hey.
Why aren't you inside?
I'm calling the owner. There's a guy in there who won't let me in to the stupid V.I.P. room.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I had this move, so I came here to bust it.
Can you get me in?
Great. Voice mail.
Thanks, I'll see you!
Bye!
Oh, come on, he just got here.
He's probably famous.
Oh, yeah. Isn't there a third Affleck brother?
Keith Affleck or Brian Affleck or something?
Holy crap, we just saw Brian Affleck.
It's not like I care so much about getting into the V.I.P. room,
I have been in tons of V.I.P. rooms.
I'm not exactly a V.I.P. room virgin.
But seriously, call me back.
Oh, um, I was just in there, Robin Sherbotsky. I'm on the list.
Name's already crossed off. Sorry.
But I'm Robin Sherbotsky.
I'm a reporter for Channel One.
There's a channel one?
Back of the line.
Should have snuck in with Brian Affleck.
Aah! Coat wench, do not uncheck that man's jacket!
Sorry, just being dramatic. You're not a coat wench.
No, no, no, coat wench, I like it.
I should get a sign made up.
What are you doing here? Lily let you go?
Lily? Who cares, right?
- You are so dead.
- Oh, I am so dead.
- Wow, I'm going home.
- No, uh-uh.
I put my ass and probably other parts of my body on the line
to come down here and party with my bro.
Now, damn it, we're going to party.
All right, one beer.
Yes!
Finally, I don't have to wait a half an hour for a drink.
Oh, man, I can't believe I forgot to tell you this.
This is important to the story.
Earlier that day, Marshall went to the dentist and got a temporary crown put in.
Okay, so anyway...
Marshall, are you okay?
Again, I wasn't there, so I'm a little foggy on the details.
Taxi!
Hey.
Hey.
Marshall just ditched out on our own party.
Can you get me in there? I kind of need to kill him.
Actually, I can't even get myself in.
I was such a dork.
I get recognized one time, and I start thinking I'm Julia Roberts.
I'm no V.I.P.
I'm not even an I.P.
I'm just a lowly little pea, sitting out here in the gutter.
You know something?
I'd take a pea in the gutter over Julia Roberts any day.
Hmm...
I broke my tooth!
Do you have...
...any aspirin?
Maybe there's...
a machine in...
...the restroom.
Now to this day, I don't know what happened in there,
but when Marshall came out a few minutes later...
Rough night?
Yeah.
These clubs are supposed to be fun, right?
Why do I hate them so much?
Because all of the stuff you're supposed to like usually sucks.
Like these clubs... or cruises.
Or New Year's Eve.
Or the Super Bowl.
Or parades.
The Rockettes.
Or parades.
- You said that already.
- I really hate parades.
Okay.
He just left in the middle of our own party! You don't do that.
Unless, of course, you're chasing after somebody who's already done it,
and then... then I think it's okay.
Well, I hate to take his side, but come on, a wine tasting?
What's the big plan for next Saturday, Scrabble night?
Don't check your e-mail.
Why are you becoming this person?
I heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare.
Once on a dare.
The other times were just for fun.
I'm not in college anymore.
I'd love to go back and be that person again, but you can't move backwards.
You can only go foreword.
Um, false.
You can go wherever you want.
I guess the question is, where do you want to go?
I want to go into this club and find my fiancé.
Well, that you can't do.
Want to bet?
Follow my lead.
Hey, big guy.
I said follow my lead.
- Please, please. Come on.
- Follow her lead. Do it, please.
- Follow her, please.
- Yes, please.
Those were the four greatest and only breasts I've ever seen.
Yeah, see, if everyone keeps telling you something is supposed to be fun, it's usually not.
- Right!
- Right.
So, by that logic, if you and I were to say, go out on a date...
Well, then we couldn't go anywhere that's supposed to be fun.
Right. The DMV it is.
Then we'll get our teeth cleaned.
Sounds awful. It's a date.
Okay!
But there's still one big question that needs to be answered.
How many of these coats do you think I can put on all at once?
Okay, for the wedge...
Barney?
Ted.
Get your coat. We're leaving.
What... what happened to that, um... cutlet you were grinding with?
That was my cousin Leslie.
- What?!
- No, no, no.
We're not laughing about this, Ted.
This is not gonna be some funny story that we'll be telling in a couple months.
It's not gonna be like, "Hey, ha, remember that time when you were grinding with..." No.
And you know why?
Because-- italics -- this night did not happen.
You promise me you will never, ever, ever tell
another living soul what transpired here tonight.
- You promise.
- All right.
- Promise.
- All right, I promise.
- Get Marshall and go, okay?
- All right.
Hey, thanks for saving my night.
I'll talk to you soon?
Um, hey, tip her, Barney.
Why? I didn't check a coat.
And even if I did, on principle, tip jars have become so...
Funny story: Barney was grinding with this girl all night...
Fine!
I learned a new trick.
So, Marshall and Lily rediscovered their youth.
It was nice.
And then it got... icky.
I'm really glad you guys came out tonight.
You know, dude, can I just say something?
It kind of hurt that you guys didn't invite me out.
I mean, I know things have changed since I got engaged,
but it would have been nice to be asked!
I'm sorry! I just assumed...
They played some good songs tonight!
I mean, lately...
I know, I know. It just seems like suddenly we're living in two different worlds.
Maybe you've got more in common with Barney.
What?
Are you crazy?
You think I like going to those clubs?
I'd so much rather go to your fruity little wine tasting.
Oh, God, I'm gonna barf.
Where's my purse? Where's my purse?
I'm okay.
The problem is, you can't do any of that couple stuff unless you have someone to do it with,
and the only way I'm gonna find that someone is by going out
and doing stupid single stuff with Barney.
What?
But, man, when I find her, we're gonna have some bad-ass wine tastings.
It's a plan.
Hey, maybe it'll be that cute coat check girl.
Yeah!
Maybe it will be.
It wasn't.
You know, Ted, I don't say this nearly enough, but I really...
That place has great salads!

L'an 2030
Tante Robin aime l'Halloween.
Elle adore se déguiser, hein ?
Ça n'a pas toujours été le cas.
En 2005, elle se trouvait trop bien
pour l'Halloween.
<i>Mais pas tante Lily.</i>
L'an 2005
- Devine ce que le facteur a apporté.
- Nos costumes ?
- Ils sont beaux ?
- Et comment.
Le tien est 100% laine,
pour que tu ne souffres pas d'hypothermie
comme l'an dernier.
Tarzan avoir tétons bleus.
Ce que j'aime de l'Halloween,
c'est que les filles se laissent aller
ŕ leurs bas instincts.
Si une fille se déguise en sorcičre,
c'est une sorcičre sexy.
Si c'est un chat, c'est un chat sexy.
- Si c'est une infirmičre...
- Bon. On a compris.
C'est une infirmičre sexy.
Robin, que feras-tu, toi ?
Oh, je ne sais pas.
Je vais sans doute voir Mike,
le type avec qui je sors.
Mike ? Il y a un Mike ?
Tu as un petit ami
et tu ne nous l'as pas dit ?
Ce n'est pas mon petit ami.
C'est juste un gars avec qui je sors
depuis deux semaines.
Un petit ami.
Pourquoi on ne l'a pas rencontré ?
On veut garder ça pour nous pour l'instant.
Marié.
Et si on sortait ensemble ŕ l'Halloween ?
Je sais pas, on pensait rester ŕ la maison
et se déguiser en nudistes.
Allez, Robin,
présente-nous ton nouveau gars.
Laisse-nous le juger
et l'évaluer dans ton dos.
Ça va ętre super.
Eh Ted, tu ne devinera
jamais ce qui est arrivé !
- Vos costumes sont arrivés ?
- Nos cost... Yes.
C'est pour ça qu'on s'entend aussi bien.
Ted, que fais-tu ŕ l'Halloween ?
- Eh bien...
- Quoi ?
Tous les ans, Ted attend la citrouille sexy.
Exact.
C'est quoi ?
Tu veux dire: "C'est qui ?"
C'était il y a quatre ans.
<i>J'étais ŕ une fęte d'Halloween
sur notre toit.</i>
<i>J'allais partir, quand, venant de nulle part,</i>
<i>est apparue une fille
dans un costume de citrouille trčs sexy.</i>
Comment un costume de
citrouille peut ętre sexy ?
Elle était évidée aux endroits stratégiques.
<i>On était au bar et je l'ai vu mélanger</i>
- du Kahlúa et...
- Et du soda.
Un cocktail de son invention.
- Et...
- Elle appelait ça un Tootsie Roll.
- Car...
- Ça a le goűt
d'un Tootsie Roll alcoolisé.
Est-ce que je peux, s'il vous plait,
raconter mon histoire ?
On a tout de suite accroché.
Elle m'a donné son numéro. Mais...
Ça s'est terriblement mal passé.
S'il vous plaît !
Ça s'est terriblement mal passé.
Joyeux Halloween.
Sonny, oů est Cher ?
- Cher.
- Ici, mon chou.
Je viens de rencontrer la femme idéale.
<i>Elle est drôle, elle est belle,
elle adore La Guerre des étoiles.</i>
Eh bien. Que pense-t-elle des Ewoks ?
- Elle est fan.
- Parfait.
J'ignore pourquoi les gens sont cyniques.
La révolte aurait échoué sans les Ewoks.
C'est une biologiste du monde marin.
Elle a étudié les manchots en Antarctique.
Les manchots, c'est super.
Des espčces d'Ewoks noirs
et blancs. J'approuve.
Oů est ma Kit Kat ?
Je l'avais mise sur la table.
Je ne sais pas,
mais on a plein de chocolat.
Tu ne comprends pas. Il me faut celle-lŕ.
Elle a mis son numéro sur l'emballage.
Oů est-il ?
Allez, Dracula. Donne-moi
cette barre de chocolat. Donne !
Oů est la Kit Kat ? Oů est la Kit Kat ?
Je n'ai jamais trouvé le numéro.
Je ne l'ai jamais revue.
Mais tous les ans, il y a une fęte
sur le toit, et c'est lŕ que je serai.
Tu sais, Ted, ça fait quatre ans.
Elle est peut-ętre fiancée, mariée,
ou, Dieu nous préserve, grosse.
Je sais pas, j'ai un pressentiment.
Ça pourrait ętre l'année.
L'Halloween est une nuit magique.
C'est ça, moquez-vous. Je m'en fiche.
Ça ferait une super histoire,
que la citrouille sexy
soit ma future femme, non ?
Oh, et au cas oů ça arriverait,
il vaudrait mieux arręter
de l'appeler "la citrouille sexy".
Bonne idée.
Ted, tu es pręt ŕ ętre impressionné ?
J'ai hâte.
Alors, qu'en penses-tu ?
Alors, qu'en penses-tu ?
Eh bien !
Marshall, tu t'es maquillé ?
Oui. C'est bizarrement sexy, hein ?
On va gagner le concours de costumes,
c'est sűr.
Le premier prix est un bon cadeau de 50 $
au bar.
Combien t'ont coűté les costumes ?
100 $ .
Chacun.
Vous ętes super.
En quoi tu te déguises ?
Oh, inutile de demander.
Je veux que la citrouille sexy
me reconnaisse,
et elle m'a vu en carte perforée.
BULLETIN DE VOTE
Quoi ? Elle a trouvé ça hilarant.
Oui, il y a quatre ans.
Mais tout le monde a oublié
ce qu'est une carte perforée.
Quel triste commentaire
sur le niveau d'attention national.
Oublier un moment aussi mouvementé
de notre histoire politique.
Triste commentaire.
Bon, Polly doit faire pipi.
Encore ?
- Oů vas-tu ?
- C'est un costume élaboré.
Non, pas encore. Pas cette année.
Tu es mon copilote. Mets ta combinaison.
Non, merci.
Je m'en tiens ŕ la carte perforée.
T'es dangereux, Maverick.
Ton ego fait des chčques
que ton corps n'encaisse pas.
Bon.
Voilŕ le plan, et je suis sérieux.
Je vais nous faire entrer
ŕ la fęte de Victoria's Secret.
Fais-moi confiance. Ŕ la fin de la soirée,
c'est toi qui vas perforer.
Les top models peuvent nous jeter
chaque jour.
Ce soir, je serai sur le toit,
buvant des bičres
et attendant la citrouille sexy.
Voilŕ ce que je vais faire.
Des mannequins de Victoria's Secret
en petite tenue
ou des snobs de Yale
avec leur stupide chorale.
Pardon, main gauche ?
La main droite est nulle ?
Bien dit.
Je vais sur le toit.
Eh bien les gars, on se retrouve tous les trois.
Qu'es-ce que tu dis ? Tope la ?
Super. On s'en va.
Salut, le bulletin. Ça vote ?
Un jeu de mots. Marrant.
Joli costume.
- Je suis un perroquet.
- Ça se voit.
- Oů est Mike ?
- Il me retrouve ici.
Je suis en retard,
j'étais au défilé du Village.
Il y a des milliers de pirates homosexuels,
cette année.
Sérieux, mon maquillage, ça va ?
Ouais, c'est bizarrement sexy.
Alors, oů est ton costume ?
Avec Mike,
on a dit pour rire qu'on ferait un truc,
mais on a décidé de ne pas se déguiser.
Oh, non.
Salut.
Je vous présente Michael.
Ce ne sont pas ses vrais cheveux.
Oů est ton costume, Gretel ?
Tu as cru que j'étais...
Je plaisantais.
Je dois arręter les blagues par courriel.
C'est dur de faire passer le ton.
Je crois qu'on les bat.
C'est dingue que tu m'aies convaincu.
C'est toi qui m'as suivi ici.
Cette fęte est nulle.
Il y a sept filles.
Six filles.
Du calme. Il est tôt. Ça va s'améliorer.
Mesdames et messieurs,
ils chantent toujours aussi juste
qu'au bal du printemps de 1995.
Je suis ravi de vous présenter
les Shagarats.
Quels sont les gilets préférés des pirates ?
Ceux faits au crochet ?
Et quel est le restaurant fast-food préféré des pirates ?
Arr-by's
On pourrait croire que c'est Arby's.
Mais en fait c'est le
"Long John Silver's".
J'ai besoin de cette main pour manger.
Oh, oui.
- Merci.
- Je suis mooort de faim.
Ravie de te rencontrer, Mike.
Vous allez bien ensemble.
Oui. On se voit souvent.
On en est męme au point oů on finit nos...
- Ce cheeseburger est...
- Délicieux.
Vous voyez ?
C'est toi qui gagnes
le prix du meilleur plat, bébé.
Ce steak a battu mes côtes de porc
ŕ plates coutures.
C'est sans doute vrai.
Mais ton riz pilaf
a tellement écrasé mes épinards
qu'ils en ont un peu vomi.
Robin, il faut que tu goűtes ce poulet.
Non, ça va. Merci.
Il est délicieux.
Je suis vraiment contente
avec ce cheeseburger.
Allez, juste une bouchée.
Non, je me régale vraiment.
Pour l'amour du ciel.
Délicieux.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Qu'est-ce qu'il faut faire
pour se faire enguirlander ici ?
Ouais.
Je vois. Parce que je porte une guirlande.
Seigneur.
C'est pas drôle si tu expliques la blague.
- Partons d'ici.
- Oh, non, Barney. Je m'amuse.
En plus,
c'est super de revoir tous ces gens.
Donne-moi le nom
d'une personne que tu connais.
Il y a Ninja.
Derričre de cheval.
Oů est Devant de cheval ?
Ce type est super drôle. Oů est-il ?
Bon, je m'en vais.
Sache que la fęte de Victoria's Secret
est sur un yacht.
Et qu'est-ce qui va suivre le yacht ?
La Bernacle.
- Ah, c'est ton nouveau surnom ?
- Oui, la Bernacle.
- La Bernacle ?
- C'est ça.
La Bernacle s'en va.
Amuse-toi bien, Bernacle.
Alors, Mike te plaît ?
Et toi, il te plaît ?
Bien sűr. Pourquoi ?
On ne dirait pas.
Tu ne partages pas ta nourriture,
pas de déguisement.
Lily, tu me connais. Les trucs de couples,
ça ne me branche pas.
Je sais que ça a l'air idiot vu de l'extérieur,
mais c'est super
quand tu le vis de l'intérieur.
Si tu essayais, ça te plairait peut-ętre.
Tu veux que je fasse partie de la secte ?
Robin, Mike t'aime bien.
Si tu ne vas pas vers lui, tu vas le perdre.
Quoi ?
Écoute, c'est l'Halloween.
Déguise-toi en petite amie pour la soirée.
D'accord. Bon, qu'est-ce que je dois faire ?
Je lui achčte un nounours géant ?
Et si tu commençais
par partager ton dessert ?
Je peux faire ça.
Bien.
Il a intéręt ŕ vouloir le brownie sundae.
Mais oui. Je peux tout ŕ fait partager.
Oui.
- Barney ? Tu es revenu ?
- En effet.
Avec un nouveau déguisement.
Ŕ chaque Halloween,
j'apporte un costume de rechange
au cas oů je me planterais avec
la plus jolie fille de la soirée.
Comme ça, j'ai une seconde chance
de faire une premičre impression.
C'est quoi cette tęte ?
Moitié "tu es pathétique",
moitié "je dois pisser".
Alors va aux toilettes.
Il y a une file.
Je ne veux pas rater la citrouille sexy.
T'as qu'ŕ pisser du toit.
Ted, pisse du toit.
Je ne ferais pas ça, si j'étais toi.
Il y a des gens en bas.
Allons, Ted. Qui vas-tu écouter ?
Moi ou Monsieur Goody-Goody ?
Laissez tomber. Vous avez de l'herbe ?
Un peu plus ŕ gauche, Marshall.
Un peu plus ŕ gauche, Marshall.
Lily, accroupis-toi.
Ça va ętre un massacre.
Aucun de ces costumes
n'arrive ŕ la cheville des nôtrrres.
Prends la photo.
- Ça y est.
- Joli.
Mais on aurait dű
gagner avec Sonny et Cher.
Si j'avais mis la robe rouge, peut-ętre.
Si je pouvais remonter le temps...
Ce sundae a l'air délicieux.
Je l'avalerais en entier.
Mais je préfčre partager
ce minuscule sundae avec toi, Mike.
Une tarte aux pommes, bon choix, Lilypad.
Merci, Marshmallow.
Commençons, Mikero-ondes.
Laisse-moi deviner.
Tout le monde t'a fait
le coup de la guirlande, ce soir ?
Tu ne peux pas savoir.
Au nom des hommes, je m'excuse.
Laisse-moi réparer. Je te sers un verre.
Quel charmant diable.
Je suis aussi un diable trčs cornu.
Ouais.
Non.
Va en enfer.
Si vous aimez le tiramisu,
on a découvert un resto italien...
C'est toi qui l'as découvert.
Je t'accompagnais.
Mais continue.
Je veux juste dire qu'on aime le tiramisu.
J'en veux toujours plus.
On en est dingues.
Je suis dingue et tu es dingue...
de tiramisu.
Nous adorons le tiramisu.
Je ne devrais pas dire ça ?
Non, non. Mais c'est un peu bizarre, non ?
Nous adorons le tiramisu.
C'est vraiment une activité de groupe,
le tiramisu ?
Hein ?
Et ce resto italien.
Comment sont leurs cannoli ?
Doucement, l'affamé.
Oui, on dirait que nous sommes
tous les deux affamés.
- Hé, est-ce que c'est Gary Oldman ?
- Oů ça ?
Je ne vois pas...
C'est froid.
- On va ŕ la fęte de Victoria's Secret.
- Non.
Je ne peux pas regarder mon ami
ręver debout
et gâcher une autre fęte d'Halloween.
Ted, la citrouille sexy ne va pas venir.
On ne sait jamais.
Barney, ce n'est pas une question
de probabilité,
c'est une question de foi.
Cette fille, elle représente
quelque chose pour moi.
Je ne sais pas, l'espoir.
Eh bien.
Je n'ai pas compris un mot
de ce que tu viens de dire.
Mannequins de lingerie sur un bateau !
Ŕ plus tard.
Non.
Ŕ plus tard toi-męme !
Tu veux boire ce qui a fondu ?
Tu sais quoi ? Il est tard.
Je vais m'en aller.
Hé.
Je pensais qu'on suivrait
les miettes de pain
jusque chez moi, Hansel.
Robin, j'ai pas l'impression
que t'aimes ma compagnie.
J'aime bien ętre avec toi.
Mais tu préfčres ętre seule.
C'est ta nourriture,
ton lit, tes mots croisés.
Qui se sert de l'encre ?
Désolée.
C'est vrai, j'ai mes petites habitudes.
C'est pas pour ça que ça marchera pas.
En fait, c'est pas vraiment ça.
Attends, nous nous séparons ?
Non, nous ne nous séparons pas.
Je me sépare de toi.
<i>Et juste au moment oů je perdais espoir.</i>
Elle a étudié les manchots en Antarctique.
<i>Kahlúa. Soda.</i>
<i>Ce manchot était-il la citrouille sexy ?</i>
Excusez-moi ?
Ça va te paraître bizarre,
mais j'ai rencontré quelqu'un ici
il y a quatre ans
qui buvait ce cocktail
et qui adorait les manchots.
Y-a-t-il une chance que...
c'était vous ?
C'est toi.
- Tout le monde me trouvait fou, mais...
- T'es vraiment nul.
Allons, je suis revenu pour toi, Ted.
Je me suis déguisé en manchot
pour te montrer ton erreur.
Et obtenir le numéro de la fille au Hula.
Mission accomplie.
- Incroyable.
- Eh oui.
Une minute.
Tu es le soldat minable.
Non, c'est un autre.
Et c'était un super pilote de guerre.
Dire que je t'ai filé mon numéro.
C'est vrai. Merci.
Rends-le-moi.
Pas question. Je l'ai gagné.
Sans tricher. Je t'appelle.
Mais je ne sortirai jamais avec toi.
Comment me reconnaîtras-tu ?
Je suis le roi du déguisement.
Ouais.
Joli.
Allez. La fęte de Victoria's Secret.
Maintenant. On y va.
- Je reste ici.
- Trčs bien.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je te fais une aile d'honneur.
Mon chou, je suis désolée.
Franchement, c'est pas grave.
Il voulait ętre "nous"
et je voulais ętre "je".
Les types sont de vraies filles.
Ça va, je vais bien.
Mesdames et messieurs, les résultats.
Les gagnants
du concours de costumes sont:
Lily Aldrin en perroquet
et Marshall Eriksen en pirate homosexuel.
Ouais ! Attends, qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ?
Peu importe, Marshall. On a gagné.
Attends. Un pirate homosexuel ?
Qu'est-ce qui te fait dire ça ?
Hé, tu t'es maquillé les yeux.
Je veux que tout le monde sache bien
que je ne suis pas un pirate homosexuel.
Je couche avec mon perroquet
tout le temps.
C'était une mauvaise impression.
Mais c'est pas grave ! On a gagné !
- Je t'aime, Marshmallow.
- Moi aussi, Lilypad.
Laissez-moi vous prendre en photo.
Je savais que tu serais ici.
Salut.
Si tu es venue pour les Shagarats,
tu as raté le quatričme rappel.
Je n'ai jamais fait de sports d'équipe.
Tu joues ŕ Confessions ?
Parce qu'il ne reste plus rien,
sauf du schnaps ŕ la pęche.
Au lycée, je faisais du tennis.
Tu sais pourquoi ?
Parce que j'étais toute seule.
Je n'aimais pas les doubles.
Je viens de me faire larguer.
Mince, ça craint.
Ça va. Je ne l'aimais pas tant que ça.
C'est l'histoire de ma vie.
Tout le monde tombe amoureux,
devient bęte, ridicule, mignon et débile,
mais pas moi.
Pourquoi je n'en ai pas plus envie ?
Je veux en avoir envie.
- Y a quelque chose qui cloche ou quoi ?
- Non.
Tu ne voulais pas ętre avec moi,
ce qui prouve ton mauvais goűt.
Mais tu n'as rien qui cloche.
Et si j'étais juste... froide ?
Ce soir, Mike était pręt ŕ avoir l'air
complčtement idiot pour moi,
mais je ne pouvais pas ętre Gretel.
Pourquoi je ne peux pas ?
Parce que tu n'as pas encore rencontré
le bon Hansel.
Un jour, tu rencontreras un type
pour qui tu voudras avoir l'air
complčtement idiote.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui, il existe.
Tout comme la citrouille sexy.
Comment fais-tu, Ted ?
Comment peux-tu rester toute la soirée
sur le toit en ayant froid
tout en continuant ŕ croire
que ta citrouille va venir ?
Eh bien, je suis passablement soűl.
Je sais qu'il y a peu de chances
que l'amour de ma vie
apparaisse miraculeusement
en costume de citrouille
ŕ 2 h 43 du matin.
Mais ce n'est pas un mauvais endroit
pour attendre.
Pousse-toi.
Now, as you know, Aunt Robin is a big fan of Halloween--
always dressing up in crazy costumes--
but she wasn't always that way.
Back in 2005, she thought she was too cool for Halloween,
unlike Aunt Lily.
Guess what came in the mail today?
Our costumes?
- Do they rule?
- They rule.
And yours is 100% wool, so you won't get hypothermia like last year.
Tarzan nipples blue.
You know what I love about Halloween?
It's the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag.
If a girl dresses up as a witch, she's a slutty witch.
If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat.
- If she's a nurse...
- Wow, we get it.
...she's a slutty nurse.
Robin, what are you doing for Halloween?
Oh, I don't know.
Probably hanging out with Mike, this guy I've been seeing.
Mike? There's a Mike?
You have a boyfriend and you haven't told us?
No, I mean, he's not my boyfriend.
He's just this guy I've been seeing for a couple of weeks.
Boyfriend!
So why haven't we met him?
We're not really ready to go public yet.
Married.
How about we go on a Halloween double date?
I don't know, we were kind of thinking about staying at home
and dressing up as naked people.
Come on, Robin, trot out your new fella.
Let us judge and evaluate him behind your back. It'll be fun.
Hey, Ted, you'll never guess what happened.
- Your costumes came?
- Our cost... Yes.
That is why we're best friends.
Hey, Ted, what are you doing for Halloween?
Well...
What?
Every Halloween, Ted waits for the Slutty Pumpkin.
That's right.
What's the "Slutty Pumpkin"?
You mean who is the Slutty Pumpkin.
It was four years ago...
I was at this Halloween party up on the roof of our building.
I'm about to call it an early night when out of nowhere
appeared this girl in the sexiest pumpkin costume.
Wait, how can a pumpkin costume be sexy?
It was carved in strategic places.
So, uh, we're at the bar, and I see her mix
- Kahlua...
- Kahlua and root beer.
A cocktail she invented herself.
And she called it... "The Tootsie Roll..."
Because it tastes like an alcoholic Tootsie Roll.
Hey! Can I please tell the story?
So we had this instant connection.
She gave me her number, but then...
- Something went terribly wrong.
- Guys!
Then something went terribly wrong.
Happy Halloween.
Sonny, where's Cher?
Cher?
Right here, babe.
I just met the perfect woman.
She's funny, she's beautiful, she loves Star Wars.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's her take on Ewoks?
- Loves 'em.
- Oh, good.
I don't know why people are so cynical about Ewoks.
The rebellion would have failed without the Ewoks.
And get this: She's a marine biologist.
She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.
Oh, penguins are cool.
Kind of like black and white Ewoks.
I approve.
Hey, where's my, uh, Kit-Kat? I put it right here on this table.
I don't know, but we've plenty of chocolate here.
No, no, you don't understand. I need that Kit-Kat--
she wrote her nuer on that wrapper. Where is it?
Uh-oh.
Hey, Dracula! Come on, give me the... give me it!
Where's the Kit-Kat?
Where's the Kit-Kat?!
Never found her number, never saw her again.
But every year, they have a Halloween party up on the roof,
so that's where I'll be.
You know, Ted, it's been four years.
She could be engaged or married,
or, God forbid, fat.
I don't know, I got a feeling--
this could be the year.
Halloween is a night of wonder and magic.
All right, bring the mockery, fine, I can take it.
But come on, wouldn't it be the coolest story ever
if the Slutty Pumpkin turned out to be my future wife?
Oh, on the off-chance that that could happen,
maybe we should stop calling her the Slutty Pumpkin.
- That's a really good point.
- That's a good idea.
Ted, is your world ready to be rocked, rocked, rocked?
Can't wait.
So... what do you think?
So, what do you think?
Wow.
Marshall, are you wearing eyeliner?
Oh, yeah.
Weirdly hot, right?
We are so going to win the costume contest this year.
First prize: $50 gift certificate at the bar.
And how much did you pay for your costumes?
$100.
Each.
Well, I think you guys look great.
What are you going as?
Oh, like I even need to ask.
Hey, I want the Slutty Pumpkin to recognize me, and she knows me as...
a hanging chad.
What? She thought it was hilarious.
Yeah, four years ago, but nobody remembers what the hell a hanging chad is.
What a sad commentary on our national attention span--
that we could forget such a turbulent time in our political history.
Sad commentary.
All right, Polly got to pee.
Again?
Where you going?
It's an elaborate costume.
No, no, not again, not this year. You're going as my wingman.
Flight suit up.
No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad.
Oh, you're dangerous, Maverick.
Your ego's writing checks your body can't cash.
Okay.
Here's the plan, and I crap you not.
I'm getting us into the Victoria's Secret Halloween Party.
Trust me, by the end of the night, your chad will not be hanging.
We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year.
Tonight I'm going up to the roof, I'm going to have a few beers,
I'm going to wait for the Slutty Pumpkin.
It's just what I do.
Hmm. Victoria's Secret models prancing around in bras and panties...
or Yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group.
What's that, left hand?
"Right hand sucks"? Word.
Heading up to the roof.
Well, boys, looks like it's just the three of us.
What's that? "Self five"? Nice. We out.
Hey, Chad, how's it hanging?
Hey, word play, funny.
Whoo, nice outfit.
- I'm a parrot.
- You sure are.
- Where's Mike?
- He's meeting me here.
I ran late covering the Halloween parade in the Village.
There are, like, a zillion gay pirates this year.
Seriously, does my eyeliner look okay?
Yes, it's weirdly hot.
So, where's your costume?
Uh, you know, Mike and I joked about doing something together,
but we decided not to dress up.
Oh, geez.
Hi.
Uh, everyone, this is Michael.
That is not his real hair.
Um, where's your costume, Gretel?
You thought I was...
Oh, I was just kidding. I've got to stop making jokes in e-mails.
It's so hard to convey tone.
I think we got them beat.
I can't believe you talked me into this.
I didn't. You followed me up here.
This party sucks.
There's seven chicks here.
There's six chicks here.
Relax. The night is young. It's going to get better.
Ladies and gentlemen, as on pitch as they were at Spring Fling '95,
it's my pleasure to welcome back the Shaggarats.
What be a pirate's favorite kind of sweater?
Arr-gyle.
And what be a pirate's favorite fast food restaurant?
Arr-by's.
'Twould think it would be Arby's.
But, actually, it's Long John Silver's.
Actually, I kind of need this hand to eat.
Oh..
Oh, yeah.
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm starrr... ving!
It's so nice to meet you, Mike. You guys are really cute together.
Yeah, we've been spending a lot of time together.
We're even getting to that point where we finish each other's...
- This cheeseburger is so...
- Good. See?
I think you won the dish-off tonight, baby.
This steak totally bitch-slapped my pork chops.
That may be true,
but your rice pilaf kicked my spinach in the crotch so hard
it threw up a little bit.
Robin, you have to try this chicken.
Oh, that's good, I'm okay, thanks.
It's really tasty.
I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger.
Come on, just try a little bite.
Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here.
Oh, for God's sakes.
Really tasty.
Hey.
Hey.
So what does a fella have to do to get lei'd around here?
Yeah.
Right. 'Cause I'm wearing a lei.
It isn't funny if you explain the joke.
Let's bail.
No, Barney, come on. I'm having fun.
Plus, it's really great to see all these guys again.
Name one person you know at this party.
Well, there's Ninja, Back of Horse.
Hey, where's Front of Horse? That guy's a riot-- where is he?
Okay, I'm leaving.
But just know, that this Victoria Secret party is on a yacht.
And what will be sticking to that yacht?
The "Barnacle."
Really?
- That's your nickname now?
- Yeah, the Barnacle.
- The Barnacle?
- That's it.
Barnacle, out.
Have fun, Barnacle.
So... do you like Mike?
Do you like Mike?
Of course I do. Why?
It just doesn't seem like it.
You won't share your food, you won't wear a costume.
Oh, Lily, you know me. I'm just not into all that coupley stuff.
Okay, I know that stuff looks dumb from the outside,
but it's kind of the greatest thing in the world when you're a part of it.
If you just gave it a chance, you might like it.
Are you trying to get me to join a cult?
Robin, Mike likes you.
If you don't start meeting him halfway, you're gonna lose him.
What?
Look, it's Halloween. Just put on the girlfriend costume for a night.
Okay, well, what am I supposed to do,
buy him a giant teddy bear or something?
How about you start by sharing dessert?
I can share dessert.
Good.
He better want the brownie sundae,
but yeah, yeah, I can totally share.
Barney?
What, you're back?
That's right.
In a totally new costume.
Every Halloween I bring a spare costume,
in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party.
That way I have a second chance to make a first impression.
What's with the face?
It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee.
So go to the bathroom.
No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the "Slutty Pumpkin."
So pee off the roof.
Ooh, Ted, pee off the roof.
Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you, there's people walking down there.
Come on, Ted, who you gonna listen to?
Me, or Mr. Goody-Goody over there?
Yeah, whatever, you guys got some weed?
A little to the left, Marshall.
Lily, squat down.
This is gonna be a slaughter.
None of these other costumes even come close to ourrr...s!
Take the damn picture.
Got it.
I still think we should have won as Sonny and Cher.
Maybe if I'd worn the red dress. Huh.
If I could turn back time.
Wow, this sundae looks so good. I could eat the whole thing.
But, um, I would much rather share this small, one-scoop sundae with you, Mike.
Apple tart? Excellent choice, Lily-pad.
Thanks, Marshmallow.
Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven.
Let me guess.
Every guy's used the lei'd line on you tonight, huh?
You wouldn't believe.
I apologize for my gender.
Let me make it up to you-- make you a drink?
You certainly are a charming devil.
I'm also a "horny" devil.
Yeah.
No.
Oh, go to hell.
You know, if you guys like tiramisu, we found this little Italian place...
No, you found it.
I came with you.
Go on.
I'm just saying, we love tiramisu.
I cannot get enough of it.
We're crazy for the stuff.
I'm crazy, and you're crazy...
...for tiramisu.
Right.
We love tiramisu.
Am I wrong saying that?
No, no, no. I mean, it just sounds a little bit weird. Doesn't it?
We love tiramisu?
Isn't really a group activity.
Loving tiramisu?
Right?
So this Italian place, how is their cannoli?
Easy there, hungry.
Yeah, looks like we're both hungry.
- Hey, is that Gary Oldman?
- Wait... where?
I don't see...
Brain freeze.
- Okay, Victoria Secret party, right now.
- Nope.
Come on. I can't stand watching my delusional friend waste another precious Halloween.
Ted, the "Slutty Pumpkin" is not coming.
She might.
Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds. It's about believing.
This girl, she... she represents something to me. I don't know.
Hope.
Wow.
I did not understand a word you just said.
Lingerie models on a boat!
See ya.
No. See ya.
Ow!
Want to drink the melty part?
You know what? It's getting late.
I think I'm gonna take off.
Hey.
I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, Hansel.
Robin, I don't get the sense you like being with me.
I like being with you.
Not as much as you like being alone.
You like...
eating your own food, sleeping in your own bed, doing your own crosswords.
Who uses ink?
Sorry.
Okay, I'm a bit set in my ways, that doesn't mean that this won't work.
Actually, it kind of does.
Wait, are we breaking up?
No, we aren't breaking up.
I'm breaking up with you.
And then just as I was about to lose hope...
She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.
Kahlua, root beer...
Could this penguin be the "Slutty Pumpkin?"
Uh, excuse me.
This is going to sound crazy, but
I met someone up on this roof four years ago, and
they mixed that cocktail, and-and they loved penguins.
By any chance, was that you?
It's you.
- Everyone thought I was crazy, but I came...
- You are such a loser.
Come on, I came back for you, Ted.
I penguin-suited up to show you the ror of your ways.
And to score Hula Girl's number. Check and check.
- Unbelievable.
- Yes, it is.
Wait a minute. You're that lame army guy.
What? No, No, that's some other guy, and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot.
I cannot believe I gave you my number.
Yeah, well, you did. Thanks.
Yeah. Well, give it back.
Well, uh, I don't think so. I earned it, fair and square. I'm calling you.
But I'm never gonna go out with you.
But how will you know it's me?
I'm a master of disguise.
Yeah.
Nice.
Come on, Ted. Victoria Secret party, now, let's go.
I'm staying.
Fine!
Fine...
What are you doing?
I'm flippering you off.
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.
Seriously, it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a we, and I wanted to be an I.
Dudes are such chicks.
You guys, I'm fine.
Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in.
And the winners of this year's costume contest are...
Lily Aldren as a parrot,
and Marshall Erikson as a gay pirate!
Oh, yeah!
Wait, what did he say?
Oh, who cares, Marshall? We won!
Wait. Gay pirate-- where are you getting that from?
Dude, you're wearing eyeliner.
Okay. I just want everybody here to know I'm not a gay pirate.
I have sex with my parrot all the time.
That came out wrong.
Oh, yeah, doesn't matter. We won!
- I love you, marshmallow.
- I love you, too, Lily Pad.
You guys, let me get a picture.
I had a feeling I'd find you here.
Oh, hey.
If you're here for the Shaggarats, you just missed the fourth encore.
I never played any team sports.
Are we playing "I never"? 'Cause there's nothing left but peach schnapps.
I played tennis in high school.
You know why?
Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles.
I just got dumped.
Oh, man, that sucks.
Yeah. It's okay.
I wasn't that into him.
Story of my life.
Everyone else is off falling in love and acting stupid
and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me.
Why don't I want that more?
I want to want that.
Am I wired wrong or something?
No.
Look, you didn't want to be with me, so, clearly, you have abysmal taste in men.
But you're wired just fine.
Well, what if I'm just a... a cold person?
Tonight Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but
I couldn't be Gretel.
Why can't I be Gretel?
Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet.
Hey, one day, you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot.
Really?
Yeah. He's out there somewhere.
- Just like the Slutty Pumpkin... Pumpkin, pumpkin...
How do you do this, Ted?
How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold,
and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up?
Well, I'm pretty drunk.
Look, I know that odds are, the love of my life isn't gonna magically walk through that door
in a pumpkin costume at 2:43 in the morning, but
this seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know,
sit and wait.

Les enfants, avant de rencontrer votre mŤre,
quand je cherchais,
j'ai appris une chose utile.
L'amour n'est pas une science.
- Super histoire, papa.
- On va aller regarder la tťlť.
Parfois, dans la vie,
il faut accepter que certaines choses
ne s'expliquent pas,
et c'est assez effrayant.
L'an 2005
- Oh, mon Dieu.
- Je sais, j'en tremble encore.
Qu'est-ce que... Je t'ai eu. J'ai un rhume.
Est-ce que Áa va ?
Une tournťe, double pour Lily et moi.
Que s'est-il passť ?
- On a vu une chose dans l'appartement.
- Une chose terrible.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi,
mais les margaritas me rendent sexy.
<i>Oh, mucho sexy. Te quiero, Marshall.</i>
Oh, mon Dieu !
C'ťtait quoi ?
La souris la plus horrible et mťchante
que vous ayez jamais vue.
Une souris ?
Mon chou, c'ťtait un cafard ťnorme.
C'ťtait une souris.
Elle avait des moustaches.
Les trucs qui lui sortaient de la tÍte ?
Des antennes.
- Marshall a fui devant un cafard.
- C'ťtait une souris.
Dťsolť, je me suis trompť.
Tu es un homme.
C'est mon reportage. Ted, ťcoute.
Carl, monte le son.
<i>Me voici avec Ellen Pierce,</i>
<i>une marieuse de premiŤre.</i>
<i>Votre compagnie, "Solutions d'amour"
a un taux de succŤs de 100%.</i>
<i>- Quel est votre secret ?
- La science.</i>
Dans la vie, tout se ramŤne
ŗ des uns et des zťros, mÍme l'amour.
Il me suffit d'entrer les variables,
de passer l'algorithme,
et subito, vous voilŗ avec l'‚me soeur.
Et Áa marche !
Demandez ŗ tous mes couples heureux.
Et ce ne sont que les plus beaux.
J'ai d'autres photos dans les toilettes.
Les Solutions d'amour d'Ellen Pierce.
Une lumiŤre d'espoir
pour le New York en peine d'amour.
<i>Robin Scherbatsky...</i>
La fille, c'est une cliente ?
- Oui.
- On s'inscrit.
- Quoi ?
- Ted, elles sont dťsespťrťes et chaudes.
C'est le cocktail parfait.
Tu mťlanges bien et tu couches avec elles.
Je ne vais pas voir une marieuse.
C'est comme baisser les bras.
C'est la version masculine
d'adopter un chat.
Ce n'ťtait pas un cafard. Il avait de
la fourrure. Seuls les mammifŤres en ont.
C'ťtait un cafard.
Voyons, Lily. «a n'aurait pu Ítre un cafard
que s'il portait la peau d'une souris
qu'il aurait tuťe.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Voyons !
Ted ! Vite ! Aide-moi,
mon bateau est en train de couler.
- Quoi ?
- Mon bateau coule !
- T'as un bateau ?
- Je l'ai achetť
aux enchŤres de la police.
Un gars du port a appelť
pour dire qu'il penchait ŗ 45į.
Si je n'y vais pas ŗ l'instant, il va chavirer !
Viens !
SOLUTIONS d'amour
Ton bateau coule. Bien trouvť.
Voyons. Ted,
c'est une opportunitť incroyable.
On va rencontrer nos ‚mes soeurs,
se les faire et ne jamais les rappeler.
C'est terminť, messieurs ?
Fťlicitations, vous avez franchi
la premiŤre ťtape.
Merci, Ellen.
J'espŤre bien que Áa va marcher.
Le cťlibat, c'est terminť.
La drague, le sexe sans lendemain.
Vous mťritez mieux.
C'est tout ŗ fait vrai, Ellen.
Je suis prÍt ŗ abandonner le moi
et ŗ embrasser le nous.
Y a-t-il moyen de dire
que j'adore les c‚lins ?
Oh, bien sŻr, vous... C'est trŤs...
C'est dťlicat d'en parler
en prťsence de Ted,
mais je cherche quelqu'un qui n'ait
pas peur de me tenir la nuit,
quand viennent les larmes.
Ellen, pouvez-vous m'aider ŗ la trouver ?
- Sortez.
- Quoi ?
Je reÁois 15 gars comme vous
par semaine.
Des salauds qui cherchent
des femmes vulnťrables
pour se les faire et ne jamais les rappeler.
Oh, mon Dieu, les gens font Áa ?
Vous voulez la mťthode douce
ou violente ?
La violente, c'est quoi ?
Je me fais sortir par la sťcuritť ?
Non, Áa, c'est la mťthode douce.
L'autre mťthode,
c'est moi qui vous dťmolis.
- Bon, Ted, on y va.
- Pas vous. Vous restez.
Vous Ítes mignon.
Vous Ítes architecte. C'est un bon mťtier.
Et vous n'avez pas choisi
un pseudonyme ťvident,
contrairement ŗ votre ami: "Jack Paquet".
- «a se prononce P‚h-kť.
- Dehors !
Avec vous, je peux travailler.
Donnez-moi trois jours,
et je vous trouve votre future ťpouse.
Non, merci. Pas besoin d'algorithme
pour rencontrer des femmes.
On est ŗ New York.
La mer est pleine de poissons.
La mer est pleine de poissons.
Il y a neuf millions de personnes
ŗ New York.
4,5 millions de femmes.
Vous voulez rencontrer
quelqu'un de votre ‚ge,
disons, avec une marge de cinq ans.
Si on prend en compte
le recensement le plus rťcent,
cela nous donne 482000.
Mais attendez,
48% sont dťjŗ dans une relation,
puis on ťlimine la moitiť
pour intelligence, sens de l'humour,
et compatibilitť.
Vous devez ensuite enlever les ex,
la famille,
et, oh, on ne peut pas oublier
les lesbiennes.
Ce qui nous laisse...
huit femmes.
C'est impossible. Huit ? Vraiment, huit ?
Il y a huit poissons
dans ce grand ocťan bleu, Ted.
Et si vous pensez
pouvoir en pÍcher un dans votre bateau
sans moi, la porte est lŗ.
Vous prenez les cartes de crťdit ?
La chose est revenue.
Et cette fois, on a bien regardť.
Hť. Sťrieusement, arrÍte de faire Áa !
Elle est plus grande. Elle a mangť.
On ťtait en haut
en train de regarder la tťlť.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Bon. Il faut le faire.
C'est bon. C'est terminť.
- Alors, tu as bien regardť ?
- Oui.
Six pattes, un exosquelette,
comme un cafard.
Mais avec des caractťristiques de souris.
Des touffes de fourrure marron gris,
une queue.
Alors, c'ťtait un cafard ou une souris ?
Un cafasouris.
Quoi ?
Une combinaison mutante des deux.
C'est comme si un cafard et une souris,
vous savez...
Dansaient le cha cha horizontal
ŗ dix pattes ?
C'est impossible. «a n'existe pas.
- Mais si.
- La preuve.
Et il est ťnervť.
Est-ce que tout va bien ?
La porte est ouverte.
On n'a pas eu le temps.
Alors, Solutions d'amour ?
Tu as rencontrť la femme de ta vie ?
Elle avait dit trois jours.
«a en fait dťjŗ cinq.
Je devrais m'inquiťter ?
Ne stresse pas. Ne fais pas le Ted.
Tu utilises mon nom
comme nom commun ?
Ouais, on fait Áa dans ton dos.
Un Ted. Quelqu'un qui se prend la tÍte.
Voir aussi: Un pauvre Ted.
Quelqu'un qui se prend la tÍte
avec des rťsultats dťsastreux.
Exemple: Billy a fait le pauvre Ted
en essayant...
C'est bon. Je comprends.
T'inquiŤte, je ne ferai pas le Ted,
pauvre ou pas.
Je vais laisser passer quelques jours.
20 minutes plus tard...
- Ellen, vous vous souvenez ? Ted.
- Ted. Bonjour.
Je voulais vous appeler.
L'ordinateur est en train
de digťrer les chiffres.
TrŤs occupť, ce petit ordinateur.
Vous aviez dit trois jours.
Ah bon ? Trois jours.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Quand on vous promet
la femme parfaite dans trois jours,
on le note dans son agenda. Donc.
Comment dire ? «a va Ítre trŤs dur.
Ted, il n'y a aucune femme pour vous.
Finalement, ce n'ťtait pas si dur.
Il n'y a pas de femme pour moi ?
Vous aviez dit huit.
Je sais. «a devrait.
Je ne sais pas oý elles sont.
Mais je suis architecte.
Et selon vous, je suis mignon.
- Un architecte mignon.
- Et mon moral ?
J'ai 100% de rťussite.
C'est mon accroche.
Je trouverais quelqu'un
si vous ťtiez homosexuel.
- C'est pas le cas.
- Un peu bi ?
Non !
- Vous vous moquez de moi, hein ?
- Voyez vous-mÍme.
Je ne peux pas vous prťsenter ŗ quelqu'un
si vous n'avez pas un quotient
de compatibilitť supťrieur ŗ 7,0. Regardez.
5,4. 4,8. 5,6...
Lŗ, il y a un 9,6.
Ne touchez pas ŗ l'ordinateur.
Oui. Sarah O'Brien.
Je l'ai casťe il y a six mois.
Elle aurait ťtť absolument parfaite
pour vous.
Et le gars avec qui vous l'avez casťe.
Il avait eu 9,6 ?
- 8,5.
- Donc il est nul !
Non, 8,5 est un excellent
quotient de compatibilitť.
Oui, c'est bon. C'est du solide. Mais 9,6 ?
9,6, Áa crŤve le plafond.
Mais Sarah est casťe.
Ted, regardez. J'ai un dÓner. S'il vous plaÓt.
Je vous promets qu'on trouvera.
Ne perdez pas espoir.
Des femmes atteignent l'‚ge de 18 ans
tous les jours.
C'est une nouvelle espŤce. Le cafasouris.
C'est de la taille d'une patate.
Alors quoi, c'est un cafapatatesouris ?
Ne le tourne pas en ridicule.
C'est un cafasouris !
Incroyable ! C'est comme si on ťtait
la mÍme personne.
Sarah O'Brien adore les brunchs.
Elle veut deux enfants.
Sa chanson nulle prťfťrťe
est Summer Breeze, de Seals and Croft.
Eh bien, Ted.
On dirait bien que tu es sa femme parfaite.
Et comme l'hippocampe majestueux,
c'est un hermaphrodite.
…videmment, tout Áa reste
bien mystťrieux.
Malgrť tout ce qu'on sait sur le cafasouris,
il y a encore beaucoup de choses
qu'on ignore.
Eh bien,
on sait que le cafasouris n'existe pas.
Mais on ignore ce que vous avez fumť.
Donc tu ne crois vraiment pas
aux cafasouris ?
Je pense que vous avez vu
une chose normale,
mais que votre imagination a travaillť,
comme le monstre du loch Ness.
Si par cela, tu veux dire:
"Qu'il existe vraiment et est super",
alors oui,
c'est comme le monstre du loch Ness.
Son alimentation ressemble ŗ la nŰtre.
Des cťrťales,
- et il adore le fromage.
- Bon, Áa devient bizarre.
Les similitudes continuent.
Elle dťteste les faux jetons.
Comme moi.
Elle est dermatologue.
J'ai de la peau.
Tu veux Ítre son copain. Elle en a dťjŗ un.
- C'est troublant !
- D'accord.
Pourquoi ne pas la rencontrer ?
Histoire de voir ŗ quoi ressemble mon 9,6
en personne, pour rťfťrence.
Et si elle pense pouvoir faire 11,45
de mieux, pourquoi l'en empÍcher ?
<i>C'est vrai, j'avais calculť.</i>
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, je suis le docteur O'Brien.
Je suis l'architecte Mosby. Dťsolť,
je voulais aussi mentionner ma profession.
- Bonjour, Ted.
- Bonjour.
Que fait-on, aujourd'hui ?
J'ai un grain de beautť dans le dos.
Ce n'est sans doute rien.
Mais je suis prudent.
Je suis pareille.
Dťsolť. Summer Breeze
est ma chanson nulle prťfťrťe.
Je l'ai en tÍte depuis que je l'ai entendue
ce week-end,
- ŗ un brunch.
- J'adore les brunchs.
Il n'y a rien de tel.
Tant que ce n'est pas
avec une bande de faux jetons.
J'aime votre faÁon de penser,
architecte Mosby.
«a va vous sembler bizarre,
mais ce sera pire
quand j'aurai enlevť ma chemise,
alors voilŗ.
Voulez-vous souper avec moi
samedi soir ?
C'est trŤs gentil,
mais samedi, je me marie.
Vendredi soir ?
Eh bien. Vous vous mariez. Fťlicitations.
- Merci.
- Dťsolť de vous avoir invitťe.
J'ai senti qu'il y avait
une connexion bizarre entre nous.
- J'ai l'air complŤtement fou ?
- Juste un peu.
Bon, si par le plus grand des hasards,
et je ne vous le souhaite pas,
vous ne vous mariez pas en fin
de semaine, passez-moi un coup de fil.
D'accord. Mais c'est peu probable.
Ma robe me va trop bien.
J'en suis sŻr.
Dites donc,
c'est un piŤge drŰlement sophistiquť.
Vous pensez que Bip Bip va se faire avoir ?
On comprend. Tu es sceptique.
Mais Marshall et moi, on est croyants.
On y croit.
Oui, regarde autour de toi.
L'univers est mystťrieux et redoutable.
Il y a le triangle des Bermudes,
les fantŰmes, le Bigfoot.
Mauvaises cartes, maisons qui grincent,
un idiot dťguisť en gorille.
Les extraterrestres ?
Allons ! Tu peux m'accorder
les extraterrestres.
Stonehenge, la Zone 51,
il y a des extraterrestres partout.
Tu n'es pas sťrieux ?
Ma chŤre, tu m'as cherchť.
Alors, mon 9,6:
Belle, charmante, intelligente, ...fiancťe !
- Ted, je suis dťsolťe.
- C'ťtait mal barrť.
Je lui ai dit de m'appeler
si elle changeait d'avis. Mais bon.
Attends, attends. Pas si vite !
LŤve la main si tu as draguť
une femme fiancťe.
Ne tire pas sur le joueur,
prends-t'en au jeu.
"La nuit du 2 juillet 1947,
"le ciel ťtait clair sur Roswell,
au Nouveau-Mexique."
Seigneur !
Ted, il y a un message pour toi
sur le rťpondeur.
- Le docteur O'Brien.
- Quoi ?
"Quand soudain,
dans un dťploiement de..."
<i>Bonjour, Ted. Ici le docteur O'Brien.
C'est ŗ propos d'aujourd'hui.</i>
<i>Je dois vraiment vous parler. Appelez-moi.
Je serai au bureau toute la journťe.</i>
Le docteur va vous recevoir.
Qu'est-ce que je fais ? J'y vais, non ?
Ne t'en mÍle pas. Un gars s'attend
ŗ ťpouser cette femme, samedi.
Ouais, un gars de 8,5.
Si j'ťpousais la mauvaise personne
et que la bonne ťtait lŗ
et le savait, je voudrais qu'elle vienne
ŗ mon cabinet de dermato
pour me le dire.
Dans ce cas, je ne m'en mÍle pas,
- je suis une fin heureuse.
- Une fin heureuse ?
Je dois y aller.
Je ne sais pas ce qui se passera
quand j'y serai, mais je dois y aller.
- ņ plus tard. Bonne chasse.
- Attendez, vous allez oý ?
Vous ne restez pas voir le cafasouris ?
On va aller faire des cercles
dans les champs de blť.
- Oh, mon Dieu !
- Nom d'un tonneau, on le tient.
- Qu'est-ce qu'on en fait ?
- Du calme. J'ai un plan.
J'en ai parlť ŗ mon ami Sudeep.
Il va le montrer au dťpartement
de biologie de Columbia.
- Mais il doit Ítre vivant.
- Attends, non, non !
Ils vont faire des expťriences
en laboratoire. C'est horrible.
On ne devrait pas plutŰt l'assommer
avec un b‚ton ?
Rebonjour.
Je suis heureuse que vous soyez venu.
Je prťfŤre vous l'annoncer en personne.
Allez-y, Sarah. Vous pouvez tout me dire.
Vous avez un carcinome basocellulaire.
Autre chose ?
Votre grain de beautť. J'ai reÁu la biopsie.
Ce n'est pas mortel,
mais on devrait l'enlever.
Attendez, vous vous mariez toujours ?
- Bien sŻr.
- Mais on a 9,6.
- Pardon ?
- Bon, je...
Je suis allť ŗ Solutions d'amour
et j'ai vu sur l'ordinateur
qu'on avait 9,6. Votre fiancť n'a que 8,5.
- Vous avez vu mon dossier ?
- Il le fallait. Vous ťtiez la seule.
Vous n'Ítes pas curieuse ?
La femme qui vous a prťsentť
votre fiancť nous trouve parfaits.
Je me marie samedi.
Ted.
Vous ne trouvez pas un peu impulsif
d'ťpouser un gars
- rencontrť il y a quelques mois ?
- Et c'est pas impulsif
de faire une proposition
ŗ une inconnue dťjŗ fiancťe ?
Vous voyez, on est tous deux impulsifs.
On est faits l'un pour l'autre !
- Ted, calmez-vous.
- Me calmer ?
Vous Ítes la seule ŗ me convenir !
Voyons, il y avait un ordinateur
et huit poissons
- dans une mer pleine de lesbiennes.
- Ted, Ted.
Vous pensez sťrieusement
qu'il n'y a personne pour vous
sur la foi des assertions d'un ordinateur ?
Avant, non, mais avec les calculs,
j'ai ťtť perturbť.
L'amour n'est pas une science.
Les sentiments ne se calculent pas.
Quand on tombe amoureux,
un 8,5 ťquivaut ŗ un 10.
Vous avez raison.
Si c'est bien ce que vous dites,
Áa peut Ítre ťnorme pour ma carriŤre.
Prťpare-toi. «a va te stupťfier.
EspŤce de salaud. J'ťtais vraiment excitť.
- Quoi ?
- Elle est vide.
Attends, s'il n'est pas lŗ, cela veut dire...
Lily !
- Robin !
- Quoi ?
- Oh mon Dieu ! C'ťtait vrai !
- Tiens, vraiment ? Fais quelque chose !
Non ! C'est quoi, Áa ? Tu veux le soŻler ?
C'est le seul truc qui m'est venu ŗ l'esprit !
Lily ! Dieu merci !
Lily, je t'aime !
Robin, ouvre la fenÍtre !
Pour l'amour de Dieu, ouvre la fenÍtre !
Il vole.
«a alors.
Sois libre, bÍte mutante.
Je vais regretter notre petite guerre.
J'en suis venu ŗ admirer ta tťnacitť...
Nom de Dieu ! Il vient par ici !
Ferme la fenÍtre !
Bonjour, Ellen.
Je voudrais Ítre remboursť.
Je suis nulle. J'ai ťchouť.
J'ai tout essayť, Ted.
J'ai ťlargi les paramŤtres de recherche,
j'ai modifiť le programme.
Hier soir, je suis restťe dans la rue
pendant cinq heures
en montrant votre photo aux passantes.
Personne n'en voulait.
Quoiqu'un travelo prostituť m'a dit
qu'il ou elle le ferait pour moitiť prix,
car vous ressemblez ŗ John Cusack
<i>et que son film prťfťrť est
Un monde pour nous...</i>
Voyons, Ellen. Un pot de crŤme glacťe.
Ce n'est pas un peu clichť ?
C'est pour le bourbon.
Ce n'est pas sans espoir.
Vous me trouverez quelqu'un.
Non. Vous allez mourir seul.
Mais non. Regardez-moi.
Je suis intelligent. Je suis beau.
Il faut juste vous remettre ŗ chercher.
Non. Vous ne trouverez jamais personne.
Et au fur et ŗ mesure que vous vieillirez,
Áa deviendra plus dur.
Vous Ítes ridicule.
Un jour, je serai sur ce mur.
- Certainement pas !
- Mais si !
- Comment le savez-vous ?
- Je n'en sais rien, mais j'y crois.
Si un cafard et une souris peuvent
tomber amoureux dans cette ville,
alors moi aussi !
Je ne vous suis plus.
L'affaire, c'est que quelque chose de bien
va m'arriver.
Avec ou sans l'aide de votre ordinateur,
mais Áa va arriver.
- Alors je continue ŗ chercher ?
- Bien sŻr.
Et vous allez le faire gratuitement.
Kids, before I met your mother, when I was still out there searching,
I learned something valuable.
That love is not a science.
Wow, that was a great story, Dad.
We're going to go watch TV.
You see, sometimes in life you just have to accept that certain things can't be explained.
And that's kind of scary.
Oh, my God.
I know, I'm still shaking.
What the...?
Joke's on you, I have a cold.
Are you guys okay?
Another round, and back it up for me and Lily!
What happened?
We saw something up in the apartment.
Something bad.
I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy.
Oh, muchos sexy.
Yo quiero, Marshall.
Oh, my God.
What was it?
Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen.
Mouse?
Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse.
That was a huge cockroach.
Baby, it was a mouse.
It had whiskers.
But those things coming out of its head, those were antennae.
Marshall ran away from a cockroach.
It was a mouse.
Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.
Oh, my story is on. Ted, pay attention.
Carl, turn it up.
I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker.
Ellen, your company, Love Solutions, boasts 100% success rate.
What's your secret?
Science.
Everything in life can be broken down to ones and zeros, even love.
All I have to do is input the variables, run the algorithm,
and presto manifesto, you have a soul mate, and it works!
Just ask all of my happy couples.
And these are just the attractive ones.
I have more photos in the bathroom.
Love Solutions, Ellen Pierce.
A beacon of hope for New York City's lovelorn.
Robin Scherbotsky...
Was that chick at the end really a client?
Yes.
We're signing up.
What?
Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot.
That's a perfect cocktail.
Shake well, then sleep with.
I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up.
It's the man version of getting a cat.
No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur, and only mammals have fur.
It was a cockroach.
Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach
is if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just killed.
Oh, my God.
Come on.
Ted! Hurry! You've got to help me.
- My boat is sinking!
- What?
- My boat is sinking!
- You have a boat?
Yes, I bought a boat last year at a police auction.
I just got a call from a guy down at the marina that it's leaning starboard at a 45 degree angle.
If I don't get down there right now, it's going to capsize. Now come on!
Your boat is sinking. That was good.
Come on, Ted. This is an incredible opportunity.
We'll meet our soul mates, nail 'em and never call 'em again.
All finished, gentlemen?
Congratulations.
You have just taken your very first step.
Gosh, thanks, Ellen.
I sure hope this works.
I'm so done with the single life-- all the games, the meaningless sex.
You deserve more.
That is so true, Ellen.
I really think I'm ready to stop being a me, and start being a we.
Hey, is there any way I can let it be known that I love cuddling?
Ah, of course you can. That is so... Oh.
Kind of hard to talk about with Ted here, but
I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night...
when the tears come.
Ellen, can you help me find her?
Get out.
What?
I get 15 guys like you every week.
Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call 'em again.
Oh, my God, people do that?
Do you want to do this the easy way or the hard way?
What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?
No, that's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.
Okay, Ted, let's go.
Not you. You stay.
You're cute.
You're an architect.
Good career, and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application,
like your friend Jack Package.
- It's pronounced pa-codge.
- Get out of here!
You, I can work with. You give me three days,
and I will find the woman you will marry.
Uh, no thanks.
I don't need an algorithm to meet women.
It's New York City, you know-- plenty of fish in the sea.
Plenty of fish in the sea.
Yes, there's nine million people in New York, 4.5 million women.
Of course, you want to meet somebody roughly your own age.
Let's say, plus, minus, five years.
So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000.
But, uh, wait... 48% of those are already in relationships,
and then you have to eliminate half for intelligence, sense of humor and compatibility,
and then you have to take out the ex-girlfriends and the relatives,
and, oh, we can't forget those lesbians.
And then that leaves us with eight women.
That can't be right. Eight?
Really? Eight?
There are eight fish in that big blue ocean, Ted.
And if you feel confident that you could reel one in to your boat without me,
there's the door.
Do you take credit cards?
Okay, it's back. And this time we got a good look.
Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.
It's bigger now.
It's been feeding.
We were just upstairs watching TV.
Oh, gosh.
Okay, let's do this.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.
It's over.
Oh, God!
So did you get a good look at it?
Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton, like a roach.
But it had mouse-like characteristics.
Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.
So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?
It's a cock-a-mouse.
What?
It's some sort of mutant combination of the two.
It's as if a cockroach and a mouse, you know...
Did the horizontal, ten-legged, interspecies cha-cha?
That's impossible. That simply can't happen.
- Oh, but it can.
- And it has.
And it's pissed.
Dude, is everything okay? You left the front door open.
There was no time.
So, Love Solutions?
Did you meet the love of your life?
She said it'd take three days. It's been five days.
Should I be worried?
Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.
Did you just use my name as a verb?
Oh, yeah. We do that behind your back.
"Ted out," to overthink.
Also see "Ted up."
"Ted up"-- to overthink something with disastrous results.
Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when he tried...
Okay, I get it.
Don't worry. I'm not going to Ted anything up. Or out.
I should give it a few more days.
Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.
Ted, hi. I, uh, meant to call you.
The computer is still crunching the numbers.
Busy as a bee, that little computer.
You said it was going to be three days.
Did I?
Three days? Really?
Yeah, and when someone says you're going to meet the perfect woman in three days,
you kind of put that in your date book, so...
How do I say this? This is going to be really hard.
Ted... there are absolutely no women out there for you.
Phew, actually, I got through that okay.
There're no women out there for me? I thought you said there were eight.
I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are.
But... I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute.
I'm a cute architect.
How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate.
That's my hook.
I could maybe find somebody for you if you were gay.
Well, I'm not.
- A little bi maybe?
- No!
You're messing with me, right?
Come see for yourself.
I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher.
And look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6.
There's a 9.6 right there.
Don't touch the computer.
Yes, Sarah O'Brien.
I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you.
Well, what about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?
8.5.
So he sucks.
No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.
Oh, sure, it's good.
It's solid, but a 9.6?
9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up.
Ted, look, I have a lunch.
Please, I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope.
There are new women turning 18 every day.
It's a whole new species-- the cock-a-mouse.
And it's the size of a potato.
So what, now it's a cock-a-potato-mouse?
Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cock-a-mouse.
My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person.
Sarah O'Brien loves brunch, she wants to have two children.
Her guilty pleasure song is "Summer Breeze" by Seals and Crofts.
Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.
And like the majestic seahorse, it's hermaphroditic.
Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.
For as much as we know about the cock-a-mouse,
there's still so much we don't know.
Well, we know that there's no such thing as the cock-a-mouse.
What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.
So you really don't believe in the cock-a-mouse?
Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal,
but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know?
Like the Loch Ness Monster.
If by "like the Loch Ness Monster," you mean totally exists and is awesome,
then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness Monster.
Its diet is not unlike our own-- grains, cereals-- and it's awfully fond of cheese.
Okay, this is getting weird. The similarities go on and on.
She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies, too.
She's a dermatologist. I have skin.
You want to be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend, it's uncanny.
All right.
But it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right?
See what my 9.6 looks like in person?
As, you know, a frame of reference.
And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?
That's right. I did the math.
Hi.
Hi. I'm Dr. O'Brien.
I'm Architect Mosby.
Sorry, I just wanted to say my job, too.
Hi, I'm Ted.
Hi. So what are we doing today?
Right, I, uh, I have a kind of mole on my back.
It's probably nothing, but I'm a cautious guy.
I'm exactly the same.
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Sorry about that.
"Summer Breeze" is my guilty pleasure song.
It's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend...
at brunch.
I love brunch.
It's the best.
As long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.
I like the way you think, Architect Mosby.
Hey, this may sound weird, but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off.
So I'm going to ask you now.
Do you want to have dinner with me Saturday night?
That's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday.
Friday night?
Wow. You're getting married. Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'm really sorry I asked you out, it just felt like
there could be this weird connection between us.
How crazy am I coming off here?
Only a little.
Well... if by some million-to-one long shot and I'm not rooting for this--
you wind up not getting married this weekend,
give me a call.
Okay.
But it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress.
I'm sure you do.
Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap.
You think the roadrunner's going to fall for it?
Okay, we get it. You're skeptical.
But Marshall and I, we're believers.
We believe.
Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome.
You've got the Bermuda Triangle, ghosts, Bigfoot.
Bad maps, creaky houses, hillbilly in a gorilla suit.
Aliens.
Oh, come on, you've got to give me aliens.
Stonehenge, Area 51, there's alien crap all over the place.
You can't be serious.
My friend, you just poked the bear.
So my 9.6-- beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.
Oh, Ted. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it was a long shot.
I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mind, but I don't know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's not skip over this.
Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.
Come on, Lily. Don't hate the player, hate the game.
"On the night of July 2, 1947, conditions we clear over Roswell, New Mexico..."
Oh, geez.
Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you.
Dr. O'Brien.
What?
"When suddenly an array of..."
Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien.
About today, listen, I really need to talk to you.
Call me. I'll be at the office all day.
The doctor will see you now.
What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?
Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.
Yeah, an 8.5 guy.
Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it,
I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.
In that scenario, I'm not interfering, I'm a happy ending.
Happy ending.
Look, I have to go down there.
I don't know what's going to happen when I get there, but I've got to give it a shot.
All right, see you later. Happy hunting.
Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cock-a-mouse?
Yeah, we're going to go make some crop circles.
Oh, my God!
Holy crap buckets. We got it.
What do we do with it?
Calm down. I have a plan.
I told my friend Sadip about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department.
But it has to be alive.
Wait, no, no!
They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean.
Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?
Hello again.
I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.
Go ahead, Sarah. You can tell me anything.
You have a basal cell carcinoma.
Anything else?
Your mole. The biopsy came back.
It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it.
Wait, then you're still getting married?
Of course I'm still getting married.
But we're a 9.6.
Excuse me?
Okay. I went to Love Solutions, and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer,
that you and I are a 9.6.
Your fiancé is only an 8.5.
You looked at my file?
I had to. You're my only match.
Aren't you even a little curious?
The woman who set you up with your fiancé, thinks we're a better match.
I am getting married on Saturday.
Summer breeze...
Ted.
Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive
marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?
Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you
to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know?
See? We're both impulsive.
We're perfect for each other.
Ted, just calm down.
Calm down?! You're my only match.
God, there was a computer and there were eight fish in a sea full of lesbians and...
Okay, Ted, Ted.
Do you honestly believe, deep down, that there is no one else out there for you
just because some computer says so?
I didn't used to. But there was math, I got confused.
Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling.
When you fall in love with someone, an 8.5 equals a perfect ten.
You're right.
If this thing is what you say it is, it could be huge for my career.
Brace yourself, dude.
This is going to blow your mind hole.
You bastard.
I actually got excited about this.
What?
It's empty.
Wait, but if it's not here, that means...
Lily.
Robin!
What?
Oh, my God.
It's real.
No, is it?
Do something.
What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?
It was the only thing I could think of.
Lily! Thank God.
Lily, I love you.
Robin, open up the window!
Open the window! Ah!
It can fly.
Wow.
Be free, mutant beast.
I'll miss this private war of ours.
I grew to admire your tenacious... Holy mother of God, it's headed this way!
Hi, Ellen.
I think I want my money back.
I'm a failure.
I'm all washed up. I tried everything, Ted.
I widened the search parameters. I tweaked the program.
Last night I stood out on the street for five hours
showing your photo to random pedestrians. No takers.
Although this transvestite hooker said he/she would do you for half price
because you kind of look like John Cusack and his/her favorite movie was Say Anything.
Come on, Ellen. I mean, a pint of ice cream, isn't that a bit cliché?
It's for the bourbon.
This isn't hopeless. You're going to find someone for me.
No, I won't.
You're going to die alone.
I'm not going to die alone.
Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive.
You just got to get back out there and keep looking.
No, you're never going to find anybody.
And every year you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder.
You're being ridiculous. I'm going to be up on that wall one of these days.
- No, you won't!
- Yes, I will!
How do you know?
I don't know, but I believe.
Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse can find love in this crazy city, then, damn it, so can I.
You're losing me.
The point is, something good's going to happen to me.
Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.
So I should keep looking?
Of course you should.
And now, you're going to do it for free.

L'an 2030
Les enfants,
il y a beaucoup d'ťdifices ŗ New York,
<i>des appartements par milliers,
des ťtages par millions.</i>
<i>Et mÍme si Áa remonte ŗ longtemps
et que quelqu'un d'autre y habite,</i>
<i>notre appartement nous est propre,
ŗ tout jamais.</i>
<i>Cet endroit est plein de bons souvenirs:</i>
<i>Marshall en train de jouer
ŗ des jeux vidťo,</i>
<i>Lily en train de peindre
sur l'escalier de secours.</i>
- Hť !
- Dťsolťe, M. Matson !
<i>Et moi, en train de faire le cafť.
J'avais une cafetiŤre</i>
<i>vieille d'une cinquantaine d'annťes.
Elle donnait du cafť trŤs mauvais.</i>
<i>On la surnommait "la Dťcharge".</i>
- Je la branche.
- J'enregistre mon jeu.
<i>J'adorais tous les dťtails
de notre appartement,</i>
<i>y compris les ťpťes ridicules
qu'on avait accrochťes au mur.</i>
<i>Je ne voulais pas que les choses changent,
mais la vie ne fonctionne pas ainsi.</i>
L'an 2005
Vous ne croirez jamais
ce qui nous est arrivť.
Moi-mÍme, je n'arrive pas ŗ y croire.
On ťtait ŗ Queens et on a dťcidť
de faire un tour ŗ mon appartement.
<i>Comment Áa, son appartement ?</i>
Ma tante Lily vivait avec toi
et mon oncle Marshall.
Je vois pourquoi tu serais portťe
ŗ le croire, mais j'ai mon appartement.
Je tiens ŗ mon indťpendance.
- «a fait longtemps que tu y es allťe ?
- Trois mois.
C'est comme un pantalon
au cas oý l'on se sente grosse.
On espŤre ne jamais avoir ŗ le porter,
mais on aime l'avoir en rťserve.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
- Oý Áa ?
Mon appartement ťtait ici.
- Oý ?
- Juste ici.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
Lily, c'est un restaurant chinois.
Non ! C'ťtait mon appartement !
Ma commode ťtait... C'est ma commode !
Et Áa, c'est mon placard.
C'est ici que j'ai renversť
du vernis ŗ ongles ! Voilŗ la tache !
Salut ! Une table pour combien ?
- Lily !
- Oui. On se connaÓt ?
Oui, de votre photo d'album de finissants.
Vous Ítes plus jolie en personne.
Oui, je sais. La frange ne m'allait pas bien.
Oý sont mes affaires ?
Dans la rťserve.
Je peux les emballer pour vous.
Vous les prenez pour emporter ?
- C'est mon appartement, ici.
- Plus maintenant.
Tu inventes cette histoire ou quoi ?
Oui. On t'aurait avertie, c'est sŻr.
On a envoyť un avis pour vous avertir.
- Quand ?
- «a fait trois mois.
Et voici votre courrier.
Sans les magazines.
On ne peut quand mÍme pas te jeter
dans la rue comme Áa. Tu as un bail.
Je n'avais pas de bail ťcrit, en tant que tel,
mais allez voir ma propriťtaire,
Mme Conroy.
Elle a peut-Ítre 98 ans,
mais elle est encore...
MAISON DES BOULETTES
DE MADAME CHEW
Elle est morte ?
Le bus est sorti de nulle part.
Mon appartement est rendu
un restaurant chinois.
- Je suis censťe faire quoi ?
- Viens vivre avec nous.
- Vraiment ?
- Bien sŻr.
- Es-tu sŻr, Ted ?
- Oui.
Tu vis pas mal dťjŗ ici.
«a ne changera rien.
«a va tout changer !
Ted ! Tu es foutu.
- Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
- Pourquoi cette fille te fixe-t-elle ?
Parce que je parais bien.
Concentre-toi !
Toi et Marshall Ítes colocataires.
Tu as un bel appartement.
Marshall et Lily viennent de se fiancer.
Oui. Et alors ?
Tu ne seras plus son colocataire
quand il sera mariť.
Quelqu'un devra dťmťnager.
Qui, d'aprŤs toi ?
Ils ont sŻrement dťcidť
qui va garder l'appartement.
Vous en avez parlť, pas vrai ?
Oui, on en a parlť.
Quand Lily et moi nous marierons,
- qui va garder l'appartement ?
- Bonne question.
Tu sais qui est mieux placť
pour rťsoudre cette ťnigme ?
- Qui ?
- Le Ted et le Marshall de l'avenir.
Absolument.
Laissons-leur la t‚che de dťcider.
Foutu Ted du passť !
Tu as tout g‚chť, mon gars.
Avec Lily, Áa change toute la dynamique.
- Ils vont t'exclure.
- Mais non.
Ils ne vont pas m'exclure.
Marshall est mon meilleur ami.
Un de mes meilleurs amis.
Il ne me ferait pas Áa.
Garde-les ŗ l'oeil. Suis mon conseil.
Il y aura des petits changements
dans l'appartement.
Voyons, Barney. Tu es paranoÔaque.
Non, mais, vraiment,
qu'est-ce qu'elle veut, cette fille ?
- Je sors avec elle en ce moment.
- Quoi ?
Oui. Je l'ai trouvťe en ligne.
J'en ai assez des bars,
des aventures d'un soir.
Je cherche l'‚me soeur,
quelqu'un que j'aime,
ŗ qui je peux faire des c‚lins.
C'est ce que j'ai mis dans mon profil.
Mais cette fille veut la mÍme chose,
et Áa m'ennuie.
Ted, tťlťphone-moi de l'hŰpital.
- D'accord.
- Tu vas ŗ l'hŰpital ?
Il va retourner la voir,
je vais lui tťlťphoner.
Ce sera un faux appel d'urgence
de la part d'un parent ŗ l'hŰpital.
Seigneur ! Une fausse urgence ?
C'est l'excuse la plus ridicule
et la plus misťrable.
Je te croyais meilleur que Áa.
Reste ŗ l'ťcoute.
Je dťveloppe de nouvelles stratťgies.
Entre-temps, souhaite-moi bonne chance.
Tu vas parler avec Marshall, alors ?
Il voudra garder l'appartement,
et moi aussi.
- On finira par se disputer. Alors, non.
- C'est trŤs mature.
DŤs qu'un problŤme sťrieux se prťsente,
tu fais comme si de rien n'ťtait ?
J'ai un appel ŗ faire.
Je peux le faire pour toi ?
Pardon.
- AllŰ ?
- Salut, sexy.
- Salut, tante Kathy. Quoi de neuf ?
- Pas grand-chose.
Je suis en train de parler de toi, beautť.
Un accident ?
Est-ce que l'oncle Rudy va s'en sortir ?
Ta tante Kathy a vraiment envie de toi,
mon neveu bien montť.
Mon Dieu !
Pourquoi a-t-il voulu construire
son propre hťlicoptŤre ?
Viens-t'en, mon beau.
Viens me donner un morceau
de ton chocolat blanc.
S'il a besoin d'un don d'organe, je lui ferai.
J'arrive.
Tu sais, je...
ņ plus tard.
Je paierai la note la prochaine fois.
«a sera bien
de vivre ensemble tous les trois.
Je crois que ce sera bien.
Ce cafť est super.
Vraiment super.
Trop, mÍme.
Oý est passť la Dťcharge ?
- C'est quoi, Áa ?
- Ma cafetiŤre. De mon appartement.
- Elle fait du bon cafť, pas vrai ?
- Absolument.
Comme la Dťcharge.
Vraiment ? J'ai toujours trouvť que le cafť
de la Dťcharge goŻtait la rouille.
Oui. Non. C'est vrai.
Mais j'aimais le goŻt de la rouille.
J'y ťtais habituť. Je ne sais pas.
De plus, la cafetiŤre de Lily ne donne pas
de chocs ťlectriques.
Non, mais... Avouez que la Dťcharge...
«a rťveille, le matin.
Tu sais ce qui rťveille aussi, le matin ?
Le cafť.
C'est super. Tu as raison.
Mes colocataires ! C'est super.
Ils sont en train de m'exclure. Tout ŗ fait.
- Je n'y croyais pas, mais tu as raison.
- Oui. Lily est astucieuse.
Elle a apportť une belle cafetiŤre.
- Comment a-t-elle pu ?
- Ce n'est pas juste la cafetiŤre.
J'ai fini mon tableau.
- C'est super.
- TrŤs beau.
- Oý veux-tu l'accrocher ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Au-dessus du piano ?
Oui, Áa serait beau.
Dommage que les ťpťes occupent dťjŗ
cet espace. On adore les ťpťes.
«a fait longtemps
que ces ťpťes sont accrochťes lŗ.
Je sais. Elles me manqueraient beaucoup,
ŗ moi aussi.
Pourquoi pas
dans la chambre de Marshall ?
D'accord.
Il voulait retirer les ťpťes !
Ce n'est pas croyable !
Ted, pourquoi pas lui parler ?
C'est ton meilleur ami.
Pardon ?
Un de tes meilleurs amis.
C'est l'heure
de communiquer entre adultes.
De communiquer ? C'est la pire idťe !
Tu as ralenti leur premiŤre avance.
C'est bien.
- Il faut contre-attaquer, maintenant.
- Je suis censť faire Áa comment ?
Tu dois marquer ton territoire.
Et pas en faisant pipi autour de la cuvette.
Fais quelque chose d'important.
- Je devrais acheter un nouveau divan ?
- Plus gros que Áa.
Katie est arrivťe. …coutez, vite.
Hier soir, j'ai compris un truc:
Ce qui manque au monde des cťlibataires.
PrÍts ? «a prend une loi
contre la camelote.
- Comme pour les voitures ?
- Voilŗ.
ņ partir du dťbut du rendez-vous,
on a cinq minutes
pour dťcider si on veut continuer la soirťe.
Et si on n'a pas envie,
ce n'est pas compliquť, on dit:
"Merci, bonsoir. Et adieu."
La loi contre la camelote. «a va marcher.
Peut-Ítre mÍme maintenant.
- Salut, Katie. Je m'appelle Barney.
- Salut ! Heureuse de te rencontrer, enfin.
Oui. Katie, tu feras bientŰt partie
de l'histoire ancienne.
Dis-le ŗ tes amis.
«a va marcher.
Le comportement de Ted est ťtrange.
Il appose des ťtiquettes sur ses aliments.
Il a mÍme taillť son nom
dans un morceau de fromage.
Oui. Le fromage appartient
dťsormais ŗ Ed.
- Il n'aime pas le fait que j'habite ici.
- Ce n'est pas Áa.
Tu as toujours vťcu ici, plus ou moins.
Ted t'adore.
- C'est quoi, son problŤme, alors ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Mais quand il sera prÍt ŗ en parler,
il le fera.
Tu plaisantes ?
Vous ne parlez jamais de rien.
Il va laisser traÓner la chose
jusqu'ŗ ce qu'il fasse un gros truc
pour se dťfouler.
On voit que tu ne connais pas Ted.
J'ai un colis pour Ted Mosby.
Ta cabine est arrivťe d'Angleterre.
Super ! Elle est belle, non ?
Disons. Mais je ne sais pas
si elle plaira ŗ Lily.
Elle me plaÓt.
Je vais donc la garder, si tu veux bien.
Bien sŻr. On habite tous ici.
On devrait donc tous
avoir droit ŗ nos affaires.
Exactement.
Super. Magnifique.
Tu aimes la cabine. Alors, on la garde.
J'aime ce tableau.
Je vais donc l'accrocher au mur.
Oh, alors c'est comme Áa, hein ?
Salut, monsieur le Gouverneur.
Oh, alors c'est comme Áa, pas vrai ?
A plus tard !
Ouais, c'est comme Áa
- Je veux cet appartement !
- Moi aussi.
Tu n'es qu'un con !
Non. Je suis un visionnaire.
La loi contre la camelote ! «a va marcher !
Sache que ta petite loi
reprťsente tous les problŤmes
de notre pays
sans capacitť de concentration.
Tu as tort. Cette loi est super.
«a prend plus de cinq minutes
pour connaÓtre quelqu'un.
Si tu continues ŗ abandonner les gens
comme Áa, tu manqueras ta chance.
Disons que tu sors avec un inconnu.
Tu es ŗ table avec... lui.
Tu crois avoir besoin
de plus de cinq minutes
pour dťcider
que tu ne voudras plus sortir avec lui ?
C'est ce que je crois, oui.
C'est peut-Ítre mon ‚me soeur.
Je n'en sais rien.
Mal jouť, Scherbatsky.
Salut. Connaissez-vous Robin ?
- Salut.
- Salut.
D'accord, Marshall.
On va dťcider du sort de l'appartement
tout de suite.
On risque de se disputer,
mais on va dťcider.
- On peut dťcider ŗ pile ou face.
- Oui, dťcidons ŗ pile ou face.
- Lance la piŤce.
- Je vais la lancer. C'est parti.
- Lance-la.
- Je vais la lancer.
- Vas-y.
- Je vais la lancer !
Lance-la.
Mais avant, je veux dire un truc.
Tu ne voulais mÍme pas emmťnager ici.
Ce b‚timent te causait des allergies.
«a fait cinq ans.
J'obtiens mes antihistaminiques
sans ordonnance.
Voilŗ. As-tu autre chose ?
Bon, je lance la piŤce. Pile ou face ?
- Tu n'as pas besoin de deux piŤces.
- Pile ou face ?
- Comme si tu en avais besoin, toi.
- On fera des enfants.
Ce n'est pas vrai !
Tu n'en feras pas
avant de terminer tes ťtudes.
- Il reste au moins trois ans.
- Peut-Ítre.
On n'est pas douťs pour la contraception.
Deux, zťro.
Voyons ! Si je dťmťnage,
ma chambre sera vide.
Tu auras un nouveau coloc ?
Qui Áa ? Barney ?
Tu sais, il fait la cuisine tout nu.
Barney n'aurait pas dťcrochť nos ťpťes.
Nous ťtions frŤres !
Elles reprťsentaient notre fraternitť.
Tu les as remplacťes
par le foutu tableau de ta fiancťe ?
Ma fiancťe ?
C'est "ma fiancťe" tout ŗ coup ?
Lily fait partie de moi.
Et si tu ťtais mon frŤre,
elle ferait aussi partie de toi.
C'est notre frŤre, par association.
Je mťrite cet appartement, Marshall.
Pas plus que moi.
Super. Dťcidons ŗ pile ou face, alors.
Lance la piŤce.
C'est ainsi qu'on va dťcider
du sort de l'appartement ?
Je suppose.
Quels sont les rŤglements ?
On se bat jusqu'ŗ la mort ?
On ferait mieux de mettre Áa au clair.
«a va. «a va.
- Je peux dire quelque chose ?
- Que c'est bien ce qu'on fait ?
Absolument.
- Pourquoi on n'a jamais fait Áa ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Merci.
Je n'arrive pas ŗ y croire.
Je viens de rencontrer
une femme magnifique
et on mange dans mon restaurant prťfťrť.
C'est bien, ici.
J'aime l'idťe de manger des cŰtes levťes.
ņ l'avenir, on risque de prendre nos repas
sous forme de capsules.
Soit il n'y aura plus de vaches,
soit elles deviendront nos chefs.
Juste un instant. AllŰ ?
Pas grand-temps, Scherbatsky.
C'est ta derniŤre chance.
Laisse-moi tranquille.
4 minutes, 56. 4 minutes, 57.
4 minutes, 58.
On ne fait que commencer ŗ se connaÓtre.
Avoue que j'ai raison et ce sera fini.
Tu peux dire que je t'appelle de l'hŰpital.
Dťsolťe.
Laisse-moi deviner.
Il y a eu un accident fou, et tu dois y aller.
Non ! Je ne ferais jamais Áa.
Je ne veux pas m'en aller. Je veux rester.
…coute, si tu es une prostituťe,
je n'ai pas beaucoup d'argent.
- C'ťtait super.
- Je sais.
Refais la mÍme chose.
Cette fois,
saute et je passerai mon ťpťe en dessous.
Oui.
Voici pourquoi l'appartement me revient.
Toi et Lily allez vous marier.
Et moi, dans tout Áa ?
Je serai cťlibataire, sans colocataires,
et en plus, je serai sans-abri !
Tu trouves Áa juste ?
- Oh ! Pauvre petit.
- Quoi ?
Pauvre de moi ! Cťlibataire !
Mes ovaires sont en train de rapetisser !
Ted, si tu voulais te marier, tu l'aurais fait.
Mais tu ne l'as pas fait.
Sais-tu pourquoi ?
Parce que tu es impossible ŗ outrance,
tu es incapable de te concentrer
et tu es l'anti-hťdoniste.
- "L'anti-hťdoniste ?"
- Voilŗ.
- «a veut dire que tu ne sais pas t'amuser.
- Foutaises. Je m'amuse, lŗ.
Je sais. C'est super !
- Dťsolť d'avoir dťcrochť les ťpťes.
- «a va, mon gars.
Gr‚ce ŗ Áa, on fait de l'escrime.
C'est vrai.
Tu sais quand on les a achetťes ?
Le jour oý on a emmťnagť ici.
5 ans auparavant
Fťlicitations, Marshall.
Il y a des ťpťes au mur.
Ma liste de souhaits vient de diminuer
de moitiť.
Merde. Il manque une vis ŗ la table.
Prends la colle ŗ bois. «a tiendra.
Oui !
Mon Dieu ! J'arrive.
Kevin, je suis dťsolťe. Je dois y aller.
Mon amie a reÁu un coup d'ťpťe.
C'est une insulte de Klingon.
Tu es sans honneur.
Tu aurais dŻ le dire, dŤs le dťbut.
Non, je te jure que c'est vrai. Je viens de...
Laisse tomber.
J'ai donnť un coup d'ťpťe ŗ Lily.
J'ai blessť ma fiancťe.
Voyons, Marshall.
Tu crois que c'est toujours ta fiancťe ?
Je plaisante.
Je crois
que vous devriez garder l'appartement.
Mais tu t'es battu avec tant de courage.
Je ne me battais pas pour l'appartement.
C'ťtait pour...
Je ne sais pas.
Je voulais que rien ne change.
Mais Áa ne marchera pas, alors...
Garde l'appartement. Il est ŗ toi.
Est-ce qu'elle va bien ?
On lui met des pansements. «a ira.
…coutez. Je suis sorti
avec une fille nommťe Jackie.
Tu as dit qu'elle allait bien.
Je suis sorti avec une fille nommťe Jackie.
«a alors, Jackie.
Tu m'impressionnes vraiment.
J'ai l'impression que ce soir,
Áa pourrait se terminer par "Jackie... oooh"
Je suis navrťe. Je suis obligťe
d'appliquer la loi contre la camelote.
«a existe ! «a marche !
La loi contre la camelote est adoptťe !
J'aurais dŻ la nommer la loi de Barney.
- Mais tu as...
- Donne-lui Áa.
«a y est.
Elle aimerait voir les chevaliers
de la Table ronde mal montťe.
C'est nous.
Vous vous Ítes battus ŗ l'ťpťe ?
- Dťsolť, Lily.
- Dťsolť, Lily.
Lundi matin, je devrai expliquer
ŗ ma classe de maternelle,
ŗ qui je dis de faire attention
avec les ciseaux,
que mon fiancť m'a frappťe de son ťpťe.
Au moins,
l'ťpťe ne t'a pas transpercť le corps.
Je te demande pardon, le degrť
de pťnťtration a quelque chose ŗ y voir ?
Tu as raison. Je suis dťsolť.
On se battait pour dťcider du sort
de l'appartement. J'ai gagnť.
Tu n'as pas gagnť.
Je t'ai dit que tu pouvais le garder.
- Et tu sais, si j'avais...
- Bon, attendez !
Je ne veux pas cet appartement !
Il est trop masculin.
Il est plein d'ťpťes,
de jeux vidťo et... il sent le mec.
Il fait l'affaire, mais quand on va se marier,
je veux recommencer ŗ neuf avec toi.
Dans un nouvel appartement.
- Le vieil appartement va me manquer.
- ņ moi aussi.
On ne va pas se marier avant un an.
Oui, le Marshall de l'avenir
va s'en occuper.
- Laisse-le faire.
- Absolument.
C'est sŻrement parce que
j'ai perdu du sang, mais je suis affamťe.
- Sortons manger.
- Je sais oý aller.
Un restaurant chinois.
- Je n'arrive pas ŗ y croire.
- Je te l'ai dit.
Bon. Portons un toast.
La vie est remplie de changements.
Un jour, on a un appartement,
le lendemain, on y sert des boulettes.
Mais les choses importantes demeurent.
ņ la vŰtre !
- ņ la vŰtre !
- Oui.
- Oui.
- ņ la vŰtre !
ņ la loi contre la camelote.
Je le ferai moi-mÍme.
En passant, ce sont mes verres.
Je les ai achetťs chez lkea.
Ce sont mes verres !
J'aime cette chanson.
Il y a longtemps que je l'ai entendue.
Je suis presque sŻre que c'est
une cassette que tu m'avais offerte.
Oui, oui.
Lily, ton appartement fait
les meilleures boulettes ShangaÔ.
<i>Je t'aime, Lily. Bonne Saint-Valentin, 1998.</i>
So Kids, there are many buildings in New York City.
Thousands of apartments,
millions of stories.
And even though it's been decades and someone else lives there now,
there's one apartment in particular that will always be our apartment.
I have so many great memories of that place.
Marshall playing video games.
Lily painting on the fire escape.
Hey!
Sorry, Mr. Matson.
And me making the coffee.
I had this coffee pot-- it was probably 50 years old at the time,
and it made truly terrible coffee.
We called it Shocky.
Plugging in.
Saving game.
I loved every last detail of that place,
right down to the incredibly tacky swords we hung on the wall.
I never wanted any of it to change.
But that's not how life works.
You guys will never believe what just happened to us.
I don't even believe it myself.
We were in Queens, and we decided to stop by my apartment.
Wait, her apartment?
I thought Aunt Lily lived with you and Uncle Marshall.
I could see how you would think that, but I have to have my own place.
It's an independence thing.
When was the last time you were there?
Three months ago.
What?
It's like fat pants.
You hope you never have to use them, but you're glad to know they're there.
What the hell?
What?
This is my apartment.
Where?
Right here.
What the hell?
Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.
No, no, this was my apartment.
My dresser was right...
That's my dresser!
And this is my closet.
And I spilled nail polish there. There's the stain.
Hi. How many?
Lily.
Yes. You know me?
Yeah. From your homecoming picture.
You're much prettier in person.
Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake.
Where's my stuff?!
Oh, it's all in the back.
We could wrap it up for you.
You want it to go?
This is my apartment.
Not anymore.
No way. You're making this up.
Yeah, the building would have had to give you some kind of notice.
They sent you a notice about this.
When?
Three months ago.
And here's your mail.
Minus magazines.
Well, still legally, they can't just toss you out on the street.
You have a lease.
Okay, so I didn't have a written lease as such,
but go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.
She may be 98 years old, but she's still...
She's dead, isn't she?
Never even saw the bus.
My apartment is a Chinese restaurant.
What am I going to do?
Come live with us.
Really?
Of course.
You sure about this, Ted?
Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway.
It's not like it'll change anything.
No, it's like it will change everything.
Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.
What are you talking about?
And why is that girl checking you out?
Because I look good.
Now, focus.
You and Marshall are roommates.
You have an amazing apartment.
Marshall and Lily just got engaged.
Yeah, so?
So, you're not still going to be his roommate when he gets married, are you?
Someone's going to move out. So who's it going to be?
Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment.
You've talked about who gets the apartment, right?
Yeah, we've talked about it.
So when Lily and I get married, who's going to get the apartment?
Oh, that's a tough one.
You know who I think could handle a problem like that?
Who?
Future Ted and Future Marshall.
Totally.
Let's let those guys handle it.
Damn it, Past Ted.
You blew it, dude.
Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic.
They're edging you out.
That's crazy. They're not edging me out.
Marshall's my best friend.
One of my best friends.
He wouldn't do that to me.
Just keep your eyes open, that's all I'm saying, Teddy.
Little things are going to be changing around that apartment.
Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid.
Okay, seriously, what is this girl's deal?
I'm sort of on a date with her.
What?
Yeah, yeah.
I found her online.
I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups.
I'm looking for a soul mate.
Someone who I can love and cuddle.
Or so it says in my profile.
But this girl...
she wants the same stuff. And it's... it's bumming me out.
All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.
All right.
You're going to the hospital?
No. See, he's going to go back over there, and I'm going to call him.
He's going to pretend it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.
Oh, Lord, fake emergency?
That is the lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book.
I expect more from you, Barney.
Well, stay tuned. I'm working on some stuff.
But in the meantime, wish me luck.
So, are you going to talk to Marshall?
He's going to want the apartment, I'm going to want the apartment.
It's going to lead to an argument. So, no.
Hmm, that's real healthy.
So when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it?
I should really make this call.
Ooh, can I do it?
Excuse me.
Hello.
Hi, there... sexy.
Hello, Aunt Cathy. What's up?
Oh, nothing.
Just sitting here thinking about you, hot stuff.
An accident?
Well, is Uncle Rudy going to be okay?
Aunt Cathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.
Oh, God!
Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?
Oh, come on, Daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.
Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine.
I'll be right there.
You know... I...
See you guys later.
Put it on my check.
Ah, this will be nice.
The three of us living together.
I think it's a good setup.
Man, this coffee's great.
It's really great.
Too great.
What happened to Shocky?
What's this?
My coffeemaker from my apartment.
It makes great coffee, right?
Yeah, definitely.
I mean, so does Shocky.
Really?
I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kind of rusty.
Yeah, no, it did.
I mean, I kind of liked the rusty taste.
I'm used to it, I don't know.
Also, Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock people.
No, it's just... you got to admit that shock, that... wakes you up in the morning.
You know what else wakes you up in the morning?
Coffee.
That's great. You're right.
Roomies.
I love it.
They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out.
I didn't believe it, but you're right.
Told you. That Lily-- she's a shrewd one.
Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker-- how dare she.
It's not just the coffeemaker.
Done.
The painting's done.
- That is great.
- Nice.
Where do you want to hang it?
I don't know.
Uh... Over the piano?
Yeah, that would be a good place for it.
Too bad the swords are there.
We kind of love those swords.
Well, those swords have been up there a long time.
I know, right? I'd really miss them, too.
So, maybe Marshall's room.
Okay.
He was going to take the swords down.
Can you believe that?
Ted, why don't you just talk to him. He's your best friend.
One of your best friends.
The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.
Healthy communication?
That's the worst idea ever.
Look, you held off their first advance. That's good.
Now it's time to counterstrike.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
You got to mark your territory.
And I don't mean missing the toilet.
You've got to do something big.
What, like buy a new sofa?
Bigger.
Katie's here.
Okay, real quick... last night, epiphany--
I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready?
A lemon law.
A lemon law like for cars?
Exactly.
From the moment the date begins, you have five minutes
to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening.
And if you don't, it's no hard feelings. Just,
"Good night. Thanks for playing. See you never."
Huh? Huh? The lemon law-- it's going to be a thing.
Possibly, starting right now.
Hi, Katie. Barney.
Hi. It's good to finally meet you.
Hmm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.
Tell your friends.
It's going to be a thing.
Man, Ted's been acting weird.
He started labeling all his food.
He even carved "Ted" into that block of cheese.
Yeah.
Well, now it's Ed's.
I think he's not cool with me moving in.
No, that's not it.
You've basically lived here all along.
Ted loves you.
So what's he PMSing about?
I don't know.
But when he's ready to talk to me about it, he'll come and talk to me about it.
Are you kidding?
You guys never talk about anything.
He'll just let it fester under the surface
until he doesn't something big and passive-aggressive.
You clearly don't know Ted.
Delivery for Ted Mosby.
Your English phone booth arrived.
Oh, awesome! It's great, right?
Yeah, I guess.
I'm just not sure if Lily's going to like it.
Well, I like it, so I'm just going to keep it right here, if that's cool.
Of course.
I mean, we all live here, so...
we should all be able to have things the way we want them.
Exactly.
Great.
Terrific.
You like the phone booth, it stays.
I like this painting...
so I'm just going to hang it...
right here on the wall.
Oh. So it's like that, is it?
Oh, hello, governor. Oh, it's like that, isn't it? Cheerio.
Yeah, it's like that.
- I want this apartment.
- Well, I want it, too.
You're a jerk.
No, I'm a visionary.
Lemon law! It's going to be a thing.
For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything
that's wrong with our no-attention-span society.
No. Wrong. Lemon law's awesome.
It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone.
You keep giving up on people so quickly. You could miss out on something great.
Okay, you're on a blind date.
Sitting across from the table is... that guy.
You really think it'll take more than five minutes
to realize there will be no date number two?
Yes, I do.
For all I know, that guy's my soul mate.
Oh... bad move, Scherbotsky.
Hi.
Have you met Robin?
- Hi.
- Hi.
All right, Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment.
May lead to an argument,
but we're settling this.
Or we could flip a coin.
Yeah, let's flip a coin.
- Flip it.
- Okay.
I'm flipping it. Here I go.
- Flip it.
- Okay, here I go.
- Flip it.
- I'm flipping.
But before I do, I just want to say something.
You didn't even want to move in here in the first place.
You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.
That was five years ago.
Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter.
Oh, snap. What else you got?
Okay, I'm flipping. Heads or tails?
- You don't need two rooms.
- Heads or tails, Marshall.
- Like you need two rooms.
- We might be starting a family soon.
Oh, no, you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're still in law school.
It's going to be at least three years.
It could be sooner. We're not that careful with our birth control.
Two-zip.
Oh, come on! You know damn well, I move out, that room's going unused.
Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate. Who's it going to be, Barney?
You know he cooks naked.
Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down.
We were bros!
These swords represent our bro-hood.
And you took them down to make room for your fiancee's stupid painting?
My fiancee? Suddenly she's "my fiancee"?
Lily's a part of who I am.
And if you're such a bro, she's a part of who you are, too.
She's a bro by extension.
I deserve this apartment, Marshall.
No more than I do.
Great.
So let's flip for it.
Flip it.
Si this is how we're deciding who gets the apartment?
I guess so.
How are we doing this exactly?
Is this, like, to the death?
We should probably figure that out.
Ooh! Ow. Ow.
He's okay, he's okay, he's okay.
Can I observe something?
That this is kind of awesome?
Totally.
- I can't believe we didn't do this before.
- I know.
Thank you.
I can't believe this.
I'm sitting here with a beautiful woman I just met eating at my favorite restaurant.
Sweet.
It's a nice place.
It's good to know the future has ribs.
In the future, food will most likely be served in gel cap form.
Plus, cows will probably have died out by then.
Or be our leaders.
Hello.
H-H-H-H-Hey. Time's running out, Scherbotsky.
Last chance for the lemon law.
Leave me alone.
4:56, 4:57, 4:58...
We're only just getting to know each other.
Say I'm right and this could all be over.
This could be your call from the hospital.
Sorry.
Let me guess-- there's been a crazy accident and you have to go.
No, I would never do that.
I don't want to go anywhere.
I'm all yours.
Look, if you're a hooker, I don't have a lot of money...
- Oh, that was awesome.
- I know.
Do it again.
Okay. But this time jump up and I'll swipe your legs.
Look... here's why I should get the place.
You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right?
I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates.
And on top of that, I have to be homeless. Does that seem fair?
Oh, boo-freakin'-hoo.
What?!
Woe is me. "I'm not married yet. my ovaries are shrinking." Ted!
If you wanted to be married by now, you would be, but you're not.
And you know why?
Because you're irrationally picky.
You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.
- "Anhedonic"?
- Anhedonic.
It means you can't enjoy anything.
The hell I can't.
- I'm enjoying this.
- I know. This rules!
Hey. I'm sorry I took those swords down.
Dude, that's okay. It lead to this totally rad swordfight, didn't it?
Yeah, it did.
You remeer when we first got these swords?
It was the day we moved in.
Congratulations, Marshall, we live in an apartment with swords on the wall.
List of lifelong dreams, you're now half as long.
Crap, I'm missing one of the screws for this table.
Just use this wood glue. It'll hold.
Yeah.
Oh god, I'll be right there.
Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go.
My friend's been stabbed with a sword.
Hab Slosi' Quch!
It's a Klingon insult. You have no honor.
You know, if you felt this way, you could've just been upfront.
No, I swear, that was a real call. I just...
Oh, forget it.
I stabbed Lily.
I stabbed my fiancee.
Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancee?
I'm kidding.
Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment.
But you fought so bravely for it.
I wasn't fighting for the apartment, I was fighting for...
I don't know... for everything to stay the way it is.
But I'm not going to get that, so...
seriously, take the place, it's yours.
Is she okay?
They're just patching her up. She's going to be fine.
So get this: I was on a date with this girl, Jackie...
What? You said she's fine.
So anyway, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie...
Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression.
I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie... oh.
Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm going to have to lemon law you.
It's out there. It's a thing.
The lemon law is a thing!
Damn, I should've called it Barney's law.
- But you totally...
- Just let him have this one.
All set.
She said she'd like to see the knights of the poorly constructed roundtable?
That's us.
A swordfight?
- Sorry, Lily.
- Sorry, Lily.
On Monday, I'm going to have to tell my kindergarten class,
who I teach not to run with scissors,
that my fiance ran me through with a frickin' broadsword.
Well just to be fair,
it didn't go all the way through.
I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?
You're right.
I'm sorry.
We were fighting to see who gets the apartment, and I won.
Uh, you didn't win.
I... gave it to you.
Wait, wait, wait.
I don't want that apartment.
It's a boy apartment. It's...
full of swords and video games and...
kind of smells like dude.
I mean, it's fine for now,
but when we get married,
I want to start a new life with you...
in a new place.
Gonna miss the old place.
I will, too.
But we're not going to get married for, like, a year.
Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem.
Let that guy deal with it.
Totally.
Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking, but I'm starving.
Let's go get some dinner.
I know just the place.
Chinese restaurant. I still don't believe it.
I told you.
Hey, a toast.
Life is full of changes.
One day you have an apartment, the next day it's a house of dumplings.
But the important stuff doesn't change.
To the important stuff.
Here, here.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
And to the lemon law.
Self click.
And by the way, I bought these glasses.
Bought them at Ikea.
These are my glasses!
I love this song. I haven't heard this in forever.
And I'm pretty sure this is a mix tape you made me in sophomore year.
Yeah, right.
Lily, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings.
I love you, Lily.
Happy Valentine's Day 1997.

Les enfants,
voici une histoire qui se déroule
le jour de Thanksgiving.
<i>Thanksgiving à New York est
un moment merveilleux,</i>
<i>un moment pour donner de soi
et pour penser aux autres,</i>
<i>un moment où la ville sans pitié
devient un peu moins rude.</i>
Bon, je viens de vomir.
L'an 2005
- Avez-vous bu beaucoup, hier ?
- La quantité n'importe pas.
Le Thanks-tini,
un délicieux cocktail fantaisiste
de mon invention.
Jus de canneberge, vodka de patate,
et un cube de bouillon.
Tout le bon goût d'une assiette de dinde.
On dirait Thanksgiving
dans ma bouche.
Tu veux un bon cocktail pour les fêtes ?
Essaie son Kwanzaa-politain.
La navette est arrivée !
Il n'est pas retourné
au Minnesota depuis Noël.
- Il est un peu emballé.
- La navette nous attend.
As-tu tout le nécessaire ?
Brosse à dents, pyjama, sous-vêtements ?
Mes sous-vêtements.
Alors, Lil, la famille de Marshall.
Toute un week end
avec les beaux-parents. Emballée ?
- Oui, non, on va bien s'amuser.
- Lily, tu as dit: "Oui, non."
J'ai dit ça ?
Non, j'aime la famille de Marshall.
- Mais oui, non, ça va être super.
- Tu l'as encore dit.
Oui, non, la ferme.
Et toi, tu ne vas pas chez tes parents ?
- Non, je travaille vendredi. Et toi ?
- Je suis canadienne.
- On fête Thanksgiving en octobre.
- Oui, j'avais oublié.
Vous êtes bizarres, les Canadiens.
Vous dites "dewors" pour "dehors".
Vous êtes les meneurs
en violence par arme à feu,
votre système de santé est pourri
et votre population n'arrive pas
à s'entendre sur les grands enjeux.
Vous avez "la police montée".
Alors, tu vas passer du temps
avec Barney ?
Non. Il fête Thanksgiving à sa façon.
Thanksgiving dans un bar
de danseuses. Ça vous dit ?
Le Léopard lubrique offre un excellent
buffet de Thanksgiving.
Et pour l'occasion,
Heather se déguise en pèlerine
et Misty se déguise en Amérindienne,
et elles partagent un repas.
- Ah ! Barney !
- Désolé. Elle se déguise en autochtone.
Je pense aider à servir le repas
dans un refuge pour sans-abris.
- Quelle bonne idée.
- Oui.
Je veux passer ma journée à faire ma part,
faire une bonne action.
- Pour annuler l'effet Barney.
- Exactement.
- Où sont mes caleçons ?
- As-tu regardé dans ta valise ?
Non.
On y va.
On y va.
<i>Et ils sont partis.</i>
<i>À destination de Saint-Cloud
au Minnesota, la ville natale de Marshall.</i>
<i>Et comme Lily entrait
dans la maison d'enfance de son fiancé,</i>
<i>elle reçut un grand accueil.</i>
Salut ! On est arrivés !
<i>Un très grand accueil.</i>
<i>À près de deux mètres, Marshall était
le petit chétif du clan Eriksen.</i>
- C'est bon de te voir.
- Toi aussi.
J'avais oublié combien vous êtes grands.
- Où est ma future Belle-fille ?
- Je suis ici !
Par ici !
Tu t'es trouvé
une chouette petite femme, fils.
- Oui.
- C'est génial.
Bon, pas de temps à perdre.
Mettez vos patins et vos protecteurs.
La partie va commencer.
Super.
- Vous allez jouer au hockey ?
- La passe !
- Avec un ballon de basket ?
- C'est un mélange des deux.
- On appelle ça: "basket sur glace".
- On l'a inventé.
Le sport le plus dangereux
et spectaculaire au monde.
Basket sur glace ?
Pourquoi pas hockey-ball ?
"Hockey-ball ?"
- Ça sonne bizarre.
- Oui.
- Basket sur glace, et je suis le meilleur.
- Tu veux rire.
Vous dites ça parce que
vous ne m'avez pas encore vue jouer.
Je ne sais pas, chérie.
Ce n'est pas pour les filles.
C'est drôle, pourtant,
ton frère lance comme une fille.
Marcus.
- Ça va être vraiment bien.
- Je suis content qu'on fasse ça.
Regarde tous ces gens.
Ils laissent la fête de côté
pour aider leur prochain.
Ils sont la crème des New-Yorkais.
Excusez-moi, les gars. Je dois passer.
- Barney ?
- Hé ! Salut, vous deux.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
- Juste le travail du Seigneur.
- Mais tu es Satan.
- Écoutez, les gars.
Je n'en parle pas trop,
mais je fais du bénévolat ici.
C'est important d'aider les moins fortunés.
Je suis le pendant masculin séduisant
d'Angelina Jolie.
C'est une blague, pas vrai ?
Tu n'es pas vraiment bénévole ?
Barney, on a besoin de toi.
On n'arrive pas à farcir les dindes.
- Tu leur montres comment faire ?
- J'arrive.
- C'est vrai ? Barney est bénévole ?
- Chaque dimanche, à l'année longue.
Notre meilleur bénévole.
Parce que j'ai été formé
par le meilleur, Kendall.
Bon, nous sommes heureux
d'être ici, Kendall.
Que doit-on faire ?
- Partez, on a assez de monde.
- Quoi ?
On est bénévoles, on travaille pour rien.
Ça arrive, trop de bénévoles ?
Pendant la plus grande journée
de bénévolat de l'année, oui.
- On veut juste donner un coup de main.
- Ils sont bons, Kendall.
D'accord, mais je ne promets rien.
Attendez ici
et on verra si on a besoin de vous.
Je retourne de l'autre côté.
Il y a beaucoup de nourriture à servir.
Et beaucoup de sourires à offrir.
J'ai presque oublié.
Je sais qu'il est tôt,
mais tu es une future madame Eriksen.
Oh ! Merci.
Ça va bien aller avec mon...
Je l'adore.
D'accord, Lily, tu t'occupes de la salade.
Je sais faire une excellente salade
de laitue frisée et d'endives
avec une vinaigrette lime et coriandre.
Mais c'est pour une fête américaine.
Lily, puisque tu seras bientôt
une madame Eriksen,
je vais te donner ma recette secrète:
La salade sept étages de la famille Eriksen.
Une salade sept étages ?
Six tasses de mayonnaise ?
C'est sûrement une erreur.
Oh ! Non, mon coeur. C'est seize tasses.
La mayonnaise est dans cette armoire.
Seigneur, c'est toute une partie
de basket sur glace.
Papa a lancé une boule de neige
au visage de Marcus. Interdit,
vu qu'on n'a qu'une boule par ronde,
alors je l'ai frappé au tibia avec mon patin
et j'ai marqué un point.
Ça allait bien pour toi jusqu'à ce que
je te frappe avec mon maillet.
Salut, beauté.
Tu t'amuses ?
Oui, mais tu me manques.
Peux-tu rester à l'intérieur un moment ?
Oui, oui, pas de problème.
C'est la mi-temps.
La mi-temps est terminée.
Tout le monde dehors.
Et j'espère que tu aimes manger du patin,
espèce de malade.
- Vas-y.
- Merci, chérie.
N'est-ce pas génial ?
Comprends-tu pourquoi tous mes amis
du secondaire sont restés ici ?
Hé ! Marvin !
C'est toi, l'espèce de malade !
C'est incroyable, de l'autre côté.
J'ai tellement fait de bonnes actions
que mon âme est en érection.
Voir les visages
des moins fortunés s'illuminer
devant un repas chaud et nutritif,
c'est la sensation la plus enivrante.
Tu as dit que la meilleure sensation
était de te faire sucer les orteils.
Ensuite, tu as dit "tope là"
en montrant le pied.
Dis, Barn, tu nous laisses te remplacer
pour servir la farce un moment ?
Servir la farce à votre première journée ?
Allô, la N.F.L. ? Je peux être quart-arrière,
ce dimanche ? Voyons donc.
Bon, j'ai fini l'étage
des oursons en gélatine.
C'est quoi, après ?
Des chips, évidemment.
Alors, Lily, quand vas-tu commencer
à penser à faire un bébé ?
Un bébé ?
Vous savez, je n'y ai pas trop songé.
Pas du tout.
<i>À vrai dire, tante Lily mentait.
Elle ne pensait qu'à ça.</i>
<i>Rappelez-vous quand elle a dit...</i>
Bon, je viens de vomir.
<i>À ce moment,
elle avait cinq jours de retard.</i>
<i>On était au sixième jour.</i>
Je veux dire, je suis trop jeune
pour avoir un bébé, non ?
Tu veux rire ?
J'étais plus jeune quand Marcus est né.
Un beau garçon de sept kilos.
À peine plus gros que cette dinde.
Oh ! Seigneur.
<i>Si Lily était déjà incertaine à l'idée
d'entrer dans la famille Eriksen,</i>
<i>imaginez l'idée</i>
<i>de peut-être avoir un Eriksen de sept kilos
en train de grandir dans son ventre.</i>
Ça fait un gros bébé, Judy.
- On pensait que j'aurais des jumeaux.
- Des jumeaux.
Des jumeaux.
C'est débile. Depuis quand c'est si difficile
de faire du bénévolat ?
J'en fais souvent.
J'ai dit que je te trouverais une copine.
Quel humour.
Et ça avance, ce petit projet ?
J'y travaille.
Je vais te présenter à la fille que tu fixes.
De quoi tu parles ? Je ne fixe aucune fille.
Connaissez-vous Ted ?
Salut, je m'appelle Ted, et voici...
Elle est partie.
- Je m'appelle Amanda.
- Salut.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici, Ted ?
- Eh bien, je... Rien. Je ne fais rien.
Si tu veux t'occuper,
toi et ta copine pouvez aider
à trier ces dons.
Je ne suis pas sa copine.
Je l'ai déjà été, mais je n'étais pas
suffisamment femme pour Ted,
des points de vue émotionnel et sexuel.
Oh ! Mon Dieu.
Alors, Amanda, que veux-tu qu'on fasse ?
D'accord, c'est important.
Triez toutes ces boîtes
de dons de nourriture
et mettez les bonnes choses
dans cette boîte.
C'est comme si c'était fait.
C'est parti.
Barney ne récoltera pas toute la gloire.
BÉNÉVOLE DE L'ANNÉE
- Commençons par celle-ci.
- Oui.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Regardez qui est venu dire bonne nuit.
C'est le petit Martin. Il a trois mois.
- Mois ? Trois mois ?
- Il boit beaucoup de lait.
Ah ! Oui.
J'approuve.
Et elle est de nouveau enceinte.
C'est parce que les petits soldats
des mâles Eriksen savent nager.
Ils ont deux queues et une perceuse
à la place de la tête.
- Papa, c'est gênant.
- Ne t'en fais pas, fils. Elle peut en prendre.
- Elle va devenir une Eriksen.
- Eh bien, pas littéralement.
Parce que, vous savez,
Je garde mon nom.
Et le tablier ?
On n'en a pas encore vraiment décidé,
alors on va...
Non, j'ai décidé de garder mon nom.
Mais Eriksen est un nom de famille génial.
Les gens connaissent les Eriksen.
Oui, à Saint-Cloud,
mais on ne va pas élever nos enfants
à Saint-Cloud.
Pas vrai, chéri ?
Pourquoi pas ?
J'ai adoré mon enfance à Saint-Cloud.
Saint-Cloud est un super endroit
pour élever des enfants.
New York l'est aussi.
Quoi ? C'est vrai.
On y a grandi et c'était bien.
Et on a arrêté de grandir
quand on a atteint une taille normale.
- Amanda, à quoi sert cette boîte ?
- C'est pour moi.
- Tu peux la mettre dans mon auto.
- Dans ton auto. Et tu vas l'emmener...
Chez moi. On reçoit tant de nourriture,
personne ne peut tout manger.
Oh ! De l'huile de truffe. Génial.
Mais les gens ont donné tout ça
pour les moins fortunés qui ont faim.
Je sais. Et je suis affamée.
- Mais, Marshall, tu adores New York.
- En effet.
Mais tu dis qu'avec des enfants,
- tu voudrais quitter Manhattan.
- Oui, pour déménager à Brooklyn.
Pourquoi doit-on en parler maintenant ?
Ça n'arrivera pas avant longtemps.
<i>Mais Lily savait que "avant longtemps"
pourrait être dans peu de temps.</i>
- Je dois aller à la toilette.
- Lily, c'est de l'autre côté.
<i>Alors elle se mit en chemin.</i>
Lily ? Lily !
Attendez. Non seulement vous n'avez aidé
personne aujourd'hui,
mais vous aidez quelqu'un
à voler aux sans-abris ?
Cette fête est consacrée à rendre grâce,
pas à prendre, Ted.
Maudit.
Barney, dois-je signer ta feuille de temps ?
- Oui, c'est vrai. Merci.
- Barney.
- Oui, quoi ?
- Tu as une feuille de temps ?
- Personne d'autre n'en a une.
- Et alors ?
Bon, fais voir. Donne.
Ce sont mes affaires personnelles.
"Service communautaire ordonné
par la Cour ?"
Mon Dieu ! Tu es en probation ?
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?
Ce sont mes affaires personnelles.
J'ai été puni injustement parce que c'était
le mur de l'église fréquentée par le juge.
Tu as fait pipi sur une église ?
J'ai fait pipi dans une ruelle
où il y avait une église,
que je n'ai pas vue parce que j'étais saoul.
- C'est confirmé: Tu es méchant.
- L'ordre des choses est rétabli.
Bon, d'accord.
Un juge me force à le faire,
mais l'important est que je le fais.
Et je le fais mieux que quiconque,
en passant.
À quand remonte
votre dernière bonne action ?
Kendall. Kendall.
Amanda vole des champignons de Paris
aux sans-abris.
Amanda. J'ai dit que je voulais
les champignons de Paris.
- Ce sont pour les gens qui ont faim.
- Je sais. Je suis affamé.
Ce sont de bons champignons !
Des champignons de Paris
pour tout le monde !
Prenez-les et sauvez-vous !
Ils coûtent très cher !
- Joyeux Thanksgiving.
- Joyeux Thanksgiving ?
Comme dans:
"Cette fille achète un test de grossesse,
"je me demande à quoi elle pense."
Puisque ça vous intéresse, une famille
de géants mangeurs de mayonnaise
essaie de m'attirer
dans son cauchemar banlieusard
et il y a de bonnes chances
que je porte un Eriksen
de la taille d'une dinde de sept kilos
dans mon utérus !
Vous connaissez les Eriksen ?
Vous êtes la fiancée de Marshall.
- Génial.
- Je suis heureux de vous rencontrer.
Vous êtes plus grande
qu'on vous a décrite.
Excusez-moi de m'être emportée.
- Je peux utiliser votre toilette ?
- On n'en a pas.
- Que faites-vous quand vous devez...
- Je me retiens.
- On ne peut pas congédier un bénévole.
- Apparemment, si.
Et ses deux amis
qui ne lançaient pas de champignons.
Je n'en reviens pas.
Je vous avais recommandés à Kendall.
Il me reste 40 heures
de services communautaires.
Et je vais devoir les passer à ramasser
des déchets sur un terre-plein.
J'étais bénévole de l'année !
Je suis désolé, d'accord ?
Si je peux faire quoi que ce soit
pour me racheter,
- je vais le faire.
- Ted, je suis content que tu demandes.
Buffet de Thanksgiving.
- C'est étonnamment bon.
- Je te l'avais bien dit.
Uriner en public.
Qui se fait arrêter pour ça ?
- Lily s'est fait arrêter.
- Seigneur. Qu'a-t-elle fait ?
Elle a uriné en public.
- Merci, Pete.
- Pas de quoi, Marsh.
- Ça va ?
- Non.
Je me suis ridiculisée devant ta famille,
et maintenant je fête Thanksgiving
dans l'endroit le plus déprimant au monde.
Je suis heureux que tu sois saine et sauve.
Une question, comme ça:
Pourquoi as-tu conduit 5 km
sur la route 23
et fait pipi derrière un dépanneur ?
Je vais te le dire, mais d'abord,
dis-moi que nous ne déménagerons
pas à Saint-Cloud, au Minnesota. Jure-le.
Je ne parle pas de venir vivre ici demain,
- mais...
- Promets-le-moi !
Pourquoi ?
Parce que je ne suis pas à ma place.
Je ne mesure pas 2,5 m
et je crois qu'une salade ne devrait pas
contenir de chips aux oignons !
Je suis pour les chips aux oignons.
Et la mayonnaise, les oursons en gélatine
et le basket sur glace. J'aime Saint-Cloud.
Et une partie de moi aimerait revenir
vivre ici un jour.
Mais pourquoi faut-il en discuter dans
une cellule de prison à Thanksgiving ?
Effets personnels:
Portefeuille, téléphone cellulaire,
et un test de grossesse.
Pete m'a arrêtée
avant que je voie le résultat.
- Holà.
- En effet.
Nos enfants ne peuvent pas jouer
au basket sur glace.
C'est vraiment dangereux.
Oui, et quelles en sont les règles, déjà ?
Il n'y en a pas.
On se tape juste dessus.
Écoute, je ne veux pas être
exactement comme ma famille.
Et ne le prends pas mal,
mais je ne veux pas être
comme la tienne non plus.
On aura notre propre famille.
Et nous aurons notre propre façon
de faire peur aux amis de nos enfants.
Bon, je pleure, maintenant.
Écoute, on va peut-être avoir
de grandes décisions à prendre
dans une dizaines de secondes,
mais peu importe
où on élèvera nos enfants,
ce qui compte, c'est que tu sois leur papa.
J'espère vraiment que c'est toi le père.
Une petite blague
pour détendre l'atmosphère.
Qu'est-ce que ça dit ?
- J'ai peur de regarder.
- C'est négatif !
Dieu merci !
Et, hé ! Vous !
Ted, tu m'écoutes ?
Tu es un bon gars.
Tu sais pourquoi
je dois travailler demain ?
On aménage une suite exécutive
pour une entreprise de tabac.
Dans la lutte contre le cancer,
je suis du côté du cancer.
Ted, je t'ai trouvé le moyen
de faire une bonne action.
Voici Walter. Il est sans-abri.
- Et Walter voudrait une danse-contact.
- Tu blagues ?
Je ne blague jamais sur l'art sublime
du divertissement burlesque.
Non, Barney, c'est fou.
Monsieur, aimeriez-vous que je vous offre
un coupon pour le buffet ?
Non, je suis plein.
Une danse-contact fera l'affaire.
Walter a mangé à trois soupes populaires.
Tu sais ce qui lui manque ?
De connaître le paradis avec Samantha.
Voilà enfin ta chance
d'aider quelqu'un dans le besoin.
Paye une danse-contact à cet homme.
Tu voulais voir une lueur de joie
dans les yeux de quelqu'un.
Vous savez,
je crois que je ne regarderai pas.
Voilà pour vous, Walter.
Joyeux Thanksgiving.
Merci beaucoup. Non, vraiment. Merci.
Joyeux Thanksgiving, vous deux.
Thanksgiving en novembre. Bizarre.
<i>C'était notre fête de Thanksgiving
en 2005.</i>
<i>À vrai dire, ça n'était pas génial.
Mais la vie a de bons côtés.</i>
<i>C'est dans les moments difficiles
qu'on est heureux d'être bien entouré.</i>
J'ai vu ce que tu as fait pour ce gars.
C'était vraiment gentil.
- Veux-tu une danse ?
- Non, merci.
- Veux-tu des patates douces ?
- Non, merci.
- Je m'appelle Amber.
- Ted.
À vrai dire, je m'appelle Tracey.
Je m'appelle toujours Ted.
<i>Et ceci est la vraie histoire
de comment j'ai connu votre mère.</i>
- Quoi ?
- Je plaisante.
Kids, this is a Thanksgiving story.
Thanksgiving in New York is a wonderful time.
It's a time for giving of yourself,
for thinking of your fellow man.
A time when the unforgiving city becomes a little kinder.
Well, I just ralphed.
How much did you guys drink last night?
Not how much...
what?
The Thankstini.
A fun and delicious new novelty drink I invented.
Cranberry juice, potato vodka, and a bouillon cube.
Tastes just like a turkey dinner.
Mmm, it's like Thanksgiving in my mouth!
You want a good holiday drink,
try his Kwanzaapolitan.
The shuttle's here!
He hasn't been back home
to Minnesota since Christmas.
He's a little excited.
Lily, we're holding up the shuttle. Do you have everything you need--
toothbrush, pajamas, underpants?
Underpants!
So, Lil...
Marshall's family.
A whole weekend with the future in-laws. You excited?
Yeah, no, it'll be fun.
Lily, you just said, "Yeah, no."
Did I?
No. I-I love Marshall's family.
But yeah, no, it'll be great.
You just did it again.
Yeah, no, shut up.
So you're not going home for Thanksgiving?
No, I have to work on Friday. You?
I'm Canadian, remember?
We celebrate Thanksgiving in October.
Oh, right, I forgot.
You guys are weird.
You pronounce the word "out," "oat."
You guys are the world's leader in handgun violence, your healthcare system is bankrupt,
and your country is deeply divided on almost every important issue.
Your cops are called "Mounties."
So probably hanging out with Barney, then?
No. Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition.
Thanksgiving in a strip club. Who's in?
The Lusty Leopard has a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet.
Plus they do this thing:
Heather dresses up as a pilgrim,
and Misty dresses up as an Indian,
and they share a meal together.
Oh, Barney.
I'm sorry... Native American.
I think I'm going to a homeless shelter, serve food.
That's awesome!
Yeah, I though I'd just spend the day giving back, you know? Doing some good.
Canceling out Barney.
Exactly.
Where are all my underpants!
Did you check your suitcase?
Let's go!
And go they went...
all the way to St. Cloud,
Minnesota, Marshall's hometown.
And as Lily stepped into her fiancé's boyhood home,
she received a big welcome.
Hello, we're home!
Hello... hey...
A very big welcome.
You see, at six-foot-four, Marshall
was the runt of the Eriksen clan.
Wow, I forgot how tall you guys are.
Where's my almost daughter-in-law?
Here I am!
Oh, you got yourself
a great little bride here, son.
All right, now.
No fartin' around!
Put your skates and your pads on, boys!
Game on in five minutes!
Yeah, all right.
Oh, you're gonna play hockey?
With a basketball?
Well, it's sort of a combination of the two.
We call it bask-ice-ball.
We invented it.
It's the most dangerous
and awesome sport in the world.
Bask-ice-ball?
Not ice-ketball?
Ice-ketball?
That just sounds weird.
It's bask-ice-ball, okay?
And I'm the best.
You wish.
Well, maybe that's just
'cause you haven't seen me play.
Oh... I don't know, honey.
It's not really a sport for a girl.
Well, that's funny, because
your brother throws like a girl.
Marcus!
This is going to be great.
I know. I'm so psyched we did this.
Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man.
These have got to be
the best people in New York.
...to Grandmother's house...
'Scuse me, guys. Coming through.
Barney?
Well, hi guys.
What are you doing here?
Oh, just the Lord's work.
But you're Satan.
Guys, okay, look. I don't
advertise it, but I volunteer here.
I think it's important
to help the less fortunate.
I'm the Angelina Jolie
of incredibly hot guys.
This is a joke, right?
You don't actually volunteer here.
Barney, we need you out front.
There's a logjam on the stuffing line.
Can you show them how it's done?
I'm on it.
Wait, so this is real?
Barney does this?
Every Sunday, all year long.
He's our best volunteer.
That's 'cause I was trained by the best, Kendall.
Anyway, we're psyched to be here, Kendall.
What do you need us to do?
Uh, go home. We're full.
What?
We're volunteers. We're unpaid help.
Can you ever really have enough unpaid help?
On the biggest volunteer day of the year?
Yeah, you can.
Come on, we just want to help out.
Kendall, they're cool.
Fine, but I'm not promising anything.
Wait here-- we'll let you know if we need you.
Okay, well, I'd better get back out there. There's a lot of food to give out.
And a lot of smiles.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I know it's early, but...
you are a future Mrs. Eriksen.
Thank you!
Well, it'll go great with my, uh...
I just love it.
Okay, Lily, we're putting you on salad duty.
Oh, I make this great frisee and endive salad with a coriander-lime vinaigrette.
But this is an American holiday.
Lily, now that you're going to be a Mrs. Eriksen,
I'm going to let you in on a secret recipe:
the Eriksen family seven-layer salad.
Seven-layer salad?
"Six cups of mayonnaise"?
That can't be right.
Oh, no, dear. 16 cups.
Mayo's in that cabinet.
Oh, my God.
There is some serious
bask-ice-ball going on out there.
Dad totally nailed Marcus
in the face with a snowball,
which is a foul, 'cause you only get
one snowball per possession,
so I nailed him in the shin
with my skate and I totally dunked it!
Yeah, you were sittin' pretty
till I whacked you with that mallet.
Hey, gorgeous.
You having fun?
Yeah, but... but I kind of miss you.
Could you stay in here for a little bit?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem. It's halftime.
Oh, halftime's over!
Get your butts out here! Come on.
And I hope you like
the taste of skate, dorko!
Go.
Thanks, baby.
Aw, isn't this great?
Can't you see why everyone from
my high school stays in this town?
Hey, Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko.
Man, it's amazing out there.
I've done so much good today,
I've got like a soul boner.
Man, he way the faces
of the less fortunate light up
when you give them a hot, nutritious meal. Is there a better feeling on Earth?
Yesterday you said the best feeling on Earth was getting your toes sucked.
Then you requested a high-five with your foot.
Hey, Barn, what do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?
You want to scoop stuffing your first day out?
Hello? NFL?
Can I be quarterback this Sunday?
Dude.
Okay, I finished the gummi bear layer of the... salad.
What's next?
Potato chips. Of course.
So, Lily... when are you gonna start
thinking about having a baby?
Baby?
Uh, you know,
I hadn't really thought about it.
At all.
Actually, Aunt Lily was lying.
It was all she'd been thinking about.
You see, remember when she said...
Well, I just ralphed...
At that point, she was five days late.
This was day six.
Yeah, I mean, I'm way too young to have a baby, right?
Oh, are you kidding?
I was younger than you when I had Marcus.
Beautiful 15-pound boy.
Not much bigger than this turkey right here.
Oh, my.
Now, if Lily was already uneasy
about joining the Eriksen family,
imagine how she felt about possibly having a 15-pound Eriksen growing inside of her.
That's a big baby, Judy.
The doctor thought he was twins.
Twins!
Twins!
This is crazy! When did it get
so hard to do charity work?
I do charity work all the time.
Remember when I said I'd find you a girlfriend?
Delightful.
How's that little project coming along anyway?
I'm working on it.
I'm gonna introduce you
to that girl you've been staring at.
What? That's crazy,
I haven't been staring at any girl...
Have you met Ted?
Hi. I'm the afore mentioned Ted.
And this is... um, gone.
I'm Amanda.
Hi.
So, uh, what do you do here, Ted?
Well, I've been... um, nothing.
I do nothing.
Well, if you want to do something,
you and your girlfriend
can help sort through these donations.
Oh, um, I'm not his girlfriend.
I used to be, but, um, I just wasn't enough woman for Ted emotionally
or sexually.
Oh, my God.
So, Amanda...
What do you need us to do?
Okay, this is important.
Go through all these boxes of food donations,
take out the really good stuff,
and put it into this box.
Got it.
Consider it sorted.
Hey, we're in business.
Hey, Barney's not gonna get all the glory today.
Let's start with this one.
Yeah.
Amen.
Amen.
Look who came to say good night.
It's little Martin.
Three months old.
Months?
Three months.
He's been drinking his milk.
And she's already pregnant again?
Well, that's 'cause
those Eriksen boys' boys can swim.
They've got two tails
and a drill bit for a head.
Dad, you're embarrassing me!
Oh, don't worry about it, son, she's cool.
She's going to be an Eriksen.
Yeah. well, well, not literally, 'cause, you know, I'm keeping my name.
But... the apron.
Well, we haven't actually
decided anything yet, so we're...
No, I've decided
and I'm keeping my own name.
But Eriksen is a great last name.
People know the Eriksens.
Well, sure, in St. Cloud, but our kids aren't going to be growing up in St. Cloud.
Right, baby?
Well, why not St. Cloud?
I mean, I loved growing up in St. Cloud.
St. Cloud is a great place to have a childhood.
Well, so is New York.
What? It is. And we grew up just fine.
And we grew to the proper size
and then we stopped.
Hey, Amanda, what's this box for?
Oh, that's for me.
You can put it in my car.
In your car, um,
and then you'll take it...?
Home. Yeah, we get so much extra food,
no one can eat it all.
Ooh, truffle oil. Score!
People donated this food thinking
it was going to feed the hungry.
I know.
And I'm starving.
But, Marshall, you love New York.
Yes, I do,
but you always said that when we have kids, you wanted to move out of Manhattan.
Yeah, to Brooklyn.
Why are we even talking about this? This is like way down the road.
But Lily knew "way down the road" might not be so far down the road.
I need to go to the restroom.
Lily, the restroom's the other way.
So she literally headed down the road.
Lily?!
Lily!
So wait, not only have you not done
any good for anyone today,
you're actually helping
someone steal from the homeless?
You know, Ted, it's called
Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking Damn.
Barney, you needed me
to sign your time sheet, right?
Oh, yeah, right. Thanks.
Barney.
Yeah, what's up?
You have a time sheet?
No one else has a time sheet.
Yeah. So?
All right, let me see that.
That's my private, personal business!
Court-mandated community service?
Oh my God, you're on probation?
What did you do?
That's my private, personal business.
I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church.
You peed on a church?
I peed in an alley,
which happened to have a church,
which I did not see because I was drunk.
Oh, you are evil.
Ah, all's right with the world again.
Okay, fine, so a judge is making me do this.
But I'm still doing it.
And kicking ass at it, BTW.
When's the last time
either of you did something good, huh?
Kendall. Ah, Kendall.
Amanda is stealing portabello
mushrooms from homeless people.
Amanda.
I called dibs on the portabello mushrooms.
Those are for the hungry.
I know.
And I'm starving.
Those are good mushrooms.
Mushrooms. Mushrooms.
Portabello mushrooms for everyone.
Take them and run!
They're very expensive.
Happy Thanksgiving.
"Happy Thanksgiving." Huh.
As in "check out the chick
buying the knockup test, everybody.
Wonder what must be going through her head?
Yeah, well, since you asked, a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants
is trying to suck me
into their suburban nightmare,
and there's a solid chance
that I have an Eriksen
the size of a 15-pound turkey
growing inside of me!
Oh, you know the Eriksens?
You're Marshall's fiancée.
Fantastic.
So nice to meet you.
You are taller than described.
Look, I'm sorry I just yelled at you.
You mind if I use your bathroom?
Don't have one.
What do you do when you have to...?
I hold it.
You can't fire a volunteer.
Apparently you can.
And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.
I can't believe I told Kendall
you guys were cool.
I have 40 hours left
on my community service
and now I've gotta spend it spearing trash on a freakin' median strip.
Volunteer of the year!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?
Look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you just tell me. I'll-I'll do it.
Ted, I'm glad you asked.
# Domo arrigato, Mr. Roboto #
# Domo... domo #
# Domo arrigato, Mr. Roboto #
Surprisingly good.
Right? I told you so.
Public urination.
Who gets arrested for public urination?
Lily's been arrested.
Oh, dear. What for?
Public urination.
Thanks, Pete.
No problemo, Marsh.
You all right?
No.
I embarrassed myself in front of your family,
and now I'm celebrating Thanksgiving in probably the most depressing place ever.
# Domo arrigato, Mr. Roboto #
Well, I'm glad that you're safe.
Hey, weird question.
Why did you drive three miles down Route 23 and take a pee behind a convenience store?
Okay, I'll tell you, but before I do,
promise me that we are not gonna move to St. Cloud, Minnesota. Promise.
I'm not suggesting that
we move here tomorrow, I'm just...
Promise.
Why do you want me to promise you that?
Because. I don't fit in here.
I'm not eight feet tall, and I don't think you could call it a salad if it has Funyuns in it.
I'm Funyuns.
And mayonnaise and gummi bears
and bask-ice-ball, and I love St. Cloud.
And, yes, there is a part of me that would like to move here someday,
and why are we having this discussion in a jail cell on Thanksgiving?
Okay, personal effects.
One wallet. One cell phone.
One... pregnancy test.
Pete arrested me before I could look at it.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Lily, we can't let our kids play bask-ice-ball.
Bask-ice-ball is really dangerous.
Yeah, what are the rules to that game, anyway?
There are no rules.
We just wail on each other.
Look, I don't want to be
exactly like my family.
And don't take this the wrong way,
but I don't want to be exactly
like your family either.
We'll be our own family.
And we'll find our own way to freak out the people our kids bring home.
Great, now I'm crying.
Look.
We may have some really big decisions to make in about ten seconds.
But right now, I don't care
where our kids grow up.
As long as they have you for a father.
Gosh, I hope you're the father.
Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.
What does it say?
I'm afraid to look.
It's negative!
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God.
And, hey!
Ted. Are you listening?
You're a good guy.
Want to know why I have to work tomorrow?
My firm's designing an executive
lounge for a tobacco company.
In the fight against cancer,
I'm on the side of cancer.
Okay, Ted, I found a way
for you to help someone.
To do some good.
This is Walter.
Walter is homeless.
And Walter would like a lap dance.
Are you joking?
I never joke about the sublime
art of burlesque entertainment.
No, Barney, that's insane.
Sir, would you like me
to buy you a ticket to the buffet?
No, I'm stuffed.
Just a lap dance will be fine.
Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners.
You know where he hasn't been?
To heaven with Samantha.
Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need.
Now, buy this man a lap dance.
You said you wanted to see
the look of joy in someone's eyes.
You know, I don't think I'm going to watch.
Here you go, Walter.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Thank you so much.
No, really. Thank you.
Happy Thanksgiving, guys.
Thanksgiving in November.
Weird.
So that was Thanksgiving 2005.
To be honest, it didn't go great.
The life has plenty of good parts.
It's the rough parts that make you thankfull that you have people to share it with.
Hey, I saw what you did
for that guy. It was really sweet.
Do you want a dance?
Uh, no, thanks.
Do you want some yams?
No, thanks.
I'm Amber.
I'm Ted.
Actually... I'm Tracy.
Still Ted.
And that, kids, is the true story
of how I met your mother.
- What?!
- What?!
I'm kidding.

<i>J'ai beaucoup de souvenirs de l'époque
où je ne connaissais pas votre mère,</i>
<i>mais il y a une histoire qui m'a échappé.</i>
<i>Oncle Marshall l'appelle encore
"l'incident de l'ananas".</i>
<i>La soirée avait commencé comme
toujours, au sous-sol du bar.</i>
Compliments de la maison.
- Eh bien !
- Eh bien !
C'est ma propre concoction,
le Dragon Rouge.
- Super.
- Merci, Carl.
- C'est gentil.
- Génial.
- On fait cul sec ?
- Mais non.
- Non, non, non.
- Jamais.
Ça ressemble à du sang.
Je sais que vous avez déjà tous
rejeté cette théorie.
Mais est-il possible
que Carl soit un vampire ?
- Non.
- C'est ridicule.
Je suis sérieux. Pensez-y.
Il porte toujours du noir,
on le voit uniquement après
la tombée de la nuit.
C'est effectivement la description
d'un vampire. Ou... d'un barman.
- Je dois aller me changer.
- Un rendez-vous important ?
Mets-en. Elle sort avec un milliardaire.
Je t'ai dit de ne pas l'appeler comme ça.
Tu sors vraiment avec un milliardaire ?
Il n'a pas un milliard. Il a cent millions.
Pourquoi les gens arrondissent toujours ?
- Où t'emmène-t-il ?
- À un souper de bienfaisance.
- Oui, à 2000 $ le couvert.
- À 1500 $ ! Cesse donc d'arrondir.
- C'est contre la faim dans le tiers-monde.
- Tu lui feras des faveurs ?
Quoi ? Il l'invite à souper
pour une seule raison,
et ce n'est pas pour payer des pilules
anti-malaria à un petit Africain.
Je crois que mon âme vient de vomir.
Eh bien, je vais être en retard.
Amusez-vous.
- Salut.
- Au revoir.
- Salut.
- Au revoir.
- Ça va ?
- Oui, pourquoi ?
Je ne sais pas. Parce que la fille
de tes rêves sort avec un milliardaire ?
Premièrement, il n'a que cent millions.
Et deuxièmement,
ce n'est pas la fille de mes rêves.
On est amis, c'est tout.
On serait fous de gâcher ça par une baise.
Je veux dire, je veux fonder une famille,
et elle cherche...
Quoi ? Tu as fini ? Bien.
Regarde la table numéro quatre.
Tu vois la petite beauté au bout ?
Elle n'est pas grande, mais quelle poitrine.
J'aime ça. Ses boules font la moitié
de son corps. Allons-y.
Oui, pour dire quoi ?
Comment on va se présenter ?
En disant: "Papa est à la maison."
- Papa est à la maison ?
- Oui.
Tu veux qu'on aille là-bas, maintenant,
et qu'on dise à ces filles:
"Papa est à la maison" ?
Penses-y bien, Barney.
Je crois qu'elles vont aimer.
D'accord, que dites-vous de ceci ?
Y a-t-il un seul plat au menu
qui contient de l'ail ?
Les patates à l'ail.
Bon. Je te reviens là-dessus.
Oh ! Papa est de retour.
Si tu avais pris un moment
pour réfléchir à...
Alors, papa n'aurait pas reçu une carte
avec le numéro de téléphone d'Amy.
Ça a fonctionné ? Je déteste ce monde.
Ted, ton problème,
c'est que tu réfléchis tout le temps.
J'essaie de m'occuper de ton cas, cas, cas.
- Ca... Ca.
- C'est drôle.
Je réfléchis, et alors ?
J'ai un cerveau puissant.
- Je ne peux rien y faire.
- Au contraire.
Intéressant.
Ted, nous nous sommes rencontrés
pour une raison.
C'est comme si l'univers disait:
"Barney, ce gars-là,
"il est cool,
mais tu vas le rendre génial."
Ton cerveau te nuit, Ted.
Il crée des obstacles.
C'est arrivé avec Robin
et avec la fille aux boules.
Et ça va continuer à arriver,
à moins que tu n'arrêtes
cette usine à névroses grâce à la boisson.
Alors, quoi ? Tu veux que je fasse cul sec ?
Non. Je veux que tu en boives cinq.
- Encore plus intéressant.
- Holà.
- Je pense que tu as officiellement...
- Non, ne pense pas. Agis !
Ted, il a raison. Tu réfléchis trop.
Peut-être que tu devrais boire trop.
- Bois. Bois. Bois. Bois.
- Bois. Bois. Bois.
Lily, dis-leur donc
à quel point ils sont épais.
Les gars, vous êtes deux
crétins immatures, et toi, bois, bois.
- Bois, bois, bois, bois, bois, bois.
- Bois, bois, bois, bois, bois, bois.
- Ouais !
- Ouais !
- Bois, bois, bois...
- Bois, bois, bois...
Je vais vous dire une chose
sur mon cerveau.
...bois !
...bois !
Ouais !
L'alcool ne peut pas arrêter mon cerveau.
- Bois, bois...
- Bois, bois...
J'aime ça ! J'aime ça !
Mon cerveau, chers mortels,
n'est pas un cerveau ordinaire.
...bois, bois...
...bois, bois...
C'est un super cerveau.
...bois, bois. Bois !
...bois. Bois !
Rien ne peut arrêter mon cerveau.
Mon cerveau...
<i>Et je ne me souviens de rien d'autre,
à part quelques images floues.</i>
JE M'APPELLE TED
TÉLÉPHONE-MOI
<i>Ce dont je me souviens,
c'est de m'être réveillé le lendemain.</i>
<i>Il y avait quelques questions sans réponse.</i>
<i>Avais-je beaucoup bu ?</i>
<i>Comment m'étais-je foulé la cheville ?</i>
<i>Et qui était cette fille dans mon lit ?</i>
Voilà notre vedette.
D'accord. Que s'est-il passé
la nuit dernière ?
Tu ne t'en rappelles pas, super cerveau ?
<i>Oncle Marshall et tante Lily
m'ont donné les détails.</i>
- Vous avez aimé vos boissons ?
- J'ai bu les cinq, salope !
- J'aime Ted quand il est soûl.
- Marshall dit que tu es un vampire.
S'il vomit, l'un d'entre vous nettoiera.
Pas moi !
Pas... Ah ! Merde !
Vous avez la mémoire courte !
Je n'ai pas vomi depuis le secondaire.
100% sans vomi depuis 1993.
100% sans vomi depuis 1993. C'est drôle.
Je suis drôle !
- Qui appelles-tu ?
- Robin.
Mauvaise idée.
Non, c'est une idée géniale.
C'est ça, le but de se soûler.
On fait des choses
qu'on ne ferait jamais sobre.
Comme disent les filles
avec qui tu as couché.
Qu'en dis-tu ?
Salut, Robin. C'est Ted.
- Salut, Ted.
- Salut, Robin. C'est Ted.
Salut, Ted. Tu as l'air de t'amuser.
Robin, savais-tu que je suis
100% sans vomi depuis 1993 ?
Écoute, Ted,
je ne peux pas vraiment te parler...
1993 ? C'est impressionnant.
Robin, je ne te le dis pas assez,
mais tu es une fille géniale !
<i>Et une journaliste géniale.
Tu devrais animer 60 Minutes.</i>
Tu devrais être l'une des minutes.
C'est gentil, et un peu bizarre,
mais j'ai un rendez-vous.
Et je suis en désaccord avec Barney.
Ce n'est pas parce que le gars paie tout
que tu dois coucher avec lui.
Prends ton temps, Robin.
Prends ton temps.
- Ton temps.
- À la prochaine, Ted.
Ton temps.
Ah ! Oui.
C'est pour ça qu'on ne fait pas cul sec.
Il ne faut pas laisser ses amis
boire et téléphoner.
- Redonne-moi mon téléphone !
- Je te le rendrai à la fin des cours.
Dring ! C'est la cloche. Voilà, petit.
Appelle qui tu veux.
Merci, gentil monsieur.
Au moins une personne apprécie le fait
que j'agisse sans réfléchir.
Et maintenant, je ne crois pas
que je n'irai pas à la toilette.
Était-ce nécessaire ?
Il n'agit pas intelligemment.
En effet ! Et que va-t-il faire ensuite ?
Je l'ignore, mais je veux le savoir !
Cheap Trick. Oh ! Ted.
Rebonsoir, Ted.
<i>Salut, c'est à nouveau moi</i>
<i>Attendant de te revoir</i>
<i>S'il te plait, puis-je te voir tous les jours ?</i>
J'aime tout le monde dans ce bar !
Et on t'aime aussi, Ted le soûl !
<i>Je suis à nouveau un idiot</i>
<i>Je tombe amou...</i>
Ted ?
Ça explique pour ma cheville.
Ensuite, on t'a ramené à la maison
et tu t'es couché.
Y avait-il quelqu'un d'autre
dans la chambre ?
- Il y a une fille dans ta chambre.
- Je sais.
- Et un ananas.
- Je sais !
- Qui est-ce ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Qu'est-il arrivé à mon manteau ?
- Holà.
Cette fille est bien en vie, n'est-ce pas ?
Je devrais appeler Barney.
Il sait peut-être ce qui s'est passé.
Salut.
Que fais-tu dans notre baignoire ?
La porcelaine empêche mon costume
de se froisser.
Étais-tu là quand je suis venue à la toilette
- au milieu de la nuit ?
- Ça va, tu ne m'as pas réveillé.
J'étais totalement éveillé !
Et tu sais, pour une petite femme,
tu as un gros réservoir.
Comment es-tu entré ici ?
On a mis Ted au lit vers 1 h.
Oui, vous avez mis Ted au lit.
Vous prenez soin de moi.
Vous êtes les meilleurs.
Je vous aime tant, tous les deux.
- Bonne nuit, Ted.
- Je t'aime aussi, mon ami.
Je suis de retour, bébé !
Je suis de retour, bébé !
Hé ! Il a repris des forces !
La soirée commence maintenant.
Prépare-toi.
Carl, deux autres. D'accord, d'accord.
Et elle, qu'en dit-on ?
- Je pense qu'elle...
- Raté ! Pas le droit de réfléchir !
Quelle heure est-il ? L'heure d'agir !
- On y va.
- Amenez-en.
Salut.
Connaissez-vous Ted ? Il...
Excusez-moi.
- Tu appelles Robin.
- J'appelle Robin.
Ted, en tant que ton mentor
et guide spirituel, je t'interdis de l'appeler.
Ah, oui ? Tu vas faire quoi ?
Si tu fais cet appel,
je mettrai feu à ton manteau.
Tu n'es pas sérieux.
Salut, Robin. C'est Ted.
Ted, pour la dernière fois, arrête...
Ted ?
Tu m'as mis le feu.
Du vrai daim n'aurait pas brûlé si vite.
Tu t'es fait avoir. C'est du synthétique.
Tu m'as mis le feu !
Et qui est la fille qui est dans mon lit ?
Il y a une fille dans ton lit.
Et un ananas ! Il n'y a que moi
qui se questionne sur l'ananas ?
- Qui est-ce ?
- Je n'en ai aucune idée.
Chouette.
Tu ignores vraiment qui c'est ?
Oui. Après t'avoir arrosé,
je t'ai ramené ici.
J'espère que je n'ai pas de brûlures.
Mon nom est Ted
Si je me perds: 555-2574
L'un d'entre vous a-t-il écrit ça ?
"Mon nom est Ted. Si je me perds..."
- C'est le numéro de qui ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Mon vieux, appelle-le.
Oh ! Attends. Je vais faire du maïs soufflé.
Bon, tu peux appeler.
C'est vraiment intense. J'adore ça.
<i>- Allô.
- Salut. Qui est à l'appareil ?</i>
<i>- Tu m'as appelé. Qui es-tu ?
- C'est Ted...</i>
C'est Carl, le barman.
<i>Et Carl nous a dit ce qu'il savait.</i>
Barney, tu prends toujours soin de moi.
Tu es un gentleman bien éduqué !
Va dans mon écurie
et prends mon plus bel étalon.
Il est pour toi. Il s'appelle Windjammer.
Dors bien, l'ami.
Je suis de retour, bébé !
Et je vais vomir.
J'ai vomi ? Je dois repartir à zéro.
100% sans vomi depuis 2005,
ça sonne mal.
Désolé, Carl. Continue.
Carl ?
Savais-tu que "karaoké" veut dire
"orchestre vide" en japonais ?
N'est-ce pas une superbe expression ?
Es-tu un vampire ?
Bon, je ne te sers plus. Rentre dormir, Ted.
Oui. Le soleil va bientôt se lever.
Tu ne voudrais pas être encore ici, hein ?
Penses-tu que ça serait facile
d'entrer au zoo ?
Je dois voir
des pingouins, immédiatement.
- Donne-moi ton bras.
- D'accord.
Comme ça, si tu t'évanouis
au bord de la rue...
Ça chatouille !
...quelqu'un m'appellera
et j'irai te chercher.
Merci, Carl.
On ne peut pas être qu'amis !
On a une attirance !
- Et on le sait tous les deux.
- Pardon ?
Moi et Robin. Moi et Robin.
Je dois faire un autre appel.
Oui, ça devrait bien se passer.
Salut, c'est encore moi.
Écoute. Qui croit-on tromper ?
On ressent une attirance mutuelle.
On est jeunes. On est soûls.
Du moins, l'un de nous l'est.
Et on n'a qu'une vie à vivre.
Alors pourquoi tu ne viens pas
à mon appartement,
et on pensera à un truc stupide
à faire ensemble.
C'est vrai ? Génial.
Attends, tu es sérieuse ? Génial.
Merci, Carl.
C'est Robin.
C'est Robin qui est dans ma chambre.
Est-ce que vous avez...
Oh ! Voyons ! Tu me dois bien ça !
L'alcool t'a mené plus loin
avec Robin que ton cerveau.
Tu vois ce qui arrive
quand on ne réfléchit pas ? On fait.
Et, mieux encore,
on le fait avec Robin. Allez !
D'accord, et moi.
N'empêche, ça veut dire quoi ?
Est-ce qu'on sort ensemble ?
Je ne voulais pas
que ça se passe comme ça,
mais c'est peut-être ce qu'il fallait.
Pensez-y.
Donnez-lui à boire.
Il recommence à penser.
Attends un peu. C'est peut-être une bonne
idée de réfléchir à ceci.
Toi et Robin êtes déjà passés par là,
et ça a mal fini pour toi.
Vous savez qui a peut-être un mot à dire
sur l'avenir de Ted et Robin ?
Robin. Va la réveiller.
- Pour lui dire quoi ?
- Papa est à la maison.
Bonne chance, l'ami.
- Allô ?
- Ted, c'est Robin.
En es-tu certaine ?
Salut, Robin. Comment vas-tu ?
Je crois qu'on devrait parler...
- C'est Robin ?
- Alors, qui est-ce ?
...de tes appels d'hier.
- Je l'ignore !
- Je peux passer ?
- Demande pour l'ananas !
- Oui, viens.
- Merci.
Non ! Attends ! Ne viens pas.
Elle arrive. Merde !
Le suspense me tue.
On doit découvrir qui est cette fille.
Trudy. Je m'appelle Trudy.
<i>Et Trudy nous a dit ce qu'elle savait.</i>
Je m'étonne
que tu ne l'aies pas laissé avant.
Je sais. Je ne reverrai jamais
ces deux années de ma vie.
Une partie de moi veut s'envoyer en l'air
avec le premier venu.
Papa est à la maison.
Ou le second.
Compris. Mais je veux donner une leçon
à un ami.
Alors, donne-moi ton numéro,
et disons que tu t'appelles... Amy.
Mesdames.
J'aime tout le monde dans ce bar !
Regardez-moi cet imbécile.
Il est plutôt mignon.
<i>Je tombe amou...</i>
Que fais-tu dans
les toilettes des hommes ?
Qu'est-ce que je fais
dans les toilettes des dames ?
Ah ! Oui, je suis entré parce que
je pensais que j'allais vomir.
Tu l'as fait ?
Je n'ai pas vomi.
Et ça continue.
100% sans vomi depuis 1993.
Désolé, Trudy. Continue.
J'ai aimé ta prestation.
Quoi, le karaoké ?
J'aimerais être aussi brave.
Pouvoir me lever et me ridiculiser.
- Alors, fais-le.
- Je ne sais pas.
N'empêche, j'ai eu une dure semaine.
Je pourrais bien faire
quelque chose de stupide.
Je suis quelque chose de stupide.
Défoule-toi sur moi.
Tu es drôle.
- Me donnerais-tu ton numéro ?
- D'accord.
Je vais le faire.
Pourquoi ça s'appelle "karaoké",
en passant ?
Est-ce une femme nommée
Carrie Okie qui l'a inventé ?
C'est le genre de chose à laquelle je pense.
"Karaoké" veut dire "orchestre vide"
en japonais.
Quelle superbe expression.
Hé ! Ça marche !
Bon, tu vas devoir m'appeler, alors.
Je dois faire un autre appel.
Allô ?
Salut, c'est encore moi.
Salut.
Écoute. Qui croit-on tromper ?
On ressent une attirance mutuelle.
On est jeunes. On est soûls.
Du moins, l'un de nous l'est.
Et on n'a qu'une vie à vivre.
Alors je suis venue ici.
Et maintenant,
je me sens vraiment très gênée.
Merde, Trudy ! Et l'ananas ?
Désolé. Désolé. Désolé.
Voilà Robin. Écoute, Trudy,
cache-toi dans ma chambre.
Pourquoi ? C'est ta copine ?
Non. Ce n'est pas ma copine.
C'est compliqué.
Tu es marié. Je n'arrive pas à le croire.
Non, non. Je ne suis pas marié.
Je t'expliquerai quand tu te seras cachée.
- Allô.
- Salut.
- Salut, Robin. Bon matin.
- Salut.
Salut, Robin. Joli chandail.
Salut, Robin. Joli chandail.
Je suis désolé de t'avoir téléphoné
autant de fois. J'étais soûl.
Sans blague.
Tes appels étaient vraiment bizarres.
Écoute, Ted, on devrait en discuter.
- Allons chercher une collation.
- J'aime les collations.
Pas pour moi.
Allons, ce n'était pas si bizarre.
<i>Robin ! Viens me rejoindre !</i>
<i>Je vais faire ce bruit
jusqu'à ce que tu viennes.</i>
Et ça dure pendant trois minutes et demie.
Sans que j'arrête pour respirer ?
C'est sûrement un record.
Ted, ne fais pas ça. S'il te plaît.
On allait rester amis, et maintenant,
c'est tout confus.
Non, écoute. J'ai seulement
donné congé à mon cerveau pour la soirée.
Rien n'a changé.
On s'est remis de notre rupture.
Vraiment ? Tu t'en es remis ?
Oui. Quoi, tu ne me crois pas ?
Bon, d'accord.
Trudy ! Tu peux sortir.
Tu vas bien rire.
- Tu as couché avec quelqu'un, hier ?
- Oui, Trudy. Elle est chouette.
Trudy, sors.
Je suis sérieux. Ça va.
C'est bien son genre. Elle est très timide.
Je crois.
Trudy ?
Salut, Trudy. Je m'appelle Robin.
Heureuse de te rencontrer.
Tu as raison. Elle est timide.
Je n'invente rien.
Elle a dû sortir par l'escalier de secours.
Bon, bon. Je me fous de ce que tu penses.
Alors pourquoi voulais-tu
qu'elle se cache de moi ?
C'est très fort.
<i>On t'a déjà dit que tu devrais
animer 60 Minutes ?</i>
- Oui, tu l'as dit. Hier soir.
- Vraiment ?
Eh bien.
Recouche-toi, Ted. Tu as eu une dure nuit.
Et ne t'en fais pas.
Je me suis réveillée à côté de pire que ça.
<i>J'ai laissé un message à Trudy,
mais elle n'a jamais rappelé.</i>
<i>C'est comme ça, la vie, parfois.</i>
<i>On arrête de réfléchir pour une soirée</i>
<i>et tout ce qu'on a le lendemain,
c'est un mal de tête, une cheville foulée...</i>
<i>On n'a jamais su d'où était venu l'ananas.</i>
<i>Mais il était délicieux.</i>
Now I remember a lot of stories from back in the days before I met your mother.
But there's one story I don't remember.
Uncle Marshall still refers to it as "The Pineapple Incident."
The night started like any other.
We were downstairs at the bar.
On the house.
It's my own concoction.
I call it the Red Dragon.
- Wow! Thanks!
- That was really sweet.
- We're not really doing shotre we?
- I Hope not.
These look kind of like blood.
Okay, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before.
But is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?
No, you guys, I'm serious. Think about it.
He always wears black.
We never see him in the daylight, only after dark.
Oh, my God.
That does describe a vampire...
or, you know, a bartender.
I should go get dressed.
Where you going, buddy? Hot date?
I'll say. She's going out with a billionaire.
Lily, I told you not to call him that.
Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire?
He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred-millionaire.
Why do people always round up?
So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you?
A charity dinner.
Yeah, $2,000 a plate.
$1,500. Stop rounding up.
And it's for Third World hunger.
You gonna put out?
What?
There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner,
and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills.
I think my soul just threw up a little bit.
Well, I'm gonna be late.
You guys have fun.
- Bye.
- See ya.
- Bye.
- See ya.
You okay?
Sure. Why?
Oh, I don't know.
Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.
Okay, first of all, hundred-millionaire.
And second, she's not the girl of my dreams.
We're just friends.
Look, it would not be smart if we got together.
I mean, I'm looking to settle down, she's looking for...
Wha...? You done? Great.
Check out table number four.
See that little hottie on the end?
She's short, but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's, like, half boob.
Let's go.
Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?
I... uh...
Daddy's home.
Daddy's home? Okay, you want us to go over there right now
and say to those girls, "Daddy's home"?
Really think about that, Barney.
Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.
Okay, think about this.
Is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it?
Garlic fries.
Okay, well, I'll get back to you.
Oh, Daddy's back.
See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...
Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Date Card from Amy.
That worked?
I hate the world.
Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think.
I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.
- Doo-doo.
- Totally.
So I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.
Oh, yes, it can.
Interesting.
Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason.
It's like the universe was saying, "Hey, Barney, there's this dude-- he's pretty cool--
but it's your job to make him awesome."
Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way.
It happened with Robin, it happened with Half Boob,
and it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inibriation style.
So, what, you want me to do a shot?
Oh, no.
I want you to do five shots.
More interesting.
Barney, I think you've officially...
No, don't think. Do.
Ted, he's right: you overthink.
Maybe you should overdrink.
- Drink, drink...
- Drink, drink, drink...
Uh, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?
Guys, you are being immature and moronic, and drink, drink...
Drink, drink, drink...
Yeah!
Drink, drink, drink...
Let me tell you something about this dream, okay?
Drink!
Pure alcohol cannot stop this brain.
Drink, drink, drink...
I love it! I love it! I love it!
This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain.
Drink, drink, drink...
This is a super brain.
Drink, drink, drink...
This brain is unstoppable.
This brain...
And that's all I remember.
Except for a few hazy memories.
But really, the next thing I remember was waking up the following morning.
So there were some unanswered questions.
How much did I drink?
How did I sprain my ankle?
And who was this girl in my bed?
There's our rock star.
Okay, uh... What the hell happened last night?
You really don't remember, Superbrain?
So Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lilly filled me in.
And how did you guys like the shots?
I drank all five, bitch.
I love Drunk Ted.
Marshall thinks you're a vampire.
If he pukes, one of you guys cleans it up.
No dibs.
No d... Damn it!
How quickly you all forget.
I haven't puked since high school.
I am vomit-free since '93.
Vomit-free since '93.
That's funny. I'm funny!
Who are you calling?
Robin.
Oh, bad idea jeans.
No, no, it's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk.
You do things you'd never do if you were sober.
Says every girl you've ever slept with.
Say what?
Hello, Robin. It's Ted.
Oh, hi, Ted.
Hello, Robin. It's Ted.
Hi, Ted.
Sounds like you're having fun.
Robin, have I ever told you that I am vomit-free since '93?
Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right...
'93?
Dude, that's impressive.
Robin, I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter.
You should be on 60 Minutes.
You should be one of the minutes.
That's sweet... and odd.
But I'm kind of on a date right now.
Yeah, and I disagree with Barney.
Just 'cause this guy's spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out.
Take it slow, Robin. Take it slow.
Slow...
Bye, Ted.
Slow...
Wow, right. That's why we don't do shots.
Friends don't let friends drink and dial.
I need that phone back.
You'll get this back at the end of class.
Ding. Class dismissed. Here you go, kid. You call whoever you want.
Thank you, kind sir.
At least someone appreciates the fact that I am doing and not thinking.
And now, I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom.
Was that necessary? He is not making smart decisions.
Exactly. It's like, what's he gonna do next? I don't know, but I want to find out.
Cheap Trick?
Oh, Ted.
Hello again, Ted.
# Hey, it's me again #
# Plain to see again #
# Please, can I see you every day #
I love everyone in this bar!
We love you, Drunk Ted!
# I'm a fool again #
# I fell in lo... #
Ted?
Well, that explains the ankle.
Then we brought you home and put you to bed.
Was there anyone else in there with me?
- There's a girl in there!
- I know.
- And a pineapple.
- I know.
- Who is she?
- I don't know.
What the hell happened to my jacket?
Whoa.
That girl in there is alive, right?
I should call Barney. Maybe he knows what happened.
Hello.
Why are you sleeping in our tub?
Uh, the porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling.
Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?
Don't worry. I slept through it.
I totally didn't sleep through it.
Oh, and wow, for a little girl, you got a big tank.
How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around 1:00.
Oh, you put Ted to bed, all right.
You guys take care of me.
You guys are the best.
I love you guys so much.
Good night, Ted.
Love you, too, buddy.
I'm back, baby doll!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
He rallies!
And the night begins now!
All right. Game face on. Carl, two more.
All right, what do we think of this one?
- I think she...
- Trick question. No thinking.
You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride. Bring it!
Hi.
Have you met Ted?
Excuse me.
You're calling Robin.
I'm calling Robin.
Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.
Oh, yeah?
What you gonna do?
If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire.
You're bluffing.
Hello, Robin. It's Ted.
- Ted, for the last time, stop...
- Ow!
Ted?
You set me on fire.
Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast.
You got robbed. This is a blend.
You set me on fire.
And who's the girl in my bed?
There's a girl in your bed.
And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?
Who is she?
I have no idea.
Nice.
You really don't know who that is?
No. After I hosed you down with the beverage gun, I brought you back here.
I better not have gotten burned.
Did any of you write that?
"Hi. I'm Ted. If lost, please call..."
Whose number is that?
I don't know.
Dude, call it.
Ooh, hold on, I'm gonna make some popcorn.
Ooh. Okay, you can call now.
God, this is intense. I love it.
Hello?
Uh... hi. Who's this?
You called me. Who's this?
It's Ted.
It's Carl from the bar.
And then Carl filled us in.
Barney, you've always taken care of me.
You are a gentlemen and a scholar.
Go into my stable and take my finest stallion.
He's yours. His name is Windjammer.
Sleep it off, bro.
- I'm back, baby doll!
- Yeah.
And I... am gonna throw up.
I threw up?
Oh, my streak is over.
Vomit-free since '05 doesn't sound good.
Sorry, Carl. Go on.
Carl... did you know the word "karaoke" is Japanese for "empty orchestra"?
Isn't that hauntingly beautiful?
Are you a vampire?
All right, I'm cutting you off.
Go home and get some sleep, Ted.
Yeah, the sun's gonna come up soon.
Wouldn't want to be around for that, would we?
Hey, how easy do you think it would be to sneak into the zoo?
I have to see some penguins, like, right now.
All right, give me your arm.
Okay.
This way, if you pass out in the gutter...
It tickles.
...someone will call me, and I will come get you.
Thanks, Carl.
We can't just be friends. We're attracted to each other, and we both know it.
Excuse me?
Me and Robin, me and Robin.
I have to make one more call.
Yeah, this'll go good.
Hey, it's me again.
Look, who are we kidding?
You and I are both attracted to each other.
We're young, we're drunk-- half of us anyway-- and we only get one life.
So, why don't you come over to my apartment right now,
and we'll think of something stupid to do together?
Really?
Great.
Wait. Really?
Great.
Thanks, Carl.
It's Robin.
That's Robin in there.
Did you guys...?
Oh, come on. You've got to give me this one.
Those five shots got you further with Robin than your brain ever did.
See what happens when you don't think?
You do. More importantly, you do Robin.
Come on.
All right, right over here.
But, uh, still, what does this mean?
Are we dating now?
I-I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but...
maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...
Someone get him a shot. He's thinking again.
You know what? Hold on, man. Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one.
You and Robin went down this road before. You got dinged up really bad.
You know who might have something to say about Ted's future with Robin?
Robin.
Go wake her up.
Wake her up and say what?
Daddy's home.
Good luck, buddy.
Hello.
Ted, it's Robin.
Are you sure?
Hey, Robin, how are you?
Ted, I think you and I should have a talk about those phone calls last night.
- Do you mind if I swing by?
- Ask her about the pineapple.
- Uh, yeah, sure, come on over.
- Thanks.
No. Wait, d-d-don't come...
She's coming over. Crap!
Wait. This is killing me. We have to find out who that girl is.
Trudy.
My name is Trudy.
And then, Trudy filled us in.
I'm just surprised you didn't dump him sooner.
I know. It's two years of my life I'm never getting back.
A little part of me wants to just jump the bones of the next guy I see.
Daddy's home.
Or the one after that.
Okay, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so,
you just gave me your number... and your name is Amy.
Ladies.
I love everyone in this bar!
Look at that idiot go.
He's kind of cute.
What are you doing in the men's room?
What am I doing in the ladies' room?
All right, I came in here, 'cause I thought I was gonna throw up.
Did you?
I did not.
And the streak continues-- vomit-free since '93.
I'm sorry, Trudy. Go on.
I liked your performance.
What, the karaoke?
Domo arigato.
I wish I had your guts.
Getting up and making a complete idiot of myself.
So, do it.
I don't know.
Still, I've had a pretty serious week.
I could sure stand to do something stupid.
I'm something stupid. Do me.
You're funny.
Hey, can I call you sometime?
Okay.
Here, let me.
Why do they call it karaoke, anyhow?
Was it invented by a woman named Carrie Okey?
These are the kinds of things I think about.
Karaoke is Japanese for "empty orchestra."
That's hauntingly beautiful.
Hey, it works.
Then I guess you're gonna have to call me.
I got to make one more call.
Hello?
Hey, it's me again.
Hey.
Look, who are we kidding?
You and I are both attracted to each other.
We're-We're young, we're drunk--
half of us, anyway-- and we only get one life.
So, I came over here.
And now, I'm really, really embarrassed.
Damn it, Trudy! What about the pineapple?
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry!
Ah, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.
Why? Is that your girlfriend?
Ah, no, that's not my girlfriend. Um, look, it's complicated.
Oh, you're married. Yeah, I know. I can't believe I did this.
No, no, no, I-I'm not married. Um... I'll explain after you hide.
Hey.
Hi, guys.
- Hey, Robin, top of the morning.
- Hi, Robin. Good sweater.
Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was pretty drunk.
Uh, no kidding.
Those calls were really weird.
Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.
- Let's go get a snack.
- I love to snack.
I'm good.
Come on, those calls weren't that weird.
Robin! Come hang out!
Okay, I'm gonna make this sound till you come hang out.
That goes on for three and a half minutes.
Without a breath?
That's got to be some kind of record.
Oh, Ted, you can't do this. Please.
We agreed to be friends, and now you're making it all confusing.
No, I'm not. Look, I-I just turned off my brain for the night.
Nothing's changed. You've moved on. I've moved on.
Really? You've moved on?
Yes. What, you don't believe me?
Oh. Uh, okay.
Trudy, come on out.
You are gonna laugh.
Wait. You were with someone last night?
Yeah, Trudy. She's cool.
Trudy, come on out.
Yeah, seriously, it's okay.
This is so Trudy.
She's really shy...
I think.
Trudy?
Hi, Trudy. I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you.
You're right. She is shy.
I'm not making this up. She-she must have climbed out the fire escape.
Whatever. Whatever! I-I don't care what you think.
Then why'd you hide her from me?
Wow. You're good.
Anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes?
Yes. You did... last night.
Really?
Get some sleep, Ted.
You had a long night.
And don't feel bad.
I've woken up with worse.
I left Trudy a message, but she never called me back.
That's just how life works sometimes.
You turn off your brain for a night,
and all your left with the next day is a bad hangover,
a sprained ankle...
Oh, we never found out where that pineapple came from,
but it was delicious.

Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks.
Sure, it looks great on TV,
but in reality, it's always just a big let down,
but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible,
to give my friends a great New Year's Eve.
I had an idea of how to do it, too.
And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.
Yeah, that's right-- a limo.
Oh, man, Ted, this is great.
Okay, people, let's talk strategy.
Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked.
This year we party together or not at all.
Now, I sifted through your party submissions
and I narrowed them down to these five.
Question?
Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no,
we will not be attending any parties in your pants.
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?
Thas an actual picture of my pants.
Yeah.
We will hit all five parties before midnight,
and then narrow them down to one,
the most awesome party in New York City
and that is where we will ring,
nay rock, in the new year.
All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?
Mary Beth?
Oh, she works in my office.
She seems like she might be into me.
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
So tonight...
People often ask me "Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"
By who ?
Who asks you that?
And the answer is right here--
my own, personal "get psyched" mix.
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall,
but people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.
Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey
into the white-hot center of adrenaline.
Bam.
It's working.
- I am definitely getting psyched.
- Oh, God.
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.
Must do robot.
- Let's do this!
- Yes! Let's!
Oh, driver?
Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.
I've moved up in the world.
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.
Hey, what are we waiting for?
We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek
should be coming by any minute to pick me up.
Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek.
Derek.
He was like rich, successful, handsome.
I hated that guy.
Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun.
Bye.
See ya next year.
Go get 'em.
Well, this kind of sucks.
Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.
That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder.
Ranjit!
- Party number one.
- Party number one!
I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets.
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.
If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.
We didn't really get a chance to meet.
I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.
Hi. Mary Beth.
So great to meet you guys.
- My word.
- You're, you're friendly.
American party friends of Barney's.
Oh, no.
So, Barney, who's your new friend?
Natalya.
Oh, friendly.
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She... Who knows?
The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?
Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?
Isn't she awesome?
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Okay, I love these shoes,
but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.
Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?
Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.
Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.
It's true.
I can hear them.
What's that, little boys?
What's that?
You wanna go for a... rock?
- Ranjit! Party number two.
- Party number two.
- Party number two?
- Not so good.
Let's go back to party number one.
No, no turning back.
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three. Yeah.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
We have to turn around.
We left Natalya.
Barney, none of us really liked her.
- What?!
- Sorry.
Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.
So while you may chose to turn your back on her,
I choose to turn my front on her. What up?
I'm sorry about Barney.
No, I'm having a great time.
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.
Me, too.
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.
Pfft. Derek.
Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night
and I was already on a date with another girl.
But... it was Robin.
Ranjit, turn it around.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this.
You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.
No, this is perfect.
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.
What happened?
Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal.
Who works on New Year's Eve?
Okay.
Now I feel worse.
I was really looking forward to this night.
This sucks.
Oh, dude, not now!
What? She needs to get psyched.
Fine.
Maybe I should just go home.
My finger slipped.
Look, Robin, you're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.
Look, so your date fell through.
So what ?
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?
Fine. I'll kiss you at...
a little bit after midnight.
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Mary Beth.
You're friendly.
I haven't eaten dinner yet.
Is there anything to eat in this thing?
That's it. I know what you're jonesing for.
Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!
Oh, yes.
Ted, you rock.
We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being,
but we do have time for hot dogs?
Yeah, we like hot dogs.
No. No. We are already behind schedule.
Ted, come on.
We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.
You don't know what you're missing.
Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.
Which is exactly how much time I need.
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.
Wait. Baby, what are you doing?
- I'm going home.
- What? No!
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.
There's a cab over there.
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.
But... hot dogs.
Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.
Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at...
- party number three.
- Are you sure?
- If I don't see you, happy new year.
- Don't say that.
We'll find each other.
We'll find each other.
I know we will.
Hell of a woman.
Let's go get some hot dogs!
Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
- Oh, yeah!
Look at us.
Riding around in a limo.
Eating hot dogs.
It's like we're the president.
Hey. I'll bet you're feeling better now.
Oh, so much better.
Guys.
Is that Moby?
I think that that's Moby.
Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young.
No way.
That's totally Moby.
That's awesome.
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?
Moby! Hey, Moby!
Oh, my God.
He's coming over.
Everybody be cool.
Everybody be cool.
- Hey.
- Hello.
What's up?
Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.
You want a ride?
Sure.
Welcome.
- Wow. You're friendly.
- Big fan.
Barney Stinson.
So, uh... what about this party?
It's just a New Year's thing.
You know, with some friends.
Wow, that sounds awesome.
You guys want to come?
Yeah, we'd love to.
- All right.
- Uh, Ted.
S idebar?
Um... Moby, switch up, will you?
Yeah, what's up?
- What about Lily?
- Call her.
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.
- All the circuits are jammed.
- That's New Year's Eve for you.
Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...
No, I-I can't.
Lily's waiting. I gotta...
I gotta find her.
Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.
But... Come on!
Moby's party!
Moby's party!
Moby's par...
Ranjit.
- Moby's party.
- Moby's party.
This is a cool mix.
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.
I think it should be all rise.
Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher.
This mix is my pride and joy.
I never leave home without it.
Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.
Jan... Aah!
So then I say,
"your motorcycle was like that when I got here."
You're not Moby, are you?
Who?
Moby-- the recording artist, Moby.
No.
But when we said, "Hey, Moby," you said, "Yeah."
I thought you said "Tony."
So your name is Tony?
No.
Oh, hey, we're here.
All right.
You guys going to come in?
Nah.
You're sure?
Come on. It's going to get nuts in there.
There's this dude who owes me money.
No, uh, we're good.
We're good.
Happy New Year, Not Moby.
Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.
Why did we think that guy was Moby?
I don't know.
I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.
That's Marshall's phone.
Hello.
Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?
He left his phone in the limo.
- He's out looking for you.
- What? Where?
Party number three.
Well, I'm here at party number three and...
Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in-- Moby!
Moby?! She's upstairs.
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby.
Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo...
- Does he have a gun?
- Run!
Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four.
What are the odds?
Who was that guy?!
Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.
Ranjit, drive!
- Where to?
- Party number three!
Party number three!
No, but I was just at party number three.
No, no, no, no you were at party number four.
You must have looked at the list wrong.
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience,
you know what it's time for?
It's time to... what?
That's right, re-psych.
Re-psy...
Where's the...?
Oh, my God!
Not Moby took my "Get Psyched" mix!
Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it!
Let it go.
We need to get back on schedule.
Ah, nuts.
Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?
No.
I am pissed.
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.
Okay.
Okay, not a problem.
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.
I wish Marshall would call.
I guess the circuits are jammed.
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed
because everyone's calling their loved ones,
everyone around the world.
Everyone except Barney.
Oh, sure, laugh.
Laugh for Barney Stinson.
Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel
of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze.
Round and round it goes.
And where's it all heading?
Nowhere.
Is this just 'cause you lost your "Get Psyched" mix?
I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?
No. No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.
We got to stay psyched.
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.
"Shot through the heart
And you're to blame, darling"
"You give love a bad name
A bad name"
- "I play my part and you played your game"
- I'm going to get some air.
"Darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!"
It'll be fine.
We'll be out of here in a jiff.
Ted, I'm going to head out.
My roommates are having a party not far from here.
No. Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...
How long have you been in love with Robin?
I'm not in love...
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.
And I can tell that she's into you, too.
That's ridiculous.
Wait. Really?
Happy New Year, Ted.
I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.
Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party.
It's no big deal.
The first time I rode in a limo I was five.
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.
I suppose, in a way, I still am.
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.
- I'm going to call Marshall.
- But he left his phone.
I'm sorry about your girl.
Sorry about your guy.
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.
I did not, too.
D erek.
- Hi. How's work?
- I'll give you some privacy.
Okay, how's this for a plan?
We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45.
We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.
- Give it a rest, Ted.
- Give what a rest?
Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is,
which is New Year's Eve which is the single
biggest letdown of a night every single year.
Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around.
We've still got ten minutes.
Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted.
It doesn't exist.
Holy crap.
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.
So much to tell.
I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked--
I walked to the next party on the list.
- Not Moby's party?
- Yes, Moby's party.
Check it out.
He signed my shirt.
And guess what I found.
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.
Yeah, I know.
Come on.
Come on! Oh! Oh!
Baby, baby, I was so worried about you.
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried, baby.
All the circuits were jammed.
But wait, there's more.
After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five.
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome.
I want to cry, it is so awesome.
We have to go there.
How? We'll never get a cab.
The flat's fixed.
Let's do this!
Come on! In!
Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!
- Natalya?
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time.
Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want to awake her.
She looked so peaceful.
Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town.
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?
I get you there in six.
I don't think I can do it.
No! Come on!
Move, you stupid taxi!
Three minutes!
Come on!
Ranjit, put her in park.
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome,
but it's not the best party in New York.
'Cause this is, right here.
- Cheers. Well said.
- Cheers. Cheers.
And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve.
The funny thing is all night long, I'd been trying to chase something down
that was right there in that limo.
Derek?!
Derek.
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, come on in.
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.
I can't believe you made it.
I made it, baby.
I super love you, okay?
Here, you need a mint.
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year!
You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story.
Well, don't.
Not every night has a happy ending.
But all of it's important.
All of it was leading somewhere.
Because suddenly, it was 2006.
And 2006 was a big one.
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.
What about your guy?
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.
Eh, he kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.
Well, a deal is a deal.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.

L'an 2030
Les enfants, le jour de l'An, c'est pourri.
<i>Oui, ça paraît bien à la télé.</i>
<i>Mais en réalité,
c'est toujours très décevant.</i>
<i>Mais en 2005, j'ai tenté l'impossible:</i>
Jour de l'An 2005
<i>faire passer un bon jour de l'An
à mes amis.</i>
<i>J'avais une idée pour y parvenir,</i>
<i>et ça n'a coûté que la moitié
de ma prime de Noël.</i>
Oui, c'est exact. Une limousine !
3 heures avant minuit...
- Oh, Ted, c'est super !
- D'accord, discutons notre stratégie.
L'an dernier, on n'a pas fêté ensemble,
et ça a été pourri.
Cette année,
on fête ensemble ou pas du tout.
J'ai étudié vos propositions de fêtes,
- et j'en ai retenu cinq.
- Question.
Oui, Barney, j'ai reçu tes propositions,
et non, on ne fera pas la fête
dans ton pantalon.
Mais t'as aimé l'invitation, hein ?
Il y avait une photo de mon pantalon.
Oui.
On va aller aux cinq fêtes avant minuit,
puis on va en choisir une,
la meilleure fête de New York,
et c'est là qu'on se défoncera
pour le jour de l'An.
<i>D'accord, et c'est à la fête n° 1
qu'on va rencontrer Marybeth ?</i>
- Marybeth ?
- C'est ma collègue de travail.
Je crois que je lui plais.
Elle me prend toujours dans ses bras.
Alors ce soir, on verra...
On me demande souvent:
"Barney, pourquoi es-tu toujours
- "aussi excité ?"
- Qui te demande ça ?
La réponse est juste ici.
Ma propre compilation pour être excité.
On pense à tort
que l'intensité d'une compilation
devrait augmenter et diminuer.
Elle devrait constamment augmenter.
Bon, préparez-vous à un voyage sonore
à l'épicentre même de l'adrénaline.
Bang !
- Ça marche !
- Je suis tout excité !
Mon Dieu.
J'atteins des sommets d'excitation.
Je dois faire le robot.
- On y va !
- Oui !
Chauffeur ?
Salut !
Salut, Ranjit !
Tu conduis une limousine, maintenant ?
C'est super.
J'ai gravi des échelons.
Comment vous êtes-vous connus ?
On est déjà montés dans son taxi.
C'est une longue histoire.
On attend quoi ?
On doit aller dans cinq fêtes
en trois heures.
Oh, j'aimerais bien venir,
mais Derek doit venir me chercher
d'une minute à l'autre.
<i>Oh, oui, Robin passait le jour de l'An
avec son copain Derek.</i>
<i>Derek. Il était riche,
beau et il avait du succès.</i>
<i>Je le détestais.</i>
Vous me manquerez. Amusez-vous.
- Salut.
- Bonne année.
- Salut.
- Et voilà.
- C'est nul.
- Ne soyez pas déçus.
On le savait dès le départ.
On en a perdu une.
Ça veut juste dire
qu'on devra s'éclater davantage.
<i>Ranjit, à la fête n° 1.</i>
<i>- À la fête n° 1 !
- À la fête n° 1 !</i>
2 heures et demie avant minuit...
Il y avait des saucisses enrobées de pâte
dans cet endroit.
Si tu penses qu'on peut battre ça,
t'as de l'ambition.
Hé, il nous reste quatre fêtes.
<i>Si la fête n° 1 s'avère la meilleure,
on y retournera.</i>
On ne s'est pas présenté. Je m'appelle
Lily, et voici mon fiancé Marshall.
Salut. Marybeth.
Heureuse de vous rencontrer.
- Pareillement.
- Oh, t'es chaleureuse.
Bonjour, amis américains de Barney.
- Oh, non.
- Alors, Barney, qui est ta nouvelle amie ?
- Natalya.
- Oh, t'es chaleureuse.
- D'où viens-tu, Natalya ?
- Elle... Qui sait ?
De l'ancienne république
de Je-suis-soûle-istan ?
C'est fantastique d'être super soûle, hein ?
N'est-elle pas merveilleuse ?
- Comment vont tes pieds ?
- D'accord.
J'adore ces chaussures,
mais elles me font mal.
Peut-on arrêter à l'appartement
pour les changer ?
Allez, Lily. On a un horaire serré
rempli de plaisir devant nous.
Tu dois endurer la douleur.
D'accord, Ted, mais on dirait
que mes pieds hurlent.
C'est vrai. Je les entends.
Quoi, les gars ? Quoi ?
Vous voulez entendre du rock ?
<i>- Ranjit, à la fête n° 2 !
- À la fête n° 2 !</i>
1 heure et 55 minutes avant minuit...
<i>- La fête n° 2, pas super.
- Retournons à la fête n° 1.</i>
<i>Non, on ne peut pas. Ranjit, à la fête n° 3.</i>
<i>- À la fête n° 3 !
- Ouais !</i>
Oh, attendez ! On doit revenir.
On a oublié Natalya.
- Barney, on ne l'a pas vraiment aimée.
- Quoi ?
- Désolée.
- Oh, c'est gentil, Lily.
Vous savez,
elle est notre invitée dans ce pays.
Tandis que vous lui tournez le dos,
moi, je choisis de tourner
mon torse vers elle. Topez là.
- Désolé pour Barney.
- Ça va, je m'amuse.
Je suis contente
que tu m'aies invitée ce soir.
Moi aussi. Une seconde.
- Salut, Robin.
- Ted, Derek m'a posé un lapin.
<i>Derek. On avait un horaire serré ce soir-là,</i>
<i>et j'étais avec une autre fille.</i>
<i>Mais c'était Robin.</i>
Ranjit, fais demi-tour.
1 heure et 38 minutes avant minuit...
Salut. Oh, mon Dieu, je suis désolée.
J'ai tout gâché votre horaire.
Non. C'est parfait. C'est le destin.
Nous sommes réunis.
Qu'est-il arrivé ?
Oh, Derek est coincé au Connecticut
à cause d'une transaction.
Qui travaille au jour de l'An ?
Bon, là, je me sens encore pire.
J'avais vraiment hâte à ce soir. C'est nul.
- Oh, pas maintenant !
- Quoi ? Elle a besoin d'entrain !
- Barney !
- D'accord.
Je devrais peut-être rentrer.
Barney !
Mon doigt a glissé.
Écoute, Robin. Tu ne rentres pas.
Allez, c'est le jour de l'An.
Il t'a posé un lapin, et alors ?
Tu n'as pas besoin de lui.
Tu veux te faire embrasser à minuit ? Bon.
Je le ferai un peu après minuit.
- Salut, je m'appelle Robin.
- Marybeth.
Oh, t'es chaleureuse.
Je n'ai pas encore soupé.
Y a-t-il quelque chose à manger ?
Ça suffit. Je sais ce que tu veux.
- Ranjit, allons au Gray's Papaya.
- Oh, oui, Ted, t'es super !
On ne pouvait pas revenir pour Natalya,
un être humain,
- mais on s'arrête pour des hot-dogs ?
- On aime les hot-dogs.
Non. Non ! On est déjà en retard.
Ted, il reste une heure et demie
avant minuit,
- et je ne veux pas embrasser Ranjit.
- Tu ne sais pas ce que tu manques.
- Allez. C'est un détour de 20 minutes.
- Exactement le temps dont j'ai besoin.
- Ranjit, arrête la voiture.
- Je l'arrête.
- Attends, que fais-tu ?
- Je retourne chez moi.
- Non !
- Tu ne peux pas !
Je ne supporte plus ces chaussures.
C'est impossible.
Il y a un taxi là-bas.
Je le prends et je change de souliers.
Et les hot-dogs ?
Je sais, j'aimerais y aller,
mais ils sont deux contre moi.
- D'accord. J'y vais avec toi.
- Non.
<i>Va avec eux, et on se rejoint à la fête n° 3.</i>
- T'es certaine ?
- Si on ne se retrouve pas, bonne...
Ne dis pas ça. On va se retrouver.
- On va se retrouver.
- J'en suis convaincue.
Au revoir, Lily.
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir.
Toute une femme.
Allons manger des hot-dogs !
1 heure et 18 minutes avant minuit...
<i>- Ranjit, à la fête n° 3 !
- À la fête n° 3 !</i>
- Oh, oui !
- Dire qu'on mange des hot-dogs
dans une limousine.
Je me sens comme le Président.
- Je parie que tu te sens mieux.
- Oh, beaucoup mieux.
Les gars, est-ce que c'est Moby ?
Je crois que c'est Moby.
<i>Moby était un artiste populaire</i>
<i>quand j'étais jeune.</i>
- C'est pas vrai.
- C'est vraiment Moby. Super !
Devrais-je dire quelque chose ?
Je devrais, hein ?
Moby. Hé ! Moby !
Oh, mon Dieu, il s'en vient.
Restez calmes. Restez calmes.
- Salut.
- Bonsoir.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Tu vas quelque part ?
Oui, je vais à une fête au centre-ville.
Veux-tu qu'on t'y conduise ?
D'accord.
Bienvenue.
- Oh, t'es chaleureuse.
- Je suis un grand fan.
Je m'appelle Barney Stinson.
Et alors, cette fête ?
Oh, on fait juste fêter le jour de l'An
entre amis.
Oh. Ça semble super.
- Voulez-vous venir ?
- On adorerait ça !
- D'accord.
- Ted.
- Je peux te parler en privé ?
- Moby, on change de place ?
Oui, qu'y a-t-il ?
- Et Lily ?
- Appelle-la.
J'essaie. Je n'arrive pas à la joindre.
- Les lignes sont occupées.
- C'est le jour de l'An.
Écoute, on va aller à la fête de Moby,
et après...
Je ne peux pas. Lily attend.
Je dois la trouver.
<i>- Bon, on se rejoint à la fête n° 3.
- Mais... Allez. La fête de Moby.</i>
La fête de Moby... La fête...
- Ranjit, à la fête de Moby !
- À la fête de Moby !
C'est une bonne compilation.
Les gens pensent que l'intensité devrait
augmenter et diminuer.
- Je crois que ça devrait juste augmenter.
- Oui, Moby.
Oui, ça devrait toujours augmenter.
Je suis fier de cette compilation.
- Je ne sors jamais sans elle.
- J'éprouve la même chose pour Janice.
Puis, j'ai dit: "Ta moto était comme ça
quand je suis arrivé."
- Tu n'es pas Moby, hein ?
- Qui ?
- Moby. L'artiste compositeur.
- Non.
Mais quand j'ai dit "Salut, Moby",
t'as répondu "Oui".
Je croyais que t'avais dit "Tony".
- Donc, tu t'appelles Tony ?
- Non.
Bon, on y est. Alors, vous venez ?
- Non.
- En êtes-vous sûrs ?
Allez, ça va être dément.
C'est chez un gars qui me doit de l'argent.
Non, ça va. Ça va.
Bonne année, sosie de Moby.
Oh, j'allais oublier. Soyez prudents.
- Pourquoi a-t-on cru que c'était Moby ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Il était petit, chauve et cool,
ce qui me rappelle tout de suite Moby.
C'est le téléphone de Marshall.
Hé...
- Bonjour.
- Oh, Marshall. Enfin, je t'ai !
- Salut, ma belle.
- Barney, où est Marshall ?
Il a oublié son téléphone ici. Il te cherche.
<i>- Quoi ? Où ?
- À la fête n° 3.</i>
Eh bien, j'y suis et...
Oh, mon Dieu,
devine qui vient de passer ? Moby.
Moby ? Elle est en haut.
Lily, tu dois partir tout de suite.
Ce n'est pas Moby !
Oh, non, je connais Moby, et...
C'est un fusil, ça ?
Cours !
<i>Oh, mon Dieu.
Le sosie de Moby est à la fête n° 4.</i>
Quelle coïncidence.
C'était qui, ce gars-là ?
On sait que ce n'est ni Moby, ni Tony.
- Ranjit ! Conduis !
- On va où ?
<i>- À la fête n° 3 !
- À la fête n° 3 !</i>
<i>À la fête n° 3.</i>
<i>Mais je reviens de la fête n° 3.</i>
<i>Non. T'étais à la fête n° 4.
T'as mal lu la liste.</i>
Après cette expérience désagréable,
savez-vous ce qu'il est temps de faire ?
C'est le temps de quoi ? C'est ça.
S'exciter de nouveau.
S'exci...
Où est le...
Oh, mon Dieu,
le sosie de Moby a pris ma compilation !
Barney, Barney, arrête !
Ça ne vaut pas la peine. Laisse tomber.
On doit rattraper notre retard.
Oh, merde.
28 minutes avant minuit...
28 minutes avant minuit...
Ranjit, t'es sûr que je ne peux pas t'aider ?
Non. Je suis en colère.
Ted, je ne veux pas que tu me voies ainsi.
D'accord.
Bon, pas de problème,
il va soulever la voiture, changer le pneu,
<i>et on sera à la fête n° 3 en un instant.</i>
J'aimerais que Marshall appelle.
Les lignes doivent être occupées.
Oui, et sais-tu pourquoi ?
Les gens appellent ceux qu'ils aiment.
Partout sur le globe.
Tout le monde sauf Barney.
Oh, c'est ça. Riez. Riez de Barney Stinson.
Riez du clown triste,
prisonnier de son manège de complets,
de cigares,
de filles faciles et d'alcool.
Il tourne, sur ce manège.
Et où s'en va-t-il ? Nulle part.
Est-ce juste parce que tu as perdu
ta compilation ?
Désolé. Je n'ai plus le droit d'être pensif ?
Non. Pas ce soir. Pas dans la limousine.
On va rester excités.
Ted s'est cassé la tête pour qu'on passe
un jour de l'An fantastique.
Je vais prendre l'air.
Ça ira, on part dans une minute.
Ted, je vais partir.
Mes colocataires sont à une fête près d'ici.
Quoi ? Non !
Cette soirée ne se déroule pas
comme prévu, mais...
Ça fait combien de temps
que t'es amoureux de Robin ?
Je ne suis pas amoureux d'elle.
On est amis. D'où tu sors ça ?
Ted, ça va. Je vais bien.
- Et je vois bien qu'elle t'aime aussi.
- C'est ridicule.
- Vraiment ?
- Bonne année, Ted.
19 minutes avant minuit...
Je ne peux pas croire
que Marybeth soit partie avant minuit.
Oh, elle devait saluer des gens
à une autre fête.
Ce n'est pas grave.
À mon premier tour de limousine,
j'avais cinq ans.
Je me rendais aux funérailles
de mon grand-père.
En un sens, j'y suis toujours.
Ça devient bizarre, ici.
Je vais appeler Marshall.
- Mais il a oublié son téléphone.
- Marshall !
Marshall !
- Désolée pour ta copine.
- Désolé pour ton copain.
Au moins, on a tous deux
quelqu'un à embrasser à minuit.
As-tu oublié notre entente ? Pas moi.
Moi non plus.
C'est Derek.
Salut  ! Et le travail ?
Je te laisse discuter en privé.
Marshall !
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Marshall !
Bon, qu'en dites-vous ?
<i>On marche,
on arrive à la fête n° 3 vers 0 h 45,</i>
et on célèbre à l'heure normale du Centre.
Marshall !
- Arrête, Ted.
- Arrêter quoi ?
De vouloir faire de cette soirée
quelque chose d'autre
que le jour de l'An,
qui est, chaque fois,
la soirée la plus décevante de l'année.
- Marshall !
- Allez ! On peut changer
le cours de la soirée. Il reste 10 minutes.
Arrête d'être à la recherche
du jour de l'An parfait, Ted.
Ça n'existe pas.
- Marshall !
- Lily !
- Bon Dieu.
- Marshall !
Je savais que je vous retrouverais.
<i>J'ai tant à dire. Je n'ai pas vu Lily
à la fête n° 3, alors j'ai marché</i>
jusqu'à la fête suivante.
- La fête de Moby ?
- Oui.
Regardez, j'ai son autographe.
Et vous savez quoi ?
Je l'ai entendu à la fête, alors je l'ai pris.
- Je sais. Je sais. Allez.
- Allez.
Marshall.
Mon chéri. J'étais inquiète.
Pourquoi ne m'as-tu pas appelée ?
Les lignes étaient occupées.
Mais je n'ai pas fini.
<i>À la fête n° 4,
j'ai pensé que vous seriez à la fête n° 5.</i>
Alors j'y suis allé, et c'était super !
Je veux pleurer. C'est tellement super.
- On doit y aller.
- Mais on ne trouvera pas de taxi.
La crevaison est réparée.
On y va ! Allez ! Montez ! Allons-y !
- Allez, allez !
- Natalya ?
Oui, apparemment,
elle dormait sur le siège avant.
- Ranjit, tu ne me l'as pas dit ?
- Je ne voulais pas la réveiller.
Elle avait l'air si bien.
<i>La fête n° 5 est à 20 pâtés de maisons,
à l'autre bout de la ville.</i>
Ranjit, ça se fait en huit minutes ?
J'en ai juste besoin de six.
3 minutes avant minuit...
Je ne crois pas pouvoir le faire.
- Non, allez.
- Non, allez.
- Avance, maudit taxi !
- Avance...
- Trois minutes ! Allez !
- Allez !
Ranjit, arrête la voiture.
<i>Les amis, je suis sûr
que la fête n° 5 est fantastique.</i>
Mais ce n'est pas la meilleure
de New York, car c'est ici.
Juste ici.
- Santé. Bien dit.
- Santé.
- Santé.
- Santé.
<i>Et soudainement,
on passait un jour de l'An parfait.</i>
<i>Le plus drôle, c'est que toute la soirée,
j'étais à la recherche de quelque chose</i>
<i>qui était juste là, dans la limousine.</i>
Derek ? Derek.
- Salut.
- Salut. Entre.
Robin.
Je suis parti plus tôt de ma réunion
pour être avec toi à minuit.
- Je ne peux pas croire que tu sois ici.
- J'y suis, ma chérie.
Je t'aime au maximum, d'accord ?
Tiens, t'as besoin d'une menthe.
Huit, sept,
six, cinq, quatre,
trois, deux, un !
Bonne année !
<i>Vous êtes sans doute tristes pour moi
à ce stade-ci de l'histoire.</i>
<i>Ne le soyez pas.
Il n'y a pas toujours une fin heureuse.</i>
<i>Mais tout ça était important.
Tout ça menait quelque part.</i>
<i>Car soudainement, on était en 2006.</i>
<i>Et 2006 était toute une année.</i>
Ted !
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je croyais qu'on avait une entente.
Et ton copain ? Il est minuit.
Va l'embrasser.
Il m'a fait attendre.
Je peux le faire attendre aussi.
Un marché est un marché.
Bonne année.
Bonne année.
<i>Quand tu es célibataire
et que tes amis se marient,</i>
<i>chaque invitation à un mariage entraîne
un étrange moment d'autoévaluation.</i>
<i>Emmèneras-tu un invité ou iras-tu seul ?</i>
<i>La véritable question, c'est:</i>
<i>Où seras-tu dans trois mois ?</i>
<i>Assis près de ta copine, ou à faire
du charme à une demoiselle d'honneur ?</i>
<i>Je cochais toujours
que je serais accompagné.</i>
<i>J'étais un optimiste.</i>
2 mois et 26 jours plus tard
Mais j'invite qui, à ce mariage ?
Ted, tu n'as rien retenu
de ce que je t'ai appris ?
En général, non.
On va seul à un mariage.
C'est comme apporter une carcasse
de cerf à la chasse. Oh ! Ted.
On n'y va pas accompagné !
Une carcasse de cerf, vraiment ?
C'est ça, ta métaphore ?
Ted, c'est une comparaison.
C'est trop tard.
Si je n'emmène personne, je gaspille
un plat de poulet ou de saumon à 200 $ .
Je dois y aller avec quelqu'un.
Mais qui ?
<i>Bien sûr, je savais qui je voulais inviter.</i>
<i>Robin. La grande question
sans réponse de ma vie.</i>
<i>Le problème, c'est qu'elle sortait
avec un type vraiment riche, Derek.</i>
<i>Derek !</i>
Eh bien, Derek et moi avons rompu.
Non, c'est terrible. Ça va ?
- Oui, tu veux un verre ?
- Ça n'a jamais vraiment marché avec lui.
Je me sens mal. Il était assez déprimé.
Ne t'en fais pas. Il va s'en remettre.
Ce type est pratiquement milliardaire.
Il se sert de sa carte de crédit
comme hameçon
et il prend dix filles plus belles que toi.
Merci. Je me sens vraiment mieux.
Je crois que je vais aller
me chercher un verre.
Les gars, je dois vous dire un truc.
Je pense que mes sentiments pour Robin
refont surface.
Oh ! Allez, ils n'ont jamais été bien loin.
Pas encore.
Allez. On connaît tous la fin de ce film.
Ted tombe amoureux.
L'amour frappe Ted dans les couilles.
Générique de fin.
Non ! Il faut que vous regardiez
tout le tableau.
C'est un fait, Robin était intéressée
lors de notre première rencontre.
<i>C'est un fait, même sans désir de relation,</i>
<i>on a échangé un baiser fantastique
sur le toit.</i>
<i>C'est un fait, on s'est embrassés encore
la veille du jour de l'An.</i>
C'est un fait, il me faut quelqu'un
pour ce mariage. Croisez les doigts.
Ce que je ne comprends pas,
c'est pourquoi Claudia épouse Stuart.
Elle est bien plus sexy que lui.
À quel point ?
Bien plus.
Ce mariage a l'air assez fantastique,
par contre.
La salle de bal d'un hôtel sophistiqué.
Tout le monde sur son trente et un.
- Et c'est reparti.
- Quoi ?
On n'avance pas
dans la préparation du mariage,
car je veux un truc amusant
et Marshall veut un truc plat.
Voilà une évaluation juste
de nos deux points de vue.
C'est ce que je pensais.
Tu sais quoi, excuse-moi
de ne pas vouloir me marier
pieds nus dans les bois
près du lac
Personne-n'ira-dans-un-trou-si-perdu.
Oui, je veux une salle de bal.
Et un groupe de musique.
Et des chaussures.
Je rêve de ce jour depuis que je suis...
Une petite fille ?
Bien envoyé.
Je dis simplement
que c'est mon mariage aussi,
je devrais avoir mon mot à dire.
Mais je suis la mariée, alors je gagne.
Je pensais que le mariage était l'union
de deux partenaires égaux.
Oui, mais je suis la mariée, alors je gagne.
Mais, sérieusement, Claudia et Stuart ?
Je suis déjà sorti avec une fille
qui n'avait pas autant de charme que moi.
Mais j'étais saoul.
C'est impossible que Claudia soit saoule
depuis trois ans.
Tu sais, j'ai toujours cru
que la meilleure façon d'oublier
un échec amoureux
est de célébrer l'heureuse union
d'autres gens.
C'est logique.
En gardant ça en tête,
ce samedi, c'est le mariage de nos amis
Claudia et Stuart, tenue de soirée exigée.
Tu veux être mon "plus un" ?
"Plus un". Dit comme ça,
c'est tellement romantique.
Très bien.
Tu veux m'accompagner ?
T'accompagner ?
J'adorerais ça.
Et c'est une soirée chic ou très chic ?
- Sois sur ton trente et un.
- Je le serai.
Je le serai tellement que la mariée aura
l'air d'un gros sac de merde blanc.
Lily, j'ai besoin d'une robe.
Tu viens ? C'est génial !
Mon Dieu, 4 jours pour trouver une robe ?
Je sais. C'est une mission suicide.
Si on y va maintenant,
- on a peut-être une chance.
- Allons-y.
Salut, chérie.
Avez-vous vu
comme elle était enthousiaste ?
Je sais pas, il y a quelque chose là.
Et quand viendra samedi, avec la musique,
la danse, le champagne...
Qui sait ?
Ted, tu dois te trouver un autre sexe
parce que je t'exclus du club des hommes.
Ouais, et ta manucure, hier ?
Revigorante, merci.
<i>Bon, je n'allais pas le dire devant les gars,</i>
<i>Bon, je n'allais pas le dire devant les gars,</i>
<i>mais à ce moment-là, je croyais
que ça marchait ainsi.</i>
<i>Tu t'arranges pour être dans un endroit
romantique avec une fille qui te plaît.</i>
<i>Les planètes s'alignent,</i>
<i>et bingo !</i>
<i>Je sais maintenant
que la vie n'est pas si simple.</i>
Salut, Claudia !
Oui, je veux vanille tahitienne.
Vous l'avez mal pris en note ?
Non, non, non ! Écoutez-moi.
Si mon gâteau de mariage n'est pas
à cette saveur,
j'irai réduire en cendres
votre petite boutique.
Vous voulez savoir si je blague ou pas ?
C'est ça, au revoir.
Salut !
Quoi de neuf ?
Je me marie dans 2 jours,
voilà ce qu'il y a de neuf.
Ne t'inquiète pas. Ça va être génial.
J'ai vraiment hâte.
Tu devrais. Des filles célibataires.
Je serai accompagné.
- Alors, je ne serai pas disponible.
- Quoi ?
Je serai accompagné.
Tu ne seras pas accompagné.
Oui, je le serai.
Non, tu ne le seras pas.
- J'ai coché le "plus un".
- Non.
Claudia, je suis pas mal certain que...
Tu n'as pas coché le "plus un" !
Tu ne viendras pas accompagné
à mon mariage !
Mais j'ai déjà invité quelqu'un.
Tu n'emmèneras pas d'invitée, Ted.
La liste des invités est complète
depuis des mois.
Mais j'ai coché le "plus un".
Je le coche toujours.
Tu ne l'as absolument pas coché.
Si oui, je t'aurais appelé
pour faire imprimer un carton
au nom de ton amie.
Est-ce que je t'ai appelé ?
Est-ce qu'elle a un carton à son nom ?
Elle n'en a pas besoin. Elle sait son nom.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle mange ?
Tu as demandé le poulet. Et elle ?
Tu vois à quel point
ton histoire est pleine de trous ?
Allez. On se connaît depuis longtemps.
Il n'y a pas de place pour une de plus ?
Ne m'oblige pas à te faire mal, Ted.
Je n'y crois pas. Claudia est folle.
Mais, soyons justes, elle est aussi sexy.
J'ai coché le "plus un". J'en suis sûr.
- Oui, c'est ça.
- Je l'ai fait !
Je ne pense pas. Tu sais pourquoi ?
Parce qu'au fond,
tu ne voulais pas aller là accompagné.
Tu fais bien ton fendant
en disant que tu es prêt pour une relation,
mais tu es un célibataire.
C'est ton état par défaut.
Ted, tu sais ce qu'il y a
au fond de ton cerveau ?
Génial, le petit discours de Barney.
Derrière un rideau,
dans une petite pièce sombre,
contrôlant en secret
tous tes mouvements...
- Un petit Barney.
- Un petit Barney.
Un petit Barney.
Et tu sais ce qu'il a dit ?
"Ted, tu n'emmèneras personne
à ce mariage.
"Tu vas faire du charme aux demoiselles
d'honneur saoules avec ce Barney-ci."
Arrête, s'il te plaît.
J'appelle Claudia. Je lui explique...
Ted, non. Laisse tomber.
Elle va se marier.
Elle a déjà assez de soucis.
Alors, je fais quoi ?
La seule chose possible.
Dis à Robin qu'elle ne peut pas venir.
Un instant.
Salut.
- Écoute...
- Attends, deux choses. D'abord,
j'ai préparé le terrain cet après-midi.
De façon subtile et décontractée.
Sans la pousser ni la forcer.
Le thème de la journée, c'est:
"Ted est super !"
Et elle accepte ce que je lui suggère.
- Il y a un problème...
- Attends. Ensuite,
la robe. On a trouvé une robe.
Vas-y.
Alors...
Vais-je la porter ?
Ou...
Est-ce que je vais la mettre ?
Je crois que je l'ai déjà mise.
- Superbe !
- C'était mon but.
Je suis vraiment emballée pour demain.
On va bien s'amuser.
Oui, à ce propos...
Je viendrai te chercher à 17 heures.
Alors, la robe ?
- Je n'ai pas de "plus un" pour le mariage.
- Quoi ?
J'ai croisé Claudia et elle m'a dit
que je n'avais pas coché l'option.
- Pourquoi tu ne l'as pas cochée...
- Je l'ai cochée.
- Mais Robin est si emballée.
- Je sais.
- Et la robe.
- Je sais.
D'accord. On la fera entrer en douce.
On ne peut pas faire ça.
On n'est pas des ninjas.
- J'aimerais qu'on soit des ninjas.
- Je sais.
Tu pourrais toujours demander à Stuart.
- Je peux faire ça ?
- Bien sûr.
Vous êtes amis depuis longtemps.
Et c'est son mariage aussi, à 40%.
Je ne sais pas. Il va être dur à convaincre.
- Mon vieux, pas de problèmes.
- Vraiment ?
Plus on est de fous, plus on rit.
Merci de ne pas avoir fait de scène
à propos de ça.
Tu sais, Claudia a dit...
Oui, oui. Ce matin, à la répétition,
Claudia a traité de pute
la bouquetière de sept ans.
Ne te sens pas visé,
elle est juste un peu stressée.
- Oui, elle n'est pas comme ça, d'habitude.
- Non.
Merci, Stu. Ça sera un beau mariage.
Ce magazine dit que de nombreux couples
choisissent de se marier de façon
non traditionnelle dans les bois.
Si un magazine le dit,
on devrait se marier dans les bois,
comme un couple d'écureuils.
Les écureuils ne se marient pas, Marshall.
Comme si tu le savais.
Je l'ai fait. Je l'emmène au mariage.
- Super.
- Quoi ? Comment ?
J'ai parlé à Stuart.
Tu as contourné la mariée.
Ce nid de frelons n'a pas l'air dangereux.
Peut-être que je taperai dessus
avec un bâton.
Regarde, des gremlins.
Allons les nourrir après minuit.
Étais-tu au courant de ça ?
C'était peut-être mon idée.
Quoi ? Stuart n'a pas son mot à dire ?
Alors tu l'admets.
Le marié a autant le droit de décider.
Mais oui.
Pour les trucs stupides,
comme qui est invité.
Alors, je peux inviter qui je veux ?
Bien sûr.
Il y a beaucoup de place dans les bois.
- C'est Claudia.
- Et c'est parti.
Allez. Ça ne peut pas être si pire.
Tiens, Lily, réponds.
Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
Parce que c'était ton idée, tout ça.
Et Claudia me fait peur.
Mais t'es le gars...
Téléphone de Ted.
Allô, Claudia.
Quoi ?
<i>Je n'y étais pas, mais d'après
ce que j'ai entendu, ça s'est passé ainsi.</i>
En passant, chérie, Ted est venu
et je lui ai dit de venir
au mariage accompagné.
Tu as fait quoi ?
Je lui ai dit qu'il pouvait venir
au mariage accompagné.
...juste me le dire, au lieu
de toujours défaire ce que je fais.
...essayer de faire preuve de souplesse.
Mais non, tout est à propos de toi.
Et ta mère. Elle m'appelle tout le temps...
Tu sais quoi ? Le mariage est annulé.
Ils se sont séparés.
Ce n'est pas de ma faute, hein ?
Mon père a déjà payé
pour cet énorme mariage.
Il va me tuer.
Puis, il va tuer Ted.
Puis, je vais tuer Ted.
- C'est Robin.
- Réponds.
- Téléphone de Lily.
- Ted ? Où est Lily ?
Je dois lui dire que j'ai acheté
des chaussures incroyables.
Lily est occupée.
Bon. Je voulais juste dire
qu'elles sont superbes
et que Ted va les adorer.
Génial. Je dirai à Lily de me le dire.
Je voudrais continuer à parler,
mais ce n'est pas le moment.
J'ai vraiment hâte à demain,
d'accord, salut.
- Salut.
- Merde.
Elle a acheté des chaussures.
Elle a vraiment hâte à ce mariage.
- Elle est intéressée, non ?
- Concentre-toi.
D'accord, ma belle.
Calme-toi. Tu veux qu'on aille
quelque part pour parler ?
Je veux qu'on aille
quelque part pour boire.
D'accord. Viens chez McLaren's.
On se voit là-bas.
- Je me sens très mal.
- Sens-toi mal plus tard.
Il faut arranger ça.
Lily, va au bar réconforter Claudia.
Ted et moi tenterons
de faire entendre raison à Stuart.
Dis à Claudia que je suis désolé.
Elle était fâchée contre moi ?
Elle a dit que s'il n'y avait pas de mariage
demain, tu devais 400.000 $ à son père.
Et si on réconciliait ces gamins débiles ?
Salut, dame aux yeux tristes.
Pourquoi es-tu déprimée ?
Stuart et moi, on vient juste de se séparer.
Mon Dieu, je suis désolé.
C'est juste... C'est...
Deux vodkas canneberge, s'il vous plaît.
Tu te rappelles que je bois
de la vodka canneberge.
Si je me rappelle ?
Quand on parle de toi,
comment veux-tu que j'oublie ?
Elles boivent toutes
de la vodka canneberge.
As-tu besoin d'autre chose, ma belle ?
Tu as 400.000 $ ?
Non. Mais je peux faire un câlin.
Merci.
Stuart, je ne sais pas quoi dire.
- Si je suis responsable...
- Ted, tu m'as fait
la plus grande faveur
qu'on ne m'a jamais faite.
- Allez, tu n'es pas sérieux.
- Mais oui.
Je me suis aperçu
que je m'ennuie du célibat.
De sortir tard, de faire des dégâts
sans les nettoyer.
Le porno me manque !
À qui ça ne manque pas ?
Je verrai un top modèle vraiment sexy
et je me dirai:
"Pourquoi suis-je avec Claudia ?
Je pourrais être avec elle."
C'est débile.
Je veux dire, tu as de la chance...
Claudia et toi avez de la chance.
Mais je veux me marier.
Je veux me ranger.
Mais ce n'est pas le moment.
Pas du genre à m'engager.
Du genre célibataire.
Stuart, tu n'as pas à être l'un ou l'autre.
Tout le monde ressent ça
de temps à autre.
Ce n'est pas facile d'avoir une relation.
Ce sont des compromis,
une croissance, tous ces trucs de psycho.
Et comment tu le saurais ?
Tu n'es pas marié.
Bon, demande à ce type.
Ça fait neuf ans qu'il est avec Lily.
C'est un professionnel. Il connaît ça.
Dis-lui, Marshall.
Stuart, ne te marie pas.
- Quoi ?
- Mon vieux !
Écoute, je suis désolé.
C'est dur d'être en couple.
Il faut s'engager,
faire des sacrifices. C'est dur.
Mais si tu es avec la bonne personne,
c'est facile.
Savoir que cette fille est
tout ce que tu désires
devrait être le truc le plus facile.
Si ce n'est pas le cas,
ce n'est pas la bonne.
Je suis désolé.
Tu sais que je n'ai pas 400.000 $, hein ?
Peut-être qu'on a commencé
à se fréquenter trop jeunes.
Peut-être que c'était ça, le problème.
J'ai 28 ans
et je n'ai jamais vraiment couché
qu'avec un seul homme.
C'est juste... C'est...
Deux autres vodkas canneberge,
s'il vous plaît.
Claudia, tout va bien aller.
Merci de m'écouter, Barney.
C'est très important pour moi.
N'est-ce pas étrange qu'on se rencontre
ainsi par hasard ?
Deux âmes
aussi séduisantes l'une que l'autre.
Toutes deux s'agençant telles deux pièces...
d'un casse-tête très séduisant.
Oh ! Bon sang, non !
Claudia se marie demain,
et, je te le jure, si je te surprends
seulement à respirer le même air qu'elle,
je saisirai ces cacahuètes
qui te servent de testicules
et les serrerai si fort
que tes yeux seront exorbités,
puis je te les ferai manger
comme des raisins.
Attends. Mes yeux ou mes testicules ?
Un de chaque.
D'accord, d'accord.
Claudia.
Stuart !
- Je suis si désolée.
- Je suis si désolé aussi.
- Je t'aime.
- Je t'aime, chérie.
Les gars m'ont remis sur le droit chemin.
Quand Marshall a dit de ne pas t'épouser,
je me suis aperçu...
- Marshall a dit quoi ?
- Non...
C'est plus compliqué.
Je me suis aperçu que je t'aimais.
C'est eux qui ont sauvé notre couple.
C'est bon, je suis calme, je suis calme.
Alors, qu'est-ce qu'on a décidé
à propos du "plus un" ?
Non, non, non, non.
<i>Il a fallu trois autres vodkas canneberge
pour contenir Claudia.</i>
<i>Mais elle a fini par gracieusement accepter
que j'emmène Robin.</i>
Encore superbe.
Superbe toi-même.
Un autre sur son trente et un.
Oh ! Oui.
J'ai pensé le laisser à la maison,
mais je ne voulais pas arriver là-bas
et revenir le chercher
parce que j'en avais besoin.
Alors oui, j'ai enfilé mon costume.
Désolée.
Allô ?
Oh ! Mon Dieu, ce soir ?
Vous plaisantez.
Ils veulent que je présente les nouvelles
ce soir.
Vraiment ?
Comme dans présenter présenter ?
Qu'est-il arrivé à Sandy ?
D'accord.
D'accord. Oui.
À quelle heure dois-je... Maintenant ?
Vas-y.
Vas-y.
D'accord, donnez-moi cinq minutes
pour me changer,
et je vous appellerai du taxi...
Admets-le.
Ce mariage est à l'intérieur,
et c'est remarquable quand même.
Je suis d'accord pour les feuilletés
au crabe. Ils sont bons.
Ils étaient excellents.
Nous devrions en avoir
pour notre mariage.
Absolument.
On vient de se mettre d'accord.
- On commence à planifier le mariage ?
- Je crois que oui.
On devrais prendre aussi
cette sauce brune.
Je pense que la rouge était géniale.
Mon Dieu, es-tu né
sans papilles gustatives ?
Quoi ?
Je t'aime.
Prochain reportage:
Y a-t-il des serpents dans vos murs ?
La réponse pourrait vous surprendre.
Après la pause.
Mon gars, tu sais,
Stuart est mon nouveau héros.
Si ce gars-là peut avoir un 9,
je devrais être capable d'avoir un 16.
Un 16 ?
Les deux 8 juste là. Ouais.
- Salut, Ted.
- Claudia.
On voulait juste prendre une photo
avec la femme qui a failli gâcher
notre relation.
Oui, où est-elle ?
Elle n'a pas pu venir.
- Qu'y a-t-il de si drôle ?
- Planifie un mariage. Tu verras.
Regarde ça.
C'est comme ça que ce doit être.
Exactement comme ça.
Facile. Simple.
Ce n'est pas comme ça avec Robin.
Ce n'est pas facile, et sur certains plans,
il faut que ce soit facile.
En parlant de facilité, Ted.
Demoiselles d'honneur.
Oh ! J'allais oublier. On a trouvé ça.
R.S.V.P. - M. Ted Mosby
Je viendrai seul
Je n'ai pas coché le "plus un".
Tu avais raison.
Bien sûr que j'avais raison.
Je suis célibataire.
Peut-être que c'est ce que je suis.
Et tu sais quoi ?
- J'aime être célibataire.
- C'est le pied.
- Sortir aussi tard qu'on veut.
- Pas avoir de comptes à rendre.
Le monde entier rempli de possibilités
à l'infini.
Jamais avoir à aller au marché.
Bon, quelques calculs.
3 demoiselles d'honneur là-bas.
Une huit, une huit et une sept.
Je veux bien te donner une des huit
et baisser mon total à quinze.
Ce qui signifie que tu me dois...
<i>Nous étions là, deux célibataires,</i>
<i>à faire nos trucs typiques de célibataires.</i>
<i>Pour une raison ou une autre, j'avais cru</i>
<i>que ce soir-là marquerait un tournant.</i>
<i>Que ce serait le soir où ma vie,
ma vraie vie, commencerait enfin.</i>
<i>Curieusement, je n'avais pas
totalement tort.</i>
<i>Parce que ce soir-là n'était
que le commencement.</i>
When you're single, and your friends start to get married,
every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation:
"Will you be bringing a guest, or will you be attending alone?"
What it's really asking is,
"Where do you see yourself in three months?
Sitting next to your girlfriend, or hitting on a bridesmaid?"
I always checked that I was bringing a guest.
I was an optimist.
Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?
Ted, have you ignored all my teachings?
For the most part, yeah.
No, you don't bring a date to a wedding.
That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip.
Oh, Ted. Oh, Ted. No-- no date.
Deer carcass? Really? That's the metaphor you're going with here?
Ted, it's a simile.
Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date,
a $200 piece of chicken/salmon will go uneaten.
I got to bring someone, but who?
Of course, I knew who I wanted to bring.
Robin-- the big unanswered question in my life.
Problem was, she was dating this really rich guy named Derek.
Derek.
Well, Derek and I just broke up.
Oh, no, that's terrible! Are you okay?
Yeah, do you need a drink or something?
Nah... We never really clicked.
I felt bad, though. He was pretty bummed.
Ah, don't beat yourself up.
He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's, like, a billionaire.
He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in ten chicks hotter than you.
Thanks. I feel a lot better.
I think I'll get that drink now.
Okay, guys, I got to say something.
I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing.
Oh, please-- they were buried in a shallow grave.
Not again. Come on. Dude?
We all know how this movie ends.
Ted falls in love, love kicks Ted in the sprouts, roll credits.
No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture.
Fact:
Robin was into me when we first met.
Fact:
Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof.
Fact:
On New Year's Eve, we kissed again.
Fact:
I need a date to this wedding.
Wish me luck.
What I don't get is why is Claudia marrying Stuart?
She's way hotter than him.
How way?
Way way.
This wedding does sound pretty amazing, though.
Fancy hotel ballroom,
everybody all dressed up...
Oh, here we go.
What?
We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans
because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame.
Oh, yeah. Okay, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments.
I thought so.
You know what? Excuse me if I don't want to get married
barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-One's-Going-To-Drive-That-Far.
Yes. I want a ballroom,
and I want a band, and I want shoes.
I've been dreaming about this day since I was, like...
A little girl?
What up!
Okay. I'm just saying that it's my wedding, too, and I should have a say in it.
Yes, but I'm the bride, so I win.
Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together.
Right, but I'm the bride, so I win.
I mean, seriously-- Claudia and Stuart?
I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness,
but, you know, I was drunk.
There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.
You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship
is to celebrate someone else's successful one.
Oh, it makes sense.
So, with that in mind, uh, our friends Claudia and Stuart
are having this crazy black-tie wedding on Saturday.
You want to be my plus one?
Ooh... "Plus one." You make it sound so romantic.
Fine.
You want to be my date?
Your date?
I'd love to.
How fancy are we talking about here?
Oh, you're going to want to bring your "A" game.
Oh, I'll bring it.
I'll bring it so hard, the bride's going to look like a big white bag of crap.
Lily? I need a dress.
You're going? That's awesome!
Oh, my God-- four days to find a dress?
I know, it's a suicide mission.
Well, if we leave now... we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it!
Bye, babe.
Whoa! Did you see how fired up she was?
I don't know, there's something there.
And, come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne...
Who  knows?
Wow. Ted, you're going to have to find another gender for yourself,
'cause I'm revoking your "dude" membership.
Yeah... how was that manicure yesterday?
Invigorating, thanks.
Okay, I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys,
but  back then I really thought that's how it worked.
You put yourself and a girl you like in some romantic setting...
the stars line up...
and shazam.
I know now that life is never that simple.
Hey, Claudia!
Yes, I want Tahitian Vanilla! You wrote it down wrong?
No, no, no, no, listen to me--
if I go to my wedding and the cake is not Tahitian Vanilla,
I will come down there and burn your little shop to the ground!
Do you want to find out if I'm kidding?
Yeah, good-bye.
Hey!
How's it going?
My wedding is in two days, that's how it's going.
Oh, don't worry, it's going to be great. I'm so excited.
Well, you should be-- lots of single girls.
Oh, well, yeah, I'm... bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.
What?
I'm bringing a date.
You're not bringing a date.
Uh... yes, I am.
Uh, no, you're not.
I checked "plus one."
No, you didn't.
Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...
Ted, you did not check "plus one"!
You are not bringing a date to my wedding!
Wait, I've already invited someone.
You are not bringing a guest, Ted!
The guest list has been closed for months-- months!
But I checked "plus one"! I always check "plus one"!
You absolutely did not check "plus one"!
If you had checked "plus one," I would have called you to get the name of your guest,
so I could have the place cards printed up.
Did I call you to get the name of your guest?
Is there a place card with her name printed on it?
She doesn't need a place card. She knows her name.
What's she eating?! Huh?! You ordered the chicken. What did she order?
Do you see how your story is full of holes?
Come on, Claudia, we go way back.
Isn't there room for just one more person?
Don't make me hurt you, Ted.
I don't believe this! Claudia's crazy!
But, to be fair, she's also hot.
I totally checked "plus one." I'm sure I did.
- Yeah, right.
- I did!
Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why?
Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date.
See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down, you're single.
It's your default setting.
Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?
Oh, great, here comes the little Barney speech.
Behind a curtain, in a dark little room secretly controlling your every move?
- A little Barney...
- A little Barney.
A little Barney.
And you know what he said?
"Ted... you will bring no dates to this wedding.
You... will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney."
Wow. Please stop.
I got to call Claudia. If I just explain to her...
Ted, no! Let it go.
She's about to get married, she's got enough to worry about.
Then what am I going to do?
The only thing you can do-- tell Robin she can't come.
Just a second!
- Hey!
- Hey. Listen...
Wait, two things. First of all... I have been laying groundwork all afternoon.
Totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging, just:
the theme of today is, "Ted rocks."
And she's picking up what I'm laying down.
- Lily, there's a problem...
- Wait, no.
Thing number two: the dress.
We got a dress.
Go.
Well?
Did I bring it, or... did I bring it?
I think I brought it.
Wow.
That's what I was going for.
I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're going to have so much fun.
Yeah, about that...
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
So? The dress?
I don't have a plus one for the wedding.
What?
I ran into Claudia, and she told me I didn't check "plus one" on the reply card.
- Why didn't you check "plus..."?
- I did check "plus one."
- But Robin is so excited.
- I know.
-  And the dress!
- I know.
Okay, okay. Well, we'll sneak her in.
We can't sneak her in, we're not Ninjas.
- Oh, I wish we were Ninjas.
- I know.
You could always ask Stuart.
Can I do that?
Well,  sure.
You guys have been friends for a long time.
And it's 40% his wedding, too.
I don't know... it's going to be a tough sell.
Dude, no problem whatsoever.
Really?
Sure, the more, the merrier.
Wow! Wow, thanks for being so cool about this,
'cause you know, Claudia said...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This morning at the rehearsal,
Claudia called our seven-year-old flower girl a whore.
So, don't take it personally, she's just a little stressed.
Yeah, she's not usually like that.
No.
Well, thanks, Stu!
It's going to be a great wedding.
Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting
to have non-traditional weddings out in the woods.
Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods,
like a couple of squirrels.
Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.
Like you could possibly know that.
I did it. I did it-- I'm taking her to the wedding.
Nice!
What? How?
I talked to Stuart.
You went around the bride.
"Oh, this hornets' nest looks harmless.
Maybe I'll poke it with a stick.
Oh, look, some Gremlins. Let me go feed them after midnight!"
Did you know about this?
It may have been my idea.
What?
Stuart doesn't get a say?
Ah! So you admit it-- the groom should have an equal say.
Well, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes.
So I can invite whoever I want?
Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods.
It's Claudia.
So it begins.
Come on, it can't be that bad.
Here, Lily, you answer it.
What? Why?
Because this whole thing was your idea.
And... Claudia scares me.
But... but you're the... But I just want to...
Ted's phone.
Oh, hi, Claudia.
What?
Now I wasn't there, but from what I heard, it went something like this...
Oh, by the way, honey, Ted stopped by and I told him
he could bring his date to the wedding.
You what?
...always undermining me at every turn...
...try to show a little flexibility, but no!
It's all about you!
...and your mother...
You know what?
The wedding's off!
They broke up!
O w!
It's not because of me, is it?
And my dad already paid for this huge wedding!
Oh, he's going to kill me!
And then he's gonna kill Ted!
Then I'm gonna kill Ted.
It's Robin.
Answer it!
Uh, Lily's phone.
Ted, where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.
Uh, Lily's busy.
Oh, okay, well, I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's going to love them.
That's great, I'll tell Lily to tell me.
Uh, listen, I really want to keep talking, um, but now's not a good time,
so I'm really excited about tomorrow, okay, bye.
Okay, bye.
Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this.
- Do you think she's into me?
- Ted, focus!
Okay, okay, sweetie, just calm down.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
I want to go somewhere and drink!
Okay, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there.
Oh, I feel terrible.
Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this.
Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia.
Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart.
Um, tell Claudia I'm sorry.
Did she seem pissed at me?
She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000.
What say we get these crazy kids back together?
Hi, sad eyes.
What's got you down?
Stuart and I just broke up.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's...
Two vodka cranberries, please.
You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.
Remember?
When it comes to you, how can I forget?
They all drink vodka cranberries.
So... is there anything else you need... sweetie?
You got $400,000?
No.
But I do have a hug.
Thank you.
Stuart, I-I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...
Ted, for all I know, you did me the biggest favor anyone's ever done me.
Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that.
No, I do-- this whole thing has made me realize I miss being single.
I miss staying out late, and making messes and not cleaning them up.
I miss owning porn.
Dude, who doesn't?
And you know, I'll see some super-hot model chick, and I'll think,
"Why am I with Claudia? I could be with her."
That's just crazy!
I mean... you're the luckiest... You and Claudia both...
The point is I want to get married. I want to settle down,
but right now, that's just not who I am.
I'm not a commitment guy; I'm a single guy.
Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other.
Everybody feels this way sometimes.
Relationships aren't easy; they're hard work.
It's about compromise, growing together, all that Dr. Phil crap.
How would you know? You're not even married.
Okay, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily.
He's the pro-- this guy knows relationships.
Tell him, Marshall.
Stuart, don't get married.
- Dude...
- What?
Look, I'm sorry.
Being in a couple is hard. And committing, making sacrifices, it's hard.
But if it's the right person, then it's easy.
Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life,
that should be the easiest thing in the world, and if it's not like that,
then she's not the one. I'm sorry.
You  know I don't have $400,000, right?
Maybe we got together too young.
Maybe that's what the problem was.
I mean, I'm 28 years old,
and I've really only ever been with one man.
That's just, that's...
Two more vodka cranberries, please!
Claudia... it's all gonna be okay.
Oh, thanks for listening, Barney.
It really means a lot to me.
Isn't it weird that we should... run into each other like this?
Two souls, of equal levels of attractiveness,
both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.
- Oh, hell, no!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
Claudia is getting married tomorrow,
and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her,
I will take those peanuts you're trying to pass off as testicles,
and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out,
and then I'll feed them to you like grapes!
Wait, my eyes or my testicles?
One of each.
All right! All right!
Claudia?
Stuart.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, too.
I love you.
I love you too, babe.
Marshall and Ted set me straight.
And when Marshall told me not to marry you, it made me realize I...
Marshall said what?!
It's more complicated than that!
He made me realize how much I love you.
These guys got us back together.
Okay, I'm cool, I'm cool.
So where did we land on the whole plus one thing?
No, no, no, no!
It took three more vodka cranberries to subdue Claudia,
but, eventually, she graciously agreed to let me bring Robin.
Still wow.
Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.
Oh, yeah. I thought about leaving it at home,
but I figured I don't want to get there and realize I need it
and have to go all the way back to get it. So, yeah, I brought it.
Oh, sorry.
Hello?
Oh, my God. Tonight?
You're kidding.
They want me to anchor the news tonight.
Really?
Like anchor anchor?
What happened to Sandy?
Okay.
Okay. Sure. What time do you need me to...
Right now?! Oh.
Do it.
Do it.
Okay, I need like five minutes to change, and, um, I'll call you from the cab...
So admit it.
This wedding is both indoors and amazing.
I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good.
The crab puffs were incredible.
We should totally have them at our wedding.
Definitely...
Hey. We just agreed on something.
Did we just start planning our wedding?
I think that we did.
We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.
Ooh, I thought the red sauce was, like, awesome.
My God, were you born without taste buds?
What?
I love you.
Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls?
The answer may surprise you... after the break.
Man, you know something? Stuart's my new hero.
If that dude can bag a nine,
I got to be able to bag, like, a 16.
What's a 16?
Those two eights right over there.
Yeah.
Hi, Ted.
Claudia.
We just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship.
Yeah, where is she?
Um... she couldn't make it.
What's so funny?
Oh, plan a wedding. You'll see.
Look at that.
That's how it's supposed to be. That right there.
Easy, simple.
It's just not like that with Robin.
It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.
Speaking of easy... bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.
By the way, I almost forgot.
We found this.
I didn't check "plus one."
You were right.
Of course, I was right.
I'm single.
Maybe that's just who I am.
And you know what? I like being single.
Being single's the best.
Yeah, stay out as late as you want.
Answer to no one.
The whole world full of endless possibilities.
Never having to go to a farmer's market.
Okay. Ah... doing some math here.
Table six has got three bridesmaids: an eight, an eight, and a seven.
I am willing to give you one of the eights, lowering myself to a 15,
which means you owe me...
So there we were, two single guys, doing our usual single-guy thing.
For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point,
that this was the night my life-- my real life-- would finally begin.
The funny thing is...
I wasn't totally wrong.
Because that night was just beginning.

<i>Les enfants, la vie est remplie
de moments romantiques</i>
<i>qui la rendent agréable.</i>
<i>Mais le problème,</i>
<i>c'est qu'ils sont éphémères.</i>
<i>Et se tapir dans un coin
dans l'attente de ces moments,</i>
<i>c'est la réalité pure et dure.</i>
<i>Donc, en 2006,</i>
<i>lors du mariage de Claudia et de Stuart,</i>
<i>la réalité était l'ennemie.</i>
Le corps des volontaires de la paix ?
Oui, je pars demain. Pour deux ans.
Certains disent
que c'est la chose la plus noble
qu'on puisse faire.
Je leur réponds: "Vraiment ?"
Habituellement, ils disent: "Oui, ce l'est."
Mais, Barney, ils ont raison.
Si je pouvais faire quelque chose.
Oh, Tanya,
je suis si content que tu dises cela.
<i>Ce n'est pas comme ça
que j'avais imaginé ma soirée.</i>
<i>Ça devait être un moment spécial
pour Robin et moi,</i>
<i>mais la réalité a frappé.</i>
<i>Robin fut appelée
pour présenter les nouvelles de 23 h.</i>
<i>C'était sa chance.</i>
<i>Je suis allé au mariage non accompagné.</i>
<i>Puis, au moment
où je m'y attendais le moins...</i>
Où étais-tu passé hier soir ?
J'ai passé la nuit la plus incroyable
de ma vie.
Là tu parles. Ce gâteau !
Le meilleur que j'aie jamais mangé.
Sérieusement. Mon estomac disait:
"Hé ! J'ignore ce que tu manges,
car je n'ai pas d'yeux,
"mais c'est génial.
Continue d'en envoyer dans le tuyau."
Oui, je sais. Mon estomac disait:
"Ma fille, on ne s'entend pas toujours,
mais ce gâteau..."
Lily ?
Oh, c'est vrai. La nuit la plus incroyable
de ta vie, continue.
Je devrais te dire que j'ai une règle:
Ne jamais commencer une relation
lors d'un mariage.
Je dirais que tu n'as pas
toujours suivi la règle.
Voilà. Ces beaux instants romantiques,
c'est bien quand ils se présentent,
mais ils sont faux.
Exactement. Comme à l'instant
où je t'ai vu faire la danse des canards,
pour tout te dire, j'étais renversé.
Tu n'as pas vu ma danse à claquettes.
Tu tomberais à genoux.
Malheureusement, ça m'arrive souvent.
Mais je sais que ce n'est qu'un mirage.
- L'aveuglement de la noce.
- Exactement.
C'est pour cela
que je n'essaie pas de te séduire.
- Tu n'essaies pas de me séduire ?
- Tu crois que j'essaie ?
Crois-moi, tu le saurais.
Les gens assis
à dix tables plus loin le sauraient.
- C'est dommage.
- À qui le dis-tu.
Je pense avoir une solution.
J'écoute.
Comme préface, disons
qu'on ne couchera pas ensemble ce soir.
J'écoute moins.
- Continue.
- D'accord.
Ce qui vient tout gâcher,
c'est le lendemain. N'est-ce pas ?
Alors, si on ne se rendait pas jusque-là ?
- Que veux-tu dire ?
- Je suis ici, tu es ici.
C'est un beau grand mariage romantique.
Pourquoi ne pas seulement danser
et s'amuser ?
Puis, quand ce sera fini,
on ne se reverra plus.
- À moins...
- Non, pas de "à moins".
Pas de courriels, pas de numéros
de téléphone, pas de noms.
Ce soir, on créera un souvenir
qui ne sera jamais terni.
Et quand on sera vieux,
on se souviendra de cette soirée,
et elle sera parfaite.
- D'accord, j'embarque.
- D'accord.
On utilisera des faux noms ?
Appelle-moi Buttercup.
Enchanté, Buttercup.
Je m'appelle Lando Calrissian.
C'est amusant.
Notre nom sera à jamais gardé...
Ted, regarde. J'ai une fille d'honneur.
Ted, regarde.
La deuxième au rang des filles sexy.
Ted, regarde. À plus tard, Ted.
Je m'appelle Ted.
Victoria.
- Mais pas de nom de famille.
- Pas de nom de famille.
Qu'est-ce qui va pas chez toi ?
Oui, vieux, c'est une idée ridicule.
Non, c'était génial.
J'ai passé une belle soirée.
Je ne la reverrai jamais.
Et rien ne viendra gâcher ça.
Ted, comment t'expliquer ?
Hier soir, le gâteau était succulent.
Vais-je rayer ce gâteau de ma vie ?
Pas question.
Je vais trouver quelle pâtisserie
le confectionne,
et je vais aller en chercher.
Ce gâteau t'obsède, hein ?
Il me hante.
Que s'est-il passé ensuite ?
Les règles de base sont établies.
Voyons voir ces techniques de séduction
dont j'ai tant entendu parler.
Attends, attends.
Rendons service aux filles célibataires
en volant ce bouquet.
Oui, mais créons une diversion.
Un baiser !
Un baiser ! Un baiser !
Allez, un baiser ! Un baiser !
Allez, allez.
C'est donc ça qui est arrivé au bouquet.
Un bon point pour Victoria.
C'est une sale tradition.
- Tu ne le feras pas à ton mariage ?
- Oh, oui !
Je balancerai cette bombe fleurie
dans la foule en criant:
"Rampez, salopes !"
C'est ce que font les filles.
Où êtes-vous allés ?
- Très joli.
- Oui ?
Je ne sais pas danser à claquettes.
Je ne l'ai pas remarqué.
Dommage de t'en priver, ce soir !
Si j'en voulais, je pourrais en avoir.
Non, tu ne pourrais pas.
Tu es un homme.
- Je pourrais.
- Tu pourrais certainement.
On ne s'embrassera pas, ce soir.
Si on s'embrasse, tout ceci deviendra réel.
Tu pourrais trop utiliser ta langue,
et moi pas assez.
Puis soudain, le charme est rompu.
J'utiliserai ma langue juste ce qu'il faut.
Que dis-tu de cela ?
La meilleure partie du premier baiser,
c'est la préparation.
Juste avant que les lèvres se touchent.
C'est comme un roulement de tambour.
Si ce soir
on se contentait
du roulement de tambour ?
- D'accord.
- Mais on ne s'embrasse pas.
D'accord.
Un roulement de tambour ? C'est tout ?
Alors, quoi ?
Tu lui as dit bonsoir, tu es rentré et...
tu as fait un solo à la batterie ?
Ted, que tu es idiot !
Cette fille a l'air sensationnelle.
Elle était tout à fait sensationnelle.
Elle était aussi drôle
et on avait beaucoup d'affinités,
et je ne la verrai plus jamais.
Merde, je dois la revoir.
- Oui !
- Oui !
Au travail, vieux. Que sais-tu sur elle ?
Rien, à part son nom. Victoria.
Attends, Claudia. Claudia le saurait.
Claudia est en voyage de noces
pour deux semaines.
- Attends son retour.
- Deux semaines. Bonne idée.
- Je l'appelle tout de suite.
- Non, Ted.
- On ne dérange pas les nouveaux mariés.
- Voyons, vieux.
Parle-lui du gâteau.
- Ted ?
- Salut, Claudia !
Quel mariage, quel toast, très émouvant.
Et la lune de miel ?
Écoute, hier soir j'ai rencontré cette fille,
et je me demandais si tu avais...
Oh, c'est une blague !
Et c'est parti.
Hier encore tu me suppliais
pour amener une autre fille à mon mariage
et tu en as déjà assez d'elle ?
C'est du passé.
Son nom ? Ma grosse cousine Lindsey ?
Ne sois pas gêné. Elle a de beaux yeux.
Non. Elle s'appelle Victoria.
Je n'ai pas son nom de famille.
Tu es chanceux.
Je connais ma liste d'invités par coeur.
Dieu merci !
Malheureusement, aucune Victoria n'était
invitée au mariage. Salut, Ted.
Aucune Victoria n'était au mariage.
Elle a sans doute utilisé
un autre faux nom.
Oh, elle est douée, très douée.
C'était peut-être un fantôme.
C'est pour ça qu'elle ne t'a pas embrassé.
Tu l'aurais traversée
en frissonnant de froid.
Mon Dieu !
Je viens d'avoir une idée de scénario.
Marshall, ce n'était pas un fantôme.
Je sais qu'elle n'en était pas un.
Elle a pris un bouquet, ce qui
prouve qu'elle a un corps palpable.
Elle était avec d'autres
filles d'honneur à table.
Elles la connaissent peut-être.
Super ! Comment joindre
ces filles d'honneur ?
Je suis sur le point de découvrir Nirvana.
Je devrais te donner le numéro
de Nirvana.
Elle fait de bons massages. Tu piges ?
Barney !
Je connais les règlements de la maison.
<i>C'est une blague  !</i>
Écoute, Barney.
Je t'ai vu parler avec la fille d'honneur.
- As-tu son numéro de téléphone ?
- Tu sais que je l'ai.
Super ! J'aimerais que tu l'appelles
pour moi.
Tu sais que je ne veux pas.
Pourquoi pas ?
On a couché ensemble hier soir.
Je ne peux pas la rappeler le lendemain.
Je dois attendre au moins, genre...
toute la vie.
Oh, la blague ! Je ne la rappellerai jamais.
De toute façon,
elle me croit parti pour l'lnde.
Allez, Barney. C'est pour une bonne cause.
Ted se faisant castrat pour une autre fille,
ce n'est pas une bonne cause.
Désolé, j'aimerais t'aider.
J'ai les mains liées.
Oh, non, ça, c'était hier soir.
D'accord, Barney, voici ce que je vais faire.
Tu appelles,
et je t'accompagnerai...
 à la boxe sexy.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Tu as toujours dit
que les filles n'étaient ni sexy,
- ni de bonnes boxeuses.
- Prouve-moi que j'ai tort.
- Ce soir ?
- Ce soir !
Appelle.
Salut, Tanya. Je ne joins pas
les volontaires avant demain.
Oui, je sais. Ca craint.
Un jour de moins à aider les gens.
Et cette fille, tu sais qui c'était ?
Attends. Quelle sorte de chaussures...
Non, Tanya, c'est un gars.
Il n'aura pas remarqué ses chaussures.
En fait...
Oh, voyons !
Hé !
Que veux-tu faire ? Ne réfléchis pas !
La première chose qui te vient à l'esprit.
Tiens ça.
Et ça.
Et voilà.
Apparemment, ses chaussures
étaient brunes
avec des petits flocons de neige dessus.
Oui, ils ont l'air mignons.
Tu as une idée de qui...
D'accord. Merci quand même. À bientôt.
Qu'est-ce...
Ce soir ?
C'est que je pars très tôt.
Je ne pourrai pas rester,
mais oui, j'aimerais beaucoup.
D'accord. À plus tard.
Désolé, Ted, je n'irai pas à la boxe sexy.
Je comprends.
Ne perdons pas espoir.
On appellera à l'hôtel.
Elle a peut-être couché là.
Demandons-leur de vérifier s'ils ont
une Victoria à l'hôtel.
- C'est peut-être Vicky ou Tori...
- Ou lctor.
Probablement pas lctor.
Non, c'est le destin.
Je ne suis pas censé la revoir.
C'était le but de la soirée.
J'ai été sauvé de moi-même.
- Buvons beaucoup de bières.
- D'accord.
<i>Et je pensais que c'était terminé. Puis...</i>
- Voici la lectrice de nouvelles.
- Salut.
- Comment c'était ?
- Oh, je ne sais pas.
Demande à la remplaçante
de fins de semaine.
Robin ? Merci, Robin. C'était génial.
- À vous, Robin.
- Félicitations !
- Merci.
- C'est super.
J'étais mal à l'aise
d'avoir annulé avec Ted.
Ne t'en fais pas pour ça. En fait...
<i>Puis, Lily lui raconta toute l'histoire,</i>
<i>jusqu'aux chaussures ornées
de flocons de neige.</i>
<i>Et à la fin de l'histoire...</i>
Quoi ?
Je sais qui elle est.
Tu sais qui elle est ?
Tu n'étais même pas à la noce.
J'y étais d'une certaine façon.
Quoi ?
Après les infos, j'étais très excitée,
et j'ai décidé de surprendre Ted
en me rendant à la réception.
Oh, merde.
Oh, arrête ça.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Y a quelqu'un ?
Ça va, là-dedans ?
Oui, je vais bien !
Ça doit être une allergie. Ça va.
Écoute, tu ne veux pas venir pleurer ici ?
On me dit que je suis douée
pour les câlins.
Oh, merci.
Mais je ne pleure pas devant les autres.
Je ne pleure pas habituellement.
C'est dégoûtant.
Est-ce que tout le monde se mouche
autant en pleurant ?
Tu parles à une spécialiste.
Pourquoi pleures-tu ?
Parce que tu as des sentiments pour Ted.
Je ne sais pas. Peut-être ?
Qu'y a-t-il avec vous deux ?
Sérieusement !
Il t'aime bien, tu l'aimes bien,
soyez ensemble, c'est tout !
Voyons donc,
ce n'est pas si difficile d'être heureux.
D'accord.
Oui, c'était bizarre
que je pleure aux toilettes.
Ça ne veut pas dire
que je suis amoureuse de lui.
En fait, je ne sais pas ce que je ressens.
Oui, tu le sais.
Pleurer parce que tu l'as vu
avec quelqu'un d'autre ?
Tu sais quoi ? C'est ça que tu ressens !
Ce ne sont que tes sentiments.
D'accord. J'ai des sentiments pour lui.
Tu es contente ?
Plutôt, oui.
Mais ça ne change rien.
Je ne veux toujours pas me marier,
et il est toujours Ted.
Je devrais lui dire qui est Victoria,
comme ça il sera heureux.
Ou tu pourrais lui dire qu'il t'intéresse,
et vous pourriez tous deux être heureux.
Je vais aller le trouver.
Attends.
Que vas-tu lui dire ?
Je n'en ai aucune idée.
Et voici le plus incroyable:
Je lui ai dit que j'avais changé
tout mon argent en dollars indiens,
alors, elle m'a donné 50 $
pour prendre un taxi.
C'est exact. J'ai été payé pour du sexe.
Je devrais donner cet argent.
Le corps des volontaires m'a tant aidé.
- Salut, les gars.
- Salut.
Ted, je peux te parler dehors ?
Bien sûr, qu'y a-t-il ?
J'ai une chose à te dire.
Oh, tu peux répondre.
- Allô ?
- Ted ? C'est Stuart.
Ma tendre épouse aurait
quelque chose à te dire.
Ted.
Je suis désolée d'avoir raccroché
la dernière fois.
Mon mari, et la vodka canneberge,
qui coûte 10,50 $ au maudit bar
de l'aéroport...
<i>- Quand embarquons-nous ?
- Chérie.</i>
...m'ont fait comprendre que j'agis
parfois comme une cinglée.
Et je ne veux pas donner cette impression
à mon mari.
Ça va, Claudia, ne t'en fais pas pour ça.
Marshall veut savoir
où vous avez commandé ce gâteau.
Le gâteau ?
Tiens, prends ça.
On dirait que tu en as besoin.
Merci. Tu es très gentille.
Es-tu une amie de la mariée ou du marié ?
On l'a acheté dans une petite pâtisserie.
Ni un ni l'autre, en fait.
C'est la pâtisserie Buttercup.
Enchanté, Buttercup.
J'ai fait le gâteau.
Elle a fait le gâteau.
Elle n'était pas sur la liste,
car elle n'était pas invitée.
Elle a fait le gâteau !
Elle a fait ce gâteau. Ted, c'est la bonne.
Tu dois l'épouser. Aujourd'hui.
Elle doit venir vivre avec nous.
- Je vais à la pâtisserie.
- Non, ne fais pas ça.
Chérie, de quoi tu parles ?
Toute la journée, tu m'as poussé
à retrouver cette fille.
Je pense que tu ne l'intéresses pas assez.
Et que c'est pour ça
qu'elle ne t'a pas donné son numéro.
Robin, tu n'as rien à dire ?
Oui.
Ted,
va la retrouver.
Aller. La retrouver.
Ted. J'adore cet instant.
Car je vais le dire.
Et cette fois, tu diras oui.
Prêt ? Prêt à dire oui ? Ted, en costume !
Oui !
- Non.
- Oh, voyons !
- On s'est absentés trop longtemps.
- C'est dommage.
J'aurais aimé danser une dernière fois.
Oui, je le suis.
Désolé, je lisais dans tes pensées.
Et à quoi je pensais ?
Dieu qu'il est beau dans ce smoking.
- Exact. Tu es doué.
- Oui.
Je n'ai pas cette allure tous les jours.
Les fins de semaine,
le vrai Ted porte un jeans et un t-shirt
délavé par endroits.
Le vrai Ted a l'air très sexy.
Dommage que je ne le verrai jamais.
La pâtisserie Buttercup. C'est ici.
Bonne chance, vieux.
Rapporte-moi un petit gâteau.
Ted ? Tu es toujours là ?
Dis-moi ton nom de famille.
Tu sais, il y a une petite faille
dans notre plan.
Laquelle ?
Ce soir, je vais rapporter chez moi
de beaux souvenirs,
mais aussi un mauvais:
Le souvenir de toi quittant cette salle.
Hé, Ted.
Oui ?
Ferme les yeux et compte jusqu'à cinq.
Un.
Deux.
Trois.
Quatre.
Cinq.
<i>Toute notre vie,
on se souviendra que cette soirée était</i>
<i>parfaite.</i>
On a peut-être besoin de ça tous les deux.
Tellement de choses se passent mal
dans la vie,
mais pas cette fois.
Ce sera toujours...
toujours pur,
non altéré, génial.
Si j'entre, je nous vole
à tous les deux ce qui aurait...
Le compteur tourne, vieux.
Accouche, qu'on baptise.
Oui, oui, j'y vais.
Oh, Dieu merci !
Kids, in life there are a lot of big romantic moments.
And they make life worth living.
But here's the problem:
moments pass,
and lurking just around the corner from those moments
is a cruel, unshaven bastard named reality.
And so, back in 2006,
on the night of Claudia and Stuart's wedding,
reality was the enemy.
Wow. The Peace Corps?
Yeah. I ship out tomorrow-- two years.
You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do.
To those people, I say, "Is it?"
And usually they say, "Yes, it is."
Barney, they are so right.
I wish there was something I could do.
Oh, Tanya...
I'm so glad you said that.
This wasn't how I'd thought the night would turn out.
This was finally supposed to be my big moment with Robin.
But then reality came along.
Robin got called up last-minute to anchor the 11:00 news.
It was her big break.
And I went to the wedding stag.
Then, when I least expected it...
Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night?
I had the most amazing night ever.
Tell me about it. That cake. Best cake I ever had.
Seriously. My stomach was, like,
"Hey, bro, I don't know what you're eating, 'cause I don't have any eyes,
but it's basically awesome, so keep sending it down Gullet Alley."
Yeah, I know.
My stomach was, like, "Girlfriend, we don't always get along, but that cake..."
Lily.
Oh, right. "Most amazing night ever," and go.
You know, I should tell you, I have a rule.
I never hook up at weddings.
I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule.
Well, here's the thing, those big romantic moments,
they're great when they happen, but they're not real.
Exactly, exactly-- like-like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there,
I'm not gonna lie to you, big-time thunderbolt.
Mm. You should see me tap dance.
You'd be down on bended knee.
Sadly not out of character.
But I know now it's just a mirage.
Wedding goggles.
Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you.
This isn't the moves?
What, you... you think this is the moves?
Believe me, you'd know the moves.
People ten tables away would know the moves.
Oh, that's too bad.
Tell me about it.
You know, I think... I have a solution.
Interested.
And to preface this, we're not gonna sleep together tonight.
Less interested.
Go ahead.
Okay.
So the thing that always screws it up is the next day.
Right? So...
Why don't we just cut that part out?
What are you saying?
I'm saying, I'm here, you're here, this is a big romantic wedding--
why don't we just dance and have a great time,
and then when it's over, never see each other again.
- Unless...
- No. No unless.
No e-mails, no phone numbers, not even names.
Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished.
And then... when we're old and gray,
we'll look back on this night
and it'll be perfect.
Wow.
- Okay, I'm in.
- Okay.
I guess, uh, what, we'll need fake names?
Um... you can call me Buttercup.
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.
I'm... Lando Calrissian.
Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...
Ted, Ted, Ted. Look, I got a bridesmaid.
Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid.
Ted, look. See ya, Ted.
So, I'm Ted.
Victoria.
- But no last names.
- No last names.
Oh, what is wrong with you?
Dude, that is just, like... a weenie-ass idea.
No, it was awesome-- I had a great night,
I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it.
Ted, how do I explain this to you?
Last night I ate the best cake of my life.
Now, you think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life?
Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake,
and then I'm gonna get some more cake.
That cake really got to you, huh?
It haunts me.
So, what happened next?
Okay.
Ground rules have been established.
Now let's see some of these moves I've heard so much about.
Wait,  wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let's do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet.
Yes, but we'll need... a diversion.
- Kiss!
- Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
So  that's what happened to the bouquet.
You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition.
You're not gonna do it at your wedding?
Hell, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower-grenade and chuck it into the crowd
and scream, "Crawl for it, bitches!"
That's just what girls do.
So, where'd you guys go?
Very nice.
Yeah?
Okay, I don't really know how to tap dance.
I couldn't tell. Really.
Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight.
Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.
No, you couldn't.
You're a dude.
- I could get some.
- You could totally get some.
We're not gonna kiss tonight.
If-if we kiss, all of this becomes real.
You-you might use too much tongue.
I might not use enough. And then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.
I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.
Okay, how about this?
The best part of any first kiss is the lead-up to it.
The moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll.
So... how about tonight, we just stick with the drumroll?
Okay.
But we can't kiss.
Okay.
A drumroll?
That's it?
So, what, you just... you said good night, came home and...
performed a drum solo?
Oh, Ted, you're such a doof!
I mean, this girl sounds amazing.
She was completely amazing.
She was amazing and funny, and we connected on every level,
and I'm never gonna see her again.
Damn it, I have to see her again!
- Yes!
- Yes!
So let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her?
Nothing. Her name's Victoria-- that's all I got.
Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.
Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon.
She'll be back in two weeks-- call her then.
Yes, two weeks. Good idea.
I'm calling her now.
No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon.
Yeah, come on, dude.
Ask her about the cake.
Ted?
Hey, Claudia! Great wedding, beautiful toast, touching stuff.
How's the honeymoon? Listen, I'm calling because last night I met this girl,
and I was wondering if you had...
Oh, you have got to be freaking kidding me!
Aw, here we go.
24 hours ago, you were begging... begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding,
and now, well, uh, you're over her?
I've moved on?
What was her name?
Is it my fat cousin Lindsay?
Don't be embarrassed-- she has pretty eyes.
Uh, no. Her name was Victoria. I don't know her last name.
Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards.
Thank God.
Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding. Good-bye, Ted.
There was no Victoria at the wedding.
Maybe she used a second fake name.
Oh, she's good, she's very good.
Maybe she was ghost.
That's why she didn't want to kiss you--
because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second.
Oh, my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.
Marshall... she was not a ghost!
I know that she wasn't a ghost.
She picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.
Wait-wait! She was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids.
She must've been at their table. Maybe they know who she was.
Great. So how do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?
This better be good-- I am about to enter Nirvana.
By the way, I should get you Nirvana's phone number. She gives a great massage.
Say what?!
- Barney!
- Ow!
I know the house rules. Es un chiste!
Listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night.
Did you happen to get her phone number?
You know I did.
Great! Um, I'm gonna need you to call her for me.
You know I won't.
Why not?
Because  we just hooked up last night.
I can't call the girl the next day.
I have to wait at least, like... forever.
Oh, snap! Never gonna call her.
Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.
Oh, come on, Barney, it's for a good cause.
Uh,  Ted going all castrati over yet another girl is exactly not a good cause.
Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you-- my hands are tied.
Oh, no, wait-- that was last night.
Okay, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
You make this call and I will go with you...
to Foxy Boxing.
- Really?
- Yeah.
But you always said the Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy not good at boxing.
I'm ready to be proven wrong.
- Tonight?
- Tonight.
Dial.
Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps till tomorrow.
Yeah, I know. It sucks.
Just one fewer day I get to help people.
Anyway, this girl-- any idea who she was?
Hold on.
What kind of shoes was sh... No, Tanya, he's a dude.
He's not going to know what kind of shoes she was wearing.
Actually...
Oh, come on.
Hey!
So what do you want to do next?
Don't think. First thing that comes into your mind.
Hold... this...
and this...
Whoa!
There she goes.
Apparently she was wearing brown shoes...
...with little snowflakes on them.
Yeah, they do sound cute.
Any idea who...?
Okay. Well, thanks anyway.
Yeah, you take ca...
What's...?
Tonight?
Well, I'm shipping out pretty early, so I won't be able to stay over,
but, yeah, sure, I'd love to.
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make Foxy Boxing tonight.
I understand.
Okay, uh, let's not lose hope.
We'll call the hotel. Maybe she was staying there.
We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria.
Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...
Or Ictor.
She probably doesn't go by "Ictor."
No, you know what?
This is fate.
I am never supposed to see this girl again.
That was the whole point of the night.
I have just been saved from myself.
Let's drink many beers.
Agreed.
And I thought that was the end of it.
But then...
Hey! There's the anchor lady!
How was it?
Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor?
Robin? Thanks, Robin! It was awesome. Back to you, Robin.
Congrats! That's so cool!
Yeah,  I felt really bad bailing on Ted, though.
Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...
And then Lily told her the whole story,
right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them.
And by the end of it...
What?
I know who she is.
You know who she is? But you weren't even at the wedding.
Actually, I kind of... was.
What?
Well, after the newscast, I was so excited
I decided to surprise Ted  by going to the reception.
Oh, damn it!
Oh, stop it!
What the hell!
Hello?
You okay in there?
Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Um...
Just allergies or something.
I'm fine.
Listen, do you... want to come and cry out here?
I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.
Oh, thanks.
But I don't actually cry in front of people or...
cry at all, for that matter.
Oh, man, it's gross.
Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?
Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter.
So, why are you crying?
Because you have feelings for Ted.
I don't know.
Maybe?
Okay, what is wrong with the two of you! Seriously!
He likes you and you like him. And j-j-just be together!
Cheese Louise! Happiness is not that difficult!
Look, okay, yes. I cried in the bathroom and that... was weird.
But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy.
The fact is, I-I don't know how I feel.
Yes, you do!
Seeing him with someone else and crying about it?
Guess what? That's how you feel.
That is nothing but how you feel.
Okay, fine. I have feelings for him.
Happy?
Kinda, yeah.
But it doesn't change anything.
I still don't want to get married and he's still... Ted.
What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he can be happy.
Or you could tell him that you're into him and then you could both be happy.
I'm going to go find him.
Well, wait.
Which one are you going to tell him?
I have no idea.
And here's the most amazing part--
Because I told her I'd converted all my money to India dollars,
she gave me 50 bucks to take a cab to the airport.
That's right. I just got paid for sex.
I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.
Hi, guys.
Hey.
Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Yeah, sure.
What's up?
Um... I, uh, I have to tell you something.
Oh...
Oh, just get it.
Hello?
Ted? It's Stuart.
My lovely bride would like to say something to you.
Ted... I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier.
My new husband, and the vodka cranberry,
which cost $10.50 at the freakin' airport bar...
When is this plane going to board?!
Sweet pea?
...have  helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person,
and I don't want my new husband to think I'm a crazy person.
It's fine, Claudia, don't worry about it.
Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.
The cake?
Why don't you take this?
Sounds like you could use it.
Thanks.
You're very sweet.
So are you a friend of the bride or groom?
We got it at this little bakery downtown.
Actually neither.
It's called the Buttercup Bakery.
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.
I made the cake.
She made the cake.
She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest.
She made the cake.
She made that cake? Ted, this is the girl.
You got to marry her. Today.
She has to move in with us.
I'm going down to that bakery.
No, no. Don't do it.
Baby, what are you talking about?!
Yeah, all day long you been busting my apple-bag about finding this girl.
Well, I-I just think that... that maybe she's not that into you.
And-and that's why she didn't give you her number.
Robin?
Care to chime in with anything?
Yes.
Ted...
Go get her.
Going. Getting.
Ted, oh, my, gosh, I love this moment. You know why?
'Cause I'm going to say it, and this time, you're actually going to say yes.
You ready? You ready to say yes?
Ted, suit up.
Yes!
No.
Oh, come on!
Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.
Oh, that's too bad.
I was looking forward to one last dance.
Well, yes, I am.
Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.
Wow, what was I just thinking?
"Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux."
- You got me. You are good.
- Yeah. Mmm.
You know, I don't look like this every day.
On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.
Mmm. The real Ted sounds real sexy.
Too bad I'll never get to see it.
Buttercup Bakery. This is it.
Good luck, dude.
Grab me a cupcake.
Ted? You still with us?
Tell me your last name.
You know there's one little flaw in our plan.
What's that?
I'm going to go home tonight with a lot of great memories
and one really sucky memory.
The memory of you walking out that door.
Hey, Ted.
Yeah?
Close your eyes...
and count to five.
One...
two...
three...
four...
five.
And to our dying days we'll remember everything about that night as perfect.
Maybe we both need that.
I mean, so many things go wrong in life
but this is the one thing that never will.
It will always...
always be pure unadulterated awesome.
And if I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us...
The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going.
Oh, thank God.

<i>Le début d'une relation donne lieu
à beaucoup de premières fois:</i>
<i>Le premier baiser,</i>
<i>la première nuit,</i>
<i>la première fin de semaine.</i>
<i>En 48 heures, j'ai connu
toutes ces premières fois avec Victoria.</i>
Ils devraient sortir bientôt. C'est lundi.
Penses-tu qu'ils sont là depuis le début ?
J'ignore si je dois être fière ou inquiète.
Ils ne sont peut-être pas là.
- Bonjour.
- Salut.
- Je vais ignorer ça.
- Merci.
- J'aimerais que tu restes.
- Je sais. Moi, aussi.
Je dois aller travailler et tu as ta réunion.
- Je t'appelle après ?
- Je t'enverrai un message pendant.
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir.
- Oh, Victoria. Tu es ici...
Toodle-oo !
Deux jours de suite !
Ta chambre doit sentir la cage à singes.
Dis-nous combien. Lily a dit huit,
mais je sais que c'est plus de dix !
Zéro.
- Quoi ?
- Quoi ?
On vient de se rencontrer.
On a tous les deux déjà fait l'erreur
d'être trop rapides.
On a discuté et on a décidé
de prendre notre temps.
- C'est son idée.
- Entièrement son idée !
Mais je sais pas. J'aime bien cette fille.
Et je suis prêt à prendre le temps
qu'il faut pour que ça marche.
3 semaines plus tard
Je ne me sens pas bien.
Comme si mes testicules mélangeaient
des "pop rocks" et du soda.
C'est ridicule de te faire attendre un mois.
Je n'en serais pas capable.
Tu n'as couché qu'avec une seule fille.
Cassé !
Ted, la seule raison pour attendre un mois,
c'est si la fille a 17 ans et 11 mois.
Bonnes nouvelles,
je ne couvre pas l'événement félin.
Qui veut sortir demain soir ?
Oh, je ne peux pas.
J'emmène Victoria souper.
On ne peut pas.
C'est notre 9e anniversaire.
Bravo ! Neuf ans ?
Votre relation dure depuis la 4ème.
- Félicitations.
- Merci.
On va à Berkshire
pour le Festival du sirop d'érable.
<i>Selon le magazine New York, c'est l'un
des endroits les plus romantiques.</i>
Qui dit que sexuel ne rime pas
avec raisonnable ?
Bon, je crois qu'il ne reste
que toi et moi.
Vraiment ?
En fait, je parlais à mon Martini.
- Prête ?
- Oui.
- Prête ?
- Oui.
Rien de mieux
qu'une fin de semaine dans une auberge.
Oui. Se lever à 7h pile pour le déjeuner.
Féliciter les propriétaires
pour leur collection d'artisanat.
Converser gauchement avec des couples
qui essaient de sauver leur mariage.
On ferait mieux de partir.
C'est un trajet de quatre heures.
On annonce de la pluie ce soir.
- On pourrait rester ici.
- Et regarder la télé ?
- Se commander du chinois.
- Au Jardin de Sichouan.
- On annule ?
- Oui.
Parfait, mon sac était vide.
Je parie 100 $ que lorsque
tu te retourneras, je dirai: "Super !"
C'est la troisième fois
que tu me dragues par hasard !
C'est ça qui arrive
quand on choisit à l'aveuglette.
C'est une manoeuvre qui se fait à deux.
Ted me signale si la cible est sexy.
Mais Ted est occupé
par sa relation avec une lesbienne.
Regarde le reflet des filles
dans le miroir du bar.
Tu ne peux pas...
Hé ! Pourquoi c'est si long ?
- J'y vais.
- Pas si vite, Scherbatsky.
J'aime ta façon de penser.
Cette histoire de miroir,
c'est simple, élégant.
D'accord, voici une offre
d'une durée limitée.
J'ai besoin d'un complice
pour mes sorties en ville.
Aimerais-tu être ma complice ?
C'est tentant,
mais je suis avec une amie
qui s'est fait larguer.
Elle a besoin de soutien ou de la langue
d'un inconnu dans sa bouche.
On dirait que ça marche.
D'accord ! Je suis partante.
Encore une semaine, et ça fera un mois.
Vraiment, es-tu certaine ? Ça m'a échappé.
Oh, allez !
Le 18 est encore trop loin.
Attends, le 18 ?
Oh, merde ! J'avais complètement oublié.
Je serai absente le 18.
Eh bien, on attendra que tu reviennes.
Le but était de ne rien brusquer.
Oui. Ou on pourrait le faire ce soir.
75e et Amsterdam.
Je suis contente qu'on ait décidé
de rester à la maison.
Je sais. Imagine si on était partis.
On arriverait à cette heure,
fatigués et fourbus.
Et on se sentirait obligés
de s'envoyer en l'air.
Oui, à 89 $ la nuit, on le ferait.
J'aimerais porter un toast
au plus génial de tous les anniversaires.
C'est bien que tu ailles bientôt
chez tes parents.
Je suis si contente
que tes colocs soient absents.
- Oh, mon Dieu ! Que font-ils ici ?
- Ils pensent qu'on n'est pas là.
C'est le grand soir pour Ted !
Mais on est restés.
On est dans la salle de bains.
Ils ne le savent pas.
On n'a qu'à rester cachés
jusqu'à ce que Ted traîne son joujou
dans la chambre.
Je ne veux pas me cacher ici.
Chérie, Ted devenait fou
à attendre ce moment.
Si on sort et qu'on brise cet instant,
c'est foutu.
Et l'un de nous deux devra coucher
avec Ted,
et ce ne sera pas moi.
Bon, d'accord.
Je vais utiliser le fil dentaire.
Tu es en costume !
Tant qu'à le faire, faisons-le correctement.
Emilio, la dame prendra...
Je prendrai un Johnnie Walker Blue, sec,
et un Montecristo No 2. Merci.
Le No 2.
Aussi connu sous le nom de Torpedo.
Ou, comme le disent les experts, Piramide.
Mon père était un amateur de cigares.
C'était la seule manière de l'intéresser.
Les enjeux du père. Sexy.
Je sais. J'ai passé à ça de finir prostituée.
J'aurais préféré ça.
Mais je me contenterai de complice.
Surtout que Ted est avec Victoria
et qu'il ne peut pas boire.
Il est enceinte. C'est lui la fille.
Voyons. Ted ne peut pas être enceinte.
Il faut coucher avec quelqu'un pour ça.
Bien dit ! On ne bouge plus, tape là !
Ce moment est parfait.
Ce moment est parfait.
- J'aimerais que le temps s'arrête à jamais.
- Non.
La beauté de l'instant,
c'est qu'il est fuyant.
Sa vraie nature est
de couler entre nos doigts.
C'est ce qui le rend encore plus précieux.
Foutaise.
C'est mauvais comme un magazine
de l'école secondaire !
Sans être sous l'influence de la drogue.
Et ça marche.
Oui, très lentement. Allez, faites-le.
Ça fait 45 minutes.
On l'aurait fait au moins trois fois.
- Oui, et cinq !
- Tape là.
On devrait peut-être sortir de là.
Pas question ! On ne peut pas faire ça.
Ils sauront qu'on était
dans la salle de bains tout ce temps.
- Ça fera bizarre.
- Bien.
Si on est coincés ici,
je vais monter le volume.
Je veux te connaître,
connaître ton âme.
Ted, qu'est-ce qui te fait pleurer ?
Chéri, peux-tu tenir mes cheveux ?
Je vais vomir.
Que faites-vous, toi et Ted,
après le bar à cigares ?
Tu veux rire ? Ted n'est jamais venu ici.
Tu es déjà allée plus loin que lui.
- Bien que...
- Quoi ?
Il y a une chose qu'on pourrait faire.
Si tu es prête.
J'ignorais que le jeu laser existait encore.
Profites-en
avant qu'il redevienne populaire.
- Je lui donne deux mois.
- Sûr. C'est génial !
D'accord, suis-moi, baisse-toi,
et ne sous-estime jamais
un gamin de 12 ans avec...
Scherbatsky ! Concentre-toi !
- Tu m'as sauvé la vie ?
- Tu me remercieras plus tard.
Bougeons. L'ennemi est partout.
Il la regarde dans les yeux !
On s'aimait de façon
encore plus écoeurante
que Ted et Victoria.
Regarde-nous, à présent.
Maintenant, on se moque d'eux.
C'est le cercle de la vie.
Je suis sérieuse, Marshall.
On n'a même pas trouvé la motivation
pour faire ce voyage.
Et là, on célèbre notre anniversaire
dans la salle de bains.
Ce n'est pas juste de se comparer
à Ted et à Victoria.
C'est leur première fois.
Oui, mais on pourrait quand même
être plus romantiques.
Maintenant, tu me dis: "Tu veux le faire",
et je dis: "Oui."
- Tu veux...
- Non !
Le temps des premières fois est révolu.
On dirait que le leur approche.
Et si on continuais dans la chambre ?
- Oui !
- Oui !
Oui.
- Oui !
- Oui !
Non ! Ne réponds pas.
Tu peux répondre. On a toute la nuit.
- Tu réponds ? Il répond !
- Non ! Prends-la ! Tout de suite !
Non. Bonne chance.
Désolé.
Encore un peu de vin ?
- Je vais chercher une autre bouteille.
- D'accord.
Il me faut un verre.
On a du sirop contre la toux ?
- C'est une embuscade !
- Oh, mon Dieu !
Ces gamins nous entourent !
J'en ai compté neuf, peut-être dix.
Je vais te couvrir.
On laisse personne derrière.
Tout le monde sort
ou tout le monde reste.
- Mais, je...
- Ne joue pas au héros, Scherbatsky !
On se revoit de l'autre côté.
Maman !
Merde. On va manger un bretzel ?
- Oui.
- D'accord.
Marshall, que nous arrive-t-il ?
On passait des soirées
à se regarder dans les yeux.
A-t-on perdu ça ?
Peut-être.
Mais je pense l'avoir retrouvé.
Juste ici.
Chérie, je te donne un regard provocant
avec mes yeux qui en disent long.
Prépare-toi pour mon regard à rayon xxx.
Es-tu passé chez le nettoyeur ?
- Oh, merde !
- Ça va.
- On va y arriver.
- Prenons-nous les mains.
C'est bien.
Oui.
Tu aimes ce geste !
C'est un classique à la Marshall.
Super. On n'a vraiment pas le tour.
Il faut qu'on sorte d'ici !
On ne peut pas.
J'ai besoin de faire une chose.
Et si je le fais devant toi,
ça va changer toute notre relation.
- Quoi ?
- Je dois faire pipi.
Ça va mal.
On a passé neuf ans sans pisser
devant l'autre.
On pense toujours
qu'on aura plus de temps.
Regarde-nous.
On est comme un vieux couple
et on n'est même pas encore mariés.
La flamme de notre amour vacille
et si je pisse dessus,
elle pourrait s'éteindre à jamais !
Combien de temps peux-tu te retenir ?
<i>J'ai bu un Mountain Dew
pendant le marathon Quantum Leap.</i>
Oh, merde.
Ce jeu de laser m'a rappelé mon enfance.
Tu sais quel jeu me manque ? La bataille
navale. Je n'ai jamais perdu une partie.
- Moi non plus. Bien sûr, je triche.
- Oh, oui. Moi aussi.
Le truc est de plier le porte-avions en L.
J'empile les navires les uns sur les autres.
C'est bien !
On devrait faire un tournoi de tricheurs.
Je pense que j'ai encore un...
À vous. Cible en vue.
Poupée près du juke-box.
Bien vue, Scherbatsky.
J'en ai un pour toi aussi. À deux heures.
Chemise bleue.
C'est une femme.
Oh, autant pour moi.
 Vraiment ?
- Concentrons-nous sur ta cible.
- Exact.
Attends. J'y vais.
Oh, mon Dieu ! J'aime ton jeans !
Est-ce un bar de lesbiennes ?
Car la fille avec la chemise bleue...
Oh, non. J'aime les hommes.
Bien que le choix soit restreint ce soir.
Le seul gars sexy est celui en costume,
et il n'est pas facile à séduire.
Vraiment ? Car il me fait les yeux doux.
C'est sûrement le jeans.
Le jeans ne t'emmènera pas plus loin.
Je rentre avec lui.
On verra bien.
Oh, mon Dieu, que je déteste Ted !
Je le déteste tellement !
Chérie, laisse-toi aller.
Des tonnes de couples l'ont déjà fait.
Je sais, mais pas nous
parce que je veux garder
un peu de mystère.
- Tu as déjà pété devant moi.
- Oui, mais je toussais pour masquer.
Tu le fais chaque fois.
- Salut.
- Salut.
On s'en va. Allons ailleurs.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Parfois, j'aime remettre ma prise à l'eau.
- Mais pourquoi ?
- On ne laisse personne derrière.
Tout le monde marque
ou personne ne marque.
Bien dit.
- Que dis-tu d'une bataille navale ?
- Touché !
Ted, je ne peux plus attendre.
- On va à la chambre ?
- Pas le temps.
Ils se sont léché les doigts
pendant une heure,
mais ils n'ont pas le temps
de se rendre à la chambre ?
Chéri, je ne peux plus me retenir !
C'est l'heure !
Je sais.
- Je t'aime, Marshall.
- Je t'aime, Lily.
Nous y sommes.
Tu sais Barney, je me suis bien amusée
à jouer la complice ce soir.
Tu es une bonne complice.
Tu es une meilleure Ted que Ted.
Tu es invitée à l'enterrement
de vie de garçon de Marshall.
Et tu n'es pas obligée de sortir du gâteau.
Merci. Et merci pour la compagnie.
J'espère que tu es prêt
pour une partie musclée.
Venez, les amis.
"Musclée" ?
C'est mon unique façon de jouer.
Oh, je l'ai trouvé. Tu es prêt à...
Qu'est-ce que tu fais, bon sang ?
J'enfile mon habit de naissance.
Désolé. Tu voulais me déshabiller ?
Non ! Je pensais
qu'on était sortis en amis !
Oh, voyons !
Tu as flirté avec moi toute la soirée !
Quoi ? J'ai fait le contraire !
J'ai cherché des filles pour toi !
Tu m'as invité chez toi
"pour jouer à bataille navale" !
N'est-ce pas un code mondialement connu
pour le sexe ?
Non !
Super.
J'espère que tu es contente.
Tu as coulé mon bateau.
Je vais bien. Et toi ?
Je me sens pareil.
Mais étrangement différent.
Je suis contente pour ma vessie,
mais triste pour nous.
Fallait que tu le fasses, chérie. Pour Ted.
Au moins, on pourra rester ici
le temps qu'il faut.
Il fallait que notre couple souffre
afin qu'un autre prenne vie.
Oh, merde !
Ils ont dû l'entendre.
Je pense qu'on peut sortir, maintenant.
Ça alors, ils sont partis.
Parfait. Faut que j'aille pisser.
D'accord. Toi et moi ? C'est absurde.
Si tu y as pensé une seule seconde...
Je n'y ai pensé que trois secondes,
et ça avait bien du sens.
On pense que le mariage est ennuyant,
on veut s'amuser et on s'entend très bien.
C'est vrai que ça a du sens.
- Et Ted ?
- J'ai vérifié auprès de Ted.
Salut, Ted.
Vu que ça va entre Victoria et toi,
les autres filles
ne doivent plus t'intéresser ?
Je présume que c'est non, donc,
si je couchais avec une fille, disons Robin,
- ça ne te dérangerait pas ?
- Non. Bonne chance.
On a sa bénédiction.
- Vraiment ?
- Vraiment.
Ça ne dérange pas Ted
que tu essaies de coucher avec moi ?
Pas du tout.
- Quoi ?
- Tu aimes Ted !
- Je n'ai pas dit ça, je...
- Tu aimes Ted !
Super ! C'est énorme.
Barney, je n'aime pas Ted.
Il fait son chemin, et je suis contente...
Oui, oui. On fait une partie
de bataille navale ou non ?
Tu ne le lui diras pas, n'est-ce pas ?
Non.
C'est le code du complice:
Ne pas dire à un complice qu'un troisième
complice lui plaît.
Tout comme le troisième complice
ne dit pas
que le premier complice s'est retrouvé nu
devant elle.
C'est la complicité.
A7.
- Manqué.
- Bien sûr.
Il reste toujours une limite entre nous.
La deuxième commission.
Ca ne me met pas plus à l'aise.
Mais c'était une première.
Mais oui !
- On a encore des premières.
- Bien sûr.
Tu sais quoi ? Ça nous a rapprochés.
Je veux te connaître,
connaître ton âme.
Marshall, qu'est-ce qui te fait pleurer ?
Cet instant m'échappe,
car il est pourchassé par un autre.
Oh, cramponne-toi à mes seins !
Voyons, vous autres.
Prenez une chambre.
When you meet someone special,
suddenly life is full of firsts.
The first kiss.
The first night together.
The first weekend together.
For me, all those firsts happened within 48 hours of meeting Victoria.
They have to come out soon, it's Monday.
Do you think they've been in there the whole time?
I don't know whether to be proud or concerned.
Maybe they're not even in there.
Good morning.
Hey, guys.
I'm just going to ignore that.
Thank you!
I wish you could stay.
I know, me, too.
But I have to go to work, and you have that meeting.
Call you afterwards?
I'll inappropriately text you during.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Oh, Victoria, you're here...
Toot-a-loo!
Bye.
Two days straight?!
Wow, your room must smell like a monkey cage!
Come on, give us a number. Lily guessed eight,
but I know my boy got to double digits.
Zero.
- What?
- What?
Guys, we just met.
And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick,
so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow.
- Her idea.
- Totally her idea!
But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl,
and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on.
I don't feel so good.
It's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda.
I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month.
I would never put up with that.
You've only had sex with one girl in your whole life.
Burn!
Ted, the only reason to wait a month for sex is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.
Good news: I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night.
Who's up for hanging out?
Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.
No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary.
Wow, nine years?
Your relationship's a fourth grader.
Congrats.
Thanks.
We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest.
It's one of New York Magazine's "Top five romantic getaways on a budget."
Who says sexual can't be sensible?
Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me.
Really?
Actually, I was talking to my martini.
Ready to go?
Hell, yeah.
Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast.
Yeah. Waking up for breakfast at 7:00 A.M.
Sharp.
Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese.
Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce.
Yeah, well, we'd better get going, it's like a four-hour drive.
And it's supposed to rain tonight.
- Or we could just stay home.
- Maybe watch some TV.
- Order in some Chinese.
- Oh, Sichuan Garden!
- Are we really bailing?
- Hell, yeah.
Good, cause this thing's empty.
Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say "wow."
Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident.
It's one of the many risks of the blind approach.
It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot.
But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.
Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?
You can't just...
Wow!
Hey?
What's taking so long?
I have to go.
Not so fast, Scherbotsky.
I like the way you think.
That mirror thing.
Simple. Elegant.
Okay, limited-time offer:
I need a "bro" for my bro-ings on about town.
How would you like to be said bro?
Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped.
She really needs some support...
or a stranger's tongue down her throat.
That seems healthy.
All right.
Guess I'm in.
So... one more week and it'll be a month.
Really? Are you sure?
Wow, that snuck up on me.
Oh, come on.
The 18th can't get here fast enough.
Wait, the 18th?
Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this-- I'm going to be out of town on the 18th!
O h.
Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back.
I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this.
Yeah.
Or we could do it tonight.
75th and Amsterdam.
I'm  so glad we decided to just stay home.
Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone?
We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky.
And yet we'd feel obligated to have sex.
Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it.
I would like to propose a toast.
To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever.
I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.
I'm so glad your roommates are out of town.
Oh, my God, what are they doing home?
They think we went away.
Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted.
But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom.
They don't know that.
All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.
But I don't want to hide out in here.
Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this.
If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen.
Then one of us is going to have to have sex with Ted, and...
not going to be me.
Okay, fine.
I guess I'll actually floss.
You suited up!
Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.
Emilio? The woman will have...
I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2
Thanks.
Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. "The Torpedo."
Or, as the rollers call it, "Piramide."
My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.
Father issues.
Hot.
I know-- I was this close to being a huge slut.
Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro.
Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink.
Because he's pregnant.
Cause he's the girl.
Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant.
You need to have sex to get pregnant.
What up!
Freeze frame high five!
I think this may be a perfect moment.
I wish we could hold onto it forever.
No.
Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting.
By its very nature, it...
slips through our fingers...
making it that much more precious.
Ugh, that is bad.
That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad.
And they're not even high.
It's actually working.
Yeah, smooth but slowly.
God, close the deal, already.
It's been, like, 45 minutes-- we could have had sex three times by now.
- Yeah, try five.
- What up!
Maybe we should just go out there.
No way! We can't go out there now.
They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time.
It'll be too weird.
Fine.
But if we're stuck in here...
I'm turning up the volume.
Shh. Shh.
I want to know you.
Like, know your soul.
Ted, what makes you cry?
Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl.
So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?
Are you kidding?
Ted's never been here.
You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did.
Still...
What?
There is one other thing we could do.
If you're up for it.
Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!
Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again.
I give it two months.
Oh, I believe it-- this is awesome!
Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a...
Scherbotsky, you have to focus!
You just saved my life, didn't you?
Thank me later.
Let's keep moving.
These little bastards are everywhere.
He's just staring into her eyes.
I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria.
Now look at us.
Yeah...  now we just make fun of people like that.
It's the circle of life.
No, I'm serious, Marshall.
I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip.
And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom.
Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria.
This  is their first time.
Yeah, but we could still have some more romance.
Now, you just say, "Want to do it?" And I say, "Yeah."
- Want to...
- No!
Maybe we're just out of firsts.
Looks like they're about to have theirs.
Should we take this to the bedroom?
- Yes!
- Yes!
Yes.
- Yes!
- Yes!
No. No, don't answer it!
You can answer it.
We have all night.
You're answering it? He's answering it!
No! Do her! Do her now!
Sure. Good luck with that.
Sorry about that.
How about a little more wine?
I'll get another bottle.
I need a drink.
Do we have any cough syrup in here?
Shh...
Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded.
I counted nine, maybe ten.
I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.
No. Leave no man behind.
Either we all get out of here or no one does.
- But I...
- Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.
See you on the other side.
Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Marshall, what happened to us?
We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long.
Have we lost that?
Maybe.
But I think I just found it.
Right here.
Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes.
Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision.
Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning?
- Oh, damn it.
- It's all right. We can do this.
Let's just hold hands.
This is nice.
You love that move. It's a classic Marshall.
All right, we totally suck at this.
We really, really need to get out of here.
Well, we can't.
Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you,
it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.
What is it?
I have to pee.
- This is bad.
- Yeah.
We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other.
You always think there'll be more time.
Look at us.
We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet.
The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it,
it might go out forever.
How much longer do you think you can hold it?
I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.
Oh,  boy.
Playing laser tag really takes me back.
You know what game I really miss? Battleship.
I've never lost a game.
Neither have I.
Of course I cheat.
Oh, yeah, me, too.
The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.
Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.
Nice.
You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match.
I think I still have a...
Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.
Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky.
I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.
That's a woman.
Oh, my mistake.
Or is it?
Let's just focus on your target.
Right.
Yeah, I got this one.
Oh, my God. I love your jeans.
Okay. Is this a lesbian bar?
Because that girl with the blue shirt just...
Oh, no. I am all about the dudes.
Although pickings are pretty slim tonight.
Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get.
Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now.
Must be the jeans.
Well, jeans will only get you so far.
I'm going home with him.
We'll see about that.
Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much.
Baby, why don't you just go?
Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other.
No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive.
Well, you have farted in front of me.
Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.
You always do.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.
What happened?
Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.
But why?
Leave no man behind.
Either we all score or no one scores.
Right on.
Hey, you want to go play Battleship?
Hit!
Ted, I can't wait any longer.
Should we move to the bedroom?
There's no time for that.
They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour,
but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?
Baby, I can't hold it in any longer.
It's time.
I know.
I love you, Marshall.
I love you, Lily.
You know, Barney, I had a surprisingly good time bro-ing out tonight.
Well, you make a good bro.
You're a better Ted than Ted.
Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party.
And you don't even have to come out of the cake.
Thanks.
And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight.
I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship.
Come on, boys.
Hard-core?
That's the only way I play.
I found it. Are you ready to...
What the hell are you doing?
I'm birthday suiting up.
I'm sorry, did you want to undress me?
No!  I thought we were just hanging out as friends.
Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.
What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.
You invited me up to your apartment to "play Battleship."
Is that not an internationally recognized term for sex?
No.
Great.
I hope you're happy.
You sunk my battleship.
I'm okay.
You okay?
I feel the same.
And yet, strangely different.
I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us.
You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted.
And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes.
Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit
so a new one out there could blossom.
Oh, crap!
They must have heard that.
Well, I guess we can come out now.
I don't believe it. They're gone.
Good.
'Cause I got to take a whiz.
Okay, you and me, that's insane.
If you even thought about it for one second...
But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense.
We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag.
We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.
Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense.
But what about Ted?
I checked with Ted.
Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well,
I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right?
I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin,
you'd be cool with that, right?
Sure. Good luck with that.
Totally gave us his blessing.
Really?
Really.
So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?
Didn't care at all.
Oh.
Oh...
What?
You like Ted.
I didn't say I liked Ted.
You like Ted.
Wow.
This is huge.
Barney, I don't like Ted.
He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...
Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?
You're not gonna tell him, are you?
No.
That's the bro code.
A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him.
Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro
that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her.
It's quid pro bro.
- A-7.
- Miss.
Of course.
Well, we still have one frontier left.
Still got the deuce.
Not making me feel better.
Well, it certainly was a first.
It was, wasn't it?
We still have firsts.
Of course we do.
And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now.
I want to know you.
Like, know your soul.
Marshall, what makes you cry?
This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment.
Oh, just grab my boob already.
Come on, guys, get a room.

<i>Les enfants, vous ne savez peut-ętre pas</i>
<i>que votre oncle Marshall est doué
pour les jeux.</i>
<i>Il est imbattable.</i>
Gin !
Yahtzee !
Poker !
On ne crie pas "poker"
quand on gagne au poker.
Je le sais. Mais ça m'amuse.
<i>On s'est tous entendus:</i>
<i>Marshall devait gérer nos soirées de jeux</i>
<i>et non pas y participer.</i>
<i>C'est ainsi qu'il a décidé
d'inventer son propre jeu.</i>
Ça s'appelle "Marshjacquet".
Ça combine les meilleurs jeux,
comme Candyland, l Never, Pictionary.
- Et le jacquet, bien entendu.
- Non.
C'est nul, le jacquet.
J'ai pris seulement
les bonnes parties du jacquet
et j'ai mis le reste aux poubelles,
bien comme il faut.
Je suis heureuse
que Victoria vienne nous joindre.
Je vais nous chercher ŕ boire.
Bon. Voici les rčglements
pour ce soir, Barney.
J'aime bien Victoria. Beaucoup.
Alors, ne dis rien qui... Ne dis rien.
Et je n'ai pas vraiment dit ŕ Victoria
que j'aimais Robin, auparavant,
- alors essayons d'éviter...
- Eh bien. Voilŕ qui est insolite.
Tu veux que je fasse super attention
quand ta copine est lŕ,
mais tu lui mens depuis le tout début.
Pardon.
L'entrepôt des faces ?
C'est parfait.
Mon ami Ted a perdu la sienne.
Vous ne pouvez pas lui sauver la face ?
Merci quand męme.
Ted, tu ne penses pas que Victoria mérite
de savoir que tu voulais Robin ?
Je devrais raconter l'histoire du re-retour.
Non, tu m'as juré
que tu ne la répčterais jamais.
Ça sent le scandale.
C'est quoi, l'histoire du re-retour ?
Rien. Ce n'est rien.
Ŕ ce sujet, je peux compter sur vous
pour bien vous conduire avec Victoria ?
Nous ? Que ferait-on de mal ?
Vous avez toujours été
comme mes parents
dont j'ai voulu m'éloigner en venant ici.
Cependant, est-ce qu'on peut
laisser tomber l'interrogatoire
de la nouvelle copine, ce soir ?
- D'accord.
- D'accord.
Merci.
- Je devrais aider Robin.
- D'accord.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Ça ne te dérange pas de te tenir
avec Victoria, ce soir ?
Pas du tout. Elle est super.
Ŕ cause du fait que j'ai dit
que j'aimais bien Ted ?
Non. Victoria est super.
Elle est amusante, elle est libre d'esprit.
Elle est super.
J'ai trop dit "elle est super", c'est ça ?
Tu la détestes, cette pétasse.
Mais si on obtient un chiffre pair
aux alentours de la foręt de la Menthe,
on perd son "Marshall"
et on remet ses jetons dans la cagnotte.
Et n'oubliez pas,
si jamais vous posez la question "quoi ?",
il faut boire.
C'est beau ?
- Je n'ai rien compris.
- Je n'ai rien compris.
Bon, ça ira.
On commence. Vous saisirez.
Les nouveaux d'abord.
- Lance les dés.
- D'accord.
Tu as eu trois !
C'est la section "Autobiographie".
Tu dois répondre ŕ une question
d'ordre personnel sur ta vie amoureuse,
en toute honnęteté, pour continuer.
- Marshall, voyons.
- C'est elle qui a eu trois.
Victoria.
"As-tu déjŕ trompé un de tes copains ?"
Bonne question.
- Tu n'es pas obligée de répondre.
- Ça va.
Je vivais une relation pourrie
ŕ l'université,
et j'ai embrassé un autre gars ŕ une fęte.
Je m'en voulais, je l'ai dit ŕ mon copain,
et on a rompu.
Victoria, tu as répondu honnętement
et comme une adulte.
Tu peux passer
aux montagnes des Boules de Gomme.
Dis donc, Victoria,
es-tu re-retournée avec ton copain ?
- Quoi ?
- Tu as dit "quoi". Tu es obligée de boire.
Barney, en passant, je suis allée ŕ une fęte
dans le nouvel édifice sur la 82e Rue,
et l'hôtesse a dit qu'elle te connaît.
- Comment s'appelait-elle ? Sharon ?
- Shannon ?
Shannon. Oui.
Non. Je ne me souviens plus d'elle.
Vraiment ? Pourtant, elle m'a donné
une vidéo pour toi.
Elle est oů ?
Je vais la chercher.
Oui. D'accord. Quand tu veux.
D'accord. Robin, c'est ŕ toi.
Cinq ! Encore une "Autobiographie",
pour le joueur ŕ ta gauche,
c'est-ŕ-dire... Victoria !
Bien entendu.
Victoria.
"Combien de copains as-tu eus
avant de commencer ŕ sortir avec Ted ?"
Attends. C'est écrit "Ted" sur la carte ?
Si on parle de copains,
je crois que je n'en ai eu que deux.
Alerte aux prudes.
Je parle de mes copains sérieux.
J'ai fréquenté d'autres gars, aussi.
Alerte aux filles faciles !
Ah ! Super. La voilŕ.
Merci, Lily. Tu es gentille.
Ça alors.
Robin a atterri sur le marais au chocolat.
Cinq jetons.
Merci. Enfin, quelqu'un qui comprend
le Marshjacquet.
Barney, c'était quoi, cette vidéo ?
- Dommage. Tu ne le sauras jamais.
- Merde !
Si seulement je t'avais remis une fausse
vidéo puis gardé la vraie dans mon sac.
Un instant.
C'est exactement ce que j'ai fait.
- Quoi ?
- Tu dois boire.
Tu te comportais étrangement.
Ŕ la place, je t'ai donné la vidéo de
la remise du diplôme de Ted.
- On regarde la vidéo ?
- Donne-la-moi.
- Hé ! Hé !
- Ted.
- Mets-la !
- D'accord.
Je n'arrive pas ŕ croire...
<i>Shannon ! Je t'aime.</i>
<i>Je t'aime tant.</i>
<i>On était censés
changer le monde ensemble, non ?</i>
<i>Ne me dis pas que tu l'as oublié.
Je ne l'ai pas oublié, moi.</i>
- T'as essayé son cellulaire ?
- Oui, deux messages.
J'ai vérifié le club de cigares,
le Léopard lubrique. Il n'est nulle part.
Salut. Ça va ?
- Barney, tu étais oů ?
- Oui, on est vraiment désolés.
Oui, trčs désolés.
Sérieusement, c'est quoi,
l'histoire de la vidéo ?
- Non. Reste.
- Allez. Allez.
- Reste. Voyons.
- Je ne veux pas en parler.
C'est la plus gęnante et humiliante
des choses
qui me soit arrivée.
On a tous nos histoires gęnantes.
Ça fait du bien d'en parler.
Vraiment ?
Tu nous fais part de ton expérience
la plus humiliante, Marshall ?
Montre-moi que ça fait du bien.
D'accord.
<i>J'ai fait un tour ŕ l'école
pour voir Lily ŕ la maternelle,</i>
<i>mais c'était l'heure de la récréation.</i>
<i>J'avais vraiment envie, alors j'ai été
aux toilettes de la salle de cours.</i>
<i>C'était trop petit pour cibler.</i>
<i>Je me suis donc assis.</i>
<i>Je ne m'étais pas rendu compte
que c'était des toilettes partagées.</i>
<i>Si seulement j'avais remonté
mon pantalon.</i>
Les enfants le surnomment toujours
"Drôles de Fesses".
D'accord.
Je vais vous raconter mon histoire.
Croyez-le ou pas, je n'ai pas toujours été
aussi super que je le suis maintenant.
<i>C'était en 1998.
Je venais de terminer l'université</i>
<i>et je travaillais dans un café
avec ma copine.</i>
<i>Ma copine, Shannon.</i>
<i>Merci.</i>
Super.
- J'adore t'entendre chanter, Barney.
- Je t'adore, tout court, Shannon.
Le corps des volontaires de la paix
sera légendaire.
Je sais.
On sera au Nicaragua dans cinq semaines.
Un café latte sans matičres grasses,
pour emporter.
Belle commande, mon frčre,
belle commande.
C'est ta copine, mon gars ?
Tape m'en cinq.
Désolé, j'en donne que deux.
Peu importe. Tant que tu te la tapes.
"Tant que je me la tape ?"
Les femmes ne sont pas des objets.
Ce sont des ętres humains.
Et en passant,
Shannon et moi attendons d'ętre mariés.
Lisez donc mon magazine.
Toi avec les cheveux, observe.
Ouvre le tiroir de ta mémoire
et retiens ça:
Oublie les sentiments.
Si tu gagnes beaucoup d'argent, tu baises.
C'est tout.
Je te plains.
<i>Ŕ la prochaine, hombre.</i>
Les costumes-cravates...
<i>Cinq semaines plus tard,
on devait partir au corps des volontaires.</i>
<i>Cependant,</i>
<i>elle n'est jamais venue.</i>
- Elle n'est jamais venue ?
- Que s'est-il passé aprčs ?
Vous savez quoi ?
J'aurais pas dű vous en parler.
Et si quelqu'un d'autre racontait
son expérience la plus humiliante ?
Je sais comment décider
qui sera le prochain.
Tu as apporté ton jeu au bar ?
On joue malgré la longueur d'avance
de Ted.
J'étais en train de gagner ?
D'accord. C'est ŕ mon tour.
<i>Je signalais une nouvelle en direct
sur un conducteur de calčche.</i>
- L'histoire du crottin de cheval ?
- On la connaît tous.
D'accord, écoutez.
Je vais vous raconter
mon expérience la plus humiliante.
C'est ça, Victoria. Une fonceuse !
Ça nécessite une partie d'Action ou Vérité,
une bouteille en plastique souple
de sauce ŕ la guimauve
et le spa ŕ la maison de retraite
de mes grands-parents.
<i>Les enfants,
je vous raconte plein d'histoires</i>
<i>peu convenables, mais pas celle-ci.</i>
<i>Sachez qu'elle n'était pas trčs bonne.</i>
C'est la meilleure histoire
que j'aie entendue !
- Mon Dieu !
- Ça alors !
Victoria, ton histoire était digne... d'intéręt.
Ma saga se poursuit.
<i>Je suis retourné au café
pour trouver Shannon.</i>
- Barney !
- Mon toutou, oů étais-tu ?
Je suis désolée.
Mon pčre m'a interdit de partir.
Mais les Nicaraguayens ont besoin
de nous.
Mais je dépends toujours de mon pčre.
Il va revenir pour en discuter,
mais je crois
que tu devrais partir sans moi.
- Shannon, je ne...
- Barney.
C'est ton ręve.
Ce n'est que deux ans.
On y arrivera, j'en suis sűre.
<i>Et lorsque je suis parti,
j'ai compris que Shannon était une adulte.</i>
<i>Son pčre ne pouvait pas régenter sa vie.</i>
<i>Je devais retourner sur mes pas
et l'affronter.</i>
<i>Elle était en pleine discussion
avec son pčre.</i>
Quoi ?
On est tous obligés de boire.
Oh ! Mon Dieu ! Et aprčs ?
- Je ne sais pas, les amis...
- D'accord. D'accord.
- On a eu des biscuits de sa mčre.
- Lily, non ! Non !
C'est pour l'équipe, Marshall,
pour l'équipe.
Salut, Mme Eriksen. C'est Lily.
Merci beaucoup
pour les biscuits délicieux.
De la mayonnaise. Vraiment ?
Je n'aurais jamais deviné ça.
Oui, j'embrasserai Marshall de votre part,
sans faute.
D'accord. Prenez soin de vous.
- Salut, bébé.
- Merde ! Ma mčre a envoyé des biscuits ?
Oui. Si on avait un chien, on ne serait pas
obligés de les jeter ŕ la poubelle.
Oui.
On est seuls dans l'appartement.
- J'aimerais faire l'amour par terre.
- Quelle bonne idée.
Le plancher est froid.
Prends la couverture que ta mčre a faite.
Elle a tout entendu ?
Elle a tout entendu.
Barney, on s'est humiliés, tous les deux.
On a mérité une grosse portion
de ton histoire.
D'accord. Oů en étais-je ?
Ah oui. Shannon et son pčre
se suçaient les amygdales.
Comment peux-tu... Avec ton pčre ?
Je sais, il ne faut pas juger,
mais c'est dégueu !
Barney, ce n'est pas mon pčre.
C'est Greg.
Je le fréquente depuis des semaines.
J'espérais que tu partirais,
ce qui nous aurait évité tout ceci.
Tu veux rompre ?
Et le corps des volontaires de la paix ?
Toutes ces idées granola,
ce n'était qu'une phase.
Greg est plus vieux. Il a du succčs.
Il m'achčte plein de choses cool.
- Mais je t'aime.
- Il a un bateau, lui.
Tu devrais joindre le corps des volontaires
de la paix. Et m'oublier.
<i>Je n'y suis pas allé.</i>
<i>Cette nuit-lŕ, j'ai enregistré ma vidéo
et je l'ai postée ŕ Shannon.</i>
<i>Je l'ai seulement vue
une semaine plus tard.</i>
Le sucre est dans le panier.
Shannon ! Tu es revenue !
Je viens chercher mon dernier chčque,
c'est tout.
Tu as reçu ma vidéo ?
Elle l'a reçue, ta vidéo.
C'est toi ? C'était toi ?
Merde !
EN COSTUME ! Économisez 99 $
sur les marques de créateurs.
Pauvre toi.
Ce n'est pas la fin de l'histoire.
J'ai vu Shannon encore une fois.
- Quand ?
- Désolé. Désolé.
Il faut que tu nous racontes.
Je ne sais pas. Je crois avoir besoin
d'une derničre histoire avant de continuer.
D'accord.
C'est l'histoire des testicules verts.
Je jouais au frisbee extręme ŕ l'université,
il y avait un type
avec un ongle d'orteil super acéré.
Voyons, Ted ! Tu sais bien
quelle histoire je veux entendre.
Tout le monde ici a eu le courage
de dire la vérité.
Pourquoi pas toi ?
Tu as raison.
Victoria, je suis désolé de n'avoir rien dit
jusqu'ŕ maintenant,
mais j'aimais bien Robin, auparavant.
En fait, je lui ai dit que j'étais amoureux
d'elle ŕ notre premier rendez-vous.
Elle a capoté, ce qui est normal,
et je suis parti.
Mais la soirée n'était pas finie.
<i>On a tous fini ici
avec notre chauffeur de taxi, Ranjit.</i>
Vivent les soirées folles !
<i>Et j'ai bu.</i>
<i>Beaucoup.</i>
Vous croyez que j'aurais dű l'embrasser ?
Je vais y aller tout de suite.
Je vais l'embrasser maintenant.
Oui ! Vas-y !
Allons ŕ la voiture.
Il y a quelqu'un ?
Tu as vomi puis tu es parti ?
Je croyais que tu n'avais pas vomi
depuis 1993.
Tu nous as donc menti ?
Tu es re-revenu pour moi.
C'est super gentil.
Tu as détruit
mon tapis d'accueil personnalisé.
- Désolé.
- Ça va.
- Victoria, j'imagine que tu trouves ça...
- En effet, oui.
Tu avais raison, Ted.
Tu n'aurais pas dű raconter cette histoire.
Mais tu as mérité le droit
d'entendre la fin de mon histoire.
Avançons huit ans plus tard.
Huit ans de plus, c'est cette année.
Marshall, non seulement c'est cette année,
mais c'est aussi ce soir.
Salut.
- Barney ?
- Salut, Shannon.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais lŕ ?
- Écoute-moi.
Quand tu m'as laissé pour Greg, ce type,
ça m'a changé.
Voici ce que je suis devenu.
C'est peut-ętre fou, mais tu faisais partie
intégrante de ma vie, auparavant,
et je tenais ŕ ce que tu saches
ce que je suis devenu.
Me voilŕ.
<i>C'est alors qu'elle m'a raconté sa vie.</i>
Elle a fréquenté Greg pendant
quelque temps, puis ils ont rompu.
Mais voici la partie surprenante.
Shannon a fait un enfant.
Elle a un fils qui s'appelle Max.
C'est fou. Ça aurait pu ętre mon fils.
Et qu'est-ce que j'ai ŕ la place ?
Ma vie se résume ŕ un peu d'argent,
ŕ des costumes dans mon placard,
ŕ une série d'aventures d'un soir.
Mais voyons.
Sa vie est partie d'un côté,
la tienne, d'un autre, mais ça ne veut pas
dire que la tienne est moins bonne.
Ma vie est super !
De l'argent, des costumes, de la baise.
Je pleure de bonheur.
Je pourrais ętre coincé
dans un petit appartement,
en train de changer les couches
d'un morveux,
mais ŕ la place, je sors 24 heures sur 24,
7 jours sur 7.
Tu m'as vraiment sauvé l'âme, mon gars.
Mais voici le meilleur de cette histoire,
en plus du reste,
en plus de toutes les belles choses
que je vis déjŕ.
Aprčs avoir parlé avec Shannon,
je me la suis tapée.
- Non.
- Oui.
- Non.
- Oui.
Désolée, je n'y crois pas. T'as inventé ça.
Tu essaies de cacher le fait
que tu as vécu un moment profond
et que tu t'es remis en question...
<i>- Mon Dieu.
- Oh ! Barney ! Oh !</i>
La vidéo est pas mal sur mon téléphone.
<i>Ton téléphone est allumé ?</i>
<i>Non. Ça prend du temps
avant qu'il ne s'éteigne, c'est tout.</i>
C'est dégueu. Arręte-le.
Mesdames, messieurs, Ted.
Ce fut une agréable soirée.
J'ai appris vos histoires humiliantes.
Ted a raconté le re-retour.
J'ai enfin baisé Shannon !
Je lui ai dit que je l'appellerais.
Je ne crois pas que ça arrive.
Et j'ai redécouvert
ŕ quel point ma vie est belle.
<i>Ŕ la prochaine, hombres.</i>
Barney vient de remporter
notre soirée de jeux.
<i>On dépense tant d'énergie
pour cacher nos secrets,</i>
Drôles de fesses
<i>męme ceux de nos amis intimes,</i>
<i>que lorsqu'on décide de s'ouvrir,</i>
<i>c'est incroyable ŕ quel point
nos secrets semblent insignifiants.</i>
Je parie 100 $ que dčs que tu...
<i>On n'a pas révélé
tous nos secrets ce soir-lŕ, bien entendu.</i>
<i>Mais je ne veux pas divulguer
toute l'histoire.</i>
Kids, something you might not know about your Uncle Marshall
is that he's always been good at games.
I mean, unbeatable.
Gin!
Yahtzee!
Poker!
You don't have to shout out "poker" when you win.
I know. It's just fun to say.
We all finally agreed Marshall should be running our game nights
instead of playing in them.
Which he took to mean, "invent your own game."
It's called "Marsh-gammon."
It combines all the best features of all the best games--
Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary.
Backgammon, obviously.
No. Backgammon sucks.
I took the only good part of backgammon, the "gammon,"
and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs.
I'm so excited Victoria's coming.
I'm going to go get another round.
Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight.
Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot,
so don't say anything embarrass...
Don't say anything.
And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin,
- so we you could just avoid the...
- Well, well, well. How rich.
You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend,
yet, you have been lying to her since day one.
Excuse me.
Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on.
So, nothing for him to stand on?
Okay, and thanks so much.
Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin?
I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.
No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.
Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?
Nothing. It's nothing.
And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?
Us? What would we do?
Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have
and, in fact, moved here to get away from.
However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?
- Fine.
- Fine.
Thank you.
I should go help Robin.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?
Oh, sure. She's great.
Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted?
No. Victoria's great.
She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great.
I said, "She's great" too many times, didn't I?
You must really hate the bitch.
But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest,
then you "Marshall out," and all your chips go into the pot,
and remember, if you ever ask the question "What?", then...
you got to drink. Got it?
Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up.
Newbie goes first. Roll.
Okay.
Three!
You got Autobiography.
Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question
about your dating life truthfully in order to move on.
Marshall, come on.
Hey, she's the one who rolled a three.
Victoria, "Have you ever cheated while in a relationship?"
Wow, good question.
- You don't have to answer that.
- It's okay.
Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college,
and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night,
and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up.
Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer.
You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.
So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?
What?
You said what, you got to drink!
Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd,
and the host said she knew you.
What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?
Shannon?!
Shannon, Shannon...
No, don't remember any Shannon.
Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give...
Where's the tape?
Fine. I'll go get it.
Cool, okay. You know, whenever.
Okay, Robin, your roll.
Five! Another Autobiography...
for the player to your left, which...
Victoria!
Of course.
Victoria, "How many boyfriends did you have before you started dating Ted?"
Wait, the card actually says "Ted?"
Okay, uh, well, boyfriends--I guess I've only had... two.
Prude alert.
Well... that's serious boyfriends.
I've dated other guys in between.
Oh, slut alert!
Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach.
Oh, wow, look at that.
Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me.
Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon.
Barney, what was on that tape?
Too bad you'll never find out.
Oh, damn it!
If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse.
Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.
What?!
Drink!
Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead.
So, should we pop it in?
- Give it to me, give it, give me...
- Play the tape, play it, play it!
- Ted!
- Fine, fine.
You cannot play it.
Shannon!
I love you!
I love you so much.
What about us changing the world together?
Don't tell me you've forgotten.
I know I haven't.
Will I ever see another rainbow?
Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe?
Baby, please
Don't go
There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love
There's a thief in the palace and she's...
Did you try his cell phone?
Yeah, I left two messages.
I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard.
He's off the grid.
Hey, guys, what up?
Barney, where have you been?
Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that.
Yeah, so sorry.
But seriously, what was up with the tape?
- No, no, stay.
- Come on, Barney.
- Come on.
- Stay!
I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it.
It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
Well, we all have embarrassing stories.
Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it.
Oh, really?
Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall?
Show me how good it is.
All right.
I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi,
but they were all at recess.
I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom.
It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down.
What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom.
I wish I'd pulled up my pants.
The kids still call him Funny Butt.
Okay. I'll tell you my story.
Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.
It was 1998.
I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend.
My girlfriend... Shannon.
Yeah, you were meant for me
And I was meant for you
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.
Thank you.
All right.
I love your singing, Barney.
And I love you, Shannon.
Joining the Peace Corps with you is gonna be legendary.
I know. Only five short weeks till we're down in Nicaragua.
Hey, nonfat latte to go.
Mellow order, bro, mellow order.
Dude, that your g-friend?
All right, high five!
Sorry, I only give high twos.
Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that.
Listen to you.
That?
You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings.
And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married.
You can read about it in my zine.
Hey, haircut, right here.
Open up your knowledge basket, 'cause here it comes.
Forget that touchy-feely crap.
You get money, you get laid. End of discussion.
I feel sorry for you, man.
Peace out, hombre.
Suits.
Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps.
Only problem was...
she never showed up.
She never showed?
So, what happened next?
You know what? This was a mistake.
Wait... What if somebody else told their most humiliating story?
Oh, I know just how to decide who.
You brought the game to the bar?
Well, we're not quitting just 'cause Ted's so far ahead.
I was winning?
Fine. I'll go next.
I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver.
Not the slipping-in-horse-poop story!
Yeah, we all know that one.
Okay, how about this?
I will tell you my most humiliating story.
Yeah, Victoria, way to step up!
Okay, it involves a game of truth or dare,
a squeeze-bottle of marshmallow ice cream topping,
and the hot tub at my grandparents' retirement community.
Kids, I tell you a lot of inappropriate stories,
but there's no way in hell I'm telling you this one.
Don't worry, though, it wasn't that great.
That is the greatest story ever!
- Oh my God!
- Wow, wow!
Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy.
My saga... continues.
I went back to the coffeehouse to find Shannon.
Barney.
Sugar Bear, where were you?
Oh, I'm sorry. My dad won't let me go.
But the Nicaraguans need us!
It's just, he's still supporting me, and...
Look, he's coming by soon to talk about it, but
I think you should go on without me.
Shannon, there is no...
Barney, it's your dream.
It's only two years.
I know we can make it.
As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult.
Her father couldn't control her life.
I had to go back and confront him.
She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad.
What?!
Now we all got to drink.
Oh, my God. What happened next?
I don't know, guys.
Okay, okay.
- Marshall's mom sent us cookies...
- Lily, no!
For the team, Marshall, for the team.
Hey, Mrs. Eriksen, it's Lily.
Thank you so much for the delicious cookies.
Mayonnaise.
Really?
Never would have guessed.
Well, I will definitely give Marshall a kiss for you.
Okay. Take care.
Oh, crap. My mom sent cookies?
Yeah.
I wish we had a dog, so they wouldn't go to waste.
So we've got the whole place to ourselves.
I'm thinking floor sex.
Sounds reasonable.
Ooh, floor's cold.
Grab that afghan your mom made.
The whole time?
The... whole... time.
Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us.
We just earned a huge chunk of story.
Right.
So where was I?
Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad.
How can... With your dad?
I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!
Barney, that's not my dad.
His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks.
I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this.
We're breaking up?
But what about the Peace Corps?
Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase.
Greg's older.
He's successful.
He buys me all this cool stuff.
But I love you.
But he has a boat.
You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me.
I didn't go.
That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon.
I didn't see her until a week later.
There's sugar in the basket.
Shannon! Shannon, you came back!
I'm just picking up my last paycheck.
Oh. Did you... did you get my tape?
Oh, she got the tape.
You?
It was you?
Will I ever see another rainbow
Oh, man.
Oh, you poor thing.
The story's not over.
I did see Shannon one more time.
When?
Sorry.
Sorry.
You've got to tell us.
I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.
Fine.
Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college
and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...
Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear.
Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth.
Why can't you?
You're right.
Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet,
but a while back, I was kind of into Robin.
In fact, on our first date, I might have said, "I love you."
Understandably, she freaked out and I left.
But unfortunately, the night did not end there.
We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.
To one hell of a night!
And I drank... a lot.
So you guys think I should have kissed her?
Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.
Yes! Do it!
To the cab.
Hello?
Is someone out there?
You ralphed and ran?
I thought you were vomit-free since '93.
So that was a lie?
You re-returned for me.
That's really sweet.
Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Victoria, I know this must be...
Yeah. It kind of is.
Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story.
But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine.
We fast-forward eight years into the future.
Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year.
Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.
Hi.
Barney?
Hi, Shannon.
- What are you doing here?
- Just listen.
When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me.
Now I'm this.
I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life.
And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now.
So here I am.
And then she told me about her life.
She and Greg dated for a while and then split up.
But here's the real kicker:
Shannon's a mom.
She has a little kid named Max.
That's crazy.
That could have been my kid.
But instead, what do I have?
My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet
and a string of one-night stands.
Hey. Come on.
I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another,
it doesn't make your life any worse.
My life rocks!
Money, suits and sex. These are tears of joy!
I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers.
But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365!
You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy.
Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry
on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life.
After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.
- Nope.
- Yeah.
- Nope.
- Yeah.
Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up.
You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had
a profound moment of doubt about yourself and...
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Barney!
Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?
Is your phone on?
Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.
Ew, gross. Just stop it.
Ladies, gentlemen... Ted.
This has been a wonderful evening.
I got great dirt on all you guys.
I got Ted to tell the re-return.
I finally nailed Shannon!
Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right.
And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is.
Peace out, hombres!
I think Barney just won game night.
We spend so much effort trying to keep parts of our lives hidden,
even from our closest friends.
But those rare times when we do open up,
it's amazing how minor those secrets all end up seeming.
Of course, not every secret was told that night.
But that's getting ahead of the story.

<i>Les enfants, en amour,</i>
<i>les meilleures relations sont celles
qui arrivent naturellement.</i>
Mes tout premiers muffins.
Je crois que tu dois les laisser au four
plus longtemps.
Suis ce conseil professionnel:
Si ça coule toujours,
ce n'est pas un muffin,
- mais une boisson.
- Oui, eh bien...
<i>Ma relation avec Victoria était amusante.
Et facile. Vraiment pas compliquée.</i>
Non, non.
<i>C'était super.</i>
Es-tu en train de colorier tes fesses ?
J'ai un gros entretien.
Et il y a des trous dans mon costume.
Je ne sais pas coudre.
Je n'ai pas de boxeur.
Alors, oui, je colorie mes fesses.
- Mets un autre costume.
- Je n'en ai pas d'autre.
Je suis cassé. Je peux porter
mes vêtements de sport ou y aller tout nu.
Mon gars,
si tu postules un emploi ainsi vêtu,
même les avocats hippies
du cabinet d'avocats des Amis Granola
te jetteront à la porte.
C'est au Conseil national
de la défense des ressources
et c'est l'emploi de mes rêves.
Mais ce n'est qu'un stage.
C'est un poste non rémunéré.
Je servirai le café aux gens.
Mais les patrons des gens auxquels
je le servirai sauveront le monde.
Ah bon. Demain, et sache
que ce que je vais te dire va t'extasier,
je t'emmène chez mon tailleur sur mesure.
Chez un tailleur ? Barney,
j'accumule 300 $ de déficit par semaine
et je dois économiser pour mon mariage.
Relaxe. Mon tailleur exige le tiers du prix.
Tu ne vas certainement pas porter
ce "costume" ridicule à ton mariage.
Demain, à midi. Chez mon tailleur.
Non, merci, mon gars.
- À midi ?
- À midi.
- D'accord.
- À demain.
Salut, les filles.
Salut, les filles.
- Salut.
- Salut.
J'allais justement rencontrer Ted.
On sort ensemble depuis deux mois.
On sort souper.
Voilà qui répond aux questions
que je n'ai pas posées.
Robin.
Voyons. On plaisante.
Notre amitié est rendue à cette étape.
Vraiment ?
Dégage.
Vous voyez ? Je l'ai encore fait.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Vous cherchez une robe ?
Je fais des gâteaux de mariage
pour des boutiques.
Je peux t'accompagner.
Tu auras peut-être un rabais.
- Vraiment ? Ce serait super.
- Oui.
Je dois répondre à cet appel.
Salut. Allô ?
Hé ! Je croyais qu'on irait seules demain.
Pourquoi tu l'invites, celle-là ?
Robin. Tu dois accepter
que Ted et Victoria sortent ensemble.
Tu as eu ta chance. Il vit sa vie.
Sois contente pour eux, tu veux ?
Un faux sourire et un regard éteint,
ça te va ?
- Vendu.
- Super.
Victoria, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
On vient de m'offrir une bourse
à un institut culinaire en Allemagne.
- Attends. En Allemagne ? En Europe ?
- C'est pour deux ans.
Je croyais ne pas avoir grand-chance,
car très peu d'Américains se font accepter,
mais on m'a acceptée.
Tu parles de l'Allemagne en Europe ?
- Ted, y en a-t-il une autre ?
- Celle au centre Epcot ?
- Ted.
- Désolé.
- Félicitations.
- Merci.
Je ne sais pas si je vais y aller.
Si tu y vas, qu'arrivera-t-il de nous ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je crois que les relations à distance
ne fonctionnent pas.
Les relations à distance,
c'est un mensonge
que les adolescents se racontent
pour baiser pendant les vacances.
Ça veut dire que...
Soit tu restes ici, soit on va rompre.
Ça alors.
Écoute, voyons comment ça va se passer,
et en septembre...
Je dois partir ce lundi.
- Le lundi...
- Ted.
À quoi tu penses ?
On devrait prendre du temps
pour penser à ce qu'on veut.
On se verra demain pour en parler.
D'accord.
<i>Et c'est là
que les choses se sont compliquées.</i>
- Salut, bébé. Comment ça va, les robes ?
- Tout est bouffant et blanc.
C'est comme faire les boutiques
dans une guimauve. Et le tailleur ?
C'est très sombre et suspect ici.
Je crois que c'est illégal.
C'est comme faire les boutiques
dans la tête de Barney.
- Bonne chance, bébé.
- Salut.
Dis, Barney ?
Je suis mal à l'aise. Il travaille
dans l'arrière-boutique d'une animalerie ?
Tu veux un costume de qualité
et un lapin gratuit ou pas ?
Ted, Sergei veut que tu arrêtes
de te morfondre. Ça le distrait.
Tu parles l'ukrainien ?
Les gars, je suis foutu.
Je ne veux pas perdre Victoria, mais
je ne peux pas lui dire de rester pour moi.
Et je ne veux pas de relation à distance.
Non, non, non. Oublie ça.
Tu sais qui aime les relations à distance ?
Les filles. Juste du blabla, pas de baise.
La mort, quoi.
Ne critique pas les relations à distance.
Je crois que ça peut vraiment marcher.
- Vraiment ? Tu crois à ça ?
- Absolument.
J'en vis quatre en ce moment.
J'ai Lisa à Madrid.
J'ai Erica à Tokyo. J'ai Laura au Danemark.
Et Kelly sur la 34e Rue.
Elle me prend
pour un tondeur de moutons de Killarney.
Tu sais à l'université, quand Lily
a suivi un programme d'art,
un été à Paris ?
Oui.
Elle parlait sans cesse
d'un idiot de Français, un Gabriel.
Je suis allé là-bas, il y avait une fête.
Et devine qui arrive ? Gabriel.
Il avait une petite moustache française,
toute fine.
Je n'aime pas me battre,
mais j'aurais pu régler son cas.
Je l'ai donc pris de côté et lui ai chuchoté,
avec des yeux déments:
"Ne t'approche surtout pas de Lily,
sinon je jure devant Dieu
"que je mangerai la moustache
sur ton idiot de visage français."
Il est parti en courant, je vous le dis.
Je crois qu'il pleurait.
Je n'ai jamais rien dit à Lily. Honnêtement,
je ne suis pas fier d'avoir fait ça.
Mais très honnêtement, je le suis.
À part la confirmation
de l'opinion des Européens
- sur les Américains, il y a un but ?
- Oui.
C'est que même si Lily est mon âme soeur,
la distance géographique a failli nous tuer.
Si tu crois que Victoria est ton âme soeur,
dis-lui de rester.
Je l'ignore pour l'instant.
Mais oui, elle pourrait l'être.
Tu la connais à peine.
C'est quoi sa couleur préférée ?
Aime-t-elle les chats, les chiens ?
Aimerait-elle faire ménage à trois ?
J'en sais plus
sur mon téléphone cellulaire.
Et, en passant,
j'ai bel et bien la conférence à trois.
Elle ne peut pas aimer les chats.
J'aime les chiens, moi.
J'attire les gens qui aiment les chiens.
- En es-tu certain ?
- Bon.
- Allô ?
- Une question, comme ça.
- Aimes-tu les chats ?
- J'ai détesté la comédie, j'aime l'animal.
C'est bon à savoir. Salut.
Elle aime les chats.
Je ne la connais pas du tout.
- Excellent. On prendra celui-ci.
- Celui-ci.
C'est mon costume.
Ce n'est pas moi qui choisis ?
Joue avec cette pelote à épingles.
Seigneur ! Je vais être beau.
Marshall, tu n'abîmeras pas
un aussi beau costume
pour tenter vainement
de sauver la planète.
C'est un costume gagnant. J'arrangerai
un entretien pour toi à mon bureau.
Notre équipe a besoin
d'hommes comme toi.
On se fait poursuivre. Souvent.
Non. Je ne vendrai pas mon âme.
Mais voyons, si tu travailles avec moi
pendant trois mois,
tu gagneras
plus que Lily ne gagne en un an.
Non. J'ai déjà décidé.
Moi aussi. Si je dis à cette fille
de renoncer à ses rêves pour moi
et que deux semaines plus tard, on casse,
je serai le pire des salauds.
C'est trop de pression
pour une relation aussi récente.
Je vais lui dire d'y aller.
<i>Je l'ai donc vue ce soir-là
pour lui faire part de ma décision.</i>
J'y ai bien songé, et...
Attends. Avant que tu ne dises
quoi que ce soit,
je voulais te donner quelque chose.
Voici de quoi ça a l'air
quand on les laisse suffisamment au four.
Je veux que tu restes.
Plus tôt ce jour-là...
C'est très sombre et suspect ici.
Je crois que c'est illégal.
Comme faire les boutiques
dans la tête de Barney.
- Bonne chance, bébé.
- Salut.
Quelle sorte de robe aimeriez-vous ?
Rien de trop gros ni de trop bouffant.
Je ne suis pas très féminine.
Mais j'aimerais ressembler
à une princesse magnifique.
- J'en ai vu des belles.
- Dans la vitrine ?
Je ne voudrais pas vous vexer,
mais elles sont trop chères pour vous.
De quoi elle se mêle ?
Elle ne connaît pas mon salaire.
Ces femmes sont des expertes.
Elles devinent ton salaire annuel
par tes sous-vêtements.
Foutus paquets économiques
de petites culottes qui viennent par trois !
- Au moins on nous a offert du champagne.
- Et du gâteau.
Parlant de gâteau, Victoria,
as-tu décidé,
pour ta formation en beignets ?
Je n'en sais rien. Je veux y aller,
mais je ne veux pas perdre Ted.
J'ai pensé à une relation à distance.
Ça ne marcherait pas.
C'est juste du blabla, pas de baise.
La mort, quoi.
Je sais que c'est kitsch,
mais Ted est peut-être mon âme soeur.
- Ce serait difficile de le quitter.
- Je ne sais pas.
Je me sentirais lésée
si je refusais une excellente formation
pour un gars
que je connais depuis deux mois.
Mais ce n'est pas n'importe quel gars.
C'est Ted. Il est merveilleux.
- C'est le meilleur que je connaisse.
- Aux États-Unis. Mais les Allemands ?
Je les laisserais paner mon schnitzel
avec plaisir, tu sais ?
- Moi, vraiment pas.
- Je parle de baise.
Pardon, madame.
Cette enfoirée est morte. Merci.
C'est bon les filles, je la déteste.
- Elle est archi-laide.
- C'est grave. Très.
Elle est courte en avant, longue en arrière.
Comme une coupe Longueuil.
Victoria, Marshall et moi avons vécu
à distance, une fois.
Pendant l'université, j'ai suivi un cours
à Paris. J'étais la seule Américaine.
Je me sentais vraiment seule.
Je n'avais qu'une seule amie: Gabrielle.
Elle était plutôt sans attraits
et avait l'air étrange.
Elle avait une petite moustache
qui la mettait très mal à l'aise.
À un moment donné,
elle a arrêté de me parler,
je n'ai jamais su pourquoi.
J'étais toute seule ensuite.
La seule chose qui m'ait aidée,
c'était l'idée de mon âme soeur
qui m'attendait.
Si Ted est ton âme soeur,
ça vaudrait la peine de tenir bon.
Mais comment faire pour le savoir ?
On ne se connaît pas assez.
C'est lui, justement.
- Allô ?
- Une question, comme ça.
- Aimes-tu les chats ?
- J'ai détesté la comédie, j'aime l'animal.
- Elle aime les chats. Quelle surprise.
- Arrête.
Salut. Pourquoi Ted veut-il savoir
si j'aime les chats ?
Peut-être veut-il t'en acheter un ?
J'ai entendu japper derrière.
Peut-être qu'il était dans une animalerie.
Veut-il qu'on ait un chat ?
Peut-être qu'il se sert
d'un adorable chaton pour te culpabiliser ?
Ce serait méchant. Tu crois qu'il ferait ça ?
Je ne voudrais rien savoir.
À ta place, je partirais en Allemagne.
Seigneur. Vous êtes incapables de mentir.
- Je ne sais pas quoi dire.
- C'est laid, c'est laid.
On s'y prend mal.
Je vais te chercher une des robes
en vitrine, histoire de s'amuser.
- Est-ce que ça va ?
- Ça va.
D'accord, mais on dirait
que tu veux voir Victoria partir à tout prix.
Mais non.
Je lui offre mon appui, c'est tout.
Elle a reçu une bourse super importante
en matière de desserts.
Arrête d'être sarcastique.
C'est vraiment une bourse importante
en matière de desserts.
C'est dur à dire sans paraître sarcastique.
Je sais que tu n'aimes pas Victoria,
mais on dirait qu'elle rend Ted heureux.
Pense à ça avant d'échanger tes points
contre son billet d'avion.
Tu voulais ressembler à une princesse ?
Seigneur ! Elle est parfaite.
C'est sûr que je vais me taper Marshall
si je porte ça.
- Regarde comme elle est contente.
- Oui.
J'ai toujours cru
que j'étais une femme indépendante
et qu'aucun homme n'interromprait
ma carrière,
mais j'y pense maintenant.
Je me sens coupable.
Comme si c'était antiféministe.
- Je te comprends tout à fait.
- C'est vrai ?
J'accorde toujours plus d'importance
à ma carrière qu'à mes copains,
et, en toute honnêteté, ça veut dire
beaucoup de soirées passées toute seule.
J'ai peur de ça, justement.
Le fait de choisir Ted plutôt que ta carrière
ne va pas à l'encontre du féminisme.
Ça veut peut-être dire
que vous seriez heureux ensemble.
Robin, tu es la meilleure.
Je suis contente de t'avoir comme amie.
- C'est toi la meilleure.
- Non. C'est toi.
D'accord, c'est moi.
Je vais rester.
Je suis tellement magnifique.
Ne me dites pas combien elle coûte.
Tuez-moi tout de suite,
pour que je puisse mourir aussi belle.
Tu es magnifique.
Combien elle coûte ? Sur une échelle
d'inabordable jusqu'à très inabordable.
Très, très, très, très, très inabordable.
Ça ne fait rien.
Ce qui rend une mariée belle,
c'est le fait qu'elle soit heureuse
de se marier.
Je sais que la robe me va à merveille,
mais ce qui compte, c'est que Marshall
et moi nous aimions, pas vrai ?
Oui, tu as raison.
Mais tu t'es assise sur le gâteau.
Mais tu sais ? On pourra la laver.
C'est du chocolat aux framboises.
Allez. Lève-toi.
Voyons à quel point c'est grave.
- Elle était déjà comme ça.
- Comment allez-vous payer pour la robe ?
Avec plusieurs cartes de crédit.
Chez Peter
Chez Peter
Je voulais te donner quelque chose.
Voici de quoi ça a l'air
quand on les laisse suffisamment au four.
Je veux que tu restes.
Je dois partir en Allemagne.
- Tu y vas ?
- Je dois y aller.
- C'est ce que tu as décidé ?
- Non.
Je suis venue ici
en me disant que je resterais,
mais quand tu as dit ça,
j'ai compris que je devais y aller.
- Tu veux me contrarier ou quoi ?
- Non.
Alors, oui ?
Ted, on ne se fréquente
que depuis deux mois.
Tu ne peux pas prendre cette décision
à ma place.
J'allais te dire de partir,
mais tu m'as donné ce muffin.
Ça m'a rappelé à quel point tu es super.
Viendrais-tu vivre en Allemagne
avec moi ?
Ça serait fou.
Ah bon.
Je pourrais me sacrifier pour toi,
mais de ton côté, ça serait fou.
Tu travailles ici, tu as ta vie.
J'ai rien là-bas.
- Tu m'auras moi.
- On se connaît à peine.
Ce n'est pas juste
qu'on soit obligés de rompre.
J'ai horreur de ça.
On va rompre ?
Je suppose.
Je suppose.
C'est nul, mon gars. Je suis désolé.
C'est nul, mon gars. Je suis désolé.
C'était trop de pression, trop vite.
C'était peut-être stupide de penser que...
Oui, Marshall, je vois ton
nouveau costume. Il est beau.
Merci de le mentionner.
Tu n'avais rien dit.
Je comprends que vous auriez été
obligés de rompre un jour.
- Pourquoi aujourd'hui ?
- Elle part demain.
Mais elle est encore ici.
- Oui. Elle est encore ici.
- Oui.
Tu pourrais passer
une belle journée avec elle.
Ted, penses-y.
Si tu savais que demain,
tu perdais une jambe,
resterais-tu assis en train de pleurer
ou irais-tu courir, sauter
et faire des super ronds de
jambes dans les airs ?
Des super ronds de jambes
dans les airs ?
- C'est un nouveau pyjama ?
- Absolument.
On peut se morfondre et pleurer
ou courir et faire des ronds de jambes
dans les airs avant de les perdre.
- Attends. On se partage une seule jambe ?
- C'est une jambe métaphorique.
Comment cette jambe peut-elle faire
des ronds de jambes un jour
alors que le lendemain, elle sera tellement
amochée qu'on devra l'amputer ?
- Je ne sais pas, Ted.
- Allez.
Ça s'est tellement bien passé.
Pourquoi arrêter ainsi ?
Que voudrais-tu faire ?
Tous les trucs qu'on voulait faire
- mais qu'on n'a pas faits.
- Le musée ?
On traversera le pont de Brooklyn.
On ira voir les singes au zoo.
On ira manger au resto franco-vietnamien
qu'on a vu.
- Ça alors. On devrait y aller.
- Oui.
- Une grosse journée.
- Oui.
<i>Et les enfants, c'est exactement
ce qu'on a fait de notre dernière journée.</i>
<i>Le musée. Le pont. Le restaurant.</i>
<i>Toutes ces belles choses.</i>
Lily, tu dois lui dire.
Cette robe a coûté une fortune.
Non. Je vais attendre
la prochaine grosse bourde de Marshall
et je lui dirai à ce moment-là,
ça sera moins grave, en comparaison.
- Espérons qu'il te trompera, alors.
- Oui, mais sans coucher avec la personne.
Regarde-nous. Deux gars en costume.
Ressens-tu un petit frisson ?
Toutes les filles dans le bar te veulent,
et les gars veulent être à ta place.
En fait, c'est surtout moi.
Mais tu auras les restes.
Salut, bébé. La bière coûte 1 $ .
On a donc chacun sa bière, ce soir.
Es-tu enfin décidé à venir travailler
pour la société Barney ?
Ça ne s'appelle pas la société Barney.
Pas encore.
J'ai presque oublié.
Sergei m'a envoyé ta facture.
Barney, c'est écrit: 4000 $ .
Tu as dit que ça coûterait le tiers du prix.
Tu portes donc un costume de 12000 $ .
Tu devras venir travailler avec moi.
Tu as orchestré tout ça. Tu as fait exprès.
Absolument, oui !
Ça ne marchera pas.
Même si je dois travailler de nuit,
je vais payer ton tailleur.
Je ne vendrai pas mon âme.
Je sais que ça rendra les choses difficiles,
mais ça va marcher. C'est promis.
J'ai détruit une robe de mariée de 8000 $ .
- À quelle heure, l'entretien ?
- À 9 h.
Tu as besoin de chaussures.
Je connais quelqu'un.
Je suis contente d'avoir fait
des ronds de jambes.
Oui. J'étais presque trop fatigué
pour faire l'amour.
- Tu vas beaucoup me manquer.
- Toi aussi.
Tu sais, quand je reviendrai,
si on est toujours célibataires, on peut...
Même si on ne l'est pas.
D'accord.
Je sais que ça ne fonctionne jamais,
mais veux-tu essayer à distance ?
Oui. Oui.
- On peut y arriver.
- Absolument.
Ça va fonctionner.
On s'arrangera. Ça ira.
<i>Ça n'a pas fonctionné.</i>
<i>Les relations à distance sont
une très mauvaise idée.</i>
<i>Une très mauvaise idée. Vraiment.</i>
Départs
<i>On reviendra là-dessus plus tard.</i>
Kids, when it comes to love,
the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally.
My first solo batch.
Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer.
Here's a professional tip.
If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake.
It's a beverage.
Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun,
and easy, and uncomplicated.
It was pretty great.
Um, are you coloring in your butt?
I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it.
I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so,
yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.
So wear another one.
I don't have another one.
I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.
Dude, you show up to an interview in that,
even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals
will hackey sack you straight out the door.
Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job.
Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid.
Mostly getting people coffee.
But the people I'm getting coffee for--
their bosses are going to save the world.
Okay, tomorrow-- oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world--
tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.
A tailor?
Barney, I make negative $300 a week,
and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.
Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost.
And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks "suit."
Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.
No thanks, dude.
- Noon?
- Noon. See you then.
- Hey, girls.
- Hey.
Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted.
It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner.
Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask.
Robin!
Oh, come on. We bust on each other.
We're just at that place in our strong friendship.
Really? Oh.
Get off me.
Oh, see? I did it again.
What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping.
You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops.
If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount.
- Really? That'd be great.
- Yeah.
Huh. I should take this.
Hello.
Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow.
What's with inviting Punky Brewster?
Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing.
You had your chance, and now he's moved on.
Can't you just be happy for them?
The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.
Sold.
Victoria, what's wrong?
I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany.
Wait. Germany, Europe?
It's for two years.
I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but...
I'm in.
So, this is the Europe Germany?
What other Germany would it be?
- The one in Epcot?
- Ted.
Sorry.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I don't know if I'm going to go.
Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?
I don't know.
I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone.
Oh, God, no.
Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.
So, that leaves us with...
Either you stay here,
or we break up.
Wow.
Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September,
- we still feel...
- I have to leave on Monday.
- Monday, September the...?
- Ted.
Do you have any thoughts?
Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want.
We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.
It's a date.
And that's when things got complicated.
Hey, baby, how's the dress place?
Everything's so fluffy and white.
It's like shopping in a marshmallow.
How's Barney's tailor?
Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal.
It's like shopping in Barney's mind.
- Well, good luck, baby.
- Bye.
Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this.
A tailor in the back room of a pet store?
Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not?
Ted, Sergei says stop moping around.
You're distracting him from his process.
You speak Ukrainian?
Guys, I'm kind of screwed here.
I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me.
And long distance definitely isn't an option.
No. No, no, no. No way.
You know who likes long distance? Girls.
It's all talking and no sex. Kill me now.
Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.
- Really? You?
- Absolutely.
I'm juggling four right now.
There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo,
there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street.
The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.
Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?
Yeah.
Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel.
So, I went out to visit, and there was this party.
And who shows up but Gabriel.
And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache.
I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude.
So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet,
I got the crazy eyes going, and I said,
"You stay away from Lily,
or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face."
Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away.
I think he was crying.
I never told Lily about it.
To be honest, I'm not very proud of it.
To be even more honest, I am.
Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans,
did that little story have a point?
Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate,
long distance still almost killed us.
If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate,
you should ask her to stay.
Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.
Oh, please. You barely know this girl.
What's her favorite color?
Is she a cat person or a dog person?
Is she open to a three-way?
Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone.
And FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.
Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.
Are you sure?
All right.
Hello.
Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?
Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.
Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye.
She's a cat person.
I don't know this girl at all.
- Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.
- Yes.
Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?
Here. Play with this pin cushion.
God.
I'm going to look hot.
Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice
fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival.
This is a suit for winners.
I am getting you an interview at my office.
We need good men like you in our legal department.
We get sued a lot.
No way. The Kid does not sell out.
Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me,
you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.
No. I've made my decision.
So have I.
If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out,
I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time.
It's just too much pressure on a new relationship.
I'm going to tell her to go.
And so I met her that night to tell her my decision.
All right, I've been thinking a lot about this...
Okay, wait, before you say anything,
I wanted to give you this.
This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking.
I want you to stay.
Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal.
It's like shopping in Barney's mind.
- Oh, good luck, baby.
- Bye.
Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?
Nothing too huge or-or poofy.
I'm not really a girlie girl.
But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.
I saw a couple up front that were nice.
By the window?
No offense, dear, but those are a little out of your price range.
Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.
Oh, these women are experts.
They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear.
Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!
At least we get free champagne!
- And cake.
- Mm-hmm.
Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided
what to do about your doughnut fellowship?
You know, I don't know.
I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted.
I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works.
Ugh. All talking and no sex. Kill me now.
I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One.
That's pretty hard to walk away from.
Well, I don't know.
I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity
to chase some guy I'd only known two months.
But this isn't just some guy.
This is Ted.
He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.
Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew!
I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.
- I really don't...
- Sex.
Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This bastard's kicked.
Thanks.
- Oh!
- Oh!
It's okay, guys, I hate it.
- Just horrible.
- It's bad, it's really bad.
Short in front, long in the back?
That is the mullet of wedding dresses.
You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once.
In college, I did an art course in Paris.
I was the only American there.
It was really lonely.
I only had one friend, Gabrielle.
She was kind of homely and strange-looking,
and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had.
Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me,
and I never figured out why.
And then I had nobody.
The only thing that got me through was knowing
that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me.
If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.
But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates?
It's too soon.
Ooh. Speak of the devil.
Hello.
Hey, random question: how do you feel cats?
Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.
A cat person. Why am I not surprised?
Bye.
Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?
Maybe he's going to buy you one.
I did hear barking in the background.
Maybe he was in a pet store.
Does he want us to get a cat together?
Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.
That is low.
Do you really think that's what he's doing?
Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out.
I would be on the next plane to Germany.
- Aw.
- Aw.
Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.
- Ugly, ugly, ugly.
- I don't know what to say.
You know what? We're doing this all wrong.
I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Okay.
Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.
I'm not, I'm just trying to support her.
She got a super-important dessert scholarship.
Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship.
Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic.
Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan,
but she seems to make Ted happy.
So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.
Somebody say "beautiful princess."
Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh!
This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.
Oh, look how happy she is.
You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women
who would never let any guy mess with my career.
And now I'm actually thinking about it.
I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.
I know what you mean.
You do?
Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and...
to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.
See, that's what I'm afraid of.
Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist.
Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.
Robin...
I think that you are the coolest.
I'm so glad that we're friends.
Oh, no way-- you're the coolest.
No, you are.
Okay, I am.
I'm going to stay.
- Aw.
- Aw.
Oh, I am so beautiful!
Oh, don't tell me how much it costs.
Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.
Wow, you look incredible.
Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?
Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.
Well, it's okay.
You know, what makes a bride beautiful
is that she's just happy to be getting married.
Oh, guys, I know I look amazing,
but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?
Yes, you're right.
But also... you just sat down in the cake.
But, you know what?
It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.
Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.
It was like this when I found it?
And how will you be paying for this?
Credit card... s.
I wanted to give you... this.
This is what happens when you...
you know, let them finish baking.
I want you to stay.
I have to go to Germany.
You're going?
Yes. I have to.
So that's what you decided?
Well, no-- I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying,
but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go.
What is this, opposite day or something?
- No.
- So it is?
Ted, we've only been dating for two months.
I can't let you make this decision for me.
I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake,
and it reminded me how great you are.
Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?
Well, that's just crazy.
Oh, okay.
So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy.
But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.
You'd have me.
We've only been dating two months.
Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up.
I hate this.
So... we're breaking up?
I guess so.
I guess so.
God, that sucks, man.
I'm so sorry.
It was just too much pressure too soon.
I mean, maybe it was silly to even think...
Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.
Well, thank you for acknowledging it.
It was weird that you hadn't.
Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?
- She's leaving tomorrow.
- Yeah, but she's still in town.
Yeah, she... she's still in town.
Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together.
Ted, think about it this way:
if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow,
would you sit on the couch and cry about it,
or would you run, and jump,
and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?
Awesome air kicks, huh?
- New pajama bottoms?
- You know it.
So we can sit around and cry, or we can run,
and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.
Wait, so we're sharing the leg?
No, the leg is a metaphor.
How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day,
and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next?
I don't know, Ted.
Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?
Well, what would you want to do?
Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.
Like go to the Mets.
Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.
See some monkeys at the zoo?
Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?
Wow! We better get going.
Yeah, big day.
Yeah.
And, kids, that's exactly what we did with our last day.
The museum, the bridge, the restaurant,
and all of those nice things.
Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.
No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up,
and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.
Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.
Yeah, but only, like, second base.
Look at us: two guys in suits.
You feel that slight tingle?
That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you.
Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.
Hey, babe.
Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.
So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?
Oh, please-- your company is not called Barney Corp.
Yet.
Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.
B... Barney, this says $4,000.
I thought you said that it was one-third price.
Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit.
Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.
You set this up! You set this whole thing up!
I most certainly did...
Well, it won't work.
Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor.
I'm not selling my soul.
Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.
I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.
What time is the interview?
9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes.
Don't worry, I know a guy.
I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.
Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the sex.
I'm going to miss you so much.
I'm going to miss you, too.
Hey, you know, I mean, if, when I get back, we're still single, we can...
Even if we're not.
Okay.
Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?
Yes. Yes!
- We can beat the odds.
- Odds, schmodds.
It's gonna work.
We're going to make it work-- it'll work.
It didn't work.
Long-distance was and is a terrible idea,
a really terrible idea, just awful.
But more on that later.

<i>Quand votre oncle Marshall avait dix ans,</i>
<i>il a lu un livre intitulé
La vie parmi les gorilles.</i>
La vie parmi les gorilles
<i>C'est écrit par une anthropologue
appelée Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez,</i>
<i>qui racontait son année passée</i>
<i>parmi les gorilles des plaines occidentales
du Cameroun.</i>
<i>Quand Birnholz-Vazquez</i>
<i>est venue donner une conférence
ą l'université,</i>
<i>Marshall, le plus jeune membre
de l'audience,</i>
<i>avait une question ą poser.</i>
Quel conseil donneriez-vous
ą un futur anthropologue ?
Tu veux devenir anthropologue ?
Quand je serai grand, j'aimerais
vivre avec les gorilles, tout comme vous.
<i>Sa réponse a changé sa vie.</i>
C'est merveilleux,
mais je crains que tu ne le puisses pas.
Ils seront tous morts.
Et si les sanctions économiques
ne sont pas renforcées,
la destruction de la forźt continuera,
et plus d'un million d'espčces disparaītra.
Donc tu ne veux pas de café ?
Je dis que l'industrie du café cause
d'irréversibles...
- D'accord, je le jette.
- D'accord, une tasse.
Je dois rester alerte.
Premier jour de travail, et tout.
Je peux pas croire
que tu entres dans une société.
L'Enfant est devenu homme.
C'est juste un stage
pour renflouer les coffres.
Aprčs mon droit,
je travaillerai toujours pour le NRDC.
Ils arrźteront l'effet de serre.
<i>Eh bien, ils ont fait de leur mieux.</i>
Voici ton sac-repas.
Je t'aime parce que, un,
tu m'as fait un repas,
et que, deux, tu ris chaque fois
que tu dis "sac".
- Je t'aime, Marshmallow.
- Je t'aime.
Je t'aime aussi, Marshmallow.
- Ted ?
- Oh, non !
- Non, elle n'a pas fait ēa.
- Oui. Elle l'a fait.
Un autre colis surprise ?
<i>Un autre colis surprise.</i>
<i>J'entretenais une relation ą distance
avec Victoria depuis un mois.</i>
<i>Les relations ą distance,
c'est une mauvaise idée.</i>
- Ēa en fait combien ?
- Trois.
Combien lui en as-tu envoyé ?
Par la poste ou par télépathie ? Aucun.
Elle mčne par trois points.
Des petits gāteaux. Super.
Je parie qu'ils sont délicieux.
Oui. Ils le sont.
Merde !
Je ne mérite pas
ces délicieux petits gāteaux.
Dieu que je me déteste en ce moment.
C'est moi, ą 15 ans.
<i>Marshall allait travailler
pour une importante société, Altrucel.</i>
<i>Altrucel était reconnue
pour la qualité de sa peluche jaune</i>
<i>qui recouvre les balles de tennis.</i>
<i>C'était une importante société
qui faisait d'autres choses.</i>
<i>En gros, elle voulait que les gens
se concentrent sur la peluche jaune.</i>
<i>Marshall avait obtenu un stage
dans leur service juridique</i>
<i>parce qu'il y connaissait quelqu'un.</i>
Barney, j'écoute.
<i>M. Stinson, ici Willis de la sécurité.</i>
<i>Désolé de vous déranger, mais il y aurait
un Sasquatch en liberté dans l'immeuble.</i>
<i>- Un Sasquatch ?
- Oui, monsieur. Un monstre.</i>
<i>On ne veut pas vous alerter,
mais il a été vu sur votre étage.</i>
Oui ! Regarde-toi.
En habit vers le succčs indéniable.
Ouah ! Toute une collection
d'affiches de motivation.
Oh, oui. Je les ai toutes.
"Travail d'équipe, courage, génialité."
- Une pour la génialité ?
- Je l'ai fait faire.
- Assieds-toi.
- Maintenant que je travaille ici,
vas-tu me dire c'est quoi, ton travail ?
Je t'en prie.
- Mon vieux !
- Mon vieux !
Salut Blauman, Bilson, voici Marshall.
Service juridique.
Tu vas travailler avec eux.
Marshall Eriksen. Enchanté.
- Belle cravate. Sauce ą steak.
- Oh, sauce ą steak. C'est bien vrai.
- Oł ēa ? Je ne vois...
- Marshall, approche.
Ta cravate est sauce ą steak. Comme A1.
A1 ? Compris ? Essaie de suivre.
Au travail, Eriksen.
Il est 2 h. Il pleut.
Ding dong.
Quoi ? On a sonné ?
Oh, salut Jessica Alba
en imperméable, et rien d'autre.
Attends. Toc, toc.
On frappe ą la porte arričre.
- Je n'ai pas de porte arričre...
- Mon Dieu.
Jessica Simpson ? Quelle bonne surprise.
Deux Jessica. Tu dois en choisir une.
Que fais-tu ? Vas-y.
Eh bien, je suis fiancé, donc...
Ta fiancée est partie. Que fais-tu ? Vas-y.
On est quand mźme fiancés...
Ta fiancée est morte, écrasée par
un autobus. Que fais-tu ? Vas-y.
- Tu n'en veux pas un ?
- Combien en as-tu mangé ?
Quatre. Quatorze.
Non. Juste quatre.
Et le glaēage de deux autres.
En tout cas. Voici le problčme.
Salut, c'est Ted. Tu dois dormir.
J'ai reēu le colis surprise:
Il est super.
Écoute.
Et je suis lą,
la bouche pleine de ce petit gāteau
qui favorise une relation de couple,
et j'ai dit une stupidité:
Ne t'en fais pas.
J'ai posté le tien il y a deux jours.
Et il est génial. Absolument génial.
Pourquoi ai-je dit ēa ?
Le glaēage me fait mentir.
Oh, cher Ted.
Lą, peu importe ce que je lui envoie,
elle saura que c'était aprčs mon appel.
C'est ēa le problčme.
Réfléchis pendant que je mange ce gāteau.
D'accord, voici ce que tu vas faire.
Confectionne un colis surprise
bien new-yorkais:
Des bagels de H&H, un porte-clés
de l'Empire State Building,
<i>le tout couronné
du New York Times, tu es prźt ?</i>
L'édition d'il y a trois jours.
C'est brillant. Tu es brillante.
C'est drōle, il n'y a pas longtemps,
je demandais des conseils ą Marshall
et ą Lily pour t'impressionner.
C'est amusant.
<i>Voici pourquoi c'était amusant.</i>
<i>Je ne le savais pas,
mais quelques semaines plus tōt,</i>
<i>Robin disait ceci ą Lily ą mon sujet:</i>
Bon, ēa va !
J'ai des sentiments pour lui.
La fille que j'aimais bien m'aide
ą impressionner celle que j'aime.
J'ai compris, Ted.
- Salut ! Comment ēa a été ?
- Je ne veux pas en parler.
Mes collčgues de travail sont
une bande de pourris.
- De quoi ?
- De pourris.
- En quoi sont-ils pourris ?
- Oublie ēa. Je ne veux pas en parler.
C'est comme ce midi.
C'est quoi ēa, Eriksen ?
Maman a fait ton dīner ?
Pour votre information, ma fiancée l'a fait.
A-t-elle aussi enlevé les croūtes
de ton sandwich ?
Non.
- C'est quoi ?
- Rien. Rends-le-moi !
"Cher Marshmallow, bonne chance.
Je t'aime ! Lilypad."
Donne-moi ēa !
"P.S. Si tu as déplié ce billet,
ton bisou s'est envolé. Vite, attrape-le !"
Redonne-moi ēa ! Redonne-le-moi !
- Oublie-les. On est adorables.
- Je sais.
Seigneur ! C'est comme la premičre
année ą l'école.
Sauf que cette fois-ci, ma petite danse
ne suffira pas ą les gagner.
Pas mźme la Vieille Fiable.
Mon chou, ce serait bien
d'avoir un peu plus d'argent,
mais si tu es malheureux,
ēa ne vaut pas la peine.
- Je démissionne.
- Quoi ? Non. Tu...
On s'amuse tellement. Toi et moi,
ą travailler ensemble. C'est super.
On ne travaille mźme pas ensemble.
Je suis au service juridique et tu...
- Sérieusement, que fais-tu ?
- Je t'en prie.
Désolé. Vieux, cette société,
ce n'est pas pour moi.
Bien sūr que ce n'est pas pour toi.
C'est pour Lily.
- Quoi ?
- Marshall, Lily est un bon parti.
Mais penses-tu vraiment garder
une fille si étonnante
- sans tout le paquet ?
- Le paquet ?
Le paquet. La maison, la voiture,
la meilleure école pour les enfants.
- Un voyage ą l'occasion.
- Ce n'est pas important pour Lily.
Peut-źtre pas maintenant.
Mais comment se sentira-t-elle
quand elle te fera vivre
avec son salaire d'enseignante
alors que tu seras au tribunal
ą défendre un castor volant
en voie d'extinction ?
Je sais.
- Elle sera heureuse.
- D'accord.
Mais le seras-tu,
sachant que tu aurais pu
la rendre encore plus heureuse ?
Et les quatre sont entičrement nues.
Tu dois en choisir une.
Que fais-tu ? Vas-y.
Je dirais, Bea Arthur.
Faux. Betty White.
Fais le ménage, Eriksen.
A-t-elle reēu le fantastique colis surprise ?
Oui. Hier.
- L'a-t-elle aimé ?
- Elle l'a adoré.
Quel est le problčme, alors ?
Je lui parlais hier soir, et je dois te dire,
on se parle au téléphone chaque soir
pendant une heure et demie.
On finit par ne plus savoir quoi se dire.
Qu'as-tu mangé ce midi ?
Du pain de seigle.
Oui.
Oh, cher Ted.
Je suis un bon copain, d'habitude,
mais ne jamais se voir, c'est difficile.
Peut-źtre que ēa ne se fait pas.
Ce que je dois faire est clair.
C'est trčs clair.
Je dois lui faire une surprise
et aller en Allemagne.
Exactement ce ą quoi je pensais.
Sors de ma tźte, mec.
Barney, comment me débarrasser
de ces idiots ?
Marshall, pense aux manchots.
- Aux manchots ?
- Sur le mur.
CONFORMITÉ
"Conformité. Celui qui est différent
reste au froid."
C'est une affiche de motivation ?
Regarde-toi, Marshall.
Tu es malheureux.
Et tu sais pourquoi ?
Parce que tu es différent.
Tu pourrais apprendre ą aimer
le flocon de neige unique que tu es
ou changer ta personnalité,
ce qui est beaucoup plus facile.
Changer de personnalité ? C'est affreux.
Et pas du tout motivant.
Pas nécessairement.
Au début, j'étais consterné.
Mais je me suis aperēu
<i>que c'est comme La vie parmi les gorilles
d'Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez.</i>
Je dois gagner ma place dans la bande
en agissant comme eux.
C'est une étude anthropologique.
C'est bien, non ?
Ēa ressemble ą la pression par les pairs.
Non, non. C'est anthropologique.
C'est génial. Et je vais le faire.
C'est la pression par les pairs.
On a une rencontre annuelle.
Je personnifie quelqu'un
qui succombe ą la pression par les pairs.
D'accord.
Mais si ces gars veulent te faire fumer,
que diras-tu ?
- Seulement si je suis soūl.
- Bon garēon.
<i>Pour avoir sa place parmi les gorilles,
Marshall devait apprendre ą en źtre un.</i>
<i>Ce qui voulait dire, des cours de gorilles.</i>
D'accord. Je suis tout excité.
Mais si je dois źtre ton mentor,
je dois savoir que tu es aussi excité.
Oui je le suis. Je suis excité.
C'est bien de le dire,
c'est autre chose de le montrer.
Montre-le.
Je suis excité.
C'était quoi, ēa ?
Marshall, je devrais sentir
des ondes d'excitation
tout le long de mon corps.
On aurait dit une chatte enceinte dégriffée,
essayant d'attraper une mouche
un dimanche aprčs-midi.
- C'était trčs précis.
- Montre-moi ton excitation !
On y va !
- Ēa fait mal !
- Trop mal !
Et tu le glisses au gars
dans une poignée de mains discrčte,
- et il le fera.
- D'accord.
Il fera quoi ?
- Peu importe.
- Génial. Et quel gars ?
- Il y en a toujours un.
- D'accord. Ēa va.
- Je pense źtre prźt.
- Certain ?
Tu veux pratiquer ton histoire
une fois de plus ?
D'accord.
Écoutez ēa, les gars. Je suis ą San Diego
avec mes frčres de Kappa,
et ils disent:
"Yo, Eriksen, si on allait aux StripClubs ?"
Et moi je dis: "Yabadabadou !"
On a déniché ce bar de danseuses
prčs de l'aéroport.
Et c'est lą que le portier
nous a jetés dehors.
J'ignore si Svetlana a obtenu
sa carte verte,
mais, les gars,
une fausse bague ą diamants ?
Ēa vaut son pesant d'or, vieux.
Eriksen, ēa c'était de la sauce ą steak !
- Fantastique, vieux.
- Oui. Oui.
- Pas possible !
- Super histoire.
<i>Le matin suivant, j'allais acheter
mon billet pour l'Allemagne,</i>
<i>quand je reēus un mail.</i>
"Salut, Ted. Désolée d'avoir raté ton appel.
"C'est énervant
ces longues distances, hein ?
"J'ai bien réfléchi,
et il faut que je te parle ce soir.
"Je t'appellerai ą 23 h. Victoria."
- Et ?
- Et, elle va me laisser.
A-t-on déją dit: "J'ai bien réfléchi",
suivi de quelque chose de positif ?
Ce n'est pas comme: "J'ai bien réfléchi,
on sous-estime les biscuits Nutter Butter."
De quoi pourrait-il s'agir ?
Qu'aurait-elle ą me dire
qui ne s'écrive pas dans un mail ?
Je me suis coupé tous les doigts.
Ted, tu es un gars fantastique. Je le sais.
Tu le sais. Elle le sait.
Je te parie une fortune.
Non, j'ai encore plus confiance.
Je te parie une immense fortune
qu'elle ne t'appellera pas pour ēa.
Merci. Tu as raison. Je fais l'idiot.
Je devrais acheter ce billet d'avion ?
J'attendrais.
Salut Blauman. C'est la Bombe E.
Le karaoké, ēa marche toujours ?
Parfait !
Je vais faire un malheur au micro,
tes oreilles vont en saigner.
On se voit tantōt, Gino.
D'accord.
- Qu'en dis-tu ?
- Sauce ą steak.
- Sauce ą steak ?
- Oui.
Tu sais,
l'anthropologie au bureau,
c'est ton affaire.
Mais, je t'en prie, ne fais pas ēa ici.
Lily, quand Aurelia Birnholz...
Quand Australia Berlingot-Vaseline
est revenue de son séjour avec les gorilles,
elle ne cherchait pas de poux
dans la tźte des gens
ni ne lanēait d'ordures.
Je t'en supplie. Laisse ēa au bureau.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que tu agis comme ces gars,
et ces gars sont pathétiques.
Ils étaient plutōt méchants
au début. Mais ce sont des bons gars,
si tu les connaissais, tu t'en apercevrais.
Viens avec nous au karaoké ce soir,
et tu verras qu'ils ne sont pas
si pathétiques.
- D'accord ?
- D'accord.
Attends. Toc, toc, ą la porte arričre.
Qui est lą ?
Angelina Jolie en fauteuil roulant.
Que fais-tu ? Vas-y.
Mon Vieux, Scarlett Johansson sans bras ?
N'importe quand !
Tu as raison. Ils sont adorables.
- Barney, tu chantes ?
- Le karaoké m'ennuie.
Vraiment ? Je pensais que tu aimerais ēa.
Comprends-moi bien. Je suis bon.
Le meilleur, en fait.
Mais le plus grand samouraļ laisse
son épée rouiller dans son fourreau.
<i>Chéri, ils ont notre chanson.
Chantons Don't Go Breaking My Heart.</i>
Quoi ?
<i>Don't Go Breaking My Heart.
Elton John. Kiki Dee.</i>
Pas question. Chantez du Black Sabbath.
En fait,
Marshall et moi dansons une routine...
<i>Iron Man. Je pourrais faire lron Man.</i>
- Sauce ą steak.
- Sauce ą steak, vieux.
On lui dit ?
D'accord, Eriksen, j'ai de bonnes nouvelles.
Lundi, Bilson et moi irons parler
ą Montague des ressources humaines.
Aprčs tes études,
on veut que tu travailles avec nous.
Qu'en dis-tu ?
- Oui !
- Mon ami !
- Je t'avais dit qu'il le ferait.
- Ēa va źtre d'enfer.
- On va prendre la place.
- Sauce ą steak.
C'était choquant.
Quand allais-tu me dire
que tu as changé de plan de carričre ?
Rien n'a changé, d'accord ?
Je veux toujours aider l'environnement.
Je pensais faire un peu d'argent
pendant quelques années.
On s'achčterait un appartement,
les enfants iront dans une bonne école.
Tu pourrais quitter ton emploi et peindre.
Je sais que tu n'en as pas besoin,
mais je t'aime, et je veux te combler.
Je veux te donner le paquet.
Le paquet ?
Tu me le donnes déją.
Tu as un beau paquet, Marshall.
J'aime ton paquet.
Lily, tu es la femme la plus incroyable
que je connaisse
et tu mérites un gros paquet.
Ton paquet a toujours été assez gros.
Tu ne t'en rends peut-źtre pas compte,
Marshall Eriksen,
mais ton paquet est énorme.
Oui.
- Allō ?
- Pourquoi elle n'appelle pas ?
Tu vas te rendre malade.
C'est samedi soir.
Sors, fais quelque chose.
Pourquoi je sortirais ?
J'ai une copine. Pour l'instant.
Si je sors, qui écoutera les infos ?
Je suis la moitié du public.
Je suis flattée que tu penses
qu'on a deux téléspectateurs.
Elle ne te laissera pas, Ted. Tu es génial.
Merci. Il est prčs de 23 h. Je te laisse.
Bonne chance.
<i>Assis ą la maison
en attendant que le téléphone sonne,</i>
<i>quelque chose me traversa l'esprit.</i>
Je suis assis ą la maison,
attendant que le téléphone sonne.
- Marshall.
- Hé.
Ēa fait une éternité que je t'ai pas vu.
Oui.
Comment vas-tu ?
Je pense que Victoria va bientōt rompre.
Je suis désolé, vieux.
Oui, eh bien,
honnźtement, je ne me souviens
plus de son visage.
Plus j'essaie de m'en rappeler,
moins j'y arrive.
Je me souviens de mes sentiments,
mais pas d'elle.
On dirait que j'essaie de garder
quelque chose de déją perdu.
Garder quelque chose qui est déją perdu.
On dirait une loi sur l'environnement.
Je ne sais pas.
On se bat si fort pour garder ces choses
qui finiront par disparaītre de toute faēon.
Et c'est trčs noble.
Si tu empźchais les forźts tropicales
de devenir des parkings,
oł stationnerions-nous nos voitures ?
<i>Rockuppé. Mon vieux, que...</i>
<i>Les suivants, Marshmallow et Lylipad.</i>
<i>Certaines choses valent la peine
d'źtre préservées.</i>
<i>Mais la vraie question est la suivante.
Il est 2 h.</i>
<i>Tes amis chantent au karaoké,
mais tu rentres tōt,</i>
<i>car tu attends un appel de l'Allemagne
de ta copine</i>
<i>qui devait appeler il y a quatre heures.</i>
<i>Puis le téléphone sonne.</i>
Allō ?
Salut, Ted, c'est Robin.
Écoute, je sais qu'il est tard,
mais peux-tu venir chez moi ?
<i>Que fais-tu ? Vas-y.</i>
When your Uncle Marshall was ten years old,
he read a book called Life Among the Gorillas.
It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez,
and it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon.
When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture,
Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question.
What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist?
So you want to be an anthropologist?
Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did.
What she said next changed his life.
Oh, that's wonderful, but I'm afraid you can't.
They'll all be dead by then.
...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced,
the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out.
So you don't want coffee?
I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible...
- All right. I'm pouring it out.
- Okay, one cup.
The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything.
I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us.
"The kid" has become "the man."
Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money.
After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC.
They're gonna stop global warming.
Well... I mean... they did their best.
Here's your sack lunch.
Okay, I love you because, one, you made me a sack lunch
and two, you laugh every time you say the word "sack".
- I love you, Marshmallow.
- I love you.
I love you too, Marshmallow.
Uh-oh.
Ted?
Oh, no. No, she didn't.
Yeah. Yeah, she did.
Another care package?
Another care package.
I'd been in a long-distance relationship with Victoria for nearly a month.
Long-distance relationships are a bad idea.
How many is that so far?
Three.
And how many have you sent her?
In the mail or in my mind?
Zero. She's up three-zip.
Oh! Cupcakes!
Great. I bet they're delicious, too.
Yup, they're delicious.
Damn it!
I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes.
God, I hate myself right now.
God, that is so me at 15.
Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel.
Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls.
I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things...
But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff.
Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department
because he knew someone who worked there.
Go for Barney.
Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security.
Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building.
A sasquatch?
That's right, sir, a Bigfoot.
We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor.
Yes!
Look at you.
You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.
Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.
Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness...
There's one for awesomeness?
Yeah, I had it made.
Sit.
Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is?
Please.
- My dawg!
- My dawg!
Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall. These guys are in legal.
You're gonna be working with them.
Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you.
Nice tie. Steak sauce.
Oh, steak sauce! For true, though.
Where, I don't, I don't see...
Marshall? Sidebar.
Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.
Okay, Eriksen, let's get to work. It's 2:00 a.m. It's raining outside.
Ding dong! What? The doorbell?
Oh, hello, Jessica Alba in a trench coat and nothing else.
But wait-- knock, knock. Somebody's at the back door?
I don't have a back door.
Oh, my gosh, Jessica Simpson? What a surprise.
Two Jessicas, you gotta pick one. What do you do? Go.
Right. Well, uh... I'm engaged, so--
Fiancee's out of town. What do you do? Go.
We're still engaged, even if she's...
Okay, fiancee's dead. Hit by a bus. What do you do? Go.
Sure you don't want one?
How many of those have you eaten?
Four. Teen. No, just four.
And the icing from two more.
So, anyway, here's the problem.
Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep.
Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great.
Here, listen...
Mmm. Mmm!
So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake...
And... I said something dumb.
Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail.
I sent it a couple days ago.
And it's awesome.
Really, really awesome.
Why did I say that?
I think frosting makes me lie.
Oh, Teddy boy.
Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her.
So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.
All right, here's what you do:
Put together a care package of stuff from New York--
some H&H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain...
and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready?
From three days ago.
That's brilliant.
You're brilliant.
You know, it's funny, not so long ago,
I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you.
That is funny.
And here's why it was funny.
Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier,
here's what Robin was saying to Lily about me.
Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.
Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.
The irony is clear, Ted.
Hey! How was your first day?
I don't wanna talk about it.
The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.
- What?
- They're jerks!
What makes them jerks?
Forget it, I don't want to talk about it.
Well, like today at lunch..
What do you got there, Ericksen? Mommy pack your lunch?
For your information, my fiancee did.
Oh... Does she cut the crusts off your sandwich, too?
No.
What's that?
Nothing.
Give it.
"Dear Marshmallow. Good luck today. I love you. Lilypad."
Give it.
P.S. If you've unfolded this note, your kiss already got out. Quick-- catch it."
Give it back. Hey, give it. Gimme... Give it!
Oh, screw those guys! We're adorable.
I know. God.
It's like freshman year all over again.
Only this time, my sweet dance moves aren't going to be enough to win them over.
Not even Old Reliable.
Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money,
but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.
I quit.
What? No. We're having so much fun.
You, me, working together. It's great.
We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're...
Seriously, what is it that you do?
Please.
I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.
Oh, of course it's not for you.
It's for Lily.
What?
Marshall. Lily's a catch.
But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?
The package?
The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school.
A vacation once in a while.
Lily doesn't care about that stuff.
Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years,
when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary
while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.
She'll be happy.
Okay.
But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.
And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go.
I guess, uh...
Bea Arthur.
Ahh! Wrong! Betty White.
Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.
So, did she get the awesome care package yet?
Yep. Yesterday.
Did she love it?
Ooh, she loved it.
So what's the problem?
So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you,
we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half.
Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.
What did you have for lunch today?
Oh. Rye bread.
Yeah.
Oh, Teddy boy.
I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch.
Maybe it just can't be done.
I think it's clear what I have to do.
It's pretty clear.
I have to go to Germany and surprise her.
Totally what I was thinking.
Get out of my head, man!
Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?
Marshall, consider the penguins.
The penguins?
On the wall.
"Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold."
This is a motivational poster?
Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy.
And you know why? Because you're different.
Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are,
or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.
Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational.
Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled,
but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas.
I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them.
It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?
It sounds kinda like peer pressure.
No, no, no. It's totally anthropological
and it's cool and I'm doing it.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year.
I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure.
All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say?
- Only when I'm drunk.
- Good boy.
And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla,
and that meant gorilla lessons.
Okay, I'm psyched about this.
But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.
Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched.
Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it.
Show it.
I'm psyched!
What was that?
Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure.
That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting
at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.
Wow, that was really specific.
Show me you're psyched!
Let's do this!
- Ow! That hurt!
- So badly.
And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.
Right. Get what done?
Whatever.
Cool.
And what guy is this?
There's always a guy.
Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.
You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?
All right.
So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa,
and they're all, "Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs."
So I'm, like, "Snapadoo!"
So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport...
...and that is when the bouncer kicked us out.
Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring?
Worth every penny, bruh.
Eriksen...
...that was steak sauce!
Great story.
The next moning, I was about to buy my ticket to Germany when I got an e-mail.
Uh-oh.
"Hey, Ted, sorry I missed your call last night.
This long-distance thing sucks, huh?
Listen, I've been thinking and I really need to talk to you tonight.
I'll call you at 11:00. Victoria."
So?
So she's going to dump me.
Has anyone ever said, "Listen, I've been thinking,"
and then follow it up with something good?
It's not like: Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie.
What else can it be?
What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail?
I cut off all my fingers?
Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it.
I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident.
I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.
Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy.
So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?
I'd wait.
'Sup, Blauman? E-bomb here.
We still on for karaoke?
Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy.
Catch you on the flip, butt puppet.
Okay...
...what do you think?
Steak sauce.
Steak sauce?
Yeah.
Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business,
but please don't act like that around here.
Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-...
No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas,
she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces.
I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office.
Why?
Because you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame.
Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes,
but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that.
Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay?
Okay.
But wait, knock-knock, back door, who's there?
Angelina Jolie... wait, in a wheelchair.
What do you do? Go.
Dude, Scarlett Johannsen with no arms, any day of the week.
Yeah.
You're right. They're delightful.
So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?
Nah. I'm so over karaoke.
Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.
Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really.
But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.
Oh, baby, they have our song.
Let's do "Don't Go Breaking My Heart."
What?
"Don't Go Breaking My Heart." Elton John, Kiki Dee.
No way. You got to go with some Black Sabbath.
Well, actually, Marshall and I have this little dance routine.
"Iron Man." I could do "Iron Man."
Steak sauce.
Steak sauce, dude.
Should we tell him?
All right, Eriksen, I've got some good news.
On Monday, Bilson and I are going to talk to Montague in HR.
When you graduate, we want you working with us.
What do you say?
- Yes!
- That's my man!
I told you he would.
Aw, we're gonna own the office.
Okay, that was gross.
When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path?
Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment.
I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years.
We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools.
You could quit your job and focus on your painting.
I know that you say you don't need it, but...
I love you and I want to give it to you anyway.
I want to give you the package.
The package?! You've already given me the package.
You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package.
Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package.
Your package has always been big enough.
You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen,
but you've got a huge package.
Yeah.
Hello.
Why hasn't she called yet?
Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night.
Go out and do something.
No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now.
Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.
I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.
She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome.
Thanks.
Anyway, it's almost 11:00. I should let you go.
Break a leg.
And so I was sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring, something occurred to me.
I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.
He's giving you the blues
You want to graduate, but not in his bed
Here's what you got to do
Pick up the phone...
Marshall.
Hey, hey.
Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How you doing?
I think Victoria's about to break up with me.
Oh, God, I'm sorry, man.
Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like.
The more I try to picture her, the more I can't.
Like, I remember how she makes me feel.
I just... I don't completely remember her.
It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.
Preserving something that's already gone.
Sounds like environmental law.
I don't know.
We struggle so hard to hold onto these things
that we know are going to disappear eventually.
And that's really noble,
but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot,
well, then where are you going to park your car?
Done dirt cheap!
Dirty deeds
Done dirt cheap!
Dirty deeds
Done dirt cheap!
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, ow
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap...
Uh, rockupied. Dude, what...?
Next up, Marshmallow and Lillypad.
Don't go breakin' my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey, if I get restless
Baby, you're not that kind...
It turns out some things are worth preserving.
But here's the real question:
It's 2:00 a.m. Your friends are still out singing karaoke,
but you're home early 'cause you're expecting a call from your girlfriend in Germany,
who was supposed to call four hours ago.
And then the phone rings.
Hello.
Hi, Ted. It's Robin.
Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh,
do you want to come over?
What do you do? Go.

<i>Dans l'épisode précédent...</i>
<i>Elle était totalement épatante.</i>
<i>Elle était épatante et drôle et...</i>
- Tu as des sentiments pour Ted ?
- Peut-être.
J'ai reçu une bourse pour étudier
dans un institut culinaire en Allemagne.
- Tu veux une relation à distance ?
- Oui !
"C'est énervant
ces longues distances, hein ?
"J'ai bien réfléchi,
et il faut que je te parle ce soir."
- Elle va me laisser.
- Elle ne va pas te laisser, Ted.
Allô ?
Peux-tu venir chez moi ?
<i>Les enfants,
votre grand-mère me disait souvent:</i>
<i>"Rien de bon ne se passe après 2 h."</i>
<i>Elle avait raison. Quand 2 h sonnent,</i>
<i>rentrez dormir à la maison.</i>
<i>À titre d'exemple...</i>
2 h
- Allô ?
- Salut, Ted, c'est Robin.
Écoute, je sais qu'il est tard,
mais peux-tu venir chez moi ?
<i>Retournons un peu en arrière.</i>
Vingt heures plus tôt
Assis.
Bons garçons. D'accord.
Ne touchez pas à ma réserve d'alcool.
À plus tard.
La vie d'une journaliste de télévision est
très gratifiante
et je vous encourage à penser
à faire carrière dans ce domaine.
Merci.
- Oui.
- Avez-vous un fiancé ?
Marshall est venu hier.
Ils viennent d'apprendre le mot "fiancé".
Non, je n'ai pas de fiancé.
Alors, avec qui habitez-vous ?
Eh bien, j'ai cinq chiens.
Vous ne vous sentez pas seule ?
Non, j'ai cinq chiens.
Ma grand-maman a cinq chats
et elle se sent seule.
Oui, c'est bien les chats.
Je ne suis pas une triste femme à chats.
Non pas que ta grand-mère soit...
Est-ce que quelqu'un d'autre a...
- Oui.
- Êtes-vous lesbienne ?
Non, et toi ? Si une femme vit seule,
ça ne veut pas dire que...
D'accord. On applaudit Robin,
la journaliste !
Notre prochain invité est un autre ami...
Robin, tu couvres parfois les désastres ?
Je viens d'en voir un. Tape là, petit.
Ris pendant qu'il en est encore temps.
Ce sont des monstres. Ils auront ta peau.
Son travail, c'est de faire...
- C'est quoi, ton travail ?
- S'il te plaît.
Les enfants, parlons un peu.
Vous ne vous intéressez pas
à ce que je fais dans la vie, hein ?
- Non.
- Non. Je sais ce que vous voulez.
- Des tours de magie.
- Oui !
- Allô ?
- Pourquoi elle n'appelle pas ?
Tu vas te rendre malade.
C'est samedi soir.
Sors, fais quelque chose.
Pourquoi je sortirais ? J'ai une copine.
Pour l'instant.
Si je sors, qui écoutera les infos ?
Je suis la moitié du public.
Je suis flattée que tu penses
qu'on a deux téléspectateurs.
Nous sommes prêts.
Alors, Scherbatsky. Tu as un copain ?
Non, et pourquoi tout le monde
me demande ça, aujourd'hui ?
Je pensais que le gars au téléphone...
Quoi ? Non, c'était Ted.
Ce n'est qu'un ami.
On a failli sortir ensemble à une époque,
mais on n'a pas les mêmes priorités.
Sa copine est maintenant en Allemagne
et il croit qu'elle va le larguer,
mais je ne pense pas.
Et de toute façon,
on n'a pas les mêmes priorités.
- On devrait coucher ensemble.
- Quoi ?
Pourquoi pas ?
On est tous les deux disponibles,
attirants et bons au lit.
Du moins, je le suis.
Et si tu ne l'es pas, ne t'en fais pas.
Je prendrai mon pied quand même.
Même sans l'image horrifiante
de tes cheveux en forme de casque
frappant la tête de lit,
je ne fréquente pas mes collègues.
Qui parle de se fréquenter ?
J'ai dit qu'on devrait s'envoyer en l'air.
- Dans cinq, quatre...
- Excitant.
Le sexe est excitant.
Mon numéro. Appelle quand tu veux.
Plusieurs équipes locales en action ce soir.
Salut, les gars.
Je vous ai manqué ?
Vous m'avez manqué aussi.
Salut, Ted, c'est Robin.
Écoute, je sais qu'il est tard,
mais peux-tu venir chez moi ?
- Ted ?
- Oui. Salut, je suis là.
- Peux-tu venir chez moi ?
- Pourquoi ? Que se passe-t-il ?
Je viens d'installer
mon nouveau press-fruits,
et j'allais faire du jus quand je me suis dit:
"Sais-tu qui aime le jus ? Ted."
J'adore le jus.
Veux-tu venir chez moi
pour qu'on fasse du jus ensemble ?
<i>Quand il est passé 2 h, rentrez dormir.</i>
<i>Parce qu'après 2 h,
on prend de mauvaises décisions.</i>
Oui, je vais chez toi. On va faire
- du jus.
- Oui, on va faire du jus.
- D'accord.
- À tout de suite.
Salut.
C'est bien. Tout va bien.
Qu'est-ce qui est bien ?
Je m'en vais chez une fille
pour faire du jus.
Chanceux.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
On fait du jus en amis.
Vous voyez, j'ai une copine.
Je ne pourrais jamais la tromper.
Elle habite en Allemagne.
Elle devait m'appeler il y a quatre heures
pour qu'on discute sérieusement.
Mais je n'ai pas eu de nouvelles.
Je ne sais pas trop.
Désolé de vous embêter
avec mes problèmes.
Les chauffeurs de taxi ont remplacé
les barmans, hein ?
À qui le dis-tu, le jeune.
Un petit coup ?
Laissez-moi descendre ici.
- Où allez-vous ?
- Park Slope, coin 8e et 8e.
Voici où je me suis arrêté
avec l'autre chauffeur.
J'ai une copine, mais je m'en vais
chez une autre fille...
Et tu te demandes si je serais fâchée.
Salut, Ted. Tu te souviens de moi ?
Ta copine.
Calme-toi. Robin n'est qu'une amie.
Oui. Et vous allez faire du jus.
Oui, oui. Le jus, c'est inoffensif.
C'est même bon pour la santé.
Alors pourquoi te demandes-tu
de quoi elle a l'air toute nue ?
Je ne me demande pas...
Mais si je me le demande,
c'est parce que tu m'y as fait penser.
Je ne suis qu'une manifestation
de ton subconscient,
alors tu t'y es fait penser toi-même.
Merde !
Il ne va rien se passer.
- D'accord.
- Tu veux un deuxième avis ?
D'accord.
Salut. Elle a téléphoné ?
Non. J'ai besoin qu'on tranche pour moi.
Je... C'est stupide.
Ce n'est même pas important,
mais je m'en vais chez Robin
en ce moment.
Elle a un nouveau press-fruits.
On va l'essayer.
Laisse-moi te rappeler.
Chérie, je sens qu'une crise se prépare.
Tu te rappelles le secret
que tu m'as confié,
même si tu n'étais pas censée en parler ?
Au sujet de Robin ?
Le fait que Robin aime Ted ?
Le fait que Robin aime Ted ?
- Quoi ?
- Quoi ?
Oui, elle me l'a dit. Continuez.
Il n'y a qu'à moi qu'elle n'a rien dit ?
Elle t'en a parlé, et pas à moi ?
Je dois être plus proche d'elle que toi.
Je suis plus proche de Ted que toi.
- Menteur.
- Je ne mens pas.
- C'est bon. Toi et moi, dehors.
- Tu penses me battre ?
Je n'ai pas peur ! Tu es une honte...
Je vais t'en montrer des choses !
Allez. Décroche.
Merde, Victoria. Où es-tu ?
Décroche ! Décroche !
- Un petit gâteau ?
- Non, merci.
Où es-tu ? Pourquoi n'as-tu pas appelé ?
Je suis sortie draguer.
Avec trois autres gars.
Ou peut-être bien que je te suis dévouée
et que je t'appelle en ce moment.
Oui. Pourquoi j'en doute ?
- Allô ?
- Ted. Je viens de voir les nouvelles
et un camion plein d'acide sulfurique
s'est renversé devant chez Robin.
<i>Ça fait fondre le trottoir.</i>
On voit jusqu'en enfer.
C'est horrible. Rentre à la maison.
Ça va, Marshall. Il ne se passera rien.
- Ted, que dit toujours ta mère ?
- Que rien de bon...
Rien de bon ne se passe après 2 h.
Rentre chez toi ! Il est tard pour le jus.
Robin et moi sommes amis.
Elle ne s'intéresse même pas à moi.
Oui, elle s'intéresse à toi ! Elle t'aime.
Elle me l'a dit.
- Quoi ?
- C'est un grand secret.
Ne lui dis pas que je te l'ai dit,
mais elle se sent très vulnérable.
Et tu as une copine.
Rentre à la maison, Ted.
<i>- Elle m'aime ?
- Oui.</i>
<i>Alors ce serait une très mauvaise idée
que tu ailles chez elle.</i>
<i>Rentre à la maison, Ted.</i>
Elle m'aime ?
Rentre à la maison, Ted.
Tu as raison. On se verra à la maison.
Bon. Il rentre à la maison.
Il ne rentre certainement pas.
Je ne peux pas croire que tu lui aies dit ça.
- Comment ça ?
- Lily, tu lui as dit:
"Ted, fais ce que tu veux,
"mais ne va pas chez une belle fille
qui veut coucher avec toi."
Et après, elle va te faire
un délicieux jus maison !
Non, il n'ira pas.
Il a assez de jugeote pour ça.
<i>J'avais assez de jugeote.</i>
- Gardez la monnaie. Merci.
- Merci.
<i>Mais passé 2 h, ma jugeote dormait.</i>
Alors, ça y est ? Tu montes ?
Veux-tu bien me laisser passer ?
Je ne suis pas dans ton chemin.
Tu sais, si tu m'avais appelé, je...
- Salut !
- Salut.
J'ai des légumes:
Des carottes et des betteraves.
Ou sinon, on pourrait boire du vin.
Buvins-en.
Je n'ai jamais fait pire jeu de mots.
Merci.
Un grand verre.
Bien sûr.
Alors, quoi de neuf ? "Quoi de neuf ?"
As-tu déjà vécu une de ces journées
où rien de spécial ne se produit,
mais où pourtant, à la fin,
tu ne sais plus trop qui tu es,
ni ce que tu fais de ta vie ?
Ça t'arrive d'avoir une journée comme ça ?
Environ une fois par semaine.
Je ne sais pas. C'était une dure journée,
et la seule personne que j'avais envie
de voir à la fin, c'était toi.
Alors, comment s'est passé
le grand appel avec ta copine ?
<i>Quand 2 h sonne, allez dormir.</i>
On a rompu.
Quoi ?
Oui. Oui, elle a fini par appeler.
On a parlé un moment,
combien c'est dur à cette distance,
et puis, elle a dit qu'elle me laissait.
Ted, je suis désolée.
C'est terrible.
Je me sens mal pour toi.
Tu souris.
Je souris ? Non, voyons.
Je suis lectrice de nouvelles.
Sourire fait partie du métier.
L'avalanche d'aujourd'hui a fait
des milliers de morts.
Tu vois ?
Tu souris aussi.
Oui.
J'ignore pourquoi.
Cet Elvis coréen est génial, non ?
Je vais répondre. Totalement.
Il est totalement génial.
Bon, c'est l'heure d'aller au lit.
Quoi ? Non. Il est 2 h 30.
Et rien de bon ne se passe après 2 h.
Vous savez, selon mon expérience,
les meilleures choses de la vie
se passent après 2 h.
Quand je repense
à mes plus beaux souvenirs,
l'incident à la Cloche de la liberté,
la petite chamaille à l'ambassade russe,
- ma presque orgie.
- Tu n'as jamais fait ça.
- J'ai dit: "Presque orgie" !
- D'accord.
Tout ça s'est passé après 2 h.
Après 2 h, les choses deviennent,
dites-le avec moi, légendaires !
- On doit y aller.
- Pardon ? "lntéressante théorie, Barney,
"mais je veux des preuves." D'accord.
Elvis coréen. Veux-tu prendre un verre
avec mes amis et moi ?
Rock 'n' roll.
Ça commence comme ça.
Hé ! J'ai un nouveau téléphone.
Pareil au tien. Regarde.
Ah, oui. L'aimes-tu ?
Oui, oui.
Que de banalités.
L'autre téléphone était correct,
mais en même temps,
une petite partie de moi
voulait vraiment celui-ci.
Ce téléphone
est fait pour moi.
Ouah ! Bizarre.
Je devrais répondre.
Je reste ici.
- Allô ?
- Ted, ici ton ami E.C.
Je veux que tu ramènes tes fesses
par ici. Compris ?
Désolé.
Est-ce que c'était le Elvis coréen ?
Je t'expliquerai.
On s'en va au pub MacLaren's.
Je suis chez Robin.
Oui, et j'ai peut-être fait une gaffe.
Je viens de mentir et de lui dire
que j'ai rompu avec Victoria.
Ted, je ne veux pas jurer
devant le Elvis coréen,
mais qu'est-ce que tu fais,
espèce de censuré ?
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Il s'agit de Robin !
Victoria est chouette,
mais il s'agit de Robin !
J'ai décidé que je vais rompre
avec Victoria.
- Tu vas le faire ?
- Demain matin.
Mais pour le moment,
il est 2 h 45 et tu as une copine.
Ted, je t'aime et j'aime Robin.
Mais si tu fais ça,
toute ta relation avec elle sera bâtie
sur un crime !
<i>Rentre à la maison, Ted.
Il y a une meilleure façon de faire !</i>
Je déteste ça quand tu as raison.
C'est ma qualité la plus agaçante.
D'accord.
Je rentre. On se voit bientôt.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Je devrais y aller. Il est tard.
- Je suis désolé. Je...
- Non, je comprends. Ça va.
- Je peux t'appeler demain ?
- Bien sûr.
- D'accord. Appelle-moi demain.
- Oui.
- Bonne nuit, Robin.
- Bonne nuit, Ted.
Mon Dieu ! On est vraiment passionnés.
- En effet !
- C'est fou.
En effet ! En effet !
On va dans ma chambre ?
Il y a déjà cinq chiens, mais...
- Oui.
- Oui ?
Oui.
Il faut que j'aille à la toilette.
Je fais ça vite.
D'accord.
Arrête de faire ça !
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je t'appelle.
On va rompre.
Je vais rompre immédiatement.
Je serai célibataire
en sortant de la toilette.
D'accord.
Ted, combien de temps crois-tu
que cette conversation va durer ?
Le temps qu'il faut pour faire pipi ? Non.
On va être au téléphone
pendant au moins 20 minutes.
Robin est là.
Elle va penser que tu fais un énorme...
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Ça arrive que des gens se séparent.
Pas comme ça.
Pas en direct de la salle de bain
de la fille que tu t'apprêtes à baiser.
Ce n'est pas l'idéal.
<i>Pendant ce temps, au bar,</i>
<i>Barney essayait de prouver que de bonnes
choses se passent après 2 h.</i>
Allez, Lily !
Combien de femmes se sont fait
chanter la pomme par le Elvis coréen ?
Je crois qu'il vient de me cracher dessus.
Barney, tu as essayé. C'est bon.
Mais on s'en va.
- Non. Non, allez !
- Oui !
On n'a pas atteint le stade du légendaire,
seulement le "lé".
Il nous reste le "gen", le "dai" et le "re".
Bon, si on est au "lé",
c'est peut-être le temps
de "lésser" cet endroit et de rentrer.
Ouah ! Tu t'es fait avoir
par la phonétique !
Non, non, non.
Ne pars pas, beauté.
- Rien qu'une danse, d'accord ?
- Non, vraiment.
Je sais ce qui te plairait.
<i>Barney avait donc raison.</i>
<i>La soirée fut légendaire.</i>
<i>On s'en souviendrait comme du soir
où Lily a botté les couilles du Elvis coréen.</i>
Vous vous rappelez le soir où Lily a botté
les couilles du Elvis coréen ?
Tu as raison.
Tu as raison.
Tu mérites un appel sérieux.
Je vais t'appeler demain.
Bien. Alors, tu vas rentrer ?
Pourquoi faut-il que je rentre ?
C'est très probable que Robin soit
la femme que j'épouserai.
- Ted.
- Ça se pourrait !
Ça va changer quoi, dans 50 ans,
qu'on ait commencé un soir trop tôt ?
Je sais que c'est discutable,
d'un point de vue moral, mais
il s'agit de Robin.
Et je suis épuisé.
Je suis épuisé à force de prétendre
que je ne l'aime pas.
Je crois que ça compense.
Voyons donc. Tu veux juste baiser !
Oui, en effet. Tu as deviné.
C'est en plein ce que je veux.
Et alors ?
J'en ai envie. Elle en a envie.
On va le faire. Et si ça te pose problème,
tu n'avais qu'à ne pas être en Allemagne.
Heureux d'avoir fait semblant de te parler.
Merci de ne pas m'avoir appelé,
et bonne nuit.
Ce n'est pas ton téléphone.
Ce n'est pas mon téléphone.
D'accord. Au revoir.
Je pensais que c'était le mien,
alors j'ai répondu.
- Était-ce...
- C'était ta copine.
Tu devrais peut-être la rappeler.
<i>J'ai rappelé Victoria dans le taxi,
et on a rompu.</i>
Oui, je suis...
<i>Et voilà, les enfants.</i>
<i>La chose la plus stupide
que j'aie jamais faite.</i>
<i>En une nuit, j'ai fait de la peine
à deux personnes qui m'étaient chères.</i>
<i>Et rien de cela ne serait arrivé
si j'avais écouté ma mère.</i>
<i>J'imagine que s'il y a une leçon à en tirer,</i>
<i>c'est qu'après 2 h,</i>
<i>mieux vaut aller dormir.</i>
Previously on How I Met Your Mother:
She was completely amazing.
She was amazing and funny and...
You have feelings for Ted.
Maybe.
I've just been offered a fellowhip at a culinary institute in Germany.
Do you want to try long distance?
Yes.
"This long-distance thing sucks, huh?
And I really need to talk to you tonight."
She's going to dump me!
She's not going to break up with you, Ted.
Hello?
Do you want to come over?
Kids, your grandma always used to say to me,
"Nothing good happens after 2:00 a.m.,"
and she was right.
When 2:00 a.m. rolls around, just go home and go to sleep.
Case in point:
Hello.
Hi, Ted, it's Robin.
Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?
Let's back up a little bit.
Sit.
Good boys.
Okay, remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet.
I'll see you tonight.
And so the life of a television reporter is very rewarding,
and I stronly urge you to consider it as a career.
Thank you.
Yeah?
Do you have a fiancé?
Marshall was here yesterday.
They just learned the word "fiancé."
Oh, no, I don't have a fiancé.
Then who do you live with?
Well, actually, I've got five dogs.
Don't you get lonely?
No, I've got five dogs.
My grandma has five cats and she gets lonely.
Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady.
Not that your grandmother is...
Does anyone else have a...? Yes?
- Are you a lesbian?
- No. Are you?
Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les...
Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter.
All right, our next guest is another friend...
So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one.
What up? Tiny five.
Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters.
They're going to eat you alive.
He has a job doing...
What do you do?
Please.
Kids, let's rap.
You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you?
- No.
- No, no.
I know what you want.
Magic.
Hello.
Why hasn't she called yet?
Okay, you're making yourself crazy.
It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.
What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now.
Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news?
I'm, like, half your viewership.
I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.
And we're clear.
So, Scherbotsky, got a boyfriend?
No, and why does this keep coming up today?
Oh, I just thought that guy you were on the phone with...
What? Oh, no, that was Ted. He's just a friend.
I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated,
but we want completely different things.
Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany
and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is.
And besides, we want completely different things.
We should have sex.
- What?
- Why not?
We're both available, we're both attractive, we're both good at it.
At least, I'm good at it.
And even if you're not, don't worry, I'll have a good time either way.
Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard,
don't get involved with people I work with.
Get involved? Who said get involved?
I'm just saying we should have sex, it could be fun.
Having sex is fun.
Home number. Call me anytime.
A lot of local teens in action tonight...
Hey, guys.
Miss me?
I missed you, too.
Hi, Ted, it's Robin.
Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?
Ted?
Uh, yeah... Uh, hi, I'm here.
Do you want to come over?
Why? What's up?
Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer
and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like,
"You know who likes juice? Ted."
I love juice.
Great. So you want to come over and make juice?
When it's after 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep
because the decisions you make after 2:00 a.m. are the wrong decisions.
Okay, sure. I'll come over. We'll... juice.
Yes, we'll juice.
O kay.
Okay... bye.
Bye.
This is fine. This is totally fine.
What's fine?
Oh, I'm, uh, going over to this girl's house to make some juice.
Nice.
No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends.
See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her.
She lives in Germany.
See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk.
I still haven't heard from her.
I don't know.
Sorry to bug you with my problems.
Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?
You ain't kidding, kid.
Want a nip?
You can just let me out right up here.
Where you going to, buddy?
Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth.
Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy.
See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house...
And you're wondering if I'd be upset.
Hi, Ted. Remember me, your girlfriend?
Okay, relax, Robin's just a friend.
Right. You're going to go make some juice.
Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless.
In fact, it's healthy.
Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering what she looks like naked?
I am not won...
Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head.
Ah, but I'm just a manifestation of your subconscious,
so actually, you put it in your own head.
Damn it!
Nothing's going to happen.
Right.
Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine.
Hey, did she call?
No. I need a ruling.
Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but
I'm on my way over to Robin's right now.
She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out.
Let me call you back.
Honey, there's a situation developing.
Do you remember the huge secret that you told me
that you weren't supposed to but you did?
The thing... about Robin?
Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?
- What?
- What?
Yeah, she told me already. Go on.
Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell?
She told you and not me?
Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are.
Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are.
- That is a lie!
- It is not a lie.
Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you!
I'll show you things you never seen before!
I used to box in the Army!
Come on, pick up.
Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up!
Cupcake?
No, thanks.
Where are you? Why haven't you called?
Oh, I'm out hooking up...
with three other guys.
Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend and I'm calling you right now.
Yeah. Why do I doubt that?
Hello.
Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid
overturned right in front of Robin's house.
And it's melting through the sidewalk.
You can see straight down into hell. It's bad.
You should go home, dude.
Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.
Ted, what does your mom always say?
Nothing good ever...
Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice.
Dude, Robin and I are just friends.
She doesn't even like me that way.
Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.
What?
It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you,
but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend.
Go home, Ted.
She-she likes me?
Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there.
Go home, Ted.
She likes me?
Go home, Ted.
Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home.
Good. He's going home.
He is so not going home.
I cannot believe you just told him that.
What do you mean?
Lily, here's what you just said:
"Ted, whatever you do, don't go up there.
There's a beautiful girl who wants to have sex with you."
"And then she's gonna make you some delicious juice."
No, he's not going up there. He has more sense than that.
I did have more sense than that.
Keep the change.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
But after 2:00 a.m, my good sense was sound asleep.
So you're doing this? You're going up there?
You want to get out of the way?
I'm not in the way.
You know, if you had just called me, I...
- Hi.
- Hi.
Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets.
Or we could just drink wine.
Wine... not?
Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
Thanks.
Make it a big glass.
Sure.
So, how's it hanging?
Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens
but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore
or what the hell you're doing with your life?
Do you ever have one of those days?
Uh, about once a week.
I don't know, it was just a, a rough day
and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you.
So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?
When the clock strikes 2:00, just go to sleep.
We broke up.
What?
Yeah. Yeah, she finally called.
We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is--
and then... she dumped me.
Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.
You're smiling.
Am I? No I'm not.
I'm a news anchor.
Smiling's a part of the job.
Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today.
See?
You're smiling, too.
Yeah.
I have no idea what that's all about.
# There's got to be a morning after... #
How much does Korean Elvis rock?
I'll answer that.
Infinity.
He rocks... infinity.
Okay, it's time for bed.
What? No. It's 2:30.
Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.
You know, I have found, in my travels...
that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m.
When I look back at the best stories of my life--
the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy,
- the almost four-way.
- You never had a four-way.
I said "almost."
All those things happened after 2:00 a.m.
because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary.
We're going home.
What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof?
Okay.
Korean Elvis.
How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?
Rock 'n' roll.
And it begins.
So, um... Hey. I got a new phone.
Same as yours. Look.
Oh, yeah. Do you like it?
Yeah. Yeah.
This is some solid small talk.
I had that other phone, and it was good,
but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead.
This phone... um...
feels right.
Wow. Weird.
Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.
I'll be here.
Hello?
Ted, this is your main man, K.E.
I want you to shake your tail feathers down here ASAP, you dig?
Sorry about that.
Was that Korean Elvis?
I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.
Um... Actually...
I'm at Robin's.
Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad.
I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.
Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis,
but what the bleep are you doing, dude?
What do you expect from me? It's Robin.
Victoria's great, but, it's Robin.
I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.
Gonna?
Yes. First thing tomorrow.
Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2:45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend.
Ted, I love you. I love Robin.
But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime.
Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way.
I hate how you're always right.
It's my best and most annoying trait.
Okay.
I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I should probably get going. It's pretty late.
- I'm sorry. I...
- Oh. Oh, no. I understand.
It's fine. Yeah.
Can I call you tomorrow?
Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.
Okay. Good night, Robin.
Good night, Ted.
Oh, my God. We're making out.
- Right.
- This is crazy.
Right? Right?
Should we go to my room?
I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.
Okay.
Stop doing that.
Whatcha doin'?
I'm calling you.
We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now,
I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.
Okay.
Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be?
Length of an average pee?
No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes.
Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive...
What do you want from me?
People break up. It happens.
Not like this.
Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.
It's not ideal.
Meanwhile, back at the bar,
Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2:00 a.m.
Come on, Lily.
How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?
I think he just spat on me.
Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.
- No! No, come on.
- Yes!
Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the "le".
We still got the "gen." The "da." The "ry."
Okay, if we're at the "le," then I say we follow it up with a "t's go home."
Oh, wow, you just got burned, phonics style.
No, no, no, no, no. Baby, baby, baby, don't go.
Just one dance, huh?
Okay, seriously.
Hey, I know what you like.
And so, Barney was right-- the night was legendary.
It would come to be known as The Time Lily Kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards.
Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?
You're right.
I owe you a real breakup call.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Good.
So you're gonna go home?
Why should I have to go home?
You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.
Ted.
It could happen.
And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night?
Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but...
It's Robin.
And I'm exhausted.
I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her.
I think that makes this okay.
Oh, please. You just want to get laid.
Yes, I do. You got me.
That is exactly what I want right now. And so what?
I want this. She wants this.
It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany.
It's been nice pretending to talk to you.
Thanks for not calling me and good night.
That's not your phone.
This isn't my phone.
Okay. Bye.
I thought it was mine, so I answered it.
Was it...?
It was your girlfriend.
You might want to call her back.
I called Victoria from the cab and we broke up.
Yes...
And there you have it, kids.
The stupidest thing I've ever done.
In one night, I managed to hurt two people I cared about.
And none of it would've happened if I just listened to my mom.
So I guess if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's this:
when it's 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep.

Son CD prťfťrť du coffret Otis Redding ?
Le 3e.
3 mois auparavant
Mon prťfťrť ? Devinez ? Quelqu'un ?
Allez. Le 3e !
Victoria est si ťpatante
que je pourrais en parler sans arrÍt.
Comment Áa, "pourrais" ?
Je suis dťsolť. C'est juste que...
Je suis fou de cette fille.
Je me sens comme si, peut-Ítre...
- Je ne veux pas le dire.
- Fie-toi ŗ ton instinct, Ted.
Quelque chose d'assez chouette
vient de se produire.
Mon reportage
sur Pickles le chien chantant
est mis en nomination au gala
des mťdias locaux.
- Ceux qui rapportent les histoires nulles ?
- On prťfŤre dire mťdias locaux.
Il va y avoir un grand banquet.
Je sais que ces genres d'ťvťnements
sont ennuyeux,
mais Áa serait important pour moi
que vous veniez.
Eh bien...
Il y aura un bar ouvert.
- Ah ! Oui !
- J'y vais !
Rťserve-moi deux places.
- Vraiment ? C'est dans trois mois.
- Je sais.
Mais, les amis, je vais le dire.
Je pense que Victoria et moi,
c'est pour longtemps.
Trois mois plus tard
Victoria va me manquer.
Je ne devrais pas y aller.
Robin est encore f‚chťe contre moi
parce que, vous savez...
Tu as dit que c'ťtait fini
avec Victoria avant que Áa ne le soit
pour essayer de te taper Robin
et tu as perdu les deux filles en une soirťe.
Oui, c'est ce que je voulais dire par:
"Vous savez..."
Je ne l'ai pas vue depuis trois semaines.
Elle ne m'appelle pas.
- Je ne devrais pas y aller.
- Tu devrais y aller.
C'est l'occasion de montrer
que tu es son ami et que tu l'appuies.
Ou de la rendre folle
en te faisant escorter par une superbe fille.
Ou trois fois mieux:
Superbe avec d'ťnormes seins.
- «a n'est que deux fois mieux.
- Refais le calcul.
Je n'irai pas accompagnť
mÍme si je le voulais.
C'est dans deux heures.
- Trouve une escorte.
- Par escorte, tu veux dire prostituťe ?
- Pourquoi pas ?
- Parce que c'est dťgoŻtant ?
Comment Áa, dťgoŻtant ?
Tu as un blocage puritain
sur la prostitution ?
C'est le plus vieux mťtier du monde, l'ami.
- Tu crois vraiment Áa ?
- Oh ! Oui.
L'homme de Cro-Magnon
donnait aux putes des cavernes
des poissons en plus pour leurs faveurs.
Dans ce cas, le plus vieux mťtier
serait pÍcheur. Ah-ha !
Tu t'es fait avocasser.
Allez, Ted. On va te trouver une escorte.
«a va Ítre drŰle.
Pour qu'elle me tienne ironiquement
compagnie au banquet,
- ou pour que je la baise ?
- Oui.
Non. C'est illťgal.
Et ai-je dit que c'est dťgoŻtant ?
C'est mignon. Ted, tu es si arriťrť.
L'industrie de l'accompagnement
est en pleine croissance au 21e siŤcle.
Rends-toi compte, une femme adulte
sur huit aux …tats-Unis est prostituťe.
- Tu inventes Áa.
- Oublie Áa.
Avocassť.
Venons-en au fait:
C'ťtait quand ta derniŤre fois ?
Il y a 57 jours.
- C'est ton verre ? Je peux ?
- Oui.
Merci.
Cinquante-sept jours ?
Ted, tu as perdu le tour.
Ce n'est pas Áa.
Je prends congť des femmes.
Perdre le tour, c'est ťchouer
chaque fois qu'on veut compter,
mais moi, j'ai arrÍtť de jouer.
Je suis au vestiaire dans le bain ŗ remous.
Et laisse-moi te dire, j'y suis trŤs bien.
Et tu sais quoi d'autre est dans le bain ?
Un tas de paires de testicules ŗ l'air.
Ted, il te faut une femme,
et j'ai celle qu'il te faut. Mary.
Elle habite mon bloc. Elle est intelligente,
sťduisante et trŤs chouette.
Oui, elle semble bien.
Et peut-Ítre qu'on se mariera, un jour,
si son mac
nous en donne la permission.
Tu veux juger un Ítre humain
sur la base
d'une seule caractťristique extťrieure ?
C'est du racisme.
Et je ne bois pas en compagnie
des racistes. Au revoir !
Tu attends juste que je parle
pour pouvoir...
J'ai dit: "Au revoir !"
Est-ce que je devrais
me remonter les cheveux ?
Est-ce que je devrais
me remonter les cheveux ?
- Lily.
- Quoi ?
- «a va ?
- Oui, dťsolťe.
Je suis ťpuisťe ŗ cause du travail.
La commission scolaire a aboli
la sieste dans les maternelles,
et les enfants sont fous
ŗ la fin de la journťe.
C'est difficile ŗ gťrer,
vu que je ne peux plus faire la sieste.
Tu faisais la sieste avec les enfants ?
Est-ce sťcuritaire ?
Ils n'ont que cinq ans.
Que peuvent-ils me faire ?
- Ted vient toujours, pas vrai ?
- Oui.
Est-ce que Áa serait bizarre si, disons,
je me faisais accompagner ?
Regarde-toi, Scherbatsky,
en train d'essayer de rendre Ted jaloux.
Non, c'est un gars qui travaille avec moi.
Je ne sors pas avec mes collŤgues,
mais il a demandť et j'ai dit oui.
- Est-ce que Áa va Ítre bizarre ?
- Mais non, pas du tout.
- Robin se fait accompagner.
- «a va Ítre vraiment bizarre.
- Je sais.
- D'accord.
- Robin se fait accompagner.
- Bon, Áa n'a rien de bizarre.
Elle a un rendez-vous.
Je suis content pour elle.
- Mon vieux, Áa va Ítre bizarre.
- Non, Áa va.
En dťpit de ce qui s'est passť entre nous,
Robin et moi sommes amis.
«a ne sera pas bizarre.
- «a ne sera pas bizarre.
- Merci.
Parce que tu seras aussi accompagnť.
- Salut, Barney.
- Salut, Mary.
Connais-tu Ted ?
- Enchantťe, Ted.
- Salut, Mary.
Heureux de te rencontrer.
Alors, on va ŗ une remise de prix ?
Oui. Peux-tu nous excuser un moment ?
- Barney ?
- Deux secondes, Mar.
Mettez-vous ŗ l'aise.
C'est quoi, l'idťe ?
Tes prťjugťs
contre les fornicatrices professionnelles
nuisent ŗ mon ťtat d'esprit.
- Alors, j'ai trouvť une fille pour toi.
- Tu m'as trouvť une prostituťe.
Une trŤs attirante... Une prostituťe !
Penses-y. C'est parfait.
De un, Áa va rendre Robin folle de jalousie.
De deux, tu peux coucher avec elle.
Et de trois, en apprenant ŗ connaÓtre Mary,
tu verras que les courtisanes sont
aussi humaines.
Et de quatre, le point deux, toute la nuit.
Je n'emmŤne pas une prostituťe
au banquet de Robin.
Les seuls ŗ le savoir seront toi,
moi et Marshall.
Personne ne le saura.
Ils ne verront que toi
et cette fille incroyablement sťduisante...
C'est un peu louche, j'avoue.
…coute, j'essaie seulement
d'ťlargir tes horizons, ce soir.
Mais si Áa ne t'intťresse pas, Áa va.
Je perds 500 $, c'est tout.
Tu as payť 500 $, toi ?
Ted, tu es mon pote.
Je ne vais pas te coller
un travelo ťdentť de la basse ville !
Regarde comme elle est belle.
Robin serait si jalouse.
Je n'essaie pas de rendre Robin jalouse.
…coute, je... Remercie Mary de ma part,
mais non. J'ai une ‚me.
<i>C'est alors que votre oncle Marshall et moi
avons eu l'une</i>
<i>de nos fameuses
conversations tťlťpathiques.</i>
<i>- As-tu vu le gars avec Robin ?
- Je sais.</i>
<i>- C'est qui je pense que c'est ?
- Oui, c'est Sandy Rivers.</i>
<i>Sandy Rivers ťtait le visage
de Metro News 1,</i>
NOUVELLES DE LA M…TROPOLE
<i>le poste de nouvelles sur le c‚ble
au plus petit budget.</i>
Sandy est lŗ. Sandy est lŗ !
<i>Il ťtait cťlŤbre pour sa chronique matinale
intitulťe "Le journal du jour",</i>
<i>pendant laquelle il lisait littťralement
le journal aux auditeurs.</i>
<i>Ici, ŗ la une, on a une histoire sur...</i>
L'ASCENSION D'UNE VIE
<i>Un gars dťguisť en super hťros
qui escalade l'Empire State Building.</i>
<i>«a a l'air intťressant.</i>
<i>Nous aimions regarder
ces chroniques stupides en cachette.</i>
Quel Sandy veut-on aujourd'hui ?
- Sandy le FranÁais, l'acteur porno...
- Yosemite Sandy, c'est sŻr.
Un excellent choix.
<i>... j'en ai ťlevť, enfant.
Ce n'est pas facile, je vous le dis.</i>
Le tťlťgramme
J'adore ce gars.
Je dťteste ce gars.
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Je m'appelle Lily.
- Mary. Enchantťe.
Mary est l'amie de Barney.
Il l'a invitťe.
On vient de la rencontrer.
On ne la connaÓt pas trop.
Regarde, une biŤre.
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Tu es ťlťgante.
- Ted, je te prťsente Sandy.
Sandy Rivers. Utilise mon nom complet.
Les gens aiment Áa.
Salut, Sandy... Rivers.
- Alors, vous...
- Si on fait parler de nous au travail ?
On dirait bien. On dirait bien.
Oý sont mes maniŤres.
Robin, Sandy... Rivers,
voici Mary. Elle m'accompagne ce soir.
<i>Mesdames et messieurs, bienvenue
au 45e gala des mťdias locaux.</i>
<i>Veuillez accueillir l'hŰte de la soirťe,</i>
<i>le roi des films de kung fu du samedi
aprŤs-midi, Lou le Vampire.</i>
<i>Ce soir, nous cťlťbrons le meilleur
de la tťlť</i>
<i>et le triomphe de l'esprit humain.</i>
Lou le Vampire est trŤs ťlťgant.
Je n'arrive pas ŗ croire
que je suis accompagnť par une pute.
Je ne peux pas croire que tu l'as laissťe
aller ŗ la toilette avec Lily.
Il s'y dit bien des secrets.
Pourquoi elle parlerait de Áa ?
"Passe-moi du papier.
Je suis payťe pour baiser."
- Qui est payť pour baiser ?
- Personne.
De quoi avez-vous parlť aux toilettes ?
De rien en particulier.
On a parlť
et j'ai empruntť son rouge ŗ lŤvres.
Pourquoi Lou le Vampire prťsente-t-il
les films de kung fu du samedi ?
«a n'a aucun sens. «a m'enrage.
Lily, Áa va ?
Oui, je suis seulement fatiguťe
et Áa me rend de mauvaise humeur.
Vraiment ? «a m'ťtonne de toi.
"Vraiment ? «a m'ťtonne de toi."
Dis donc. Pourquoi es-tu si fatiguťe ?
Je suis enseignante de maternelle
et la commission scolaire
a aboli ma sieste.
La sieste des enfants.
Lily, tu devrais travailler
dans une ťcole privťe.
Plus de commission scolaire,
- et tu gagnerais plus.
- Devine quoi, Barney ?
Toutes mes dťcisions ne sont pas fondťes
sur l'argent que je gagnerai,
contrairement ŗ toi et ŗ mon fiancť.
Ce n'est qu'un stage,
pour que tout le monde...
Si je sacrifiais mes valeurs
pour de l'argent facilement gagnť,
- je serais quoi ?
- Une prostituťe.
En plein Áa. Merci, Mary.
- Alors, Mary, que fais-tu dans la vie ?
- Elle est technicienne juridique.
Oui, technicienne juridique.
Mary la technicienne juridique.
«a fait quoi au juste,
une technicienne juridique ?
Je fais du travail de bureau
dans un cabinet d'avocats au centre-ville.
- Quel cabinet ?
- Douglas, O'Halloran et Stamp.
- «a existe vraiment.
- Je sais.
Bien jouť.
- Tu as de bons rťflexes.
- Est-ce que tu me dragues ?
- Est-ce permis ?
- Oui, c'est encouragť.
Je ne dirais normalement pas Áa
lors d'un premier rendez-vous,
mais dans les circonstances,
je vais le dire.
Tu es vraiment sťduisante.
- Merci.
- Il n'y a pas de quoi.
Mary, Ted est un bon gars.
Il en vaut la peine.
Ne le quitte pas de vue une minute.
Alors, Sandy, que fais-tu dans la vie ?
Oh ! Attends. Je le sais.
Tu es celui qui lit le journal le matin.
En effet. Et toi, Ted ?
Comme toi, je lis le journal chaque matin.
Mais aprŤs, quand j'ai fini mon cafť,
je me rends ŗ mon emploi d'architecte
et j'offre une contribution rťelle
ŗ la sociťtť.
Je blague. J'adore ton ťmission.
Tu es trŤs bon.
Merci. Je ne me fatigue pas de l'entendre.
<i>Tu te rappelles la scŤne
dans L'empire contre-attaque</i>
oý on met le casque
sur la tÍte de Darth Vader ?
Penses-tu que Sandy met ses cheveux
comme Áa chaque matin ?
Tu as insultť quelqu'un que je hais
avec une rťfťrence ŗ une chose que j'aime.
Bon sang !
Tu es encore plus sťduisante qu'avant.
<i>ņ mesure que la soirťe avanÁait,
je me rendais compte</i>
<i>que cette fille, malgrť son mťtier,
ťtait plutŰt chouette.</i>
- Salut.
- Salut.
Mary semble gentille.
L'as-tu dťjŗ embrassťe ou attends-tu
d'avoir une relation sťrieuse
avec une autre femme ?
Oui. Je voulais m'excuser
pour ce qui s'est passť.
Et soudain, tout est oubliť.
Gťnťrique de fin.
Vas-tu m'en vouloir ŗ jamais ?
On ne peut pas Ítre amis ?
- On est amis.
- On est... Vraiment ?
Tu ne me rappelles pas. On ne sort jamais.
Et tu essaies de me rendre jaloux
avec monsieur l'imbťcile.
Madame Blonde et lťgale et son dťcolletť,
ce n'est pas pour me rendre jalouse ?
Oh ! Quoi, tu vas la traiter de pute ?
- Quoi ?
- Tu veux savoir une chose ?
Mary la technicienne juridique
est gťniale. Et tu sais quoi ?
Je n'ai pas voulu te rendre jalouse.
Je suis venu montrer mon soutien,
en ami, et j'en ai assez d'essayer.
J'aime bien ce gars-lŗ.
- Salut.
- Salut.
De quoi parliez-vous, lŗ-bas ?
Je disais ŗ mon amie
que je te trouvais gťniale.
Merci.
C'est un des plus beaux hŰtels
oý je suis allťe.
Un de mes amis l'a rťnovť.
La vue depuis les chambres est superbe.
C'est vrai ?
Dommage qu'on n'ait pas de chambre.
Chambre 1506, ŗ mes frais.
Amusez-vous bien.
Mais ne prenez rien du minibar.
Fais-le, Ted. Allez, fais-le.
Tu dois essayer Áa avant d'avoir 30 ans.
- Coucher avec une prostituťe ?
- Perdre ta virginitť. Je blague !
Une statistique: Les hommes
qui ont eu une relation avec une prostituťe
ont 75% plus de chance d'avoir du succŤs
dans leurs relations futures.
- Tu inventes Áa.
- Oublie Áa.
Avocassť. D'accord, trois choses.
Un, c'est bientŰt la catťgorie de Robin.
Deux, tu ne peux pas faire Áa.
«a n'a rien de bon.
Trois, j'ai mis des petits objets
dans les cheveux de Sandy
et il n'a pas encore remarquť.
Je sais que je ne peux pas le faire.
Mais... C'est dommage. Elle est chouette.
- Oui, bien... «a y est.
- D'accord.
<i>... Brampton pour:
"Bicyclette: Plaisir ou mort certaine ?"</i>
<i>Mike Murphy pour:
"Treize ans, enceinte et accro."</i>
<i>Et Robin Scherbatsky pour:

<i>Et la gagnante est Robin Scherbatsky.</i>
Merci.
<i>Eh bien. C'est toute une surprise.</i>
<i>Je suis heureuse de pouvoir partager
ce prix avec mes amis.</i>
<i>Ils sont tous ici ce soir.</i>
<i>Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers...</i>
<i>Barney.</i>
<i>C'est tout. Ce sont tous mes amis.
Merci.</i>
- Fťlicitations.
- Merci.
- Sandy, tu veux un taxi ?
- Oui, allons-y.
Oui, ce gala est nul.
Mary, tu veux monter ?
On a une chambre.
<i>- Qu'est-ce que tu fais, vieux ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu penses ?</i>
<i>Je pense que Áa paraÓt mal.
Tu ne peux pas faire Áa.</i>
<i>Marshall, c'est une chouette fille
quand on la connaÓt.</i>
<i>- Et je veux rendre Robin jalouse.
- Comme tu fais preuve de maturitť.</i>
<i>Marshall, que se passe-t-il
entre toi et Ted ?</i>
<i>Rien, chťrie. Ne t'en fais pas.</i>
<i>Bon. Fais ce que tu veux.</i>
<i>Hť !</i>
On y va ?
- Oui.
- Oui.
Merci.
Eh bien, bonne soirťe.
Bonne soirťe.
Est-ce que toi et Barney avez...
- Tout l'argent du monde ne suffirait pas.
- Dieu merci.
Oui.
Alors, ils sont...
- Robin, oý est Sandy Rivers ?
- Je lui ai fait prendre un taxi.
- Attends, alors toi et lui...
- Je ne sors pas avec mes collŤgues.
Je voulais rendre Ted jaloux.
- Est-ce qu'il...
- Il est parti te rendre jalouse.
Oh ! Bon, tant mieux pour eux.
Et si Ted s'intťresse ŗ elle,
ce doit Ítre une fille bien.
<i>Lily, je sais que tu dors,
mais je dois me confier</i>
<i>et on se dit tout. Alors, voilŗ:</i>
<i>Mary n'est pas une technicienne juridique.
C'est une prostituťe.</i>
Mary est une prostituťe ?
- Quoi ?
- Barney l'a payťe.
Barney, c'est vrai ?
On parlait de prostitution.
Et puis, Barney l'a appelťe
et elle est arrivťe au bar,
et maintenant elle est montťe avec Ted.
Non mais,
qu'est-ce qui se passe avec Ted ?
Fait-il une dťpression nerveuse ?
Barney, pour quelqu'un d'autre,
ce serait le fond du baril,
mais pour toi, ce n'est que le milieu.
Mon Dieu !
J'ai empruntť son rouge ŗ lŤvres.
C'est sa serviette.
Je suppose
que c'est le moment ou jamais.
Pour continuer dans le thŤme de la soirťe,
j'aimerais annoncer
la surprise finale de la soirťe.
Lou le Vampire, me ferez-vous l'honneur ?
"Mary n'est pas vraiment une prostituťe."
- Quoi ?
- C'est tout, Lou le Vampire. Bien jouť.
- Alors, elle n'est pas...
- Non.
Mary est une technicienne juridique
et ma voisine.
Oh ! Et voici le meilleur:
Elle ne sait pas que Ted croit
qu'elle est une prostituťe.
Oh ! Voyons.
Si vous ne riez pas, Áa a l'air mťchant.
Je me sens un peu comme Richard Gere.
- Tu n'es pas trŤs humble.
- Non.
Tu sais, Mary, je n'ai jamais fait Áa avant.
- Fait quoi ?
- Me faire escorter.
Ah.
- Tu blagues, pas vrai ?
- Non.
C'est si inhabituel ?
Eh bien, Ted, j'ai des rendez-vous
depuis que j'ai 15 ans.
Mon Dieu ! Tu n'ťtais qu'une enfant.
Bon, ťcoute, on va boire quelques verres.
On va se dťtendre.
Oui, bonne idťe.
J'ai eu des clients sur le dos
toute la journťe.
- «a doit Ítre difficile.
- Oui.
Un gars en particulier ne me l‚chait pas.
Une discussion sur l'anal...
On y est.
…coute, Mary, tu me plais beaucoup.
Je suis ťtonnť que tu me plaises
ŗ ce point.
Mais je ne peux pas faire Áa.
Tu es une prostituťe.
Quoi ?
Je suis peut-Ítre vieux jeu, mais dťsolť,
Áa me dťrange vraiment.
Je ne veux pas coucher
avec une prostituťe.
Ted, je suis technicienne juridique.
Voyons, Mary, nous sommes seuls.
Tu es une prostituťe.
Non, Ted.
Je suis technicienne juridique.
Non, tu es une prostituťe.
Non, je suis technicienne juridique.
Tu es technicienne juridique.
- Ce n'ťtait pas drŰle.
- Non, pas drŰle, mon vieux.
Je sais. C'ťtait tordant.
- Pourquoi as-tu fait Áa ?
- Pour te donner une leÁon.
Quelle leÁon ?
Attendez, Áa va me venir.
Voilŗ quelle leÁon.
Tu pensais que Mary allait s'ťtendre.
Alors tu es allť ŗ une chambre d'hŰtel
avec elle dŤs le premier soir.
Tu n'as qu'ŗ afficher la mÍme confiance
avec chaque fille,
et tu vas retrouver le tour.
La leÁon est que je dois traiter
chaque fille comme une pute ?
Voyons, mon vieux.
Tu devrais me remercier.
Elle m'a giflť et est partie en furie.
Peux-tu lui en vouloir ?
Tu l'as traitťe de pute.
Je suis dťsolť, mon vieux.
C'ťtait drŰle.
Bon, il se fait tard.
- Je retourne ŗ ma chambre.
- Ta chambre ?
La coŻteuse chambre d'hŰtel
que tu as payťe par carte de crťdit
et n'a jamais quittťe. En passant,
sais-tu ce qui est vraiment bien ?
Verser du Dom Pťrignon dans la baignoire.
Bon, il est presque 3 h.
C'est l'heure de mon massage. Au revoir !
Oh ! Voyons.
Si tu ne ries pas, Áa a l'air mťchant.
Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set?
Disc three.
My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on.
Disc three!
God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours.
What do you mean "could"?
I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl.
It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.
Trust that impulse, Ted.
Hey. Something kind of cool just happened.
My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.
A... LAME-A?
We prefer Local Area Media Award.
Um... there's going to be this big banquet.
I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came.
And there's an open bar.
- Yes!
- Word up!
Yeah, put me down for two.
Really? It's three months away.
I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it.
I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.
I'm going to miss Victoria.
I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.
You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were
so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?
Yes, that's what I meant by "you know."
I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls.
- Look, I shouldn't go.
- You should definitely go.
Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.
Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter.
Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs.
- That's only two.
- Count again.
Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.
So get an escort.
By "escort," you mean prostitute?
Why not?
Because... gross?
Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution?
Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.
You really think that's true?
Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers,
like, an extra fish for putting out.
Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen.
Kaboom! You've been lawyered.
Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun.
Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have sex with?
Yes.
No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?
That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed.
The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century.
You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.
- You just made that up.
- Withdrawn.
Lawyered.
The point is, how long has it been?
57 days.
- Is that your water? May I?
- Yeah, go ahead.
Much obliged.
57 days?!
- Ted, you are in a slump.
- No, it's not a slump.
It's an intentional hiatus from girls.
A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate.
But I'm off the roster, baby.
I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool.
And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.
Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room?
A naked dudes hanging brain.
Ted, you need a lady.
And I've got the next best thing-- Mary.
She lives in my building.
She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.
Oh, she sounds great.
And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday.
You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.
You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic?
That's racism.
And I do not drink with racists.
Good day.
You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...
I said good day!
So should I wear my hair up or down?
Lily.
What?
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
I'm just exhausted from work.
The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes
and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day.
It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap.
Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were?
Is that safe?
Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?
Ted's still coming to this thing, right?
Yep.
Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?
Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.
No, it's just this guy at the station.
I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes.
Is it going to be weird?
No, it's not going to be weird at all.
Robin's bringing a date.
Boy. That's going to be really weird.
I know.
Robin's bringing a date.
Oh. Okay. That's not weird.
She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.
- Dude, it's going to be weird.
- No, it's fine.
Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends.
I don't think it'll be weird.
- Yeah, it won't be weird.
- Thank you.
Because you're going to bring your own date.
- Hello, Barney.
- Hi, Mary.
Have you met Ted?
Nice to meet you Ted.
Hi, Mary.
Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.
So we're going to an award show?
Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute?
Barney.
See you in two shakes, Mare.
You two make yourselves comfortable.
What the hell?
Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow.
So I got you a date for the evening.
You got me a hooker.
A really hot hook-- A hooker!
Think about it, this is perfect.
A-- it will make Robin insanely jealous...
B-- you get to have sex with her...
and C-- maybe by getting to know Mary,
you'll come to see that courtesans are people, too.
And D-- "B" all night long.
I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.
The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall.
No one will suspect a thing.
They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and...
Okay, that's a little bit suspicious.
Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight.
But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.
500 bucks?
Ted, you're my cabron.
You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tranny from the Port Authority?
Look at how hot she is.
Robin would be so jealous.
I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney.
Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul.
And then your Uncle Marhsall and I had one of our famous telepathic conversations.
Check out Robin's date.
I know.
Is that who I think it is?
Yep.
It's Sandy Rivers.
Sandy Rivers was the face of Metro News One,
the most low-budget cable news network ever.
Sandy time. Sandy time!
He was best known for his morning segment "In Today's Paper,"
during which he literally flipped through today's papers,
reading them aloud to viewers.
Here we have, on the front page, a story about a...
I guess, a guy in a superhero costume climbing the Empire State Building.
Looks interesting.
These idiotic filler pieces were a guilty pleasure of ours.
Which Sandy do we want today?
French Sandy, porn star Sandy...?
Yosemite Sandy, definitely.
Excellent choice.
I love this guy.
I hate this guy.
Hey.
- Hi.
- I'm Lily.
Hi. Mary. It's nice to meet you.
Mary is a friend of Barney's. Barney invited her.
Just met Mary ourselves. Don't know too much about Mary.
Look, a beer.
Hey.
Hi.
- You look nice.
- Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy.
Hi. Sandy Rivers. Use my full name. People get a kick out of it.
Hi, Sandy.
Rivers.
So are you two, uh...
Starting a bunch of office rumors?
Looks that way. Looks that way.
Oh, how rude of me.
Uh, Robin, Sandy... Rivers...
this is Mary, my date.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 45th annual Local Area Media Awards.
Please say hello to our host for the evening,
king of the Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie,
Vampire Lou!
Tonight we celebrate the very best in broadcasting
and the triumph of the human spirit.
Man, Vampire Lou just looks great.
I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.
Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man.
Secrets come out in there.
Oh, please. How's it's going to come out?
"Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have sex for money."
- Who has sex for money?
- Nobody.
What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting?
No, not really.
We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick.
Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie?
You know, it just makes no sense.
God, that pisses me off.
Lily, you okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky.
Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.
"Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky."
Wow. Why are you so tired?
Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time.
Lily, quit your job.
Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board,
and you'll make a ton more money.
Well, guess what, Barney?
I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make,
unlike you and, sadly, my fiance.
Well, it's just an internship, for the record.
Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck,
what would that make me?
A prostitute.
Exactly. Thank you, Mary.
So, Mary, what do you do for a living?
She's a paralegal.
Yes, I'm a paralegal.
Oh, so, Mary the paralegal.
What does a paralegal do exactly?
I just assist with day-to-day clerical work in a law firm downtown.
Oh, what firm?
Douglas, O'Halloran and Stamp.
That's a real law firm.
I know.
Nice.
You're pretty good on your feet.
Are you flirting with me?
Is that allowed?
Yes, it's encouraged.
You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but...
well, considering...
I'm just going to say it. You are so hot!
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.
Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him.
Don't let him out of your sight for a minute.
So, Sandy, what do you do?
Oh, wait, I know what you do.
You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning.
You got me.
What do you do, Ted?
Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning.
But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect
where I make an actual contribution to the world.
I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific.
Thanks.
I never tire of hearing that.
Hey, you know that scene in Empire where they lower the helmet onto Darth Vader's head?
Do you think that's how Sandy puts his hair on in the morning?
You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love.
Damn, you just got even hotter.
And so, as the night wore on, I started to realize,
this girl, despite what she did for a living, was kind of great.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Mary seems nice.
Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting
until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?
I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.
And just like that, it's all okay.
Roll credits.
So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?
- We're still friends.
- Are we?
You don't return my calls, we never hang out
and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?
Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?
Oh, so now she's a whore?
What?
You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome.
And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous,
I came here to support you as a friend.
And frankly, I'm sick of trying.
I like that guy.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What were you guys talking about over there?
Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.
Well, thanks.
You know, this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in.
Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel.
You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.
Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.
Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts.
Actually, don't use the mini-bar.
Do it. Come on, Ted, do it.
This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.
Sleep with a prostitute?
No, lose your virginity. What up.
Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute
are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships.
You just made that up.
- Withdrawn.
- Lawyered.
Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up.
And second of all, you cannot do this.
It's wrong on every level.
And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed.
I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame.
She's really cool.
- Yeah, well... there we go.
- Scooter "Bam-Bam" Branson for
A Bicycle-- Joyride or Deathtrap?
Mike Murphy for 13, Pregnant and Addicted.
And Robin Scherbotsky for Pickles, the Singing Dog.
And the winner is...
Robin Scherbotsky.
Thanks.
Oh, wow. This is really a surprise.
Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends.
They're all here tonight.
Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers...
Barney...
And that's it. Those are all my friends.
Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks.
Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?
Sure. Let's go.
Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs?
We, uh, got a room.
Dude, what are you doing?
What's it look like?
It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this.
Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her.
Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous.
Oh, that's real mature.
Marshall, what is up with you and Ted?
Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it.
Fine. Do what you want.
Hey.
Should we go?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Well...
Good night.
Good night.
So, did you and Barney ever...?
There's not enough money in the world.
Oh, thank God.
Wow, so they're...?
Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?
I put him in a cab.
So you and he aren't...?
I don't date people I work with.
I was just trying to make Ted jealous.
Is he...?
He's off trying to make you jealous.
Oh, well, good for them.
And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool.
Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this,
and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes.
Mary's not a paralegal.
She's a prostitute.
Mary's a prostitute?
What?!
Barney paid for her.
Is that true?
We were having a conversation about prostitution,
and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar
and now she and Ted are upstairs.
Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately?
Is he having a nervous breakdown?
You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low,
but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle.
Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!
That's her napkin.
No!
Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any.
In keeping with tonight's award show motif,
I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending!
Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?
"Mary's not really a prostitute."
What?
That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.
- So she's not...?
- No.
Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building.
Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part--
she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker.
Oh, come on.
If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.
I feel kind of like Richard Gere.
- Not shy about your looks, are you?
- No.
You know, Mary, I've never done this before.
Done what?
You know, been... on a "date."
Yeah, right.
Wait, you're kidding, right?
No.
Why, is that so odd?
Well, Ted, I mean, I've been going on dates since I was 15.
God, you were just a kid.
Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...
Yeah, that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long.
Must be tough.
Yeah. I mean, this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone.
I mean, talk about anal.
Well, here we are.
Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot.
I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this.
You're a hooker.
What?
Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me.
I'm not going to have sex with a prostitute.
No... Ted, I'm a paralegal.
Come on, Mary, there's no one else around.
You're a hooker.
No, Ted...
I'm a paralegal.
No, you're a hooker.
No, I'm a paralegal.
You're a paralegal.
That was not funny.
Not funny, dude.
I know, it was hilarious.
Why would you do that?
I did it to prove a point.
What point?
Stay with me. It's going to come to me.
No. Ah, okay, here's the point.
You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right?
So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date.
All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet
and your slump is over.
So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?
Come on, dude, you should be thanking me.
She slapped me and stormed off.
Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.
I'm sorry, dude, it was funny.
Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.
Your room?
Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card--
never checked out.
By the way, you know what's super fun?
Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain.
Well, it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles.
Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean.

<i>Huit mois aprčs que tante Lily
et oncle Marshall se sont fiancés,</i>
<i>un cas d'urgence est venu
tout bouleverser.</i>
20 minutes plus tôt
- Van Smoot est libre.
- Mon Dieu.
<i>Le domaine Van Smoot était un manoir
superbe sur la rivičre Hudson.</i>
<i>L'endroit ręvé
pour le mariage de Marshall et de Lily,</i>
<i>mais il n'était jamais disponible.
Et puis, soudainement, il l'était.</i>
Quelqu'un a annulé. C'est dans deux mois.
Tu veux qu'on se marie dans deux mois ?
Non. C'est impossible.
C'est Van Smoot. Notre ręve.
Non, on n'a pas assez de temps.
Il n'y a pas...
J'ai vomi un peu.
Je sais que c'est inattendu, mais écoute.
Si on refuse,
devine qui ira déposer un acompte ?
Todd et Valérie ?
<i>Quand on planifie un mariage,</i>
<i>il y a toujours un couple qui partage</i>
<i>nos goűts
et semble avoir une longueur d'avance.</i>
<i>Ce couple, c'était Todd et Valérie.</i>
Il faut nous décider.
Todd et Valérie sont en pleine action.
Van Smoot !
Non ! Les enfants, coloriez !
- Prends-moi sur ton dos !
- Allez, allez, allez.
Salut, Marshall et Lily.
Todd. Valérie.
L'escalier.
Je n'arrive pas ŕ y croire.
On a eu le domaine Van Smoot.
C'est parti. C'est parti ! Comme
l'ancienne république d'Azerbaďdjan.
- Quoi ?
- Tu es incroyable.
Vous allez vous marier dans deux mois.
Comment allez-vous faire ?
Division du travail.
Tout le monde a quelque chose ŕ faire.
Robin, toi et Ted irez voir le fleuriste.
<i>Robin était fâchée contre moi
depuis le soir oů j'avais exagéré</i>
<i>le fait que je n'avais pas de copine.</i>
- Était-ce...
- C'était ta copine.
Tu devrais peut-ętre la rappeler.
Robin, tu devrais y aller, toi,
chez le fleuriste.
Ted, j'aimerais ton point de vue
d'architecte sur les invitations.
Ça alors.
C'était vraiment embarrassant, Lil.
Ça l'est encore. C'est trčs embarrassant.
Et moi, dans tout ça ? Quel est mon rôle ?
Ton rôle est trčs simple.
Au mariage, il t'est défendu de coucher
avec quiconque de ma famille.
Tu sais que je ne peux pas te le promettre.
Elle est adorable.
Elle est tout ŕ fait épuisée.
Hé, bébé. Hé, ma petite fleur.
Hé, Lilypad.
Merde ! La musique !
On a oublié de trouver un groupe.
Ce sera le silence total,
puis on entendra les gens mâcher.
Bébé, ne t'inquičte pas.
J'ai appelé les 88 !
- Qui ça ?
- Les 88.
Ils sont super.
Ils ont joué ŕ la fęte du journal de droit.
Ils ont été jugé coupables...
de nous avoir amusés.
Je les ai vus
au mariage de mon cousin Bonzo.
Ils étaient super.
John Bonham, surnommé "Bonzo",
de Led Zeppelin ?
Oui, Lily, mon cousin,
le batteur de Led Zeppelin décédé en 1980,
s'est récemment marié.
Je ne peux pas approuver un groupe
que je n'ai jamais vu.
On ignore s'ils savent jouer notre chanson.
Il faut qu'ils viennent passer une audition.
Bébé, ils ne passent pas d'auditions.
Ils sont hyper célčbres.
Je suis obligée de refuser.
Ils retiendront notre réservation
jusqu'ŕ lundi, pas plus.
Est-ce qu'on peut les voir jouer
ce week-end ?
Vérifions leur site Web.
Quoi ?
Lily, tu exagčres un peu, quand męme.
J'exagčre ? Je dois planifier un mariage
pour 200 personnes en neuf semaines.
Męme si un dinosaure sortait
de mes fesses
pour manger la table ŕ café,
- je veux pouvoir encore compter sur toi.
- Ça alors.
Je viens de goűter ŕ la bouffe
d'un traiteur incroyable.
- On a déjŕ un traiteur.
- C'est vrai. Vous vous mariez.
Tu as compris ce que j'ai voulu dire ?
On dirait que les 88 vont jouer
ŕ un bal de lycée
au New Jersey, demain soir.
Un bal de lycée ?
On peut y aller ?
Oui. On téléphonera au lycée,
et on pourra aller les voir.
Onze secondes plus tard
- Ils ne veulent pas.
- Pourquoi ?
Parce qu'on n'est plus au lycée.
Et alors ? On va se faufiler.
On ne va pas se faufiler dans un bal.
C'est notre seule solution de rechange.
Tu approuves l'idée de Barney ?
Tu as vraiment perdu la tęte.
Il reste neuf semaines avant le mariage.
En ce moment,
j'accepterais n'importe quoi.
- Eh bien...
- Non, Barney.
<i>Ainsi, tante Lily concocta un plan
pour se faufiler dans un bal.</i>
- Je t'accompagne.
- Vraiment ?
Je n'ai pas pu aller ŕ mon bal.
C'était la finale de hockey sur gazon.
Lesbienne.
Tu es censé tousser
pour cacher le mot "lesbienne".
J'essaie une nouvelle façon,
en toussant séparément.
A-t-on l'air assez jeunes
pour passer pour des ados ?
J'ai l'air jeune,
Scherbatsky n'a qu'ŕ dormir un peu,
et toi, tu passerais pour une impubčre.
Allons-y tous ensemble.
Plus on est nombreux,
plus ce sera difficile.
On ne veut pas tout gâcher pour Lily.
Tu as raison. De toute maničre,
Marshall et moi voulions
sortir entre gars avant le mariage.
On peut sortir demain soir.
Super. On devrait sortir
et faire plein de trucs bizarres.
- Oui.
- Parce que tu sais,
tu n'es qu'un voyou,
et moi, je suis un hors-la-loi.
Thelma et Louise, n'allez surtout pas
vous lancer en bas d'une falaise.
Vous ętes cons !
Mais laissez-moi un message
et je vous rejoindrai.
Qu'est-ce que tu en dis ?
Vous ętes affreuses.
Tu feras un trčs bon pčre.
Vous avez trop de classe.
Vous vous ferez remarquer.
Avez-vous vu
comment s'habillent les ados
qui imitent Ashlee, Lindsay et Paris ?
Elles s'habillent comme des stripeuses.
Sois garces ou rentres chez toi.
Il faut qu'on y aille. Je dois voir ce groupe,
car je dois me décider avant lundi,
car je vais me marier dans 71 jours
et on n'a pas encore de...
Ma chérie, pense ŕ une chose ŕ la fois.
Pour l'instant, tu n'as qu'ŕ t'habiller
comme une prostituée.
- D'accord.
- Voilŕ qui est mieux.
Mesdames, en habit de pute !
Je n'ai jamais trouvé ça défavorable,
mais mes vętements sont trop classe.
- Je ne croyais plus avoir ça.
- Quoi ?
Ma robe de bal du lycée.
Tu es la fille la plus sexy au bal,
sans ętre commerciale ou plastique.
Tu es vraiment, vraiment sexy.
Comme une âme sexy.
Tu parais bien, toi aussi, Scooter.
Ah oui ! Grosse nouvelle:
On m'a accepté ŕ l'école des arbitres.
Oh ! Je suis trčs heureuse pour toi.
Tu es heureuse pour nous, non ?
Scooter, tu deviendras arbitre, un jour.
Non, bébé.
On deviendra tous les deux arbitres.
Trčs bien.
Il manque un tout petit quelque chose
ŕ vos ensembles.
Non, Barney, je n'irai pas plus loin que ça.
Je ne montrerai pas...
Deux fleurs magnifiques,
pour deux fleurs magnifiques.
C'est gentil. Merci.
- Robin, as-tu les larmes aux yeux ?
- Non.
- Robin, as-tu les larmes aux yeux ?
- Non.
Je ne suis jamais allée ŕ un bal.
- Il faut y aller. Ŕ plus.
- Amusez-vous bien.
- Salut.
- Ŕ plus.
Elles deviennent pétasses
trčs jeunes, non ?
- Est-ce qu'on est pręts pour ce soir ?
- Oui.
Une derničre chose.
Une gorgée de Jim Beam ?
- Oui.
- Oui !
J'ai promis ŕ Lily qu'on préparerait
200 invitations pour le mariage.
- Quoi ?
- Désolé, mais tu as vu
ŕ quel point elle est stressée.
Voyons ! Tu planifies ton mariage
sans cesse. Fais une pause.
Quand tu seras marié, si on sort
et que tu te soűles la gueule,
ça sera triste,
tandis que si on fait ça ce soir,
ça sera moins triste.
Ça sera cool. Écoute ce qu'on va faire.
On transformera ça en jeu.
Le premier ŕ préparer 100 enveloppes
obtiendra un prix.
Tu me prends
pour un enfant de quatre ans ?
C'est quoi, le prix ?
Il y a bien plus d'agents de sécurité,
de nos jours.
- Ça va fonctionner ?
- Oui.
Quand j'avais 17 ans,
je sortais en boîte tout le temps.
Il faut avoir confiance en soi.
Suivez-moi.
Bon bal, tout le monde.
On va ŕ notre bal.
- Vous ętes des adultes.
- D'accord, salut.
Écoutez, je veux juste voir le groupe jouer.
Je me marie dans deux mois et...
Et vous n'avez pas réservé de groupe ?
Hé ! Hé !
Désolé, madame. Vous devez soit ętre
une écoličre, soit accompagner un écolier.
Ça alors ! "Madame ?" Échec et mat.
Ça ira. C'est le temps de passer au plan B.
Scherbatsky,
es-tu douée pour le tir ŕ l'arc ?
Scherbatsky ?
Salut. Vous voulez que deux filles sexy
vous accompagnent au bal ?
On n'a pas assez d'argent.
- C'est gratuit.
- Oui, alors.
- Super. Je m'appelle Robin. Voici Lily.
- Salut.
- On y va ?
- Oui.
Je savais que ça arriverait.
C'est mon ręve.
Attends. Et Barney ?
Ne vous inquiétez pas.
J'arriverai ŕ entrer.
J'arriverai ŕ entrer.
LES 88
<i>- On a réussi !
- Merci. On va faire une pause.</i>
C'est pas vrai.
Dites, vous voulez boire
un truc pour relaxer ?
Oui, pourquoi pas ? On est au bal.
Ça goűte le sirop contre la toux.
Oui, on n'a pas pu acheter d'alcool,
car selon nos fausses cartes, on a 20 ans.
On s'en est rendu compte
aprčs les avoir achetées.
Mésadaptés sociaux pourris en maths ?
La vie sera dure.
Salut. Je vous demande pardon.
<i>Je me demandais si vous pourriez jouer
Good Feeling, des Violent Femmes.</i>
Cette chanson ne fait sűrement pas partie
de votre répertoire, mais je me marie
et mon fiancé veut vous engager,
<i>mais je dois entendre jouer
Good Feeling avant,</i>
puisque c'est notre chanson,
et comment vous engager,
si vous ne jouez pas notre chanson,
pas vrai ?
Je suis un peu défoncé, en ce moment,
donc je n'ai rien compris.
Mais si vous apportez
la musique sur papier, on la jouera.
D'accord.
Est-ce que ça te fait effet, bébé ?
J'ai moins de mucosité.
On fait pitié. C'est notre soirée de gars.
On devrait sortir se battre dans un bar.
Dis, si je me battais, m'aiderais-tu ?
Bien entendu.
Je ferais la męme chose.
Ça va.
Tu ne crois pas avoir besoin de mon aide ?
Je sais me battre.
Je fais... Je suis fou furieux.
D'accord, Ted. Allô ?
Salut, c'est Robin.
<i>Lily voudrais que tu télécharges
les paroles de Good Feeling</i>
et que tu les apportes ici, tout de suite.
Attends. C'est Robin.
Elle veut que j'aille au bal.
- Ted peut venir ?
- Ne lui demande pas ! Ça fait pitié.
Je ne veux męme pas y aller.
Je ne sais pas.
Je me sens mal ŕ l'aise avec lui.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a dit ?
Il m'a menti en disant
qu'il avait cassé avec sa copine,
pour me séduire.
Je sais qu'il m'a présenté ses excuses,
mais c'est difficile de lui pardonner.
Si tu dois absolument l'emmener avec toi,
je ne vais quand męme pas me suicider.
D'accord, salut.
Elle veut vraiment que tu viennes.
C'est bon. Les paroles arrivent.
Ça va ?
J'ai tellement de trucs ŕ faire
pour le mariage. J'ai la tęte qui tourne.
Ça avance trop rapidement.
Comment ça, ça avance trop rapidement ?
On est ensemble depuis deux ans.
Je...
Je ne veux pas
que le reste de ma vie soit décidé.
Qu'est-ce qui est décidé ?
Je vais ŕ l'école des arbitres,
tu vas ŕ l'université,
on emménage chez mon pčre.
On fait des enfants, on vieillit.
Qu'est-ce qui est décidé ? On est libre.
Scooter, dčs que je commence l'université,
ce sera fini entre nous.
Tu veux casser ?
Il me reste tant de choses ŕ faire.
Je veux voyager,
vivre ŕ l'étranger en tant qu'artiste,
peut-ętre męme vivre
une relation lesbienne.
Je suis seulement sortie avec toi
parce que tu me rappelais Kurt Cobain.
Je n'arrive pas ŕ y croire.
Je peux changer.
Je ressemblerai plus ŕ Kurt Cobain.
Je t'en prie, ne me laisse pas.
Je ne suis rien sans toi, bébé.
Ne me mets pas de pression, je t'en prie.
C'est trop !
- Je voulais juste danser. Seigneur !
- Quoi ?
On leur a promis de danser
au moins une fois.
Oui. D'accord.
Dis, Andrew, quel sont tes plans ?
Que feras-tu aprčs ce soir ?
J'ai déjŕ tout prévu.
Je vais mettre les voiles,
passer 4 belles années ŕ l'université,
puis déménager ŕ Prague ou fonder
ma propre entreprise de jeux vidéo.
- Tu ne le feras pas.
- Ah bon ?
Tu n'accompliras rien de tout ça.
Tu auras une copine
ta premičre journée ŕ l'université,
tu renonceras ŕ ton indépendance,
tu ne vivras jamais
ŕ l'étranger et tu vieilliras
en te demandant:
"Qu'est-il arrivé de mes ręves ?"
Tu crois que j'aurai une copine ?
C'est quoi, le plan ?
On va coucher ensemble, ce soir ?
Sean, tu es un gentil garçon,
mais je ne...
Non, on ne couchera pas ensemble ce soir.
Faites comme si de rien n'était.
Regardez ailleurs.
- D'accord.
- Comment ętes-vous entrés ?
De quoi tu te męles,
espčce de tortue géante ?
C'est moi, Barney.
- Salut. Oů est Lily ?
- Aux toilettes.
- Je vais porter la musique.
- Oui.
Comment ętes-vous entrés ?
- On s'est faufilés par l'arričre.
- Es-tu sérieux ?
J'ai mis toute la soirée pour entrer.
J'ai donné 200 $ ŕ un préposé ŕ l'entretien
pour qu'il me pręte son déguisement.
- Mais tu as réussi.
- Oui.
Tu as gagné la course lentement,
petit ŕ petit.
Salut ! Aurais-tu vu ma fiancée, Lily ?
Ta fiancée ? Holŕ !
C'est moi qu'elle accompagne, ce soir.
Ŕ moins que tu ne cherches la bagarre.
Mon petit, je sais que tu es ŕ ton bal
et que l'adrénaline...
Pas ce soir. J'ai attendu trop longtemps.
J'ai enfin une copine.
Tu ne me la piqueras pas.
<i>- Écoute, ne t'emporte pas.
- Nunchaku !</i>
J'arrive !
Je n'arrive pas ŕ croire que j'aie
déchargé mes nerfs sur un écolier.
Je n'arrive pas ŕ croire qu'un
écolier ait déchargé sa bile sur moi.
Je vais te poser une question folle,
puisque toi et Marshall ętes
le couple le plus adorable,
mais est-ce que tu éprouves des doutes ?
Oui.
Mais pas sur Marshall. Sur moi.
Je pense ŕ celle que j'étais voilŕ dix ans
et je me demande ce qui m'est arrivé.
Je ne veux pas ętre coincée.
Je veux vivre en France,
en Espagne et en Italie,
me laisser tremper par la vie
et l'exprimer en tableaux,
męme si je dois travailler comme serveuse
dans des cafés pendant cinq ans.
Je m'en fous. Je serai peintre.
Et je ne peux rien faire de tout ça
avec un copain autour du cou.
Mais en tout cas, je radote.
Tu ne te feras pas d'amis ainsi, Lily.
Désolée. Veux-tu me rappeler ton nom ?
Marshall.
Enchantée de faire ta connaissance,
Marshall. On est voisins.
Oui.
Ça fonctionne.
- Violent Femmes. J'adore cette chanson.
- Moi aussi.
Je n'ai vécu
aucune des expériences prévues:
Le voyage, la vie d'artiste bohčme,
la relation lesbienne.
Je n'ai rien fait de tout ça.
Lily, tu épouses ton meilleur ami.
Ça vaut tout le reste mis ensemble,
pas vrai ?
Oui.
Tu peux quand męme voyager.
Tu peux toujours peindre.
Et pour ton expérience lesbienne...
- Contente ?
- Oui.
- Tu jouais au hockey sur gazon ?
- Ta gueule.
Violation de propriété,
agression d'un mineur.
Ce déguisement de mascotte
que vous avez volé coűte 5000 $ .
On peut vous faire arręter, vous le savez.
<i>Vous avez laissé entrer
un jeune armé de nunchuks.</i>
Vous ętes gardiens de sécurité.
Je défendais mon ami.
- J'aurais pu me débrouiller.
- Oui, et je t'ai aidé, alors...
- Je n'avais pas besoin d'aide, mais merci.
- Pas de quoi.
Ce jeune était ceinture blanche.
Je suis gigantesque.
Je suis désolé, les gars. Je vous en prie,
je dois entrer pour une chanson.
Absolument pas.
Vous me remercierez plus tard, d'accord ?
- Écoutez, Don et Ray, on peut...
- Hé !
Pour une tortue, il est pas mal rapide.
La prochaine chanson est dédiée
ŕ la rousse et au grand.
- Comment s'est passé ton bal ?
- C'est ŕ toi de me le dire.
J'ai horreur de ma robe, on m'a vomi
dessus, il y a eu une grosse bagarre,
et j'ai embrassé une fille.
C'était un vrai bal, alors.
Tu m'as manqué.
Pas que j'aie envie de t'embrasser,
pas que j'aie envie de te pardonner
non plus, mais tu m'as manqué.
C'est mieux que rien.
Voilŕ pourquoi
on n'en a pas pour son argent
si on porte des jeans
dans un StripClub.
Avoue que les 88 chantent
notre chanson super bien.
Ils sont bons, oui.
Groupe: Ok.
Deux mois, bébé. Deux mois.
Deux mois.
Deux mois.
Kids, about eight months into Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's engagement,
there occurred a game-changing emergency.
Van Smoot is available.
Oh, my God!
Van Smoot House was a gorgeous mansion right on the Hudson River.
It had everything Marshall and Lily wanted for their wedding,
but it was never available.
And then, suddenly, it was.
There was a cancellation two months from now.
You want to have our wedding in two months?
No. It's impossible.
It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream!
No, there's just not enough time. There's no way...
Oh! Mini-vomit.
Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it.
If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check.
Todd and Valerie?
When you're planning a wedding, there's always one couple with similar taste
that seems to be one step ahead of you.
Todd and Valerie were that couple.
We got to make a decision.
Todd and Valerie are in motion.
Van Smoot!
Oh! Kids, color!
- Come on, baby.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Hello, Marshall.
Lily.
Todd.
Valerie.
Stairs.
I can't believe it.
We got Van Smoot House.
It is on. It is on!
Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.
- What?
- You're a wonder.
Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.
How are you going to get everything done?
Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up.
Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.
Robin had been mad at me since the night I slightly exaggerated
my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness.
- Was it...?
- It was your girlfriend.
You might want to call her back.
Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist?
And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations.
Wow. That was really awkward, Lil.
And still. It's still really awkward right now.
Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?
Okay, your job is very simple.
At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.
Lil, you know I can't promise that.
Shh! Shh!
Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out.
Hey, babe.
Hey, little one.
- Hey, Lilypad.
- Crap!
Band! We forgot a band!
It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing.
Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it.
I called The 88!
- Who?
- The 88.
They're this awesome band.
They played my law review party. They were found guilty.
On three counts of rocking.
I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great.
John "Bonzo" Bonham from Led Zeppelin?
Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin,
who died in 1980, got married two months ago.
Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen.
We... we don't even know if they can play our song.
They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition.
Baby, The 88 don't audition.
They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands.
Well, then... I have to say no.
Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday.
Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend?
Let me check their Website.
What?
Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing.
Intense?
I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people.
Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table,
I need you to roll with it, okay?
Wow.
Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer.
We already have a caterer.
Oh, right. You're getting married.
You see what I did there? Took a...
It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.
A prom? Can... can we go to that?
Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch.
Yeah. No, they won't.
Why not?
'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.
No sweat, we'll just sneak in.
We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.
Yes, we are. It's the only way.
You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped.
It's nine weeks till the wedding.
At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything.
- Well...
- No, Barney.
And so, Aunt Lily had the plan to crash the prom.
- I'll go with you.
- Really?
Yeah. I never got to go to my prom.
We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.
Lesbian.
The cough is supposed to cover the "lesbian."
No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate.
Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?
Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep,
and you've got "statutory" written all over your body.
Hey, why don't we all go?
I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in.
We don't want to mess things up for Lily.
Yeah, you're right.
Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding.
Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?
Sounds awesome.
We should go out and just get freakin' weird.
Yeah.
'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw.
What?
Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear?
Lame!
But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later.
All right, what do you think?
Horrible.
You're gonna make such a great dad.
You look so classy and nice.
You're going to stick out like a sore thumb.
Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days,
with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris?
They all dress like strippers.
It's go ho or go home.
Well, we have to get in.
I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday,
'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have...
Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay?
Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it.
All right.
That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!
I never thought this would be a bad thing,
but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.
I didn't know I still had this.
What?
The dress I wore to my actual prom.
Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom,
and not like in a corporate, plastic way. Like, truly, truly hot.
Like a hot soul.
Aw, you look great, too, Scooter.
So big news.
I heard from umpire school. I'm in!
Oh, disco!
I am so happy for you.
You mean happy for us, right, babe?
Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday.
No, baby.
We're gonna be an umpire someday.
Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.
No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go.
I'm not showing anymore...
Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.
Aw. Sweet.
Thank you.
Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?
No.
I've never been to prom before, okay?
We got to go. See ya.
Bye, have fun.
See you.
They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted?
So, what, we ready for tonight?
Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first.
Shot of Jim Beam?
- Yeah.
- Yes!
And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations.
What?!
I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is.
Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break.
Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad,
but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.
Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it.
First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize.
Do I look like I'm four?
All right, what kind of prize are we talking?
Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids.
Is this gonna work?
Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time.
It's all about confidence.
Follow me.
Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody.
Going to prom-- whee-hoo!
- Uh, you're adults.
- Okay, bye.
Okay, look, I just need to see the band.
I'm getting married in two months, and...
And you're just finding a band?
Hey, ho, hey!
I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be a student or the date of a student.
Wow. "Ma'am?" Check and mate.
It's cool. Time to activate plan B.
Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow?
Scherbotsky?
Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?
We don't have that kind of money.
For free.
Oh, hell yeah!
Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.
- Hi. Shall we?
- Sure.
I knew it would happen. This is the dream.
Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?
Don't worry about me. I'll get in.
Oh... I'll get in.
We're in!
Thank you. We're going to take a break.
Oh, you're kidding me.
Hey, uh, you ladies want something to take the edge off?
Yeah, what the hell? It's prom.
That tastes like cough syrup.
Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol.
Um, our fake IDs say we're only 20.
We didn't realize it till after we bought them.
Nerds who aren't good at math?
Life's going to be rough, boys.
Hi. Excuse me.
I was wondering if you guys could play "Good Feeling" by the Violent Femmes.
I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married
and my fiancé wants to hire you guys as the band,
but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play "Good Feeling" because that's our song,
and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?
Look, I'm kinda wasted right now, so I didn't understand any of that.
But, uh, if you get us the sheet music, we'll play your song.
So, you buzzing, baby?
My phlegm feels looser.
This is pathetic.
It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights.
If I got in a fight, would you have my back?
You know it.
I'd have your back, too.
That's cool.
What, you don't think you'd need my help?
You don't know what I can do. I'm like...
like a berserker.
Okay, Ted.
Hello.
Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music
for "Good Feeling" and bring it out here, like, now.
Hang on.
It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom.
- Can Ted come?
- Wait! Don't ask!
That's so lame!
I don't even want to go anyway.
Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us.
What'd she say? What'd she say?
He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me.
I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive.
Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's,
it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.
Okay, bye.
She totally wants you to come.
All right, sheet music's on the way.
Are you okay?
There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling.
It's just all moving too fast.
How is it moving too fast? We've been together for two years.
I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.
What's decided?
I go to umpire school, you go to college.
We move into my dad's house in Staten Island.
We have kids, we grow old together. What's decided?
It's wide open!
Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us.
You're, you're breaking up with me?
There's still so much I want to do.
I want to travel, live overseas as an artist,
maybe have a lesbian relationship.
Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.
I can't believe this.
I can change. I can look more like Kurt Cobain.
Please, just don't leave me.
I'm nothing without you, baby.
Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much!
It's just one dance, God!
What?
Well, we did promise them one dance.
Yeah, sure, okay.
So Andrew, what's your big plan?
What's life going to be like after tonight?
Well, you know I got it all worked out.
Uh, leave this place in my dust, four awesome years at college,
and then I'll move to Prague or start my own video game company or something.
- No, you won't.
- I won't?
No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to.
You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence
and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old
before your time wondering "Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?"
Whoa.
You really think I'll get a girlfriend?
So, uh, what's the deal here? Am I getting lucky tonight?
Oh, Sean, look, um,
you're a nice guy, but I just don't...
No, you're not getting lucky tonight.
Okay, just be cool. Don't look at me.
Okay.
How'd you get in here?
What's it to you, giant turtle?
It's me, Barney.
Oh, hey. Where's Lily?
She's in the bathroom.
- Wait here, I should go talk to the band.
- All right.
How did you guys get in here?
We just snuck in the back.
You just snu... Are you serious?
I've been trying to get in here all night.
I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume.
But you got in.
Slow and steady won the race.
Hey, bro, have you seen my fiancée Lily?
Your fiancée?
Whoa, tonight she's with me, bro.
Unless you're looking for trouble.
Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but...
No, not tonight. I've waited too long for this.
I finally got a girl and I'm not going to let you take her away from me.
Whoa, whoa.
Look, let's not get carried away.
Yah! Nunchaku!
I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.
I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me.
I'm going to ask you something and, um,
maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever.
But, um, are you having second thoughts?
Yeah.
But not about Marshall.
About me.
I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago
and wondering what happened to her.
I don't want to be tied down.
I want to live in France and Spain and Italy
and just soak up life and put it on a canvas,
even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafés for five years, I don't care.
I'm going to be a painter.
And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know?
But anyway, I'm blabbering.
Way to make new friends, Lily.
I'm sorry. What was your name again?
Marshall.
Nice to meet you, Marshall.
Guess we're hallmates.
Yeah.
It works.
Violent Femmes. I love this song.
Me, too.
I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to.
The travel, the bohemian art life,
my big lesbian experience.
I didn't do any of it.
Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world.
I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?
Yeah.
And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint.
And as far as your lesbian experience...
Happy?
Yeah.
- So field hockey, huh?
- Shut up.
Trespassing, assaulting a minor.
This mascot costume you stole cost $5,000.
We can have you guys arrested, you know that?
Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus.
You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here.
I totally could have taken that kid.
Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so...
Well, I don't need it, but thanks.
Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome.
No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic.
Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song.
Absolutely not.
You guys will thank me for this later, okay?
- Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?
- Hey!
You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick.
This one goes out to that redhead girl and that tall guy.
So how was your first prom?
You tell me.
I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me,
there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.
So, basically, it was a prom.
Okay, I've missed you.
Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way,
not even in an I-forgive-you way.
Just in a I've-missed-you way.
I'll take what I can get.
And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth
when you wear jeans to a strip club.
So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song.
Yeah, it's good.
Band? Check.
Two months, baby.
Two months.
Two months.

<i>La vie est une route sombre.
On ne sait jamais ce qui se trouve au bout.</i>
<i>Un soir, on avance tranquillement,
profitant de la ballade,</i>
<i>puis, tout ŗ coup...</i>
<i>on a 28 ans.</i>
- Et une lasagne pour le grand garÁon !
- Merci.
- Attention, l'assiette est brŻlante.
- D'accord.
Allez, vas-y, touches-y.
Doux Jťsus !
Elle est brŻlante, cette assiette !
Alors, Barney, vas-tu le faire ou non ?
- Oh, Barney, ne fais pas Áa !
- Il le faut. C'est ce que j'offre ŗ Ted.
Rien ne t'y oblige.
Allez, ce sera embarrassant,
on ne pourra plus venir ici,
Áa serait emmerdant
en plus d'Ítre probablement meilleur
pour notre santť.
Allez, Marshall, c'est le meilleur moyen
de draguer au monde !
Barney.
Bonne fÍte, Ted.
Excuse-moi, on t'a dťjŗ dit...
- Oh, mon Dieu !
- Quoi ?
Appelez une ambulance !
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Ne dis rien. Assieds-toi.
Ne parle pas. Ne dis rien.
- Elle va bien ?
- Je suis sťrieux, appelez le 911 !
- Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ? Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Ne bouge pas. Essaye de...
Tiens, bois un peu d'eau. De l'eau !
Voilŗ, bois Áa.
Plus je regarde,
moins je suis convaincu que c'est
le meilleur moyen de draguer au monde.
Attends, tu vas voir.
Vingt-huit ans. Plus que deux autres
avant le grand chiffre. Trois-zťro.
<i>En fait, mon 30e anniversaire n'a pas ťtť
si terrible.</i>
<i>Sauf pour la chŤvre dans ma salle de bain.
Une histoire excellente.</i>
<i>Mais ce sera pour une autre fois.</i>
C'est quand mÍme un an de plus.
Et toujours cťlibataire.
Tu n'entends pas
ton horloge Ted-ologique ?
Non. J'ai appuyť sur le rappel d'alarme.
Et voilŗ les ambulanciers.
- Merci, mon Dieu, vous Ítes lŗ !
- Que se passe-t-il ?
Peut-Ítre une hťmorragie interne.
SŻrement des fractures.
Elle doit aller ŗ l'hŰpital.
- De quoi tu parles ?
- Tu as fait une chute terrible.
Mais non !
Vraiment ? Je pourrais pourtant jurer
que tu es tombťe du ciel, mon ange.
Donne-lui ton numťro. Quoi ?
Donne-lui ton numťro. Quoi ?
Donne-lui ton...
Allez, les gars ! C'est embarrassant.
- Donne-lui ton numťro.
- Donne-lui ton numťro.
Qu'est-ce que... Allez !
- Donne-lui ton numťro.
- Donne-lui ton numťro.
Ils ne s'arrÍteront que si tu me donnes
ton numťro.
- Donne-lui ton numťro.
- Donne-lui ton numťro.
- Bon, d'accord !
- «a a marchť !
Je ne peux pas croire
qu'elle lui ait donnť son numťro.
Peut-Ítre qu'elle est vraiment
tombťe sur la tÍte.
Merci ŗ tous.
Merci ŗ tous. C'ťtait amusant.
Voici Wendy, la serveuse.
Soyez gťnťreux. Merci.
<i>TroÔlus et Cressida.
Au Neighborhood Playhouse.</i>
Allez les voir, ils sont bons.
Je comprends mon cťlibat.
CŰtť femmes, je ne fais pas de compromis.
La femme que je marierai
devra Ítre parfaite.
- C'est quoi la perfection ?
- Rien de bien prťcis.
- Oh, que si !
- Attirante, diplŰmťe universitaire.
Elle veut un garÁon et une fille.
- J'en connais des tas...
- C'est pas tout.
Elle aime les chiens, Otis Redding,
les mots croisťs.
Elle aime le sport,
mais ses mollets ne sont pas plus gros
que les miens.
C'est trop bizarre.
Elle joue de la basse
comme Kim Deal des Pixies.
- Ou comme Kim Gordon de Sonic Youth.
- Toutes les Kim des bons groupes.
- Faut pas Ítre trop difficile.
- Tu ne la trouveras jamais.
C'est exact.
C'est pourquoi j'attends qu'elle me trouve.
Je ne veux plus prťvoir l'imprťvisible.
Tu crois que le destin
va s'en charger pour toi ?
C'est Áa.
SOLUTIONS d'amour
<i>J'ťtais loin de me douter
qu'ŗ ce moment, le destin,</i>
<i>sous la forme d'un
super ordinateur de 600 gigahertz,</i>
<i>s'en chargeait pour moi.</i>
PARTENAIRE TROUV…
- «a alors, tu te lŤves de bonne heure.
- J'avais envie de faire des crÍpes.
- Marshall le sait ?
- Il dort comme un bťbť.
Gťnial ! Vraiment gťnial !
Bon Dieu ! Tu es la meilleure.
Au diable les crÍpes, je devrais te couvrir
de sirop et t'avaler tout rond.
Ne fais pas Áa, s'il te plaÓt.
Hť, le lait est bon ?
C'est vrai, j'ai eu la mÍme rťaction hier.
Mais pourquoi ne l'as-tu pas jetť ?
Je dois aller faire des courses
aprŤs le travail. J'en rachŤterai.
Oh ! Ces crÍpes sont divines.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas, chťri ?
C'est le meilleur moment de ma journťe.
<i>C'ťtait vrai.</i>
<i>Marshall rÍvait
que son diplŰme de loi l'aiderait</i>
<i>ŗ protťger l'environnement.</i>
<i>Mais le mariage coŻtant cher,</i>
<i>il ťtait stagiaire depuis 2 mois
pour la firme de Barney,</i>
<i>et il en dťtestait chaque minute.</i>
Barney, j'ai quelques questions ŗ propos
de ces bulletins de commande.
Les jumelles. L'autre paire, sur le bureau.
Je n'ai pas le temps de faire le voyeur,
j'ai beaucoup de travail.
Regarde une seconde, veux-tu ?
Le bureau du coin, l'ťtage du haut.
Regarde ce gars.
Il s'appelle Clark Butterfield.
Il travaille pour Nicholson, Hewitt et West,
et tous les matins, il commande
un sandwich au restaurant d'en bas.
- Et alors ?
- Devine ce que j'ai fait avec le sandwich ?
Regarde, j'ai pris une photo.
Oh ! Doux Jťsus !
Et je lui envoie par courriel ŗ l'instant.
Par terre !
C'est dťgoŻtant !
- Pourquoi as-tu fais Áa ?
- Qui sait ?
Cette querelle est si vieille,
je ne sais plus qui a commencť.
- Toi ?
- «a, c'est sŻr.
Bon, si tu pouvais m'aider ŗ remplir
ces commandes,
j'apprťcierais beaucoup.
Quoi ?
Butterfield se vengera
d'ici quelques heures.
C'est comme Áa qu'il procŤde.
C'est la guerre, Eriksen.
Annule tous tes rendez-vous.
Dis ŗ Lily que tu rentres tard.
C'est ridicule.
Allez, je ne t'ai pas engagť
pour tes talents d'avocat.
Je t'ai engagť pour Ítre
mon conseiller du mal.
C'est un emploi pour moi, Barney.
Une faÁon d'amasser de l'argent
pour le mariage.
Bon, je suis dťsolť, mais j'ai du travail.
Tracy, pouvez-vous venir ici un instant ?
Pouvez-vous informer M. Eriksen
que je ne lui adresse plus la parole ?
- M. Eriksen, M. Stinson ne vous...
- J'ai compris. Merci, Tracy.
AllŰ ?
Bonjour. Puis-je parler ŗ M. Ted Mosby ?
C'est moi.
M. Mosby, comment allez-vous ?
Bob Rorschach, de Solutions d'amour.
<i>Vous vous Ítes inscrit
ŗ nos services il y a six mois.</i>
Oui. Vous n'avez jamais trouvť
personne pour moi.
En fait, c'est la raison de mon appel.
<i>Nous l'avons trouvťe.
Nous avons trouvť votre ‚me soeur.</i>
Je ne comprends pas. Et Ellen Pierce ?
Elle n'est plus en charge ?
Mon entreprise a achetť la compagnie.
Entreprise de textile et
de viandes de haute qualitť,
que les petits gťnies
de la direction veulent diversifier.
C'est pourquoi je suis ici.
Je suis donc entre bonnes mains.
Vous m'avez trouvť une partenaire ?
La voici. Votre ‚me soeur. «a fait 500 $ .
Pas question. La derniŤre fois,
la fille s'est avťrťe fiancťe.
Elle n'est pas fiancťe.
C'est votre ‚me soeur.
Lisez simplement le dossier.
<i>J'ai donc lu le dossier.
Et, bon Dieu, cette femme ťtait parfaite.</i>
<i>Elle aimait les chiens,
passait ses ťtťs en Caroline du Nord.</i>
<i>Elle jouait de la guitare basse,
faisait des mots croisťs.</i>
<i>Elle jouait au tennis, aimait les vieux films
et la lasagne.</i>
<i>Livre prťfťrť:
L'amour au temps du cholťra.</i>
<i>Son chanteur prťfťrť ťtait Otis Redding et
elle voulait un garÁon et une fille.</i>
Bon, d'accord. Arrangez un rendez-vous.
Tu voulais me voir,
j'imagine qu'on se parle ŗ nouveau.
Tu peux goŻter ce cafť pour moi ?
Je crois qu'il est dťcafťinť.
Il goŻte le rťgulier.
C'est ce que je croyais
avant de voir le courriel de Butterfield.
- Oh, mon Dieu !
- J'ai eu la mÍme rťaction.
Pourquoi tu m'y as fait goŻter, alors ?
Parce que dťsormais,
Áa te concerne ťgalement.
D'accord.
Ne crois surtout pas que j'oublie
que je devrais Ítre f‚chť contre toi.
Conseiller du mal Marshall Eriksen
au rapport.
Ce salaud va le payer.
On se brosse les dents, avant ?
- C'est probablement une bonne idťe.
- Allons-y.
<i>Ce soir-lŗ, j'avais rendez-vous
avec ma partenaire parfaite.</i>
<i>J'ťtais si ťnervť
que je suis arrivť d'avance.</i>
<i>Mais avant mÍme
que la soirťe ne commence...</i>
Lily ?
Hť, Ted, es-tu occupť ?
Oui.
C'est vrai. L'‚me soeur. J'avais oubliť.
Tu pourrais prendre un taxi
jusqu'ŗ Dutchess County
et changer un pneu crevť
sur la Fiero de Marshall ?
<i>Quoi ?</i>
Quoi ? Non.
Tu ne peux pas appeler Marshall ?
Marshall ne doit pas Ítre au courant.
…coute, Ted, il fait noir,
je ne sais pas comment changer un pneu
et on dirait que je suis au beau milieu
d'une histoire d'horreur de feu de camp.
- Tu peux te dťpÍcher ?
- Je ne peux pas. J'attends...
Oh ! C'est quelqu'un avec un crochet
ŗ la place de la main, Áa ?
Non, monsieur, non !
- Allez, Lily.
- Tu vois ce que je veux dire.
Bon, d'accord, reste lŗ. J'arrive.
<i>Alors 90 $ de taxi plus tard,
j'ťtais au milieu de nulle part.</i>
Oh, merci mon Dieu.
Je suis vraiment dťsolťe.
- T'as rencontrť ta partenaire ?
- Oui.
- Elle a voulu remettre ŗ plus tard ?
- Oui, puisqu'elle est parfaite !
Alors, qu'est-ce que je fais ici ?
- Ne le dis jamais ŗ Marshall.
- D'accord.
Jamais. Jure-le sur la tÍte
de tes enfants ŗ naÓtre.
Je le jure sur la tÍte de Luke et Leia.
Il y a environ un mois,
j'ai commencť ŗ faire de l'insomnie.
<i>Pendant longtemps, me marier
avec Marshall ťtait tout ce que je voulais.</i>
<i>Mais lŗ, Áa allait vraiment arriver
et Áa paraissait ťnorme et terrifiant.</i>
<i>- Tu en as discutť avec Marshall ?
- Il n'aurait pas compris.</i>
<i>Se passer la corde au cou
ne le rend pas nerveux.</i>
<i>Alors j'ai passť mes nuits ŗ lire, ŗ peindre,</i>
<i>ŗ ťtablir des records ŗ Super Bomberman.</i>
<i>- C'ťtait toi ? Gťnial !
- Je sais !</i>
<i>J'ťtais vraiment concentrťe et...
Ce n'est pas le but de l'histoire.</i>
<i>Alors je me suis mise ŗ songer ŗ Victoria</i>
<i>et ŗ son rÍve qu'elle a suivi
jusqu'en Allemagne,</i>
<i>et je suis tombťe sur ces cours d'art.</i>
- Je devine qu'ils se donnent trŤs loin.
- ņ San Francisco.
Je n'irai pas. Les dates entrent en conflit
avec le mariage.
Mais j'adore peindre. Je me suis
toujours demandť si j'avais du talent.
C'ťtait le moyen de le dťcouvrir.
- Et l'entrevue est ce soir.
- ņ New Haven.
Tu ne veux pas te marier.
Bien sŻr que je veux me marier !
Ce n'est pas comme si j'avais vraiment eu
l'intention de le faire.
Je voulais juste...
Je voulais savoir si j'en ťtais capable.
Lily, on vit dans le bain de l'art
et de la culture d'Amťrique.
Tu aurais pu trouver un programme ici.
Mais tu en as choisi un
qui est ŗ 5000 km d'ici
sans le dire ŗ Marshall.
Je crois que la signification est claire.
D'accord, je...
Je n'ťtais plus certaine.
Mais je le suis maintenant !
Cette crevaison ťtait un signe.
Je ne dois pas le faire.
Je dois retourner ŗ la maison
et Ítre avec Marshall.
- Tu dois me trouver tellement stupide.
- Je ne te trouve pas stupide.
- J'aime Marshall.
- Je sais. Approche.
«a va aller.
Le mariage est une grande dťcision.
Tu as le droit de paniquer.
Mais pourquoi suis-je la seule ?
Pourquoi Marshall ne fait rien de fou ?
Nous avons besoin d'une grosse boÓte
et de 100 souris blanches.
PLAN C - BoÓte
C'est fait.
Ted, allons ŗ New Haven.
Lily, ne te fais pas Áa.
Je veux juste savoir
si je peux Ítre acceptťe.
Si je passe l'entrevue
et qu'on m'accepte, je saurai.
Je pourrai mettre Áa derriŤre moi
et me marier.
Allez ! C'est une aventure.
Ce n'est pas une aventure.
C'est une erreur.
Oui, d'accord, c'est une erreur.
Je sais que c'est une erreur.
Il y a des moments dans la vie
oý on sait que c'est une erreur
sans savoir que c'est une erreur,
car le seul moyen de savoir
que c'en est une est de la faire,
regarder en arriŤre et dire:
"C'ťtait une erreur."
Alors la seule vraie erreur serait
de ne pas faire l'erreur
parce qu'on passerait sa vie sans savoir
si c'est une erreur ou non.
Et merde ! Je n'ai jamais fait d'erreur.
J'ai un parcours,
ma vie, ma relation, ma carriŤre,
sans erreur.
Tu comprends quelque chose ?
Je ne sais pas.
Tu as beaucoup prononcť le mot "erreur".
Lily, ne fais pas Áa.
Ted, je me marie dans deux mois.
Je panique. Tu es mon meilleur ami,
- tu vas devoir me pardonner.
- Te pardonner pour quoi ?
Lily. Lily !
Salut Lily, c'est Ted,
le gars que tu as laissť seul
sur le bord de la route.
Je voulais te dire bonne chance
pour l'entrevue.
Souviens-toi d'acheter du lait.
Oh ! Et quand je serai de retour
ŗ la maison, je vais te tuer.
De plus, je t'ai envoyť la mÍme chose
par message texte.
Hť, j'ai besoin d'une faveur.
Tout ce que tu veux.
Tu dois venir me chercher
ŗ Dutchess County.
Non.
- C'est un peu urgent.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais lŗ-bas ?
Je cueille des pommes.
Peux-tu simplement venir ?
Malheureusement, je suis coincť
au travail.
On est dťbordť.
- C'est Ted ?
- Ouais. Il est coincť ŗ Dutchess County.
C'est pas ton rendez-vous ce soir ?
Marshall. Salut. Oui, c'est ce soir.
Alors que fais-tu ŗ Dutchess County ?
Est-ce qu'un gars ne peut pas
cueillir des pommes en paix ? Merde !
Bon, d'accord. Je viens te chercher.
- Non !
- Relaxe, je vais prendre la Fiero.
Non, non. Oublie Áa.
Je blague.
Je ne suis pas ŗ Dutchess County.
C'est Áa, la blague ?
Tu n'es pas ŗ Dutchess County ?
Ouais. Je t'ai eu !
Un classique. Je dois y aller.
Hť, regarde celle-ci.
Elle ressemble ŗ Butterfield.
Au Conseil de dťfense des
ressources naturelles, les gens
considŤrent que leur travail de sauver
la planŤte est trŤs, trŤs sťrieux.
Ce qui est fantastique, mais
je ne peux pas imaginer
avoir autant de plaisir lŗ-bas.
Tu penses venir travailler ŗ temps plein ?
Peut-Ítre.
- Ne le dis pas ŗ Lily.
- D'accord.
- Je m'en vais.
- Merci, Tracy.
Vous pensez percer
des trous dans la boÓte ?
Bien sŻr que oui.
- Tu y aurais pensť ?
- Non.
- «a aurait ťtť mauvais.
- Dťsastreux.
<i>Heureusement, il me restait
une personne ŗ appeler.</i>
- Besoin d'une voiture, cowboy ?
- Je ne monte pas avec les inconnus.
- Dommage. J'ai des bonbons.
- Des bonbons ?
Tu ne me diras pas ce que tu faisais
au bord de l'autoroute
ŗ Dutchess County ?
- Non. J'ai jurť le silence.
- Oh, allez !
- J'aime bien ton chapeau.
- Ouais.
C'est gÍnant. J'ai colorť des mŤches.
Avec des crayons de cire chaude ?
- Crayon de cire, cire chaude...
- J'ai compris.
Je pensais que ce serait bien.
Bien sŻr, ma coloriste a traduit "mŤches"
en: "je veux ressembler ŗ un tigre".
- D'oý le chapeau.
- Oh, je dois voir Áa.
- Pas question.
- Allez ! Je parie que ce n'est pas si mal.
Je parie que c'est vraiment super !
"Alors," dit-elle, changeant de sujet.
"Grand rendez-vous ce soir."
Elle fait combien
sur la grille de correction Mosby ?
C'est assez ťpoustouflant.
Elle a 28 ans, tout comme moi.
«a alors, j'ai 28 ans.
DiplŰmťe universitaire ? Oui.
Joueuse de tennis ? Oui.
<i>L'amour au temps du cholťra
comme livre favori ? Oui.</i>
Je l'ai lu, celui-lŗ. C'est plutŰt:
"L'amour au temps qui n'en finit pas".
Tu sais, c'est impoli de porter
un chapeau ŗ l'intťrieur.
- On n'est pas ŗ l'intťrieur.
- On n'est pas ŗ l'extťrieur. Fais voir.
- Jamais. Quoi d'autre ?
- Elle adore la lasagne.
- Beurk.
- Je sens comme une redondance ici.
Quoi d'autre ?
Voyons voir. Oh !
Elle ne ressemble pas ŗ un tigre.
Elle veut se marier et avoir des enfants ?
Oui et oui.
Elle en veut deux. Un garÁon et une fille.
Impressionnant !
J'y ai songť.
Je crois que je ne veux pas d'enfant.
Vraiment ? Tu n'en veux aucun ?
Ce n'est pas tout le monde
qui est aussi femme que toi, Ted.
Hť, je conduis !
Regarde Áa, 20 h 56. Tu es en avance.
Merci d'Ítre venue me chercher.
Bonne chance pour ce rendez-vous.
J'espŤre qu'elle rťpondra ŗ tes attentes.
Merci.
Bon, tu as ťvidemment passť
une soirťe ťprouvante.
Je veux que tu entres lŗ-dedans
un sourire au visage,
alors voilŗ ce que je vais faire.
Tu vas me montrer tes cheveux ?
J'allais te montrer mes seins,
mais, d'accord, va pour les cheveux.
J'en avais besoin ce soir.
Vas-y.
Demain matin, Barney enverra le colis
et Butterfield se retrouvera
dans les souris jusqu'au cou.
- Oh, salut toi !
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Alors, Lily, tu as achetť du lait ?
Oui. J'en ai achetť.
Tu veux en boire de ce lait ?
Non. Non, Áa va.
Je n'ai pas besoin de lait.
Bon, je sais que le lait est important.
Il contient de la vitamine A et D.
C'est bon le matin,
mais Ted revient d'un grand rendez-vous !
- Comment Áa s'est passť ?
- Je n'y suis pas allť.
Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
J'ai changť d'idťe.
Je ne veux plus la rencontrer.
Pourquoi ? Elle a l'air parfaite.
Je ne veux pas la perfection.
Je veux Robin.
Oh, non. Il recommence.
- Ted, c'est une erreur !
- Peut-Ítre.
Mais c'est une erreur que je dois faire.
Faux. C'est une erreur
que tu n'as pas ŗ faire.
Regarde la vťritť en face.
Robin et toi avez essayť
encore et encore...
<i>La vťritť, ŗ propos des erreurs,</i>
<i>c'est que, parfois,
mÍme si l'on sait que c'en est une,</i>
<i>on doit la faire quand mÍme.</i>
Doux Jťsus !
Elle est brŻlante, cette assiette !
Hť, le lait est bon ?
<i>MÍme si c'est vraiment, vraiment stupide.</i>
Kids, life is a dark road.
You never really know what's up ahead.
One night you're cruising along enjoying the ride,
and then all of a sudden,
you're 28.
And for the birthday boy, lasagna.
Thank you.
Careful. The plate is very hot.
'Kay.
Oh, go on, touch it.
Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.
All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?
Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.
I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted.
You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing
and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck...
in addition to probably being kind of healthy.
Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
Barney.
Oy, gevalt.
- Ah... Happy birthday, Ted.
- Whoo-hoo!
Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y...
Oh, my God.
What?
Oh! Call an ambulance!
- What's going on?
- Try not to speak.
Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk.
- Is she okay?
- I'm serious, call 911.
What's wrong? What's the matter?
Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try...
Here, have some water. Water!
Here, drink this.
Shh! Shh!
You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am
that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
Wait for it.
28. Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.
Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad.
Well, except for the goat in my bathroom. Which is a great story.
But I'll get to that later.
Still, you know, another year older. Still single.
You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?
Nope. I hit the snooze button.
And here come the paramedics.
Oh, thank God, you're here.
What is going on?!
I think there might be some internal bleeding.
Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital.
What are you talking about?
- You've had a terrible fall.
- No, I haven't.
Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven.
Angel...
Give him your number. What?
Give him your number. What?
- Give him your number.
- Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.
- Give him your number.
- What are you...? Come on.
They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.
- All right!
- It works!
I cannot believe that she gave him her number.
Maybe she really does have a brain injury.
Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun.
It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys.
Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good.
I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle.
If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.
Well, what's perfect?
- It's not like I have a list.
- Oh, yes, you do.
Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...
- That's not hard. I know at least...
- I'm not done.
She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword.
She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine.
That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.
Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.
Any Kim from any cool band, really.
Can't be too picky.
You're never going to find this girl.
Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me.
I am done trying to plan the unplannable.
So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?
That's the plan.
And little did I know, at that very moment, fate--
in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer--
was taking care of it.
Whoa, you're up early.
Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.
Does Marshall know?
He's still sound asleep.
Awesome.
So awesome.
God! Best girl ever.
Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.
Please don't do that.
Hey, is this milk any good?
Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.
God, why didn't you throw it away?
I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk.
Oh...! These pancakes are delightful.
What's wrong, baby?
This is the high point of my day.
It was true.
See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment.
But he needed money for the wedding,
so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm...
and he hated every minute of it.
Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.
Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.
I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do.
Just take a look, will ya?
Okay, corner office. Top floor.
Check out that guy.
Name's Clark Butterfield.
He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West
and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.
So?
So guess what I did to that sandwich?
Here, I took a picture.
Oh! Sweet Lord.
And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.
Ooh! Duck!
That is sick!
Why would you do that?
Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot.
- You?
- Totally.
Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.
What?
Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern.
This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule,
call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.
This is stupid.
Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills.
I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.
This is a job for me, Barney.
It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it.
Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.
Tracy, could you come in here, please?
Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.
Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer...
I get it. Thank you, Tracy.
Hello?
Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?
Speaking.
Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions.
You signed up for our services about six months ago.
Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.
Right. Well... actually, that's why I'm calling.
We found her, sir.
We found your soul mate.
I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?
Well, my firm bought out the company.
You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate,
but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so...
here I am.
So I'm in good hands.
You found me a match?
There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks.
No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.
She's not engaged. She's your soul mate.
Just read the file.
So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect.
She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina,
she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword,
she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna,
her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding
and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.
All right, fine. Set it up.
You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?
Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.
Tastes normal to me.
That's what I thought, too.
Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.
Oh, God!
It got me as well.
Well, then why did you have me drink it?!
Because now... you're in.
Okay.
Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you.
But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty.
Let's make that bastard pay.
You think that we should brush our teeth first?
Yeah, it's probably a good idea.
So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match.
I was so excited, I got there early.
But before it even started...
Lily?
Hey, Ted, are you busy?
Um... yes.
Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot.
Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?
What? What? No.
Can't you just call Marshall?
Marshall can't know about this.
Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire,
and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story.
- Can you please hurry?
- I can't, I'm waiting...
Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand?
No, drifter, no!
Come on, Lily.
But you see my point.
All right, stay there. I'm on my way.
And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, thank God.
I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?
Y es.
And was she okay about pushing it back?
Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?
- You can never tell Marshall.
- I won't.
Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.
I swear on Luke and Leia.
About a month ago, I started getting insomnia.
Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time.
But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.
Did you talk to Marshall about it?
He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot.
So I spent my nights reading, painting,
setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...
That was you? Awesome!
I know! I just got in the zone and...
Not the point of the story.
And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany,
and I found that art fellowship.
Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.
San Francisco.
But it's not like I'm going to do it.
The dates conflict with the wedding.
But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good.
This was a way to find out.
And the interview is tonight.
In New Haven.
You don't want to get married.
Of course I want to get married.
I... It's not like I was ever going to do it.
I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.
Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America.
I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective.
But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall.
I think it's pretty clear what that means.
Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts.
But I'm not any more.
I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this.
I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall.
- You must think I'm so stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.
- I love Marshall.
- I know you do. Come here.
It's okay. Look...
Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.
But why am I the only one?
How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?
So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.
All done.
Ted, let's go to New Haven.
Lily, don't do this to yourself.
I just need to know if I can get in.
If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know,
and I can forget all about it, and get married.
Come on! It's an adventure.
No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.
Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake.
But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake
but you don't really know it's a mistake
because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake,
and look back, and say, "Yep. That was a mistake."
So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake,
because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not.
And, damn it, I've made no mistakes!
I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free.
Does any of this make sense to you?
I don't know. You said "mistake" a lot.
Lily, don't do this.
Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out,
and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.
Forgive you for what? Lily.
Lily!
Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road.
I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk...
Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you.
And, also, I texted you the same thing.
- Hey, I need a big favor.
- Anything, bro.
I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.
No.
It's kind of an emergency.
What are you doing in Duchess County?
Apple picking. Can you just get up here?
I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work.
We're kind of swamped.
Is that Ted?
Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County.
Don't you have a big date tonight?
Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.
So what are you doing in Duchess County?
Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!
Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.
No!
Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.
No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank.
I'm not in Duchess County.
So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?
Yep. Gotcha! Classic!
Gotta go.
Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield.
You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people
who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously.
Which is great, and everything, but
I can't imagine having this much fun over there.
You thinking about coming to work here full-time?
Maybe.
Don't tell Lily, okay?
Taking off for the night.
Thanks, Tracy.
Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?
Of course we are.
- Were you going to think of that?
- No.
- That would have been bad.
- Horrible.
Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home.
Need a ride, cowboy?
Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.
Hmm, too bad. I got candy.
Candy?!
So you're not going to tell me what you were doing
by the side of a highway in Duchess County?
Nope. Sworn to secrecy.
Oh, come on.
- I like your hat.
- Right.
This is embarrassing. I got highlights.
Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice?
- Highlights is a children's magazine.
- Yeah, I got it.
I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took "highlights" to mean,
"I want to look like a tiger," hence the hat.
- Oh. I gotta see this.
- No way.
Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad.
I bet it looks grr-eat!
So, she says, changing the subject.
Big date tonight.
How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?
Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.
Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.
Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check.
Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.
I read that.
More like "Love in the Time of Don't Bothera."
You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.
We're not indoors. We're in a van.
Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.
Never. What else?
- She loves lasagna.
- Barf.
You know, I am sensing a pattern here.
What else?
Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.
And she's looking to get married and have kids?
Check and check. She wants two kids-- a boy and a girl.
Wow.
You know, I've been thinking about this.
I think I want to have zero kids.
Really? You don't want kids?
You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you.
Hey. I'm driving.
Look at that. 8:56. You're early.
Hey, thanks for picking me up.
Good luck on your date.
I hope she's everything you're looking for.
Thanks.
All right, you've clearly had a rough night.
I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh,
here's what I'm going to do.
You're going to show me your hair?
Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.
You just made my night.
Go.
Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package,
and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice.
- Oh, hey, dude.
- Hey, guys.
Hi.
Hey.
So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?
Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.
You think you might want to... drink the milk?
No.
Nope, I'm good.
I don't need any milk.
Look, guys, I know milk is important--
it's got vitamin A, vitamin D,
it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date.
How'd it go, dude?
I didn't go.
What? Why?
I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.
Why? She sounds perfect.
I don't want perfect.
I want Robin.
Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.
Maybe.
But it's a mistake I have to make.
Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence.
You and Robin have tried this again and again...
Here's the thing about mistakes.
Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake,
you gotta make it anyway.
Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.
Hey, is this milk any good?
Even really really dumb mistakes.

<i>La vie était belle en mai 2006 à New York.</i>
<i>Mais tout était sur le point de changer.</i>
Alors, qu'en pensez-vous ?
Robin, encore ?
Ted, c'est clair que l'univers ne veut pas
que Robin et toi soyez ensemble.
Si tu mets l'univers en colère,
il te frappera.
L'univers n'a-t-il pas
d'autres préoccupations
que ma vie amoureuse ?
Sauf si ta vie amoureuse est la colle
qui tient l'univers ensemble.
Ouah, je frissonne. Vous frissonnez aussi ?
Je sais qu'on est déjà passés par là,
mais peu importe ce que je fais,
ça me ramène toujours à Robin.
Je dois le faire.
- C'était quoi ça ?
- Ce n'était pas moi.
C'était l'univers.
<i>Le plus drôle, c'est qu'au même moment,
l'univers avait un plan.</i>
<i>Une tempête.</i>
La tempête tropicale Willie sera
des nôtres au moins jusqu'à lundi.
Il pleuvra à boire debout.
Alors, gare à la boue !
- Sandy, Robin ?
- Merci, Lou.
Oh, que c'est dommage.
<i>L'excursion de camping de Metro News 1
était en fin de semaine.</i>
Mais le camping sous la pluie ?
Pas amusant. Salissant. Beurk.
On devra remettre ça.
Nous serons là demain pour vous,
New York.
Bonne nuit.
Hors des ondes.
Dommage. J'espérais enfin coucher avec
toi, cette fin de semaine, Scherbatsky.
Je te servirais bien un:
"Je ne sors pas avec des collègues",
mais tu le connais sûrement
déjà par coeur.
Dommage. L'émission de ce soir était
très sexy.
Le rythme de notre badinage
à la fin du bulletin
a fait monter mes pulsions.
Vieux, il a raison.
Combien de fois revivras-tu cet enfer
- avant d'en avoir assez ?
- Encore une fois.
Un énorme et merveilleux geste
stupide et romantique,
et peu importe qu'elle dise oui ou non,
ce sera tout.
Si c'est oui, super.
Si c'est non,
je la laisserai tranquille à jamais.
Quel est donc ce geste énorme,
merveilleux et romantique ?
Je vais lui faire
une compilation sur un CD.
Non, je blague. J'ai un plan.
Il me faut la clé de l'appartement de Robin.
Je vois où tu veux en venir.
Ted, attendre nu dans le lit d'une fille
avec de la crème fouettée comme
sous-vêtements, ça ne marche pas.
Habituellement. Le décor:
Martha's Vineyard en 1999.
Les personnages: Moi-même
et une fille au pair aux cheveux de jais...
L'univers.
Alors, ce plan dont tu parlais.
Vous vous souvenez
de notre première sortie ?
<i>J'ai volé un cor français bleu
pour elle, et ça avait presque marché.</i>
Oui, vieux, c'était génial.
Comment vas-tu faire mieux que ça ?
Elle devrait arriver d'un moment à l'autre.
On a faim.
Quand aurons-nous notre pizza ?
Assez avec la...
On ira chercher de la pizza plus tard,
ça va ?
Merde.
- Allô ?
- Salut, Lily.
J'ai laissé ma clé à l'intérieur.
Je vais passer chercher mon double.
Ton double ?
Ai-je le double de ta clé d'appartement ?
Oui, je te l'ai donné.
Oh, oui. Ce double-là. Je l'ai perdu.
Super. Je dois aller chez le serrurier.
Non. Attends.
Tu devrais peut-être simplement frapper.
Frapper ?
Mes chiens ne sont pas si bien dressés.
<i>Allô, Lily. Ici Janet Kagen,</i>
<i>de la Fondation de la maison
des arts Russell, San Francisco.</i>
<i>Je vous annonce
que nous acceptons votre candidature</i>
<i>pour notre programme d'été.</i>
<i>Nous sommes impatients de vous parler.
Au revoir.</i>
Robin, je dois te laisser. Frappe, d'accord ?
Un programme d'été ?
Frapper. D'accord.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Robin. J'ai déjà dit cela.
Je l'ai dit à moitié.
J'ai essayé de le dire, mais tout de travers.
Alors voici, je le dis.
Avec un quatuor à cordes.
Je suis fou de toi.
Je pense qu'on devrait être ensemble.
Qu'en dis-tu ?
- Qu'en dis-tu ?
- Oui. Non. Je ne sais pas.
Ce sont les trois options.
- Ted, c'est tellement...
- Je sais.
<i>J'arrive à la maison,
j'allais regarder Jeopardy,</i>
et il y a un quatuor à cordes,
et j'ai envie de faire pipi.
Oh, désolé.
- Eh bien, vas-y, on va attendre.
- Super.
Quand on a parlé plus tôt,
vous avez dit qu'on aurait de la pizza.
Non, j'ai dit qu'on irait en chercher après.
Pourrions-nous parler de ça plus tard ?
- J'essaie de déclarer mon amour.
- Bien sûr.
On n'aura pas de pizza.
C'est bon. Discutons.
Bien.
Voulez-vous faire une pause ? D'accord.
Merci, on n'a besoin que d'une minute.
C'est une grosse décision.
J'aime les instruments bleus, cependant.
C'est une sorte de clin d'oeil.
Merci.
- Tu es fou.
- Vrai. Allez.
Ce n'est pas que je n'y ai pas pensé.
Tu sais bien que oui.
Mais regardons ça calmement.
On vient tout juste de redevenir des amis.
Je sais. Mais allez.
Et on ne veut pas les mêmes choses.
C'est toujours là. Ça ne partira pas.
Et si on commence
et que ça ne marche pas,
et que je te perdais comme ami ?
Je dois y réfléchir.
D'accord. Réfléchis-y dans l'avion.
Passons la fin de semaine à Paris.
Sérieusement.
- Je blague. Je suis sérieux.
- Je ne vais pas à Paris. Je vais camper.
- Je pensais que c'était annulé.
- Ça ne l'est plus.
- Depuis quand ?
- Il y a environ une heure.
Il y a environ une heure
Repoussant la tempête dans l'Atlantique.
Le ciel sera bleu cette fin de semaine.
- Sandy, Robin ?
- Merci, Lou.
Un nuage traversera quand même
ce ciel bleu.
Je dois vous annoncer
que dans une semaine,
<i>je quitterai Metro News 1.</i>
Ce fut un honneur de vous livrer
les informations,
et de vous lire le journal chaque matin.
J'en garde un bon souvenir.
Bonsoir, New York.
Diffusion terminée.
- Tu pars ?
- Et voilà. Je démissionne.
Nous ne sommes plus des collègues.
Veux-tu souper avec moi ?
Je blague. On m'a offert un poste à CNN.
- Oh, félicitations.
- Félicitations toi-même.
- Que veux-tu dire ?
- Eh bien, Joe m'a demandé
qui devrait me remplacer
comme chef d'antenne.
J'ai suggéré ton nom.
Ils l'annonceront la semaine prochaine.
Aie l'air surprise.
Ouah. Merci.
Et, oui.
- Oui, quoi ?
- Oui, allons souper.
Cette fin de semaine
pendant l'excursion de camping ?
Je fais de bonnes saucisses.
Tu veux rire. Pas question. N'y va pas.
Ted, je dois y aller.
C'est une sortie de bureau.
Vraiment ? Ça ressemble
à un rendez-vous avec Sandy
et sa saucisse.
- N'est-ce pas un rendez-vous ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Tu l'aimes bien, à présent ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Vas-tu coucher avec lui ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Oui, tu le sais.
- Non, Ted, je l'ignore.
Et tu sais quoi ? C'est correct.
Je ne planifie pas chaque seconde
de ma vie, comme toi.
- Je ne planifie...
- Oh, vraiment ?
C'est quoi tout ça ?
Pourquoi tu ne peux pas juste dire:
"Robin, ça te dirait des sushis ?"
Non, il faut un quatuor à cordes, Paris,
des fleurs, du chocolat,
et "Passons le reste
de notre vie ensemble".
N'a-t-on pas dépassé le stade des sushis ?
Tu as si peur de ce qui est vrai.
On dirait que tu flottes dans l'espace.
Atterris, Robin.
Vis sur terre, fais des erreurs.
Fais cette erreur.
Je dois y réfléchir.
Bien.
Non, désolé,
je ne peux plus faire ça.
Il me faut une réponse.
Si tu veux que je dise oui, tout de suite,
je ne peux pas.
Eh bien, si ce n'est pas oui, c'est non.
Alors, ça n'est pas censé arriver.
- Bien essayé, l'ami.
- Bel effort.
Vois le bon côté.
Au moins tu sais à quoi t'en tenir.
Elle a fait son choix, oublie-la.
Pas question. Ce n'est pas fini.
Tu étais assis juste ici, et tu as dit...
Je me moque de ce que j'ai dit.
Ça va arriver.
C'est faux que ce n'est pas censé arriver.
Vous savez pourquoi ?
Car je veux que ça arrive.
- Pause terminée ?
- Terminée.
<i>Faisons une pause.</i>
<i>Marshall et Lily avaient une règle:
Lors d'une dispute,</i>
<i>ils pouvaient faire une pause.
Leurs disputes pouvaient durer des jours.</i>
- Un cours d'été de peinture ?
- Je l'aurais refusé.
- En Californie ?
- Je l'aurais refusé.
Ted, elle s'en va en camping.
À moins d'un acte de Dieu,
Robin passera la fin de semaine
avec Sandy.
Bien.
S'il faut un acte de Dieu, il y en aura un.
De quoi tu parles ?
Je vais faire pleuvoir.
Je ne peux pas laisser Robin
camper avec lui.
Comment empêcher ça ?
C'est simple. Je vais faire pleuvoir.
Ted, veux-tu que je te frappe encore ?
J'ai bien aimé ça la première fois.
Je suis peut-être fou en ce moment. Non !
Je suis fou en ce moment.
Mais j'ai un plan.
Cette fille que tu voyais, Pénélope.
Ne faisait-elle pas son doctorat
en culture autochtone ?
- Oui.
- Avez-vous gardé contact ?
Bien sûr.
Même si on ne couche plus ensemble,
on se rencontre une fois par mois
pour bavarder,
bien sûr qu'on n'a pas gardé contact !
Il va falloir que tu l'appelles.
Elle va m'apprendre la danse de la pluie.
- As-tu dis la danse de la pluie ?
- Oui.
- Une danse de la pluie ?
- Oui.
- Une danse pour faire pleuvoir.
- Oui.
- On ne fera pas ça !
- Oui, on le fait.
Ted, tu me forces à être
la voix de la raison.
Et ce n'est pas un bon rôle pour moi !
- Pourquoi t'aiderais-je ?
- Allez.
Je sais que ça n'a pas marché toi et moi,
mais on avait une relation.
On a couché ensemble deux fois
dans ta voiture, et tu m'as larguée.
Tu appelles ça une relation ?
Deux fois ?
Barney, il n'est pas question que je...
Sérieusement, voyons.
Pénélope, il faut que je fasse pleuvoir
cette fin de semaine.
Pourquoi ?
C'est à cause d'une fille...
"C'est à cause d'une fille" ?
La danse de la pluie traditionnelle est
une prière sacrée adressée à la nature.
Je ne pense pas que le Grand Esprit
soit très aimable
envers les Blancs en manque de sexe.
Pénélope, c'est la fille que j'aime.
S'il ne pleut pas cette fin de semaine,
elle finira avec le mauvais gars.
S'il te plaît.
- Ce mauvais gars, c'est une ordure ?
- Absolument.
- Un peu comme Barney ?
- Un peu.
- Hé.
- Tu t'essayais avec ma mère.
On n'était pas exclusifs.
C'est d'accord.
<i>On est partis tous les trois
sur le toit de mon immeuble.</i>
D'accord.
Penche-toi en te pliant un peu.
Ça t'a pris cinq tequilas
pour te placer comme ça.
Je vais te jeter en bas du toit.
Je reconnais ta mère en toi.
Et elle vomit depuis ce temps-là.
Comment a-t-elle mangé
autant de chocolat ?
Tu te souviens de ce gars
dont je te parlais, Ted ?
Je suis rentrée chez moi et il m'attendait
avec un quatuor à cordes, des roses,
du chocolat...
Oh, que c'est gentil.
C'est gentil en théorie.
Mais n'est-ce pas un peu fou ?
Un quatuor à cordes dans mon salon.
- Qui fait ça ?
- Personne ne fait ça.
- Exactement.
- Non, ma belle. Personne ne fait ça.
Je suis sans doute
une romantique désespérée.
Je vais maintenant lui faire
un toucher rectal.
Tu dis que tu me défendrais d'y aller.
Défendre ? Qui a dit défendre ?
Je te rappelais juste qu'il y a un mariage
prévu dans quelques mois,
et j'espérais que tu y sois.
Essaie de me trouver.
Je serai le type en smoking.
Voyons, Lily,
c'est ce que tu as toujours voulu.
Il y a plein de choses
que j'ai toujours voulues
et je n'en ai fait aucune.
Je suis désolée. Je dois le faire
avant de m'ancrer pour toujours.
On est passés
de "je ne l'aurais jamais fait"
à "je dois le faire".
Ai-je quitté la pièce ? Quand est-ce arrivé ?
Quand tu m'as dit que tu t'y opposais.
Je n'ai jamais dit ça !
Si tu as des doutes maintenant,
ce sera comment dans 3 mois ?
À quoi bon se marier ?
Tu as raison: À quoi bon ?
- Pause.
- Pause.
- Tu n'es pas mort de faim, toi ?
- Complètement.
Red Lobster ?
Oh, homard, homard, homard,
tu es délicieux.
J'adore la sauce au beurre.
Y a rien de mal à en dire.
Trouve du mal à dire
de la sauce au beurre.
Je n'oserais pas.
Marshall, non.
On est sur pause.
Il n'y a pas de larmes en mode pause.
Mode pause est un endroit magique
avec des monts de crevettes pop-corn
et des rivières de beurre.
Merde !
Ted, c'est amusant.
C'est encore amusant.
Encore... Maintenant, c'est pathétique.
Hé, Pénélope,
tu es sûre que je la fais correctement ?
Je pense bien.
Ça ressemble à la danse de la pluie ?
Je pense bien.
Hé, Pénélope, as-tu déjà vu quelqu'un
faire la danse de la pluie ?
Non.
- Non ?
- J'ai beaucoup lu sur le sujet.
Des rapports directs,
des critiques théoriques...
As-tu déjà vu une danse de la pluie ?
J'ai vu un bout de film.
Fantastique. J'y vais.
<i>Un gars qui a vu un ou deux épisodes
d'E.R. veut m'opérer.</i>
Je ne peux pas croire ça.
On est ici depuis une heure
à jouer les idiots.
Qu'entends-tu par "on", homme blanc ?
Comment sommes-nous arrivés là ?
Il y a quelques jours,
mon plus gros problème était
de savoir si Ted avait mangé le dernier
pouding dans le frigo.
- Il en reste un, je crois.
- Je le prends.
- Pause terminée ?
- Terminée.
Écoute, je sais que c'est moche.
Ce n'est qu'une passe.
Je ne te demande pas de comprendre,
ni d'être content.
Je te demande de m'appuyer.
Écoute, je le veux, Lily, d'accord ?
Vraiment. Mais je ne peux pas.
- Pourquoi pas ?
- Parce que tu me fais peur.
Voilà pourquoi.
Et si tu décidais de devenir peintre
et t'apercevais que je ne t'intéresse plus,
et que ces trois mois durent toujours ?
Peux-tu me promettre
que ça n'arrivera pas ?
- Marshall...
- Si tu ne peux pas,
on devrait en finir là.
Je n'attendrai pas trois mois
pour finir avec le coeur brisé.
Marshall, je t'aime.
Promets-moi que ça n'arrivera pas.
- Pause.
- Non, Lily, plus de pause.
Promets-moi que ça n'arrivera pas.
- Pause !
- Pourquoi faire une pause ?
Bonne utilisation du mode pause, bébé.
Merci.
Hé, Ted, que fais-tu ?
La danse de la pluie.
N'importe quoi, c'est un petit gros
avec une abeille dans le pantalon.
Je doute fort que le Grand Esprit
tienne vraiment à la chorégraphie.
C'est la pensée qui compte.
Elle part dans une demi-heure.
Ce sont tes plus belles années,
tu les gâches pour cette fille.
- Ça ne marchera pas.
- Oui. Je sais.
- Pourquoi le fais-tu alors ?
- Parce que je l'aime.
Je l'aime !
Je lui ai dit la 1ère fois qu'on est sortis,
et huit mois plus tard, rien n'a changé.
Alors, je sais que ça ne marchera pas.
Mais il faut que ça marche !
M'entends-tu, Univers ?
Ici Ted Mosby !
Donne-moi un peu de pluie !
Allez !
Allez !
Allez !
Oh, voyons !
Poussant le front sur les trois États,
<i>donnant ainsi à Manhattan
une des pires tempêtes</i>
<i>depuis plus de dix ans.</i>
Que dis-tu de ça ? Il a réussi.
Robin. Hé ! Robin.
Dieu merci, tu es là.
Mon excursion de camping est à l'eau.
Je sais. Je suis désolé.
- Ce n'est pas ta faute.
- Oui, ce l'est.
Descends.
Il pleut à boire debout. Monte.
Non, il faut que tu descendes.
- Pourquoi ?
- Pourquoi ?
Parce que j'ai fait pleuvoir.
C'est ce que j'ai fait aujourd'hui.
Et c'est assez. J'ai fait ma part.
Maintenant, descends !
Je ne suis pas habillée, Ted. Monte.
Je ne monte pas, Robin.
Il faut que tu descendes.
- J'allais...
- Je sais.
<i>Et c'est ainsi que Robin et moi
avons fini ensemble.</i>
<i>Je n'avais qu'à faire pleuvoir.</i>
<i>Au matin, en rentrant, la ville
semblait inchangée,</i>
<i>les gens, tout semblait pareil.</i>
<i>En apparence seulement.</i>
<i>En une seule nuit, tout avait changé.</i>
It was May of 2006 in New York City
and life was good.
But everything was about to change.
So... what do you think?
Robin again?
Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together.
Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.
But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?
Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills.
Anybody else get chills?
Look, I realize we've been down this road before,
but the fact is, whatever I do,
it all keeps coming back to Robin, so...
I gotta do this.
Ow! What the hell?
That wasn't me. That was the universe.
The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something--
a storm.
And so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us at least until Monday.
It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks.
So don't step in a poodle.
Sandy? Robin?
Thanks, Lou.
Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.
Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.
Guess we'll have to take a rain check.
And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York.
Have a great night.
And, we're clear.
Bummer. I was hoping to finally have sex with you this weekend, Scherbotsky.
Well, I'd give you the "I don't date coworkers" speech again,
but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.
Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight.
The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end
really got my freak juice flowing.
Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash
and burn before you say, "enough"?
One more. One more time.
One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture.
And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it.
If it's yes, great.
If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.
So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?
I am going to make her...
a mix CD.
No, I'm kidding. I got a plan.
Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.
I see where this is going.
Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work...
usually.
The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999.
The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name...
Universe.
So, this plan you speak of?
Remember the first night Robin and I went out?
I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.
Yeah. Dude, that was awesome,
but how are you ever going to top that?
She should be here any second.
Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza?
Enough with the-- we'll go get pizza later, all right?
Just...
Damn it.
Hello.
Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.
Extra key?
Do I have an extra key to your apartment?
Yes, I gave it to you.
Oh, right. That key.
Yeah, I lost it.
Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.
No, wait, uh...
Maybe you should just knock.
Knock?
Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained.
Hello, Lily, this is Janet Kagan at the Russell House Art Foundation here in San Francisco.
I'm pleased to inform you that we've accepted your application for our summer fellowship.
We look forward to hearing from you. Bye-bye.
Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?
Summer fellowship?
Just knock.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Robin...
I've sort of said this already.
I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly.
So this is me, just saying it.
With strings.
I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together.
What do you say?
- What do you say?
- Yes.
No.
I don't know.
Those are the three options.
- Ted, this is so...
- I know.
I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and...
I have to pee.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.
Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza.
No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards.
Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.
Sure.
We're not getting any pizza.
Okay. Let's talk.
Okay.
Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?
Thanks, guys. Just need a minute.
Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though.
Kind of an inside joke.
Thanks.
- You're crazy.
- Right. Come on.
It's not that I haven't thought about this.
You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay?
We only just started being friends again.
I know. But-- come on.
And we want different things.
That's still there. That's not going away.
I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out
and I'd lose you as a friend?
I gotta think about this.
Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane.
Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious.
I'm kidding. I'm serious.
I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.
I thought that thing was canceled.
Well, it's back on.
Since when?
Since like an hour ago.
..sending the storm back out into the Atlantic.
So it's blue skies this weekend.
Sandy? Robin?
Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud.
I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One.
It has been an honor to bring you the news each night,
and read the paper to you each morning.
I will always treasure it.
Good night, New York.
And we're clear.
You're leaving?
There. I quit my job.
We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me?
I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.
Oh, congratulations.
Congratulations yourself.
What do you mean?
Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor.
I told him you.
They're announcing it next week. Act surprised.
Wow.
Thanks.
And, yes.
Yes, what?
Yes, let's go get dinner.
How about this weekend on the camping trip?
I roast a mean weenie.
Oh, you're kidding me.
No way. Don't go on this thing.
Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.
Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date.
With Sandy... and his weenie.
I mean is this not a date?
I don't-I don't know.
So, what? You actually like this guy now?
I don't know.
Are you gonna hook up with him?
I don't know.
- Yes, you do.
- No, Ted, I don't.
And you know what? That's okay.
I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.
- I don't plan out every...
- Oh, really? What is all of this?
I mean, why can't you just say, "Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?"
No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates
and let's spend the rest of our lives together.
Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point?
God, you are so terrified of anything real.
It's like you're floating out in space.
Touch the ground, Robin.
Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.
I need to think about this.
Fine.
No, I'm sorry, I...
I can't do this anymore.
I need an answer.
If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.
Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.
Then I guess it's not meant to be.
Nice try, buddy.
Good hustle out there.
Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure.
She's made her choice and you can finally move on.
Screw that. This ain't over.
Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...
I don't care what I said.
This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be.
It is meant to be, and you know why?
'Cause I mean it to be.
- Unpause?
- Unpause.
Let's pause.
See, Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight
they could pause and take a break.
Their fights often lasted for days.
- A painting fellowship?
- I was never going to take it.
- In California?
- I was never going to take it.
Ted, she is going on that camping trip.
Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.
Fine.
If an act of God is what it takes,
then an act of God it is.
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna make it rain.
I can't let Robin go camping with this guy.
So how do I keep that from happening?
Simple-- I make it rain!
Ted, do you want me to slap you again?
'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.
Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what?
I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan.
That girl you used to go out with, Penelope,
wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?
Yeah.
Are you still in touch with her?
Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having sex,
we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up,
and of course I'm not in touch with her!
Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her.
She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.
- Did you just say a "rain dance"?
- Yes.
- A rain dance.
- Yes.
- A dance to make it rain.
- Yes.
- We're finding Penelope!
- No, we are not!
Yes, we are!
Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!
Why the hell should I help you?
Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.
We had sex twice in your car, and then you dumped me.
How is that a relationship?
Twice!
- Barney, there is no way...
- Shh!
Seriously, come on.
Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.
Why?
There's this girl...
"There's this girl."
You know, the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature.
I don't think the Great Spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid.
Penelope, this is the girl I love.
If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy.
Please.
This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass?
Absolutely.
- Kind of like Barney?
- Kind of.
- Hey.
- You hit on my mom!
We weren't exclusive!
I'm in.
And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building.
Okay.
Crouch down and bend over a little bit.
Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.
I will throw you off this roof.
There's so much of your mom in you.
And she's been throwing up ever since.
So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate?
Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about?
Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment
with a string quartet and roses and chocolates...
Oh, that's so sweet.
Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy?
I mean, a string quartet in my living room-- who does that?
Nobody does that.
Exactly.
No, honey-- nobody does that.
But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic.
I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now.
So you're saying you would forbid me from going?
Forbid? Who said forbid?
I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months,
and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day.
Look for me-- I'll be the guy in the awesome suit.
Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted.
Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them.
I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.
So now we've gone from "I was never gonna do it" to "I need to do this"?
Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?
Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.
I never said that!
You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now,
what's gonna change in three months?
Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.
Maybe not.
- Pause.
- Pause.
- So, are you just, like, starving?
- Totally.
Red Lobster?
Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!
Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it.
Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you.
I wouldn't dare.
Marshall, no. We're on pause.
There's no crying in Pauseland!
Pauseland is a magical place, with--
with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers!
Damn it!
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday,
happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday,
happy, happy...
Ted, this is funny.
Still funny.
Still fu... And now it's sad.
Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?
I think so.
Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?
I think so.
Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?
No.
No?
I've read extensively on the subject:
firsthand accounts, theoretical criticism, the anthropological...
Have you ever seen a rain dance?
I've seen a film strip.
Terrific. Uh, look, I should run.
I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R.
I can't believe this.
We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.
What do you mean "we," white man?
How did we get here?
Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was,
did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.
I think there's still one left.
Dibs.
- Unpause?
- Unpause.
Look... I know this sucks.
It's just something I'm going through.
I'm not asking you to understand it.
I'm not asking you to be happy about it.
I'm just asking you to support it.
I want to, Lily, okay?
I really do.
But I just can't.
Why not?
Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not.
What if you decide to go be a painter
and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore,
and three months becomes forever?
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?
Marshall...
'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now.
I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.
Marshall, I love you.
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?
- Pause.
- No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore.
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!
- Pause!
- Why do you want me to pause?!
That's just a great use of the pause function, baby.
Thank you.
Hey, Ted.
Whatcha doing?
A rain dance.
Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.
Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography.
It's the thought that counts.
She's leaving in half an hour.
These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl.
This isn't gonna work!
Yeah. I know that.
- Well, then why are you doing this?
- Because I love her.
I love her!
I told her that the first night we went out,
and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed.
So yes, I know this isn't gonna work.
But it has to work!
You hear me, universe?
This is Ted Mosby talking!
Give me some rain!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on...!
Oh, come on!
Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area
and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade.
How about that? He did it.
Robin! Hey, Robin!
Oh, thank God you're here!
My camping trip got rained out.
I know. I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.
- Yeah, it is.
Come down here.
It's pouring. You come up.
No, you have to come down here.
- Why?
- Why?
Because I made it rain, that's what I did today!
And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!
I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up.
I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not.
You have to come down here!
- I was gonna...
- I know.
And that's how Robin and I ended up together.
Turns out, all I had to do was make it rain.
As I rode home the next morning, the city looked the same,
the people looked the same. It all looked the same.
But it wasn't.
In just one night, everything had changed.

Okay, oł en étions-nous ?
On était en Juin 2006,
et la vie venait de prendre
un tour inattendu.
Papa, ne peux-tu pas juste avancer
jusqu'ą la partie oł tu as rencontré maman ?
J'ai l'impression que ēa fait
genre un an que tu parles.
Chérie, tous ces évčnements
dont je te parle sont importants.
Ils font tous partie de l'histoire.
- Je pourrais aller aux toilettes ?
- Non.
L'été 2006 fut ą la fois
merveilleux et terrible.
Pour moi, il commenēait super bien.
En fait, le premier jour fut incroyable.
J'étais enfin arrivé
ą ce qu'on soit ensemble avec Robin.
Mais tandis que j'avais passé
l'une des meilleures nuits de ma vie,
votre oncle Marshall avait passé
l'une des pires nuits de la sienne.
- # Crying in the street... #
- Alors c'est tout ?
On rompt ?
Marshall, je suis désolée. Je...
J'ai juste besoin d'aller ą San Francisco
et de faire ce programme artistique et...
et de découvrir qui je suis
en dehors de nous.
Et le seul moyen pour
que je puisse faire ēa, c'est...
que nous ne nous parlions pas
pendant un moment.
Pendant un moment.
Disons plutōt "jamais", okay ?
Tu passes cette porte,
et c'est fini.
Tu n'entendras plus jamais
le son de ma voix.
Je devrais l'appeler.
- Non, Non.
- Ted c'est...
Si tu l'appelles alors
qu'elle t'a demandé de ne pas le faire,
tu auras juste l'air faible
et tu vas le regretter.
Maintenant, écoute, chaque fois que tu auras
envie de l'appeler, viens me voir d'abord.
Et je te mettrai un coup de poing
dans la figure.
Tu es un bon ami, Ted.
Hey.
Alors, tu as appris la grande nouvelle ?
Tu veux dire comment Lily
et Marshall ont rompu,
et Lily est partie et rien d'autre
d'aussi important n'est arrivé hier soir,
ouais, je pense qu'il sait.
Oh, mon dieu.
Je... je suis vraiment désolée. Que...
Que s'est-il passé ?
Bah, elle est partie.
Et je ne sais mźme pas
si elle va revenir.
Je n'ai eu ton message
qu'en me réveillant.
- Mon pote, je suis vraiment désolé.
- Merci.
Je sais que ēa doit źtre dur,
mais es-tu prźt ą entendre quelque chose
qui non seulement t'aidera ą aller mieux,
mais te rendra exubérant ?
Bien sūr.
Pour la premičre fois
de tous les temps,
nous sommes tous les trois
célibataires en mźme temps.
J'ai rźvé de ce jour, les mecs,
et ēa va źtre légendaire.
Ensemble, on va posséder cette ville.
Lorsqu'une fille voudra retourner
vers ses ex-copains,
on sera lą.
Lorsqu'une fille voudra résoudre
ses problčmes avec son pčre
par la promiscuité et sombrera
dans la boisson, on sera lą.
Lorsque les participantes
ą un enterrement de vie de jeune fille
traverseront la ville dans une limo,
passant leurs tźtes au-dessus
du toit ouvrant en criant :
"Quoi de neuf, New York ?"
on sera ce qui est "up" ą New York.
Messieurs, nous sommes
sur le point d'embarquer sur...
Ah, la vache, vous l'avez fait,
n'est-ce pas ?

J'ai appris une chose cet été-lą,
c'est que quand l'amour commence...
...et quand l'amour se termine,
les 30 premiers jours
sont remarquablement similaires.
Pour commencer, vous passez
la majeure partie de votre temps au lit.
Vos amis ne supportent pas
de vous écouter.
C'était vraiment une belle chanson.
Tellement... stupide, mec.
Et vous semblez
ne jamais porter de pantalon.
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey, Ted.
Tu as faim ?
Qu'est-ce que ēa peut faire ?
Je pourrais absorber de la nourriture.
Elle va ressortir.
Bah, au moins dans ce scénario,
c'est toi qui fais la vidange.
Allez, c'est dimanche.
C'est le jour des pancakes.
Lily faisait toujours les pancakes.
Mon dieu, j'adorais ses pancakes.
Si moelleux.
Si chauds.
Si parfaitement découpés.
On parle encore de ses pancakes ?
Allez, tu dois manger quelque chose ;
qu'est-ce que je peux te préparer ?
- De la bičre.
- Non, c'est ce que tu as eu pour le dīner.
Trčs bien.
Alors je me contenterai des restes.
Alors il reste ą la maison tout le temps
sans s'envoyer en l'air ?
Non, tu vois, c'est ce que tu fais
quand tu as une fiancée.
Il devrait descendre ici faire la fźte.
Il est libre.
Sa tumeur rousse lui a été enlevée.
Tu devrais écrire et illustrer
des livres pour enfants.
Vous savez ce que Marshall
a besoin de faire.
Il a besoin d'arrźter d'źtre triste.
Quand je suis triste, j'arrźte d'źtre triste
et je deviens formidable ą la place.
Véridique.
Ēa ne fait qu'un mois.
Il a juste besoin d'aller ą son rythme.
Quoi qu'il en soit, c'est Lily
qui a provoqué tout ce bazar.
Hey, sois indulgent avec elle.
C'est notre amie aussi.
Elle essaye juste de découvrir qui elle est.
Découvrir qui elle est ?
Ouais, elle devrait m'appeler.
J'ai toute une liste.
Elle est égoļste.
Elle est immature. Elle est...
Quoi ?
Mon dieu, tes yeux sont si bleus.
Aw, Teddy Bear.
Oh, c'est un...
Ouais, c'était dur de se sentir trop mal.
Je sortais avec la femme de mes rźves,
et les choses étaient géniales.
Enfin, pour la plupart.
J'ai trouvé son shampooing.
J'imagine qu'elle l'a laissé lą.
Il sent comme elle.
Comme la lavande
et les coquillages et l'espoir.
Quelque part érotique et réconfortant
en mźme temps.
C'est mon shampooing.
Oh, désolé.
Mmm, j'ai cru
qu'il n'irait jamais se coucher.
- Uh-oh.
- Déją ?
Il l'appelle.
- Je n'entends...
- Il l'appelle.
Non.
Okay, tu as raison.
Je ne l'appellerai pas.
Je ne l'appellerai pas.
Eh bien, je l'ai appelée.
Et devine quoi,
elle a changé de numéro.
Quoi, comme si j'allais la harceler
ou quelque chose comme ēa ?
Comme si elle était si spéciale.
Comme si elle était la seule
Lily Aldrin lą dehors.
Parce qu'il y en a quatre autres
rien que dans la région de San Francisco,
et elles ont toutes l'air
bien mieux qu'elle
si je me fie aux brčves conversations
que j'ai eues avec elles.
- Il sait que je suis lą-dedans ?
- Ouais, hey, Robin.
Quoi qu'il en soit,
l'une des Lily Aldrin a dit...
Ēa doit cesser.
Ted, on commence juste ą sortir ensemble.
On était d'accord
pour ne pas aller trop vite,
mais nous avons un bébé
en quelque sorte.
Il ne peut pas se nourrir tout seul.
Il pleure beaucoup,
il nous garde éveillés toute la nuit.
Tu as essayé de lui donner le sein ?
Perce-le !
Ecoute, ils étaient ensemble depuis 9 ans.
Ēa ne fait qu'un mois et demi.
Il a juste besoin d'aller ą son rythme.
Il a dormi sur notre plancher
la nuit derničre, Ted.
- Il a regardé un film d'horreur.
- C'est le moment pour l'amour vache.
On doit le faire sortir de cet appartement.
Il a besoin d'air frais.
Il a besoin de soleil.
Mmm, soleil.
Messieurs, veuillez accueillir
sur scčne, Soleil.
D'accord, je pense vraiment
que ēa ne va pas aider.
Tu sais pourquoi
tu n'as pas encore dépassé Lily ?
C'est parce que tu peux encore
te la figurer nue.
Tu ne peux pas dépasser une femme
avant de ne plus imaginer ses seins,
c'est un fait scientifique.
Le cerveau masculin moyen
ne peut emmagasiner
qu'un nombre limité
d'images de seins ou "S-peg".
Et tout l'espace de ton disque dur
est rempli de ceux de Lily.
Il y en a beaucoup.
Eh bien ils ne partiront pas
avant que tu les écrases
avec des images de seins
d'autres femmes.
Maintenant, ce voyage peut durer
autant qu'un million de seins,
alors on commence ici ce soir,
mon ami.
Deux ą la fois.
Ceux-ci comptent pour quatre.
Ouais.
C'est marrant hein ?
On est dehors, c'est une superbe journée.
Les Indians gagnent.
Je dois l'admettre,
c'est vraiment sympa d'źtre dehors.
Que les fans des Yankee dirigent leur attention
vers le Diamond Vision pour un spécial
- septičme tour de batte surprise.
- Oh, non.
Ce n'est qu'un gros mensonge !
Elle va te briser le cur.
Vous pouvez me traīner dehors
mais elle n'a pas d'āme !
On a tout essayé...
baseball, striptease.
Le mec ne veut toujours pas manger
de satané pancake.
Je pense qu'il est incurable.
Tu vois, c'est le problčme avec les mecs.
Vous ne savez pas gérer la douleur.
Oh, et quelle est ta prescription,
Dr. Oestrogčne ?
Manger des Haagen-Dazs
et regarder Love Actually
jusqu'ą la remontée de votre cycle ?
Ouais, c'est ēa le truc.
Oh, mon dieu.
Ēa fait combien de temps que tu fais ēa ?
Bah, mon pčre m'a appris ą tirer
quand j'étais enfant.
Chaque fois que je me sens
seule ou déprimée, je viens ici,
et ēa me rappelle que...
les flingues sont amusants.
Um, tu sais,
Ted est en quelque sorte anti-flingues.
Et c'est pourquoi
Ted ne sera jamais au courant.
Whoa, ēa a l'air effrayant
quand je tiens un pistolet, n'est-ce pas ?
Non, je... je veux juste dire,
s'il te plaīt, ne le dis pas ą Ted.
Tu veux essayer ?
Et comment ! Ouais !
Oh, ouais, ouais,
c'est ce dont j'avais besoin.
Je me suis senti si impuissant
tout ce temps, mais ēa...
c'est le pouvoir.
C'est...
J'aurais dū mentionner le recul.
Je dois te le reconnaītre,
quand il est rentré, Marshall souriait...
Tu as couché avec lui ?
Parce qu'en fait ą trois jours prčs
je l'aurais suggéré.
Parfois, tout ce dont tu as besoin,
c'est de prendre conscience de ton cōté féminin.
- Ouais, ouais !
- Eh bien, félicitations.
Tu es la premičre personne
ą l'avoir rendu heureux de tout l'été.
- Tu gagnes.
- Oh, qu'est-ce que je gagne ?
Je te dirai ce que tu as gagné :
je t'emmčne en week-end.
Vraiment ?
C'est si gentil.
Ouais, ma tante et mon oncle
ont une maison sur la plage ą Montauk,
oh, c'est vraiment romantique.
Mon oncle possčde
genre trois affaires lą-bas.
Wow, ēa doit źtre une belle maison.
J'ai vu des photos de ton oncle.
Ēa sera si génial.
On va enfin passer du temps seuls.
Tu es sūr que
Marshall sera d'accord avec ēa ?
Ouais, absolument.
Mon pote, je vais beaucoup mieux.
En fait, prends ma voiture.
- Vraiment ?
- Ouais.
Hey, merci... et, hey,
si tu as besoin de quelque chose,
de jour comme de nuit, appelle-moi...
Tu sais quoi,
ne m'appelle pas s'il te plaīt.
Quoi ?
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Ce sont les relevés bancaires de Lily.
Elle a dū oublier
de faire le changement d'adresse.
Et alors ?
Alors je me demande quelles dépenses
elle fait ą San Francisco.
Non. Non, ēa ne peut donner rien de bon.
- Tu as déją fait trop de progrčs.
- Je sais, mais peut-źtre que...
Non !
Tu me remercieras pour ēa.
Tu es un bon ami, Ted.
Le 5 aoūt, une dépense :
des billets.
Pour voir quoi ?
George Clinton et les P-Funk All Stars.
Le 10 aoūt, une dépense :
le magasin de Tennis.
Le 18 aoūt, deux dépenses :
le Bistro de Mario
et -écoutez ēa-
le Palace des Animaux.
Vous savez ce que ēa signifie,
n'est-ce pas ?
Wow, le Bistro de Mario.
Quel parfait endroit pour traīner.
Rien que le meilleur
pour ma petite Lily Pad.
Oh, George Clinton,
légende du funk,
je suis tellement contente
que tu m'aies repérée ą ton concert,
et que tu m'aies entraīnée sur scčne
pour faire une danse ą la Courteney Cox.
Et je suis vraiment content que
tu aies accepté de jouer au tennis avec moi.
Tu sais, Marshall a essayé
de me faire jouer au tennis pendant 9 ans,
mais je ne l'ai jamais fait,
parce que je ne l'ai jamais vraiment aimé.
Je t'ai acheté un cadeau.
Un furet !
Oh, je vais lui acheter de la nourriture
au Palace pour Animaux.
Oh, j'en ai toujours voulu un,
mais Marshall avait
cette secrčte phobie des furets.
Je parie que c'est quelque chose qu'il
t'a fait promettre de ne dire ą personne.
C'est vrai.
Oh.
Je t'aime, George Clinton,
légende du funk.
Je t'aime aussi, Lily.
C'est vrai, Marshall,
elle est toute ą moi.
Maintenant, je vais la laisser
jouer avec mes cheveux.
# Ow, we want the funk. #
# Give up the funk... #
C'est le truc le plus dingue
que j'aie jamais entendu.
Ouais, pourquoi as-tu peur des furets ?
Ils sont adorables.
Parce que, Robin, on dirait
des rats duveteux en forme de tube.
En plus, ces dépenses
datent d'il y a un mois.
Exactement.
Pour connaītre ses nouvelles dépenses,
il faut regarder son compte en ligne.
Tu peux voir les dépenses faites
par carte bancaire deux heures plus tōt.
Mais, tu sais, ne fais pas ēa.
Pourquoi est-ce que tu parles ?
Pourquoi est-ce que tu parles ?!
Il lui faut son mot de passe.
C'est pas comme s'il avait son mot de passe.
Ooh, c'est bien,
il a son mot de passe.
Il y a une dépense
faite un peu plus tōt aujourd'hui :
L'hōtel Kellett sur la 5čme.
J'y crois pas.
Lily est de retour ą New York.
J'arrive pas ą y croire.
Lily est ą New York ?
Je suppose que je pensais que quand
elle reviendrait, elle m'appellerait.
C'est vraiment la seule raison qui
m'a permis de tenir le coup tout cet été.
C'est ēa qu'on appelle
"tenir le coup" ?
Okay, vous savez quoi ?
Je vais l'appeler.
- Non.
- Ted, donne-moi le téléphone.
Tu ne l'appelle pas,
ēa ne change rien.
Toi, viens ici.
Ecoute, quand on sera partis ce week-end,
tu pourrais garder un oeil sur lui,
t'assurer
qu'il n'appelle pas cet hōtel ?
Tu veux que
je fasse du baby-sitting ?
20 dollars.
De l'heure.
Et de l'argent pour la pizza.
Ouais, et si tu le faisais
gratuitement
ou a chaque fois qu'on sortira ensemble,
tu devras voir ēa ?
Viens lą.
- Mon petit bébé aux yeux bleus...
- Oh, oh, trésor, trésor...
Okay, je le ferai !
Arrźtez d'źtre un couple.
- Marshall.
- Marshall, Marshall !
Ted, je sais que je ne devrais pas
le faire, mais il le faut !
- On a été ensemble pendant 9 ans !
- Si tu l'appelles, tous tes efforts
partiront dans les toil...
Allō, la chambre de Lily Aldrin,
s'il vous plaīt.
Merci.
- Raccroche
- Ted, je ne peux pas.
- Raccroche maintenant.
- Le missile est lancé,
- et je sais que tu n'approuves pas.
- Raccroche.
Allō.
Un type a répondu.
Il y a un type dans sa chambre.
- J'y vais.
- Tu ne peux pas faire ēa.
Il faut que j'aille lą-bas,
je dois lui dire que je l'aime :
je dois la supplier de me reprendre,
mźme si je dois me mettre ą genoux.
- Marshall, tu ne peux pas faire ēa.
- Oh, vraiment, pourquoi pas ?
56 jours.
C'est le temps qu'il m'a fallu
pour en arriver lą.
Parce que tu es pathétique !
Je suis désolé,
mais lą, tu n'es pas Marshall.
Tu es le misérable fantōme de Marshall,
qui pleurniche et renifle du shampooing,
et franchement, un type comme toi
n'a aucune chance avec une fille comme Lily.
Tu sais qui pourrait avoir une chance ?
Marshall.
Le vrai Marshall.
Mais si tu vas lą-bas dans cet état,
tu vas tout lui foutre en l'air,
et il ne te le pardonnera jamais.
Bien évidemment, quoi que je dise,
tu vas faire le contraire, alors...
passe un bon week-end.
Bonne chance pour foutre ta vie en l'air.
Viens, Robin.
C'est toujours okay
pour qu'on emprunte la voiture ?
Culotté.
C'est culotté de demander la voiture.
Quoi ?
Je n'ai rien dit.
Tu penses que
j'ai été trop dur avec lui.
Je n'ai rien dit.
Je n'arrive pas ą croire que
tu m'accuses d'źtre trop dur avec lui.
C'est toi qui as dit
"amour vache".
Ouais, amour vache,
pas "donne-lui une corde".
Oh, mais c'est pas grave
de lui donner un 9 millimčtres ?
Ouais, il me l'a dit.
Alors t'es une dingue des flingues ?
Non, je suis
une passionnée des flingues.
- Tu sais combien de personnes meurent
- Le deuxičme amendement...
- chaque année dans des accidents...
- me donne le droit de porter une arme...
D'accord, d'accord, d'accord !
J'ai été trop dur avec lui.
Un peu.
Je vais appeler Barney
pour voir comment ils s'en sortent.
Ici Barney.
Oh, hey, oł źtes-vous ?
On est ą une collecte de fonds
pour aider une jeune femme
ą récolter de l'argent
pour l'université.
Un club de strip-tease, sympa.
Marshall va bien ?
Ouais, il est lą
et il va bien. Uh, attends.
Marshall ?
Dis ą Ted que...
Uh-oh.
Déją ?
Quoi ?
Quoi uh-oh ?
Il est parti.
Tu l'as perdu ?
Je n'en reviens pas.
Il va aller ą cet hōtel.
Merde, tu as raison. Okay, okay,
voilą le plan, voilą le plan.
Tu vas ą cet hōtel et tu le trouves.
Je reste ici et je me laisse faire
une danse au corps. A trois. Un, deux...
Barney !
Il y a un jacuzzi chez ton oncle ?
Un vraiment chouette.
Bonsoir, pourriez-vous m'indiquer
la chambre de Lily Aldrin ?
Marshall.
Hey.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Eh bien, je suis monté
ą l'étage de Lily,
et j'avais ce petit discours
dans ma tźte...
tout ce que je voulais lui dire
sur l'amour, la loyauté, le respect.
J'ai frappé ą la porte.
Alors tu as frappé
le nouveau copain de Lily ?
Ouais.
Ce n'était pas le copain de Lily.
Quoi ?
C'était qui ?
Il s'appelait Joey Adalian,
bien qu'il ait eu un tas d'alias
lorsqu'il était voleur d'identité.
Apparemment, au début de l'été...
Oh, c'est tellement embarrassant.
J'aurais pu jurer
que j'avais de la monnaie.
Je sais, je sais.
Je suis désolée.
Oh, et voilą.
Non, c'est un bouton.
C'était un bouton.
- Vous prenez les cartes bancaires ?
- Oui.
Alors Lily n'est pas de retour,
et elle n'a pas de copain ?
Ce sont de bonnes nouvelles,
pas vrai ?
Ouais.
Je ne sais pas.
Ces relevés bancaires étaient
le seul lien que j'avais encore avec elle.
Je ne sais ni oł elle est,
ni ce qu'elle fait.
Elle était toute ma vie,
et maintenant, elle est partie.
Le premier jour de fac,
j'y suis allé,
j'avais tellement peur,
et je suis monté dans ma chambre,
et il y avait mon colocataire,
couché sur le lit
avec ses pieds contre le mur.
Il avait des écouteurs,
un grand sourire comme s'il s'en foutait.
Heureux.
Confiant.
Peur de rien.
Ce type, c'était toi.
Avant que tu rencontres Lily.
Ted ?
Ouais ?
J'étais défoncé ce jour-lą.
Vraiment. Je planais tellement
que je croyais que tu étais le doyen.
Ce que je veux dire, c'est
qu'il y a une version de toi sans Lily,
et elle ne ressemble pas ą ēa.
Tu ne peux pas laisser Lily
te voler ton identité
comme ce type lui a volé la sienne.
Okay.
Okay, résolu.
A partir de demain,
je vais commencer ą me sentir bien.
- Santé.
- Santé.
Mais ēa ne fut pas le cas, parce que
la vie ne fonctionne pas comme ēa.
Le jour suivant,
il trouva l'une de ses chaussettes
et on était revenus
au point de départ.
Et puis, un matin...
Ted, je crois que tu devrais voir ēa.
Oh, non, quoi encore ?
Marshall, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
On est dimanche.
C'est le jour des pancakes.
Ēa lui a pris 67 jours et une fournée
vraiment infecte de pancakes...
C'est tellement bon.
C'est tellement bon.
...mais Marshall
était revenu d'entre les morts.
Car mźme si le baseball, le striptease
et les armes peuvent aider,
la seule chose qui puisse vraiment
soigner un coeur brisé, c'est le temps.
# I try to laugh about it #
# Cover it all up with lies #
# I try to laugh about it #
# Hiding the tears from my eyes #
# 'Cause boys don't cry. #
Marshall et Lily avaient passé
neuf merveilleuses années ensemble,
jusqu'à ce qu'elle le jette
et parte à San Francisco.
Le processus de guérison
prenait un bon moment.
Puis, un soir,
il fit un grand bond en avant.
Bon, je vous vois plus tard,
les mecs.
Je t'accompagne.
A plus.
Tu viens de mater
les fesses de Robin.
Quoi ? Non !
Barney, je...
Mon pote, c'est formidable.
Tu oublies enfin cette petite rousse.
Lily.
Oui, Lily. Merci.
Ça m'aurait rendu fou toute la nuit.
Hey, Ted, Marshall vient de mater
les fesses de ta copine.
- Pas du tout, Ted, je...
- C'est formidable.
Tu vas enfin mieux.
C'est le moment que j'attendais.
A partir de ce soir,
je vais t'apprendre à vivre.
Ted, tu as eu ta chance.
Tu vires, c'est au tour de Marshall.
- Oui!
- Oh, mon dieu.
Marshall, être un mec célibataire
à New York, c'est comme...
Qu'est-ce que c'est
que tout le monde aime ?
Les bonbons.
Oui, c'est comme être
dans un magasin de bonbons.
Tu rentres
et tu empoignes des Maltesers.
Ouais.
C'est les Maltesers les meilleurs ?
Les Bounty.
Les Mars.
Les Dragibus.
Ça a bien duré une heure ;
je vais sauter à la conclusion.
- Billes de chewing gum.
- Excellent !
Marshall. On fait ça.
Je ne prends pas "non"
pour une réponse.
Très bien.
Hey, Robin.
Marshall a maté tes fesses.
Ted, c'est quoi ton problème ?
Il a maté mes fesses.
Hey, remercie-le. J'avais l'impression
qu'elles passaient une sale journée.
Cool, à plus.
Lily.
C'est des fesses géniales.
Aucun de nous
n'avait vu Lily en 3 mois.
Il y avait tant de questions
sans réponses,
tant de choses à dire.
Tes cheveux sont adorables.
Pendant ce temps, Barney emmenait
Marshall rencontrer des femmes
pour la première fois
depuis ses 17 ans.
Salut.
Avez-vous rencontré Marshall ?
- Salut.
- Salut.
Regardez comme mes mains sont moites.
C'est bizarre, hein ?
Heu, moite ?
Comme cette eau malodorante
sort de votre peau.
C'était sympa
de faire votre connaissance.
Je... je déteste interrompre,
mais, heu...
vous aimez la magie ?
Um, j'imagine.
Oh, mon dieu !
Quoi qu'il en soit,
Marshall que voilà est formidable.
La salade en sachet ?
Son idée.
Mon pote !
Tu étais formidable hier soir.
Tu étais charmant, tu étais drôle,
Tu travaillais cette fille au corps.
Tu es rentré avec elle.
Oui, en effet.
Mais elle m'a dit
que si ça n'avait pas été moi,
tu aurais eu une chance avec elle,
alors hypothétiquement,
tu as marqué hier soir.
D'accord !
Tope-là hypothétique.
Excellent.
Bien. Ce soir,
on va aller au bar...
Barney, non,
je ne ressortirai jamais avec toi.
Allez ! Je... je t'apprendrai
toutes mes stratégies.
Oh, vraiment ?
Mon préféré, le numéro sept :
créer un mystère à ton propos.
Comme ça,
ça les intrigue tellement
qu'elles doivent traîner avec toi
toute la nuit.
Oh, allez, ça marche vraiment ?
Peut-être que oui,
et peut-être que non.
La vache, c'est intriguant.
Okay, j'en suis.
- J'ai quelque chose à t'apprendre.
- Tu ne vas pas croire ce qui vient d'arriver.
Toi d'abord.
J'ai trouvé un penny de 1939
dans le métro.
Imagine juste le genre d'histoire
que ce petit truc en cuivre...
Lily est de retour en ville
Et tu me laisses commencer ?
Tu l'as vue ?
Ouais. En fait, je suis allée à la chasse
à l'appartement avec elle aujourd'hui.
Comment va t'elle ?
Tu ne vas pas apprécier.
Je vais super bien.
Cet été,
meilleure chose de tous les temps !
San Francisco
est si phénoménal maintenant.
Elle est heureuse ?!
Marshall a passé le pire été de sa vie,
et elle est heureuse.
Ouais, et je présume que son projet
artistique a répondu à ses attentes.
Oh. Le projet artistique...
meilleure chose de tous les temps.
Oh, mon dieu.
C'est ta meilleure oeuvre.
En toutes mes années d'enseignement,
je n'ai jamais vu quelque chose de si...
Pas besoin de le dire,
ça c'est de l'art.
Je n'ai plus rien à t'apprendre.
Mais la meilleure partie de S.F...
Oh, c'est comme ça
qu'on appelle San Francisco...
les gens.
Même rien qu'en circulant
en bus tout l'été.
C'était comme une tapisserie humaine.
Salut, je suis Mike.
Je suis un moine Boudhiste/écrivain voyageur.
Je suis Paula. Je chante
dans un groupe de punk pour enfants.
Ouais.
Je suis Dan,
je suis neurochirurgien.
Vous êtes époustouflante,
d'ailleurs.
Wow. Je suis si contente pour toi.
Oh, elle est tellement...
Après ce qu'elle a fait à Marshall,
elle devrait revenir ici dévastée,
rampant à quatre pattes sur les débris
de verre de sa honte et de ses remords.
Tu n'as jamais choisi de côté.
Je respecte ça.
Elle est incroyable.
Incroyable.
Incroyable ?
Qu'est-ce qui est incroyable ?
Oh. Ecoute, Marshall.
Ted a trouvé un penny dans le métro
et il est vieux et c'est intéressant.
Félicitations.
Okay, premièrement,
c'est intéressant.
Deuxièmement,
on doit lui dire.
Non, pas du tout. Il commence tout juste
à aller mieux, il sort avec Barney.
Comment crois-tu
qu'il se sentira en apprenant
que Lily est passée
à autre chose ?
- Elle est passée à autre chose ?
- Ça arrive.
J'ai arrêté d'être amoureuse
plus vite que ça avant,
parfois, boum,
sans le moindre avertissement.
Un jour on est amoureux,
le lendemain il est mort pour moi.
Mais nous c'est super.
Chéri.
Maintenant, passons en revue
les règles de Barney
pour s'accoupler sans sortir avec.
Leçon deux, corollaire cinq.
Faire qu'une belle femme
se sente embarrassée et disgracieuse,
et elle sera de la pâte à modeler
entre tes mains.
Excellent.
Tu as choisi ton entrée ?
Tout à fait.
Brune mignonne, 8 heures.
9 heures. 10... 13.
Elle va vers le bar.
- Elle ? Vraiment ?
- Ouais.
Non, tu as raison.
L'ambition est l'ennemie du succès.
Okay. Fonce.
C'est quoi le problème, 4 yeux, vous êtes
astigmate ou quelque chose comme ça ?
Je suis désolé, j'essayais
de vous désarmer avec humour,
mais je sors tout juste
d'une longue relation.
Je n'ai aucune idée
de ce que je fais.
Je m'appelle Marshall.
Salut, Marshall. Amy.
Ne vous en faites pas.
Je suis passée par là.
Attendez.
Bien rattrapé.
Je crois que ça marche.
Um, Amy.
Voici mon ami, Barney.
Barney, voici Amy.
Salut, Barney.
Enchantée de faire votre connaissance.
Salut.
Amy, vous aimez... la magie ?
- Je te déteste.
- Je suis vraiment désolé.
C'est une maladie.
C'est moi la vraie victime, là.
Deux fois.
Deux fois de suite, tu as pris mon bonbon.
C'était mon bonbon.
- Je sais, mais ce soir...
- Non. Oublie ça.
Tu es vraiment un connard.
Je croyais que
tu allais me traiter d'enflure.
D'accord, je suis désolé.
Je te le revaudrai.
Ce soir, on va aller à un bar de fac
près de NY Université...
Le Scorpion et Le Crapaud.
J'imagine que dans un environnement
plus jeune, tu sembleras plus mûr,
plus sophistiqué et, en tant qu'étudiant
en droit de 3ème année, plus intelligent.
Okay, mais pas de magie.
Comment t'as fait ça ?
Je pisse, crétin.
Le lendemain, Robin et moi sommes allés
à la chasse à l'appartement avec tante Lily.
Mais j'ai besoin de liberté
pour poursuivre ma passion,
qui était la peinture, mais
maintenant je pense que c'est la musique
ou les langues... peut-être les deux.
Mon dieu !
La vie n'est-elle pas merveilleuse ?
C'est si génial de te voir, Ted.
Je vais chercher la clé
dans le coffre.
Quoi ?
Elle est malheureuse. Elle a réalisé
qu'elle avait fait une énorme erreur.
Marshall et elle seront à nouveau
ensemble dans une semaine. J'adore ça !
Um, non. Tu veux juste
que Lily soit malheureuse.
La vérité
c'est qu'elle est heureuse.
Crois-moi.
Je connais Lily depuis 9 ans.
Crois-moi. Je suis une fille.
Ouais, mais tu es Canadienne.
- Pourquoi dois-tu toujours mettre ça sur le tapis ?
- Tu es notre étrange voisine du nord.
- Tu mets toujours ça sur le tapis.
- 5 dollars qu'elle veut encore de Marshall.
Ça marche.
5 dollars américains.
Merde.
Okay, alors comment va t'on
lui faire dire la vérité ?
La Tequila.
C'est son point faible.
Trois verres, elle te dira
la vérité sur n'importe quoi.
J'espère que c'est
mon nouveau chez moi.
Ouais, je vais prendre
le premier appartement.
Marshall Eriksen, costume !
Pas moyen.
Ouais, t'es bien comme ça.
- Allons-y.
- Attends.
Vide tes poches.
Allez.
- Allez, on va...
- Manches.
- Il n'y a rien dans ma...
- Oh, c'est vrai ?
Allons-y.
- Derrière mon oreille.
- Il n'y a rien derrière ton...
Ouais, je suis en prépa de droit.
La charge de travail me tue, par contre.
Oh, ne m'en parle pas. Je suis en
3ème année de droit à Columbia, alors...
si la charge de travail te tue, je peux
probablement obtenir une condamnation.
Ouais.
Tu dois faire chimie
en matière principale,
parce que ce que je perçois
entre nous, c'est heu...
Phase de lesbianisme universitaire.
Ecoute, je dois y aller,
mais ça serait génial de te revoir.
Oui, tout à fait.
Vraiment.
Eh bien, peut-être que
je te reverrai ici un de ces jours.
Probablement pas.
Je ne viens jamais ici, alors...
Tu sais,
j'ai un numéro de téléphone.
Génial.
Super.
- Salut, moi c'est Barney.
- Oh, non.
Voulez-vous... donner
votre numéro de téléphone à mon ami ?
Bien sûr.
Whoo !
J'ai réussi !
J'ai le numéro de téléphone d'une fille.
Oh, et son écriture
est si belle, regarde.
Oh, je vais l'emmener
manger chinois
et puis peut-être
qu'on se promènera dans le parc.
Ça sera si... quoi ?
Désolé, mon pote,
je prends celui-ci aussi.
Je vais te tuer !
Et ensuite, j'ai découvert
cet endroit, North Beach.
La plus belle plage du monde !
Oh, je n'ai fait que
parler de mon été.
Comment allez-vous ?
Et hey, comment va Marshall ?
- Donne-moi la carte !
- Je ne te donne aucune carte.
- Je jure... !
- Tu ne vas pas... !
Super.
C'est si bon à entendre.
Oh, attendez.
Ça pourrait être
pour l'appartement.
Okay, on a dépassé le stade
où on fait dire la vérité à Lily
et on est sur le point d'atteindre
celui du 5 Mai 1998,
et je ne compte plus
tout nettoyer
Alors félicitations, tu gagnes.
Elle est heureuse.
Je ne l'ai pas eu.
Ce premier appartement, j'ai...
j'ai attendu trop longtemps et...
Quelqu'un d'autre l'a eu.
Intéressant.
Wow, Lily, tu...
semble avoir une réaction un peu
excessive pour la perte d'un appartement.
Je me demande si c'est parce que
ça te rappelle autre chose que tu as perdu
parce que
tu n'arrivais pas à t'engager.
Non, Lily, tu pleures
sur les moulures au plafond
et les planchers en bois véritable.
Il n'y a aucune signification plus profonde.
C'est ça, Lily ?
Arrête juste de pleurer et dis-lui.
L'appartement
est une métaphore pour Marshall.
- Arrête!
- Tu ne veux pas voir...
- ..comment je suis quand je suis en colère.
- C'est ma carte !
Arrête ! Attends !
Si on ne peut pas régler ça
en gentlemen,
personne n'aura le numéro.
- Non ! Arrêtez le taxi.
- Qu... ?
Non, attends. Allez.
Marshall !
81ème et 1ère, s'il vous plaît.
Ah, elle a une belle écriture.
Le truc à propos
de la gueule de bois,
c'est que chacun
a son propre remède spécial.
Bonjour.
Que puis-je vous servir ?
Chut !
Apportez-moi le plus dégoûtant,
le plus gras sandwich que vous ayez.
Et un milkshake.
Pour vous, monsieur ?
De la sauce.
Vous voulez cette sauce
sur quelque chose ?
Etonnez-moi.
Je vous prendrais en sauce si
mon petit ami n'était pas assis juste là.
Je déconne. Je suis bien.
Qu'est-ce qui te rend si gaie ?
Elle est encore bourrée
d'hier soir.
Je ne pense pas.
Whoo !
Ecoute, si tu veux tant
que Marshall revienne,
comment ça se fait que tu n'as même pas
demandé de ses nouvelles en deux jours ?
Je mourais d'envie de demander.
J'essayais juste de la jouer décontract.
Mais en vrai...
Mais c'est bon, je veux dire,
le boulot est génial...
Allez, dis quelque chose à propos
de Marshall. Où est Marshall ?
Comment va Marshall ?
Que fait Marshall en ce moment ?
Taisez-vous et parlez de Marshall.
Taisez-vous et parlez de Marshall.
Taisez-vous et parlez de Marshall.
Marshall, Marshall,
Marshall, Marshall...
Il faut que je demande !
Et hey, comment va Marshall ?
C'était un été vraiment terrible.
Je voulais juste revenir ici
pour le voir.
Mais je pensais
que tu avais passé un super été.
Pas exactement.
Oh, mon dieu.
C'est votre meilleur travail ?
En toutes mes années d'enseignement,
je n'ai jamais rien vu d'aussi inutile.
Quant à dire que c'est... de l'art...
Je ne peux rien vous apprendre.
Et tous ces gens intéressants
que tu as rencontrés dans le bus ?
Ouais, heu...
Salut, je suis Mike.
Je suis un moine boudhiste/
écrivain voyageur.
Je suis Paula. Je chante
dans un groupe punk pour enfants.
Je suis Dan. Je suis neurochirurgien.
Vous êtes époustouflante, d'ailleurs.
Je n'ai jamais établi aucun contact
parce que j'étais trop embarrassée.
J'ai tout fichu en l'air.
Je n'ai pas de travail,
pas d'endroit pour vivre.
J'ai perdu l'amour de ma vie.
Je sais que je n'ai aucun droit
de demander ça, mais...
tu crois que Marshall
me reprendrait ?
En un clin d'oeil.
Si tu l'appelais, ouais,
il te reprendrait à bras ouverts.
Wow. Alors peut-être
que je devrais l'appeler.
Peut-être.
Non ! C'est... Ow !
Attends.
Ecoute,
si tu retournes vers lui,
je ne veux pas entendre
le mot "peut-être".
"Peut-être" ne peut pas
faire partie de ton vocabulaire.
Cette rupture l'a presque tué.
Et il ne peut pas repasser par là.
Alors à moins que tu n'en soies
absolument certaine, reste loin de lui.
Ce type aime les pennies.
Salut, Marshall.
Non, dégage.
Je ne veux pas te parler.
Okay, je sais que ce que
j'ai fait quelques nuits auparavant
se trouve dans
une zone d'ombre morale.
Mais la bonne nouvelle,
c'est qu'elle t'aimait.
Si les choses s'étaient passées à ta manière...
vous seriez sortis quelques fois,
je pense qu'elle aurait
certainement couché avec toi.
Il n'y a aucun conditionnel
dans le sexe.
Tu as raison. J'ai complètement... C'est
juste que je ne suis pas bon à ça, Barney.
Je suis bon pour être en couple,
je suis bon pour être le copain de Lily.
Etre célibataire... laisse tomber.
Allez, tu ne peux pas
laisser tomber maintenant.
Et si je te disais
que tu pourrais revivre cette nuit
avec exactement la même conversation,
les mêmes blagues,
sauf que cette fois
tu l'as et pas moi.
C'est pas possible.
Oh, mais si.
Elle a...
attends...
on y arrive...
ça y est presque...
une jumelle identique.
Oui !
Une jumelle n'est pas
la même personne.
Bien sûr que si.
Que penses-tu qu'identique veuille dire ?
"Ident"... même, "ique"... personne.
Même personne.
Hey, on pourrait faire un double rancart.
Très bien.
Mais tu dois me promettre que
tu ne vas pas voler ma nouvelle jumelle
et me laisser
avec ta vieille jumelle usagée.
Usagée ?
Elles sont un être humain,
Marshall.
Alors Oncle Marshall
et Oncle Barney ont eu
un double rancart
avec les jumelles.
Comment tu vas ?
Super. Incroyable.
C'est si drôle.
Et je pense que moi et la fille
on accroche vraiment.
C'est le cas. Absolument.
Ecoute, tu vas devoir
partir maintenant.
Je viens de parler
avec les jumelles et devine quoi,
je rentre à la maison
avec les deux.
Ouais. Ça arrive.
C'est impossible
que tu me refasses ça.
Mais elles sont jumelles.
Tu... tu disais
qu'en étant célibataire
je serais comme
dans un magasin de bonbons.
Eh bien ce n'est pas le cas,
ce n'est pas comme un magasin de bonbons.
C'est une terre en friche,
postapocalyptique.
- Je suis peut-être ton meilleur ami...
- En fait c'est Ted mon meilleur ami.
Mais dans ce monde,
c'est chaque "hombre" pour lui.
C'est ça être célibataire.
Et après 9 ans en captivité,
c'est la seule meilleure leçon
que je puisse t'apprendre
sur la survie dans le monde.
Maintenant,
si tu veux bien m'excuser...
J'ai deux seins uniques
et deux duplicata qui m'attendent.
Oh, mauvaise nouvelle...
Marshall a une intoxication alimentaire.
- Quoi ?
- Oh, non.
C'est trop dommage.
Je l'aimais vraiment bien.
Ouais, eh bien j'imagine
qu'on est qu'un trio ce soir.
Lily, qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Oh, je me promenais.
Je n'étais pas...
Oh, tu veux dire New York ?
Mon programme est terminé.
C'était génial.
Juste beaucoup d'amusement...
C'était horrible. C'était
la pire erreur que j'aie jamais faite.
Je suis tellement désolée,
Marshall, et... hello.
Lily, c'était le pire été de ma vie.
Je sais.
C'était le pire été de ma vie.
C'était la chose la plus difficile
que j'aie jamais eue à traverser.
Pouvons-nous nous remettre ensemble
s'il te plaît ?
Toutes ces conneries
que tu m'as dites,
"on doit découvrir qui on est
en dehors de nous,
et on doit apprendre à faire
des choses chacun de notre côté",
ça m'a brisé le coeur.
Il y a trois mois,
tu m'as brisé le coeur.
Pouvons-nous nous remettre ensemble
s'il te plaît ?
Lily, tu avais raison.
Toutes ces conneries étaient vraies.
Alors, non.
Non, on ne peut pas
se remettre ensemble.
On ne devrait pas.
Du moins pas tout de suite.
Wow.
Okay.
Ouais.
Eh bien...
On va se revoir ?
Ouais, ouais.
Je crois.
Je ne sais pas.
Tout est vraiment nouveau pour moi.
Je sors à peine
d'une longue relation.
J'aime bien tes cheveux.
Merci.
J'ai pensé nouvelle ville,
couleur différente...
# ...Wide open road #
# It was love to us #
# It was all that we had... #
Et les pizza là-bas,
les pire pizzas du monde.
Je suis si contente
d'être revenue à New York.
Ecoute, s'il y a quoi que ce soit que
je puisse faire pour ne serait-ce
que commencer à me faire pardonner...
En fait, il peut y avoir quelque chose
que tu peux faire pour moi,
mais tu ne dois jamais
me demander pourquoi.
Alors ensuite j'ai été promu
assistant ménag-er...
Manager... pourquoi
est-ce que je continue à faire ça ?
- Lily ?
- Tu m'as refilé une chlamydia, enflure.
Alors où j'en étais ?
Ah, oui, assistant ménag-er...
Je l'ai refait.
Je n'en reviens pas.
Tu as refilé la chlamidia
à ma soeur jumelle. Tu es répugnant !
Att... attendez, je connais la magie.
Bien joué, Eriksen.
Bien joué.

Elle a été prise en 2006, quand grand-mère
et grand-père sont venus me voir
et qu'on est allés déjeuner.
On avait tous l'air plutôt heureux,
pas vrai ?
Faux.
J'aimerais que
ton visage rétrécisse.
J'aimerais que
tes globes oculaires explosent.
- Je te déteste.
- Je te déteste davantage.
- Je vais le tuer.
- Je ne peux pas dire que je t'en blâme.
Non, je veux dire
que je vais vraiment le tuer.
Je me fiche d'à quel point
c'est désagréable. Vous devez lui parler.
- Pas maintenant.
- Okay, si vous ne le faites pas, je le ferai.
Robin...
Okay, pour que tout ça ait un sens,
vous devez comprendre
que c'est une histoire
en trois parties.
Commençons par la partie
de Marshall et de Lily.
Comme cadeau de 30ème anniversaire,
j'avais fait venir mes parents par avion
à New York pour le week-end.
Oh, j'ai oublié de te dire,
ton cousin Jimmy
a fait un séjour merveilleux
au spa où il est allé.
Tu veux dire le spa où le juge lui a
ordonné d'aller pour arrêter la cocaïne ?
Café ?
Maintenant, grand-père et grand-mère
n'aiment pas parler des choses
dérangeantes, affectives,
autrement dit... vraies.
Bonjour, Mr. et Mrs. Mosby.
Oh, Lily ! Bonjour, Marshall.
Ça fait plaisir de vous voir.
Je suis juste passée récupérer
certaines de mes affaires.
Oui, nous avons été tellement
désolés d'apprendre votre...
vous savez, la, la...
Bref...
Lily qui annule le mariage
et me jette ?
Moi qui supplie Marshall de
me reprendre et lui qui me rejette ?
J'adore vos cheveux.
Ce n'était que la deuxième fois
que Marshall et Lily
se voyaient depuis la rupture,
mais à leur actif,
ça n'était pas si embarrassant.
En fait, on est décontractés.
On a juste partagé les CD.
Tout était très courtois.
Je suis fier de nous ;
on est bien.
Eh bien, nous allons tous aller
à la "Casa a Pezzi" à 20 heures.
Lily, aimeriez-vous
vous joindre à nous ?
Um...
Quoi ?
Eh bien, je... je ne veux pas y aller
si ça doit te mettre mal à l'aise.
Pourquoi ça me mettrait mal à l'aise ?
Eh bien, je veux dire, ouais,
on est... on est bien,
mais tu dois admettre
qu'il y a ce truc entre nous.
Um, pas pour moi.
Maintenant c'est comme
si on était amis.
C'est comme si
on était frère et sœur.
"Frère et sœur" ?!
Okay. Très bien, ouais,
je te retrouve au restaurant, frérot.
Vous voyez ?
Pas embarrassant du tout.
- Hello, tout le monde.
- Salut.
Hello, Marshall.
Lily, cette robe est renversante.
Oh, merci.
Elle est un peu décolletée,
mais je me suis dit,
"Hey, on est en famille."
Pas vrai, frérot ?
Qu'est-ce que tu as ?
Oh, je me suis fait mal
à la cheville au yoga aujourd'hui.
Le prof m'a dit
de respirer profondément
pour faire passer la douleur, juste...
Tu vas bien ?
Tu transpires.
Non, je suis bien.
C'est juste que...
ce petit pain est vraiment épicé.
Lily est diabolique !
Elle portait cette robe exprès
pour me torturer.
Eh bien, tu sais quoi ?
On peut être deux à jouer à ce jeu.
Tu vas voir, au déjeuner,
je vais torturer Lily en retour.
Ouais. Il y a une partie de mon corps
pour laquelle elle a une faiblesse aussi.
Mon pote, tu ne peux pas
sortir ça au déjeuner.
Non, pas ça.
Je vais découvrir mes mollets.
C'est dingue.
Personne n'est excité par
les mollets d'un homme.
C'est une partie du corps
complètement non-érotique.
Ouais, ouais,
c'est aussi ce que je dirais
si j'avais ces maigrichonnes
petites canes de serin.
J'attendrai tes excuses
à côté du téléphone.
Alors Marshall s'est pointé
au déjeuner avec un plan.
- Hello.
- Oh, salut.
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey.
Hey. Comment te sens-tu ?
Tu semblais fiévreux hier soir.
Oh, non, en fait je vais super bien.
Il fait chaud ici, par contre,
n'est-ce pas ?
Oh, je ne sais pas, si quoi que ce soit,
c'est une sorte de...
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Oh, rien. Rien du tout.
Je me mets juste un peu plus...
à l'aise.
Oh.
Oh, oui.
J'ai fait toutes ces levées
d'orteils dernièrement, et...
j'ai vraiment
des crampes aux mollets.
Retire ta robe.
Retire le reste de ton pantalon.
Je ne m'attendais vraiment pas
à ce que ça arrive.
Ouais, moi non plus.
Ça complique les choses, hein ?
Ouais, vraiment. Pourquoi m'as-tu balancé
tes magnifiques mollets ?
Tu sais que tu as
des jambes de botteur.
Eh bien, pourquoi m'as-tu
balancé tes beaux seins ?
Tu sais que tu as... des seins.
Admets-le, tu es venu
pour essayer de me séduire.
Te séduire ?
Tu m'as séduit.
Tu t'es assis à côté de moi et tu as retiré
la majeure partie de ton pantalon.
Tu es partie trois mois
à San Francisco.
En quoi ça te séduit ?
Eh bien ce n'est pas le cas,
mais j'en suis encore furieux.
D'accord, ça suffit...
je veux l'anthologie des Beatles.
Oh, eh bien c'est trop dommage ;
je la garde.
Et tu sais, le collector de U2
que je t'ai donné ?
Regarde à l'intérieur...
c'est Dave Matthews.
Tu es diabolique.
Souriez.
Je vais le tuer.
Je ne peux pas dire
que je t'en blâme.
Non, je veux dire
que je vais vraiment le tuer.
Maintenant, parlons de la partie
de l'histoire de Barney.
Ça allait être la première fois
que Robin rencontrait mes parents,
alors on était tous les deux
un peu nerveux.
Barney, qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Uh... je suis ici
pour rencontrer tes parents.
Ils doivent mourir d'envie
de me rencontrer après toutes
les légendaires histoires de Barney
que tu leur as racontées.
Je ne leur ai jamais raconté
de légendaires histoires de Barney.
Quoi ?
Barney, voici une liste de toutes
les choses dont je parle avec mon père :
le baseball...
Mais je suis ton meilleur ami.
En bien, en fait, Marshall est mon...
Je suis la plus importante
personne de ta vie.
Eh bien, en fait, Robin est...
Comment tes parents peuvent-ils
ne rien savoir de moi ?
Je suis délicieux.
Pour nous, bien sûr,
en très petites doses non fréquentes.
Je veux dire, allons,
tu n'es pas tout à fait le genre d'ami
que des parents veulent
que leur enfant ait.
Oh, vraiment ?
Alors j'imagine que ces chaussures
ne sont pas la chose
sur laquelle tu aies le plus tort
aujourd'hui.
- Hey, Maman. Hey, Papa.
- Ted.
Je sais que vous étiez très enthousiastes
de rencontrer...
Barney Stinson. C'est un honneur
de faire votre connaissance à tous les deux.
Ce coussin en tapisserie "Bénissez Ce Désordre"
que vous avez fait pour Ted...
quel point.
Point !
Est-ce que ça vient d'arriver ?
Uh, Maman, Papa,
voici ma copine, Robin.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Oh, c'est merveilleux
de vous rencontrer, Robin.
Oh, vous êtes si jolie.
N'est-elle pas jolie, Al ?
Une vraie beauté. (looker)
C'est drôle, je n'ai même pas regardé
("look") dans le miroir aujourd'hui.
Ce n'est pas quelque chose,
n'est-ce pas ?
Alors, j'ai réservé chez San Marino
ce soir pour 20 heures.
San Marino.
Oh, tu es sérieuse ?
Mince.
Non. On doit essayer la Casa A Pezzi.
Le meilleur risotto au saumon
que j'aie jamais goûté.
J'adore le risotto au saumon.
Je sais.
Comment est-on censés avoir
une table à la Casa A Pezzi ?
Ils sont complets
des semaines à l'avance.
Eh bien, heureusement pour toi,
il s'avère que je connais la serveuse en chef,
ce qui est ironique parce que...
Ironique parce qu'on travaille tous
les deux dans un foyer pour sans abri
où je sers de la nourriture.
Où es-tu volontaire, Robin ?
C'est quoi ton problème ?
Je suis sa copine et je n'essaye
même pas aussi fort.
T'as bien inversé les rôles,
lèche-bottes.
Robin, je suis son meilleur ami.
C'est un engagement.
Copine, c'est comme
une mauvaise grippe.
Hors de votre système après
quelques semaines au lit.
Tope-là.
Je peux aider ?
Oui, vous pouvez, Virginia.
Il y a une histoire derrière
cette broche et je vais l'entendre.
Eh bien, c'est drôle
que vous demandiez.
Whoa !
Bravo, Barney.
Ça a toujours été
ma sonate préférée.
Barney, vous êtes tout
simplement délicieux.
Non, Virginia, vous êtes délicieuse,
je suis déli-Ted.
Et il est juste Ted.
Je ne prévois vraiment pas
ces choses ; elles arrivent juste.
Whoops. Je pense avoir laissé tomber
un glaçon là-dedans.
Ow, c'est vraiment froid.
D'accord, ça suffit.
Je me tire d'ici.
Dans une minute.
Quelqu'un est partant
pour un verre chez MacLaren ?
- Non, je suis fatiguée.
- Moi aussi.
Ouais, je suis sûr que mes parents
vont vouloir...
J'ai l'impression que je pourrais
descendre quelques cervezas.
Cervezas ?
Il est tombé ?
Je me joindrais bien à vous aussi,
mais je veux me lever
de bonne heure pour la messe demain.
St. Peter, 8 heures 45,
c'est mon service préféré.
Attends une minute... tu peux
passer le seuil d'une église ?
Je vous réserverai un siège.
Oh, vous êtes vraiment
sensationnel.
N'est-ce pas, Susan ?
Robin.
Susan, elle s'appelle Virginia.
Mon pote, je suis vraiment énervé
contre ton père maintenant.
Pourquoi ?
Hier soir, on est allés chez MacLaren
pour un verre, hein ?
Alors Barney fonce à nouveau
dans la maison en feu,
soulève le réfrigérateur
sous lequel je suis coincé
et me tire en sécurité.
Whoa. Vous êtes comme un héros.
Oh, je ne suis pas un héros, Wendy.
Vous savez qui est un héros ?
Mon Dalmatien, Smokey.
Il... ne...
s'en est pas sorti.
Je suis désolé.
Pauvre homme courageux.
Pourquoi ne faites-vous pas
un câlin à ce type ?
Je suis... oh.
Mon père était ton co-pilote ?
Ça me fiche vraiment
le bazar dans la tête.
Barney, mon père est cool ?
Je n'ai pas fini.
Donc, ton père reste
pour finir son verre,
mais je pars parce que je dois être debout
de bonne heure pour la messe avec ta mère.
Bien sûr.
Quoi qu'il en soit, je réalise que j'ai laissé
mon téléphone sur le bar, alors je reviens...
Oh, mon dieu...
Oh, mon dieu.
C'est vraiment...
- Oh, mon dieu !
- Je sais.
Tu peux croire que ton père
m'ait racketté comme ça ?
Mon père est sorti avec
Wendy la serveuse ?
Il a trompé ma mère ?
Non, c'est impossible.
Ted, selon les statistiques,
83 % des gens
mariés depuis plus de 6 mois
voient quelqu'un d'autre à côté.
Tu sais que quand tu sors une
statistique, tu dis toujours 83 % ?
Tu penses que je mens.
Eh bien, as-tu étudié
la question ?
Parce les personnes sur www.echangisme.
le-mariage-libre-est-naturel\
légaliser-la-polygamie.org l'ont étudiée,
et elles ont un autre avis.
Ce n'est pas un vrai site web.
Oh, et je suppose que
je n'ai pas reçu de vrai T-shirt
pour avoir participé
à leur course de 10 km.
- Salut, papa.
- Hey, Ted. Barney.
- Tu apprécies tes vacances jusqu'ici ?
- Oh, ouais.
Euh, dis, je peux te parler
à l'extérieur une seconde ?
Bien sûr.
Alors tu es sorti
avec Barney hier soir ?
Ouais.
Vous vous êtes bien amusés ?
Oh, ouais, ouais. Dommage que
tu n'aies pas pu te joindre à nous.
Ouais.
Alors...
Quoi ?
Eh bien...
Eh bien quoi ?
Tu crois que Cerrano
a sa chance au tournoi RBI ?
Je voulais le confronter,
mais je n'ai pas pu.
Je suppose que j'ai hérité du gène
ne-parlons-de-rien-de-gênant.
C'est sûr que tu n'as pas hérité
du gène concluons-l'affaire de ton père.
Souriez.
Super.
Je me fiche d'à quel point
c'est désagréable. Vous devez lui parler.
Pas maintenant.
Okay, si vous ne le faites pas,
je le ferai.
Robin...!
Okay, maintenant il faut que
je revienne au début
pour vous raconter la partie
de l'histoire de moi et Robin.
On attendait mes parents
d'une minute à l'autre.
Une dernière chose sur ma mère.
Elle cuisine
chacune de mes copines
pour savoir quand on va se marier
et avoir des enfants.
Mais c'est la première fois
qu'elle me rencontre.
Peu importe.
Et tu sauras que c'est le moment
quand elle parlera de ma cousine Stacy.
Six enfants en 5 ans.
Cette femme est pratiquement
une attraction dans un parc aquatique.
Mais je ne veux pas me marier
et avoir des enfants.
Que suis-je censée dire ?
Tu sais quoi ?
Tu es une adulte avec
des opinions parfaitement valables.
Tu ne devrais pas avoir
à t'en excuser.
- Je vais mentir.
- C'est ce que je ferais.
Encore merci de me laisser
le coffret de U2.
Je sais à quel point
tu y tiens.
J'ai parlé à tante Caroline
l'autre jour.
Stacy est à nouveau enceinte.
Oh, tant mieux pour elle.
- Alors, chérie...
- Et voilà.
Dites-nous ce que ça fait
d'être journaliste.
Je ne suis simplement
pas prête.
Okay.
Pas de pression.
Oh, Uh, je croyais que vous...
C'est génial.
Bien.
Concentrez-vous sur votre travail maintenant,
parce que l'horloge de votre carrière tourne.
Il restera bien du temps pour le mariage,
les enfants et tout ça plus tard.
Ooh, un piano !
Tu as eu du bol
avec ma mère hier soir, hein ?
Quel soulagement, pas vrai ?
Oh, absolument.
Whew, quel soulagement de savoir
que je suis la seule copine
avec laquelle ta mère ne veut pas
que tu aies des enfants.
Hourra ?
Quoi, elle croit vraiment que Cheryl,
ta copine à l'université,
aurait accouché
de beaux enfants ?
Parce que j'ai vu des photos,
et excuse-moi,
mais cette fille avait un front
digne d'un homme des cavernes.
Arrête, elle fronçait juste les sourcils
sous la lumière directe.
Et en plus, ce n'est pas ce que
j'aimais chez elle. C'était ses...
Ce n'est pas important.
Qu'est-il arrivé à
Marshall et Lily ?
Ils se sont disputés récemment.
Ils sont probablement quelque part
en train de remettre ça.
Encore du café ?
Oh, non merci.
N'est-elle pas mignonne ?
Si elle est si mignonne, peut-être
qu'elle devrait porter les bébés de Ted.
Pardon ?
Rien.
Juste une minute.
Peut-être moins.
Robin, chérie. Ai-je dit
quelque chose qui vous a énervée ?
Pourquoi ne voulez-vous pas
que je porte vos petits-enfants ?
Voulez-vous porter
mes petits-enfants ?
Non !
Enfin, je ne sais pas.
C'est juste que je veux que vous vouliez
que je veuille porter vos petits-enfants.
Et vous devriez.
Je suis une mine d'or génétique.
Pas d'antécédents de diabète ou
de maladies cardiaques dans la famille.
Tout le monde a des dents non poreuses
et une vue parfaite.
J'avais un oncle schizophrène,
mais même lui avait une vue parfaite.
Ce qui était regrettable
pour les gens qui se trouvaient
près du clocher dans lequel il était,
mais c'était quand même
un homme très bien, et...
Désolé. On ne savait pas
qu'il y avait la queue.
Marshall, ta fermeture.
Robin, ce n'est pas que
je ne veux pas de petits-enfants.
C'est juste que je crois que
personne ne devrait faire l'erreur
de se marier trop jeune.
Pourquoi dites-vous ça ?
Vous vous êtes mariée très jeune.
Ce n'était pas une erreur.
Si ?
Eh bien...
Okay, il y a quelque chose
que vous ne savez pas.
Souriez.
J'aimerais que
ton visage rétrécisse.
J'aimerais que
tes globes oculaires explosent.
Je vais le tuer.
Je me fiche d'à quel point
c'est désagréable. Vous devez lui parler.
- Pas maintenant.
- Okay, si vous ne le faites pas, je le ferai.
Robin...
Oh, laissez-moi vous aider
à ramasser ça, mon cœur.
Ton cœur ?
Ton cœur ?!
Le seul cœur de ta vie
devrait être la femme
que tu as épousée il y a 30 ans,
pas la serveuse du bar d'hier soir
et pas cette pouffiasse
maladroite !
Je suis désolé,
vous n'êtes pas une pouffiasse.
Je suis énervé.
Je ne sais pas ce que je dis.
Mais restez éloignée
de mon père.
Ted, de quoi tu parles ?
Papa ?
Tu veux dire à maman
ce qui s'est passé au bar hier soir ?
Okay.
Je suis sorti avec une serveuse.
Oh.
Oh ?
Je veux dire, oh !
Oh ! Ooh !
On va avoir une sérieuse discussion
à ce sujet à la maison, Al.
Oh, ooh !
Une sérieuse discussion ?
Maman, que...?
Il embrassait une autre femme.
Ça ne te fait rien ?
Mme Mosby ?
Ted, on ne savait pas trop
comment te dire ça...
Ta mère et moi sommes divorcés.
Comment ça, vous êtes divorcés ?
Depuis quand ?
Oh, mon dieu,
ça doit faire 9 mois maintenant.
Plutôt 10, je pense.
Le temps passe.
Donc il y a 10 mois,
vous avez simplement décidé
de divorcer sans me le dire ?
Non, ce n'était pas
une décision impulsive.
On était séparés
depuis presque 2 ans.
Comment avez-vous pu
ne rien me dire ?!
On le voulait, mais ça ne semblait
jamais être le bon moment.
Donc à Noël dernier...?
On avait pensé vous en parler,
mais ce n'était pas vraiment
dans l'esprit de Noël.
Vous vous êtes acheté un tandem.
Oh, ce n'était pas du gâchis. Ta mère
et Frank l'utilisent tout le temps.
Mais qui est Frank ?!
Oh, un type génial.
Je les ai mis ensemble.
Tu te souviens du Dr. Muchnik.
Il t'a mis ton appareil dentaire.
Okay, ma tête va exploser,
et je ne veux pas me répandre
sur les gaufres de tout le monde,
alors je m'en vais.
Teddy chéri, oh...
Vous savez, il avait dit
qu'il était divorcé hier soir.
J'avais complètement zappé ça.
Ooh, pas de file d'attente
pour les omelettes.
Lily...
je suis désolé
d'avoir dit toutes ces choses.
Moi aussi.
Je trouve juste ça très perturbant
d'être près de toi en ce moment.
C'est pareil pour moi.
Je pense qu'on se porterait
tous les deux mieux si on arrêtait
d'essayer de garder nos distances
pendant un temps.
Ouais, je pense que tu as raison.
Tu portes
un soutien-gorge push-up ?
As-tu mis de l'autobronzant
sur tes mollets ?
Je retire la question.
On est désolés de n'avoir rien dit
à propos du divorce.
C'était mal
de ne rien te dire.
Merci.
Mais écoute,
ne dis rien à ta sœur.
Ça ne ferait que l'énerver.
Non, c'est ridicule !
On doit commencer à parler de choses,
et pas seulement de base-ball.
Les Indians ont gagné aujourd'hui
sur une double échappée.
Contre les Red Sox?
Eh b'en, c'est une super victoire.
Non. Non. Non.
On ne va pas laisser passer ça.
Je veux dire,
je ne vous connais même pas.
Je ne sais même pas
comment vous vous êtes rencontrés.
Je ne t'ai jamais dit
comment j'ai rencontré ta mère ?
- Non.
- Oh, super histoire.
Dans un bar.
C'est tout ?
C'est ce qu'on appelle
la communication dans notre famille ?
Quand j'aurai des enfants, et que je leur
raconterai comment j'ai rencontré leur mère,
je leur dirai tout,
toute l'histoire.
Je crois que
c'était un bar irlandais.
C'est juste que je ne...
je ne comprends pas.
Vous aviez l'air heureux.
Quand j'étais enfant,
vous aviez l'air...
Que s'est-il passé ?
On a juste réalisé
qu'on était très différents.
Ton père est juste un romantique
avec la tête dans les nuages,
et je suis bien plus
terre à terre.
Et alors ?
Robin et moi sommes comme ça.
Ça ne veut rien dire.
Je voulais des enfants.
Et ta mère...
voulait aussi des enfants.
Robin et moi avons
des visions différentes sur la famille.
On ne va pas rompre
à cause de ça.
En un certain sens,
je l'ai toujours su.
Je ne voulais même pas
sortir avec lui au début.
Mais il a passé des mois à me harceler
jusqu'à ce que cède enfin.
Quand on ne s'entend pas
sur autant de points fondamentaux,
ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant qu'on
réalise qu'on n'est pas faits l'un pour l'autre.
Mais on aime Robin.
Absolument.
Vous rencontrer
à été le clou de mon voyage.
Enfin, le second clou.
- On vous retrouve à l'intérieur.
- Désolé.
Wow.
Je sais.
Ils m'aiment !
Alors on va vraiment essayer
de plus communiquer.
A partir de maintenant,
on dévoilera tout.
Bien. Bien, je pense que
ça fera vraiment du bien à la famille.
Et comment va grand-mère ? Elle n'a pas
répondu à mes derniers coups de fil.
Je vais me chercher du jus.
Non.
Non.
Tu as raté un super match
hier soir. Une vraie réussite.

Les enfants, parfois votre relation fonctionne
sans accroc depuis si longtemps,
que vous pensez que ça va
toujours être comme ça.
Ça n'est jamais le cas.
Eh bien, on vient d'avoir
notre première dispute.
On a eu notre première dispute.
Oh, non, à quel propos
vous êtes-vous disputés ?
Oh, non, à quel propos
vous êtes-vous disputés ?
Il y a quelques mois, mon cabinet
d'architecture a été approché
pour concevoir ce nouveau bâtiment...
C'est cet immense gratte-ciel à Spokane.
Ça doit représenter un énorme
projet pour son cabinet.
Et si on ne l'obtient pas,
on pourrait se casser la figure.
Enfin bref, l'architecte en chef
dévoile sa nouvelle ébauche
à toute la compagnie.
- Non.
- Non.
Oui.
Tous les gratte-ciels ressemblent
en quelque sorte à...
Marshall, c'est une tour
de 78 étages en marbre rose
au sommet arrondi
et deux entrées sphériques
par devant.
Wow, alors c'est tout le paquet.
- Ouais, tu l'as fait.
- Obligé.
Oh, mon pote, s'ils vendent des préservatifs,
tu dois m'en prendre un.
Et ne m'arnaque pas.
- Ouais, tu l'as fait.
- Obligé.
C'est une caricature.
Ça doit déterminer
le profil de la ville.
Si c'était moi, j'aurais conçu
quelque chose de stupéfiant.
Au lieu de ça, je passe 12 heures par jour
à dessiner les corniches.
- Ouais, tu l'as fait.
- C'en était pas un.
Alors toi et Ted avez eu
votre première dispute.
Ça s'est de toute évidence bien terminé.
Je veux dire, tu es là, avec moi.
En fait, ça ne s'est pas
terminé du tout.
Je commençais à en avoir marre,
alors je suis venue ici.
Je fais tout le temps ça.
Quand ma grand-mère est morte,
j'ai fait une permanente.
Ooh, deux tragédies le même jour.
Le truc c'est que Ted
ne fait littéralement
que se plaindre de son travail
non-stop depuis des semaines.
Alors quand je suis passée
aujourd'hui, je saturais déjà.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Comment s'est passée ta journée ?
- Bien.
Wow, tu es une journaliste géniale.
Tu ne vas pas me demander comment
s'est passée ma journée ?
Non, je sais comment c'était.
C'était terrible.
Ooh, tu veux louer
un film ce soir ?
Tu sais, heu...
j'écoute tes histoires de boulot
tout le temps.
Ouais, mais... je ne voudrais
pas me montrer désagréable,
mais mes histoires de boulot
sont intéressantes.
Je suis journaliste
d'actualités télévisées.
- Robin...
- Quoi ?
Je savais exactement
ce qu'il allait dire.
Je l'aidais juste
à y arriver plus vite.
Tu devrais travailler à SOS suicide.
Et puis c'est devenu moche.
Ce que je ne fais pas, c'est te raconter
encore et encore la même histoire.
Je veux dire, tu ne regarderais
pas le même film
encore et encore,
n'est-ce pas ?
Peut-être un super film
comme Die Hard.
Mais Jusqu'au Bout du Rêve ?
Une fois c'est plus que suffisant.
Alors, c'est ton pire mauvais film ?
Le premier exemple de mauvais
film qui te vienne
sur le bout de la langue
c'est Jusqu'au Bout du Rêve ?
Ça parle de fantômes de joueurs
de base-ball.
Je trouve ça stupide.
Alors maintenant il est furieux
après moi à cause du stupide film.
Robin, il est en colère parce
que tu ne voulais pas l'écouter,
pas parce que
tu n'as pas aimé un film.
Comment ne pas aimer
Jusqu'au Bout du Rêve ?!
Ecouter c'est la base d'une relation.
Et s'il est vraiment monotone,
tu peux toujours t'entraîner
à dire l'alphabet à l'envers.
Tu sais, au cas où tu te ferais arrêter
pour conduite en état d'ivresse.
J'imagine que je ne sais pas faire ça.
Ouais, c'est vraiment dur,
même quand tu es sobre.
C'est ce que j'essayais
d'expliquer au flic.
Non, je veux dire, j'imagine que je ne
sais pas faire ce truc de petite amie.
Je n'ai jamais eu
de relation aussi sérieuse.
Je devrais probablement lui dire
que je suis désolée, n'est-ce pas ?
Tu essayes de le faire maintenant,
n'est-ce pas ?
Bon sang, qu'est-ce
qui vient avant "Q" ?
Et à la fin du film, quand il fait
des lancers avec son père, comme...
comme il ne l'avait jamais fait quand
il était assez jeune pour que ça compte.
On peut parler d'autre chose ?
Tu sais quoi, mon pote ?
Oublie Robin, okay ?
Ce soir tu traînes avec nous.
J'ai une super fête en vue.
Oh, mon dieu.
Ça va encore être l'une
de tes bizarres fêtes entre mecs ?
C'était un poker.
C'est quoi ton problème ?
Non, c'est la première fête
de l'école de droit de l'année
et ça va être formidable.
Je n'ai pas vu ces personnes
depuis genre l'an dernier.
avant que Lily et moi rompions.
Alors je vais devoir annoncer
la nouvelle à tout le monde.
Ça va vraiment les gonfler.
Cette fête va être craignos.
Eh bien, j'adorerais t'accompagner.
Mais j'ai des billets pour
Foxy Boxing. (boxe féminine)
J'aurais aimé pouvoir me joindre à vous
les mecs, mais je dois retourner
à mon travail soi-disant ennuyeux.
- Ton travail n'est pas ennuyeux.
- Robin pense que si.
Mon pote, beaucoup de nanas
trouvent les architectes sexy.
Réfléchis-y, tu crées
quelque chose à partir de rien.
Tu es comme dieu.
Personne n'est plus sexy que dieu.
J'adore quand tu cites les
Ecritures.
Je te le dis, tu devrais approcher
les filles avec l'angle architecte.
Okay, premièrement,
j'ai une copine.
Deuxièmement, l'angle architecte
ne marche même pas sur elle.
Et troisièmement, j'ai du mal à imaginer
que ça ait déjà marché sur quiconque.
C'est parce que
tu fais toujours style...
Ted Mosby, architecte.
Si c'était moi, je ferais style...
Ted Mosby, architecte.
N'importe quoi peut impressionner
quand c'est dit avec la bonne attitude.
Marshall Ericksen.
Récemment jeté
et qui va à une fête nulle.
Whoa. Whoa, mesdames,
je vous en prie, calmez-vous.
J'en ai assez pour tout le monde.
Oh. Salut. Hello.
D'accord.
On se casse...
Attendez.
Je viens avec vous.
Ted Mosby, architecte.
Fais-moi confiance.
Hey, juste par curiosité.
Si un type vous dit
qu'il est architecte,
qu'en penseriez-vous ?
Vous plaisantez ?
Les architectes sont sexy.
Comment pensez-vous que M. Brady
ait emballé une nana comme Carol ?
Bon point.
Elle avait des cheveux d'or.
- Oui, tout à fait.
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, Carl, Ted est encore là ?
Non.
Hey, Lily.
- Tu es toujours célibataire ?
- Oui.
Tu sais... j'ai versé beaucoup de boissons
gratuites pour toi au fil des ans.
Beaucoup.
Carl, tu veux vraiment être
avec une femme
qui vendrait du sexe
pour de la bière ?
Seulement si tu en fais partie.
C'est pour moi.
Merci.
Je me demande où est passé Ted.
Ted Mosby, l'architecte ?
En fait, ouais.
Oh, c'est un type si cool.
Il était là tout à l'heure.
Et qu'est-ce qui t'a incité à
vouloir devenir architecte ?
Eh bien, tu sais,
une âme d'artiste,
des mains de maître artisan.
C'était inévitable, j'imagine.
Je parie que tu peux dessiner,
pas vrai ?
Tu devrais faire mon portrait.
Eh bien, je pourrais essayer,
mais tu pourrais finir par ressembler
à une résidence à trois étages
du milieu du siècle.
Hey. Si vous voulez, mon ami Marshall
m'a invité à cette fête où on pourrait aller.
Marshall est génial.
Il n'est qu'avocat,
mais quelqu'un doit bien déplacer
les papiers pour nous, les créatifs.
- J'ai pas raison ?
- Ouais.
Il l'a invitée à une fête.
Oh, mon dieu, tu vas bien ?
Okay ? C'est formidable.
C'est tout bénef.
Ted est parti et
je n'ai pas à l'écouter.
Peut-être qu'une fois qu'il en aura
fini avec la parlote, il reviendra
et j'aurai la partie amusante.
C'est quoi ton problème ?
Mon dieu, j'ai l'impression d'enseigner
l'amour seconde langue, là.
Okay, tu sais comment
tu es censée écouter
quand il te raconte des histoires
de boulot ennuyeuses ?
Eh bien, quand il ramasse
une fille au hasard dans un bar,
tu es censée paniquer.
Je ne panique pas parce que
dans mon esprit, elle est grosse.
Elle est entraîneur de kickboxing.
Ses fesses sont plus belles
que mon visage.
D'accord, on va faire
un crochet par la fête.
La fête était pour des camarades
de classe de Marshall
de l'Ecole de Droit de Columbia,
qui, de jour, étaient
parmi les plus pointus
et les plus sérieux jeunes
esprits légaux du pays.
De nuit, par contre...
Mince, c'est des presque-avocats
ivres.
Okay !
Sérieusement...
qui veut me raser le cul ?!
Ce type allait venir
Juge de la Cour Suprême.
Okay, où sont les mecs
et les putes ?
Yo, quoi de neuf, mesdames ?
Bienvenue à la fête. Yeah !
Il vous suffit juste de signer
cette décharge protégeant l'hôte
de n'importe quelle et de toute responsabilité
si vous vous nuisez à vous-même
ou à une tierce personne.
Puis place à la méga-teuf !
Ouais !
Hey, type de loi bourré, heu...
tu as vu Marshall Ericksen ?
Il était avec un type nommé Ted.
Tu veux dire Ted Mosby, l'architecte ?
La vache, quel visionnaire.
Ouais, ils étaient là.
C'est sympa les récompenses,
ça fait bien sur mon étagère.
Mais cette reconnaissance
n'est rien comparée à la joie
de voir le soleil se lever
sur votre premier immeuble.
Wow.
J'adorerais regarder le soleil
se lever avec toi.
Je sais.
C'est le job.
Mec. Tu devrais nous laisser
te raser les fesses ce soir.
Pas moyen.
Hey, Marshall, où est Lily ?
Je ne voulais pas gâcher aussi tôt
la fête de tout le monde, mais, heu...
que tout le monde prenne un siège.
Um... En fait, Lily a annulé
le mariage cet été
pour aller à San Francisco.
Alors...
on a rompu.
Son nom n'était pas
sur ton bail, n'est-ce pas ?
Parce que sinon, selon les lois de l'Etat
de New York, tu n'es pas obligé
de lui donner sa moitié
du dépôt quand tu déménages.
Ouais, ce n'est pas vraiment
la partie qui m'inquiète, les mecs.
Et n'oublie pas le précédent
de Smith contre Rosenblatt, 1974.
Tout effet personnel qu'elle a laissé
dans ta maison ou appartement
t'appartient après 30 jours.
Les mecs, pouvons-nous cesser
et laisser tomber
les discours d'avocat
pendant une minute ?
L'amour est mort.
L'amour qui vous a fait croire
à l'amour, c'est mort maintenant.
Tu devrais la poursuivre.
Uh, vraiment ?
Sur quelle base , Kara ?
Sur la base de...
tais-toi.
C'est notre procureur général.
Tu vois, Marshall est encore
obsédé par notre rupture.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que je l'écoutais.
C'était une relation
solide et attentionnée
que j'ai jetée
comme un vieux chewing gum.
Non pas que je sois inquiète, mais...
revenons-en au lever du soleil
avec Ted et...
oh, avec quel bon goût l'as-tu décrite ?
La fille avec le cul
qui attire les fessées.
Oui, cette jeune fille.
Alors, je connais le videur
de cette boîte de nuit techno, Posers.
T'as envie d'aller danser ?
Ouais, okay. Pas moyen
que Ted soit allé danser.
Ted déteste les boîtes de nuit.
Et comment.
J'adore les boîtes de nuit.
Je veux dire, j'allais concevoir
une cathédrale ce soir,
ça fout un grand coup à la relation
entre dieu et le mystère de l'homme.
Mais bien sûr, allons danser.
Attends, laisse-moi juste
aller voir avec mon pote.
Okay.
Hey, Marshall. T'es partant pour
de la musique super forte et répétitive
qui n'a pas changé
depuis le milieu des années 90 ?
Um... seulement toujours.
Allons-y.
Danser ?
Il est allé danser avec cette fille ?
Okay, peut-être que
c'est un peu grave.
Danser, c'est grave.
Danser mène au sexe.
T'as grandi
dans la ville de Footloose ?
Je l'appelle.
Je lui dis que j'avais tort
et que je suis désolée, et que je veux
vraiment entendre ses stupides histoires.
Ouais, réfléchis à une autre façon
de tourner ça et ça ira.
Il ne répond pas.
J'appelle Marshall.
Allô ?
Marshall, salut, c'est Robin.
Je peux parler à Ted ?
Oh, Robin, salut.
Um, non, Ted n'est pas là ce soir.
Il... il travaille.
Uh, okay. Bye.
Marshall vient de me mentir.
Ted me trompe.
Excusez-moi. Je recherche deux personnes
qui sont venues ici un peu plus tôt.
L'une fait 1m75, 60kg,
des cheveux châtain clair.
Et l'autre est
un connard qui me trompe.
Il va falloir que
vous me rafraîchissiez la mémoire.
Okay, mon pote,
bébé sait comment on joue à ce jeu.
Est-ce que 20$
aideraient votre mémoire ?
Merci, mais sérieusement,
c'était la folie ce soir.
Il faut vraiment que
vous me rafraîchissiez la mémoire.
Alors puis récupérer le...?
C'est bon. Gardez-le.
Alors ces personnes...
l'un est un architecte.
Ted Mosby, l'architecte ?
C'est lui.
Oh ouais, il était là.
Et puis j'ai fait : "Non, Frank Gehry.
Tu te démerdes tout seul cette fois-ci".
Et ça, ma chère, c'était la fin
de la carrière de ce tâcheron.
J'habite de l'autre côté de la rue.
C'est vraiment sauter du coq à l'âne.
Tu veux venir ?
Eh bien, je ne sais pas.
Mais je suppose que
je devrais au moins te raccompagner.
Monte.
Je te verrai
au club de lecture, Vinny.
- Ouais, j'apporterai les crudités.
- Chouette.
Mec, mec, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je galope.
Tu l'as prouvé, okay ? Toute cette histoire
de Ted Mosby l'architecte fonctionne.
Les architectes déchirent !
Whoo-hee!
Ça ne t'inquiète pas
qu'une certaine personne
puisse découvrir
ce que tu fais ?
Ceci n'est pas toi, Ted.
C'est moi ce soir.
Whoo !
Vous connaissez cette fille.
Où est-ce qu'elle habite ?
Je ne vous dis pas ça
pour moins de 20 dollars.
- B'en je n'ai plus d'argent.
- Je suis aussi à sec.
Je prendrai votre sac.
Mon sac ?
Ouais, ma copine aime les pochettes.
Okay, bien.
Vous devriez lui dire que ça fait
vraiment bien avec des bottes chocolat.
Cette garce a de la chance
que j'aie pris mon petit sac.
Pas assez de place
pour mon flingue. Tenez.
Maintenant, où habite
cette garce des rodéos ?
L'immeuble avec l'éclairage vert,
appartement 3-C.
Oh, mon dieu, Robin,
tu vas mettre une raclée
à cette fille ?
Ouais...
et lui voler son sac.
Je n'arrive pas à croire
qu'il me trompe.
Tu sais combien de fois
j'aurais pu le tromper ?
Six... non, sept fois.
Et tu en connais deux,
et tu serais surprise.
3-C, allons-y. Tu es prête ?
Je devrais juste
défoncer la porte ?
Ce sont vraiment de chouettes chaussures
à talons et tu as déjà perdu le sac.
Voyons si c'est ouvert.
C'est ouvert.
Okay, entre là-dedans
et mets-lui une bonne raclée.
Robin.
- Je suis le problème.
- Quoi ?
Tu avais raison.
Je ne sais pas
comment être une copine.
J'ai pris le mec
le plus gentil au monde
et je l'ai fait me tromper.
Eh bien, ne reste pas là
à te flageller.
Entre là-dedans et flagelle Ted.
Je m'occuperai
de cette garce de boxeuse.
En fait, je vais prendre Ted.
- Allons-y.
- Allez !
Que crois-tu que...?
Barney ?
Dieu merci vous êtes là.
Vous pouvez m'aider ? Il faut des ongles.
Okay, je suis complètement perdue.
Où est Ted ?
Ted ? Il est au boulot.
Comment es-tu arrivé ici ?
C'est une histoire étonnante.
Comme toujours.
Comment pensez-vous que M. Brady
ait emballé une nana comme Carol ?
Bon point.
- Et elle avait des cheveux d'or.
- Oui, tout à fait.
Désolé, j'ai oublié mes jumelles
pour la boxe féminine.
Whoo, on dirait que les choses
sont devenues un peu plus féminines ici.
Oui, effectivement.
Et tu arrives juste à temps.
Les filles, je dois y aller,
mais je vous laisse
en de très bonnes mains
à peine souillées.
Ne t'en va pas. On ne connaît même pas
ton nom pour guetter tes bâtiments.
Ouais, reste.
Excusez-nous une seconde.
Okay, tu avais raison,
le truc de l'architecte marche à fond.
Mais j'ai une copine
et je dois retourner travailler.
Ce projet devient
de plus en plus dur.
- Ouais, tu l'as fait.
- Ouais, obligé.
A plus.
Désolé, mon... interne
a dû partir.
Oh, eh bien,
c'est trop dommage.
Moi c'est Anna,
au passage.
Ted Mosby... architecte.
Mais cette reconnaissance
n'est rien comparée à la joie
de voir le soleil se lever
sur son premier bâtiment.
- Mec, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Je galope.
Okay, tu l'as prouvé. Toute cette histoire
de Ted Mosby l'architecte fonctionne.
Les architectes déchirent !
Whoo-hoo.
Tu n'as pas peur qu'une certaine
personne puisse découvrir tout ça ?
Je veux dire,
ce n'est pas toi, Ted.
C'est moi ce soir.
Et tout ceci nous a menés
à quelques heures,
qu'en tant que gentleman,
je ne peux pas vous divulguer.
On l'a fait juste ici,
et ici et ici.
Mais pourquoi avoir utilisé
le nom de Ted ?
J'ai eu récemment de la mauvaise
publicité sur le World Wide Web.
Alors j'ai décidé d'arrêter un peu
d'utiliser mon vrai nom.
Oh, c'est génial.
Ce n'était pas Ted. Tout va bien.
Tout ne va pas bien.
Regarde-moi. Je suis dingue,
jalouse, parano.
C'est comme ça que les gens
se comportent dans une relation.
Et c'est pour ça
que j'évite les relations.
Eh bien, devine quoi,
je n'ai pas été dingue, jalouse
ou parano depuis des mois,
et ça me manque vraiment.
Et ainsi se termine le chapitre de :
"Sortons tous nos cœurs
de la chambre où Barney a eu
une aventure d'une nuit."
Venez, partons
avant qu'elle sorte de la douche.
Tu es un vrai porc. Tu ne vas
même pas lui dire au revoir ?
Je te ferai savoir que
j'ai composé une charmante lettre type
à utiliser
en de telles occasions.
Il suffit d'inscrire
son prénom et puis...
Quelque chose avec un "A."
A... A...
Je vais juste mettre "résidente."
Allez, allez, allez !
Robin a fait
une longue promenade ce soir-là.
Elle a réalisé que le fait
de s'ouvrir à une autre personne
veut habituellement dire
qu'on doit s'ouvrir à un peu de folie.
Elle a pensé au fait
qu'il était plus facile d'être seule.
Et puis elle est venue me voir.
# And I am nothing of a builder #
# But here I dreamt I was an architect... #
Hey.
Hey.
- Que fais-tu ici ?
- J'ai apporté des donuts.
Et je ne voudrais pas me vanter,
mais ils sont à la confiture.
Merci.
Alors...
comment s'est passée ta soirée ?
C'était... sympa.
Rien d'excitant.
Et la tienne ?
Tu veux vraiment entendre
d'ennuyeuses histoires d'architecte ?
Oui.
Je suis désolée
pour tout à l'heure.
Pour te dire la vérité, je n'ai jamais vu
"Jusqu'au bout du rêve" en entier.
Je me suis endormie à la moitié.
Quoi ? La meilleure partie,
c'est les 20 dernières minutes.
Peut-être qu'ils auraient dû avancer
un peu cette partie, parce que...
Tu sais quoi...
Ce que j'essaie de dire, c'est que...
j'aime être la personne
contre qui tu rouspètes.
Alors comment s'est passée
ta journée, Mr. l'Architecte ?
Oh, j'aime la façon
dont tu as dit ça.
Eh, tu veux voir le bâtiment
qui donnera des complexes
à chaque homme de Spokane ?
Evidemment.
- Wow.
- Ouais.
Tu sais, tu n'avais pas parlé
de tout le feuillage autour de la base.
Si tu taillais tout ça,
le reste semblerait bien plus grand.
Tu n'as pas besoin de me le dire.
Et... juste pour le plaisir, j'ai...
j'ai travaillé sur ma propre idée
de ce que devrait être ce bâtiment.
Qu'est-ce que tu en penses ?
Vous vous souvenez de la fois
où on est allés à Spokane
et où j'ai pointé du doigt
ce gratte-ciel ?
C'était le premier bâtiment
que j'aie jamais conçu.
Et ce soir-là,
c'était la première fois
que j'en montrais
les premiers croquis à quelqu'un.
Wow.
Ted, c'est épatant.
Merci.
Ce n'est pas comme si
ça mènera un jour à quelque chose.
Je sais pas.
Ça pourrait mener à quelque chose.
Tu sais, les filles
trouvent les architectes très sexy.
Okay,
mais je ne veux pas que
tu t'attendes à 78 étages.
"Chère Résidente...
Le temps qu'on a passé ensemble,
peu importe la durée,
représentait tout pour moi.
J'adorerais te revoir,
mais malheureusement, je ne peux pas.
Tu vois, je suis un fantôme.
Je ne peux me matérialiser
qu'une fois toutes les décennies
le jour de l'anniversaire
de ma mort.
J'ai choisi de passer mon unique
journée parmi les vivants avec toi,
chère... Résidente.
Peut-être qu'on se reverra
dans une autre décennie,
si tu gardes ce physique.
Jusqu'alors,
tout mon amour de l'au-delà.
Barney."
Barney ?
Mais qui est Barney ?

Votre oncle Barney
a toujours été une énigme.
Tout au long des années
où nous vivions à New York,
aucun d'entre nous
n'a mis le pied dans son appartement.
Jusqu'au jour
où l'un de nous l'a fait.
C'est une très bonne histoire.
Et croyez-le ou non,
l'alcool n'y a joué aucun rôle.
Tout a commencé deux semaines plus tôt,
à la pendaison de crémaillère de Lily.
Hey, bienvenue
dans mon nouveau chez-moi.
Oh, wow, Lily, c'est...
Oh, ce n'est que ça.
Ouais, je sais que c'est petit,
mais il a du caractère.
Merci.
Et mes voisins m'apprennent
le Lithuanien.
Ils sont super.
Ils sont toujours là dans l'entrée,
vous savez,
à cuisiner, jouer
et se couper mutuellement les cheveux.
C'est sympa.
Hey, est-ce qu'une cuvette de WC
est dans ta cuisine ?
Où y a t'il un fourneau
dans ta salle de bains ?
Oh, ce n'est pas qu'un fourneau.
C'est un Foufourévateur :
une combinaison d'un fourneau, d'un four,
d'un évier et d'un réfrigérateur.
Foufourévateur.
N'est-ce pas avant-gardiste ?
Mon dieu, j'espère que non.
Hey, cool, un lit escamotable.
Ouais, c'est un peu le bazar.
Je n'ai pas fait mon lit ce matin, alors...
Tu sais quoi, je parie que dormir selon
cette inclinaison est bon pour toi.
Pour certaines raisons.
Je le tiens.
Ça c'était, quelque chose, quelque chose,
je vais aller, quelque chose,
tu es comme, quelque chose, stupide.
Huh.
D'autres cultures.
Hey, ouvrons le panier de fruits.
Hey, qui a mangé tout le... ?
Okay, on doit sortir Lily
de cet appartement.
Son colocataire est un raton laveur.
Je lui aurais bien proposé
mon appartement, mais j'ai des chiens
et elle est allergique.
Des chiens ?
Je vis avec son ex petit-ami.
Je pense qu'elle est encore
un peu plus allergique à ça.
Pourquoi pas ton appartement, Barney ?
Je sais que tu l'entoures de mystère,
mais il doit bien y avoir un canapé.
La Forteresse de Barnitude ?
Pas moyen.
Allez. Elle est désespérée.
Normalement, les femmes que je ramène chez
moi doivent remplir une condition préalable,
mais... passons.
L'un de vous a beaucoup,
beaucoup de chance, parce que j'ai...
un tada...
un billet supplémentaire
pour le concert d'Alanis Morissette.
Qui est partant ?
- Sans façons.
- Non.
Merde ! J'ai eu ces billets
il y a des mois pour Lily et moi
et maintenant je n'arrive
à trouver personne pour venir avec moi.
C'est ça qu'il me manque
dans le fait d'être en couple.
J'avais toujours quelqu'un
pour aller aux concerts,
ou au marché,
ou aux brunchs.
Bon sang, les brunchs me manquent !
Eh bien, j'imagine que tu pourrais...
essayer d'aller aux brunchs tout seul.
Oh, tu crois que je n'ai pas essayé ?
Une table pour un.
Un couple ?
Heu... non, juste moi.
Vraiment ?
Pour un brunch ?
Vous avez raison.
De qui je me moque ?
Ooh, Le Popover Pantry.
C'est super cet endroit.
On peut aller prendre
un brunch demain ?
Bien sûr, mon coeur.
Je peux venir avec vous ?
Vraiment ? Pour un brunch ?
Bon sang,
je déteste être célibataire !
Okay, je prendrai le reste
sur le jeu de Pittsburgh.
Oh, et P. au S.,
je n'ai jamais touché mon pourcentage
de Seattle d'il y a deux semaines.
Ouais. Ne m'oblige pas à attirer
l'attention du Contrôle des Jeux sur toi.
Je suis sûr qu'ils seraient très intéressés
de savoir ce qui se passe là-bas.
D'accord ? D'accord ?
Okay, je t'aime aussi, maman.
Prends soin de toi.
Hello, Lily.
Tu es parvenue, on ne sait comment,
à contourner ma sécurité.
Comment as-tu fait ça ?
Ted m'a donné ton double de clé.
Le double de clé, brillant !
Je suis désolée, mais tu sais
que je ne serais venue ici
que si je n'avais pas d'autre choix.
Mais tout à l'heure,
je m'apprêtais à aller dormir et...
Sveikas. (coucou)
C'est terrible.
Bon, à plus.
Eh bien, peut-être
que je peux rester ici ?
Oh... je t'aurais bien laissée,
mais je n'ai pas de pièce.
Tu vis dans un appartement
qui a deux chambres.
Tu as une pièce
rien que pour tes costumes.
Hey, j'arrive à un stade de ma vie
où mes costumes sont ma famille.
Regarde autour de toi, Lily.
Tu es au coeur
du pays du vieux garçon,
et en tant que femme,
tu es une immigrante illégale ici.
Maintenant, tu peux essayer
de demander un visa de sexe,
mais il n'est valable que 12 heures.
14 si tu te qualifies
pour l'entrée multiple.
Eww... c'est quelque chose qu'une fille
coincée et jugementale dirait,
mais je dis donne-moi :
multiples tope-là.
Wow, tu es vraiment désespérée.
Vraiment.
Okay, tu peux rester ici deux jours.
Mais je n'ai qu'une règle.
Tu ne peux rien changer.
Pourquoi changerais-je
quoi que ce soit ? Cet endroit est...
...parfait.
En dépit du fait
que tu n'aies pas de télé.
Tu vois ce mur ?
Ecran plat 300 pouces.
Ils ne les vendent qu'au Japon,
mais je connais un type.
On a dû l'embarquer dans un remorqueur
comme ce satané King Kong.
Ça me brûle les yeux.
Ouais. C'est irréversible.
- Hey.
- Hey, où es-tu allé ?
Au concert d'Alanis Morissette.
Tout seul ?
Non, en fait, j'y suis allé
avec un ami de l'école de droit.
Oh, vraiment ? Quel ami ?
Brad.
Frérot, Alanis Morissette rocks !
Complètement !
Je n'en reviens pas
que j'aie failli ne pas venir ce soir.
Laisse-moi deviner :
Tu as acheté les billets pour toi et Lily
juste avant qu'elle te jette.
Ouais, comment tu le sais ?
Je viens de me faire jeter moi aussi.
Quoi, Kara a rompu avec toi ?
Je suis désolé, mec. Ça craint.
Brad, tu aimes les brunchs ?
Tu l'as invité pour le brunch ?
Ouais, je l'ai invité pour le brunch.
Pourquoi, c'est bizarre ?
Oui. C'est pour ça que j'ai fait genre :
"Tu l'as invité pour le brunch ?"
Pourquoi deux types qui sont amis
ne peuvent-ils pas aller prendre un brunch ?
Parce que le brunch c'est un peu...
Girly. (pour filles)
Girly ? Le petit déjeuner
n'est pas girly.
Le déjeuner n'est pas girly. Qu'est-ce
qui fait que le brunch soit girly ?
Je ne sais pas.
Il n'y a rien de girly dans un cheval.
Rien de girly dans une corne,
mais mets-les ensemble
et tu as une licorne.
Je n'en ai rien à faire
de ce que tu dis,
je vais au Popover Pantry avec Brad.
On est là. On a faim.
Faut t'y faire, brunch.
- Hmm... ça sent délicieusement bon.
- Merci
Il n'y avait rien à manger
dans le frigo, alors j'ai pris...
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Lily, quelle était
la première règle déjà ?
Ne rien changer.
Et quelle était la seconde règle ?
- Il n'y avait pas de seconde règle.
- Exactement !
Il n'y avait qu'une règle
et tu l'as transgressée.
J'ai acheté de l'épicerie.
Ça compte comme changer quelque chose ?
Lily, si je voulais
un frigo plein de courses,
ou du café frais le matin,
j'aurais une relation.
Mais je ne veux pas avoir de relation.
C'est pourquoi je rend très clair
à chaque fille qui franchit cette porte
que ce n'est pas un endroit
où laisser une brosse à dents.
Ce n'est pas un endroit où laisser
son nécessaire à lentilles de contact.
C'est un endroit à quitter.
Viens, je te fais visiter.
Heu... pas de flash, s'il te plaît.
Bienvenido dans la chambre.
Note ça : immense lit,
couverture normale, un oreiller.
Tout dans ce lit dit :
"notre travail est effectué."
Ensuite on dit :
"bienvenue" dans la salle de bains.
Quoi, une seule serviette ?
Quoi, pas de sèche-cheveux ?
Tu sais où je range ces trucs ?
Chez toi. Dégage.
Et le coup de grâce...
Ouais, c'est bien ça.
Brevet imminent.
Et wilkommen dans l'entrée.
Alors que des types comme Ted
et Marshall doivent cacher leurs pornos...
Marshall n'a pas de films pornos.
Aww, c'est mignon.
Alors que des types comme Ted
et Marshall doivent cacher leurs pornos,
j'ai le mien...
avec éclairage professionnel.
Les filles voient ça, elles ne peuvent
pas sortir d'ici assez vite.
Et si ça ne les emmène
pas assez loin,
il y a toujours ton storm-trooper
grandeur nature.
Non, ça c'est formidable.
Donc tu vois, chaque fois
qu'une fille se réveille ici,
je n'ai jamais à lui dire
d'aller bâtir son nid ailleurs.
Mon appartement le fait pour moi.
Mon dieu, j'adore les brunchs.
Oh, bon sang...
le pain aux courgettes
est excellentissime.
Ce n'est pas bizarre, n'est-ce pas ?
J'ai tendance à penser
que ça pourrait l'être,
mais ça ne l'est pas du tout.
Et d'ailleurs, tu n'as pas du tout
survanté les oeufs bénédicte.
Pas vrai ?
Pas vrai ?
Je veux dire, pourquoi deux potes
célibataires ne pourraient-ils pas sortir
et se faire un brunch
style Dimanche matin ?
Exactement. Merci,
c'est exactement ce que j'ai dit.
Ça doit être le destin.
De quoi tu parles ?
J'ai deux billets pour Mamma Mia
vendredi soir.
Tu aimes Abba, pas vrai ?
Qu'est-ce que je raconte ?
Qui n'aime pas ?
Quoi qu'il en soit, j'allais emmener Kara,
mais maintenant c'est toi et moi.
On va se faire Broadway, style potes.
Qu'est-ce que tu en dis ?
Ouais !
Hey. Le froid t'a réveillée ?
Non, j'étais juste en train
de te regarder dormir.
Oh, tu as essayé de prendre une douche ?
Désolé, je n'ai qu'une serviette propre.
Je n'adhère pas au mythe selon lequel
on doit se doucher tous les jours.
Okay.
Je t'aurais bien proposé du café,
mais je n'en ai pas, alors tu vas devoir...
Je boycotte le café.
Ça revient au même que de boire
les larmes d'un paysan Colombien.
Mon dieu, j'adore cet endroit.
C'est une bonne chose
que je n'aie pas de travail
parce que je pourrais rester
ici toute la journée.
Je pense avoir laissé
quelque chose sur l'étagère.
Whoops. Oh, non, oh, regarde.
Oh, je suis répugnant.
Wow, tu es ouvert sur ta sexualité
et c'est l'une des raisons
pour lesquelles je t'aime.
Est-ce que je viens de dire ça ?
Oh, eh bien, le secret est révélé.
Je t'aime.
Whoa, heu... Okay, beep, beep.
Marche arrière, heu...
Salut, Barney.
Oh...
Oh, mon dieu. Tu es marié ?
C'est ta femme ?
Quoi ? Non.
Oui !
- Oui ?
- Oui.
Fils de pute !
Je n'en reviens pas que je t'aie laissé
entrer dans mon temple sacré.
Allez, bébé. S'il te plaît, non.
Oh, tu ne comprends pas.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ? C'est le pire.
Comment pourrais-tu... ?
Tu ne vas nulle part.
Wow, j'ai eu chaud.
Cette poulette hippie
n'allait pas partir.
Elle était prête à squatter ici.
Elle aurait dû faire avec ton siège
de toilettes à ressort, n'est-ce pas ?
Elle était incroyablement immunisée
contre tout dans mon appartement...
sauf toi.
Tu es meilleure que le porno.
Merci.
Ça te dirait de prolonger
ton séjour ici ?
Tout ce que tu auras à faire
c'est prétendre être ma femme,
et décourager les occasionnelles
visites d'une nuit.
Je sais, je sais. Tu as une éthique.
Tu as tes principes...
Je vais le faire.
Vraiment ?
Barney, tu as clairement
de sérieux problèmes de mère
qui t'ont laissé l'équivalent
émotionnel d'un rat d'égout.
Mais dans mon autre appartement,
je devrais vivre
avec un réel rat d'égout,
alors tu gagnes.
Je prends.
- Mamma Mia ?
- Mamma Mia.
Vous savez, c'est censé être
une super comédie musicale, okay ?
Elle a gagné des tas de Tonys
et autres awards.
Oh parfaitement.
On dirait que ça va être
un troisième rancart
vraiment très marrant et excitant.
Ooh, troisième rancart.
Tu sais ce que ça veut dire.
Ce n'est pas un rancart, okay ?
Ce sont juste deux potes
qui vont voir un show de Broadway.
Vous comptez
aller dîner avant ?
Il se pourrait
qu'on avale un steak, ouais.
Où ça ?
Au Café L'Amour.
Brad dit que la nourriture
y est vraiment bonne, okay ?
On dirait que Brad
a bien planifié la soirée.
Tu ferais bien
de sortir le grand jeu.
Ça veut dire :
pas de culotte de grand-mère.
Bien, vous savez quoi ?
Vous vous sentez juste menacés
parce que je suis un mec célibataire
qui empiète sur vos trucs de couple.
Bien devinez quoi ?
C'est mon territoire maintenant.
Je pisse sur les brunchs,
les dîners et les comédies musicales.
C'est exact ; Brad et moi,
on reprend Broadway.
Que vas-tu porter ?
Je pensais à
cette chemise à col et ce...
Oh, vous savez quoi ?
Allez vous faire voir.
Peux-tu me passer
la section Arts et Loisirs ?
Peux-tu me passer
la section Arts et Loisirs ?
Je viens de le faire
Chéri, je...
Barney,
qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ?
Lily, je peux tout expliquer...
Comment as-tu pu ?
Dans notre propre maison ?
Espèce de salaud !
- Je suis désolée, je ne savais pas...
- Dégagez !
C'est ce que je récolte après avoir fait
du strip-tease pendant 4 ans
pour te payer
tes études de médecine ?
Je me suis fait poser
des implants mammaires pour toi.
Je... j'étais sur le point
de laisser couler les larmes.
Brava.
C'était incroyable.
Et cette gifle était géniale.
Tu ne t'es pas retenue.
Ouais, j'ai toujours voulu faire ça.
D'accord.
Je dois dire...
que c'est plutôt sympa
d'avoir à manger ici, pour changer.
Tu sais...
nan, laisse tomber.
Quoi ?
Tu es ma femme.
Tu peux tout me dire.
Eh bien, si tu voulais vraiment
faire fonctionner ce subterfuge,
on devrait essayer
de rendre cet appart un peu plus...
tu sais, accueillant.
Comme si une femme
vivait vraiment ici.
Qu'as-tu en tête ?
# Bones, bones, brittle little bones #
# It's not the milk you seek #
# It's the sun you need #
# Sugar dumpling, muffin baby #
# This world is going crazy #
# Do do do do #
# Do do do do #
# Do do do do do #
Hey, tu es là.
Je ne pensais pas
qu'on te verrait avant demain.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ce n'était pas un rancart.
Okay, c'était un rancart
et c'est devenu très bizarre.
Oh, tu n'as vraiment pas
besoin de faire ça.
Non, j'insiste.
Tu es mon invité.
Merci, Brad.
Mon pote,
tu as du chocolat
sur ton menton.
C'est encore là.
Je vais m'occuper de ce garnement.
Whoa.
Eh bien,
ça aurait pu être pire.
Il aurait pu tomber
sur tes genoux.
Ça empire.
Non, je peux le faire, Brad.
Okay, merci.
Et au fait... c'est ce samedi.
Tu veux venir ?
Tu veux que je t'accompagne
à un mariage ?
Okay, ce n'est pas si grave.
Deux mecs célibataires qui partent en
chasse. Ce sera comme dans "Serial Noceurs".
Tiens juste Brad éloigné du bouquet.
Ça empire.
Ça s'améliore encore.
Le feuillage dans le Vermont
à cette période de l'année est sublime.
Dans le Vermont ?
Ouais, le mariage se déroule
dans ce magnifique B&B.
Kara et moi, on y allait.
Bref, il restait une chambre,
et on l'a eue.
La suite Walt Whitman, mon pote.
Tu as dit non, n'est-ce pas ?
Bien sûr.
Je comprends.
C'est cool.
Ce sera la première fois
que je verrai mes amis de la fac
depuis que Kara m'a quitté.
C'est juste...
C'est juste
qu'elle me manque tellement.
Je vais t'accompagner
dans le Vermont.
C'est génial !
Ils ont déposé une liste de mariage
chez Pottery Barn.
Je me suis dit qu'on pourrait faire
moitié-moitié pour une saucière.
Je suis désolé.
Ce n'est plus drôle.
Foutu brunch !
Ce type est dingue, pas vrai ?
Ecoute, je ne pense pas
qu'il soit dingue.
Je pense juste qu'il souffre
d'un sévère manque de petite-amie.
Et malheureusement,
tu es son patch anti-tabac.
Et maintenant, tu dois faire ce que
chaque couple à problèmes doit faire :
rompre.
Tu as raison.
J'ai promis à Brad
que j'irai avec lui au mariage,
et puis c'est tout.
Bien.
Oh, je crois qu'on a pris
la bonne décision
en choisissant les draps italiens
faits sur commande.
Eh, si mon lit doit se parer,
il doit le faire correctement.
Tu veux essayer ?
Bon, je vais y aller,
faire le tour des bars.
Que vas-tu faire ce soir ?
Oh j'allais juste regarder Letterman,
mais bon dieu que ce lit est confortable.
Si seulement tu avais la télé ici.
Okay, sérieusement,
qu'est-ce que tu fais dans la vie ?
Je t'en prie.
Je croyais que tu sortais.
Eh.
Après le monologue.
Le lendemain matin,
comme le soleil se levait sur Manhattan,
votre oncle Marshall se dirigeait
vers l'appartement de Brad
pour se rendre au mariage
dans le Vermont.
Mais quand il arriva là-bas...
Non.
Non...
Non.
Non !
Non !
Ted.
Um, Brad m'a acheté des fleurs.
Attends.
Brad lui a acheté des fleurs.
Je suis désolé.
C'est à nouveau devenu marrant.
- Oh, hey...
- Non, Brad, je ne veux rien entendre.
Je t'apprécie.
Et les callas sont mes fleurs préférées.
Je ne sais pas comment tu as appris ça.
J'imagine que tu me cernes bien,
mais ce n'est pas cool, mec.
Je n'arrive pas à croire que tu...
- Hey, chéri.
- Hey.
- Hey, Marshall.
- Salut, Kara.
Alors vous êtes
à nouveau ensemble ?
Ouais. C'est arrivé hier soir.
Uh, je suis désolé, mon pote.
- J'aurais dû t'appeler.
- Ouais, tu aurais dû.
- Je ne voulais pas te blesser...
- Arrête, Brad.
Arrête.
# There was something in the air that night #
# The stars went bright #
Oh, qu'est-ce qui lui a pris ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je crois
qu'il est amoureux de moi.
# Fernando #
J'arrive pas à croire qu'on...
que toi et moi...
- Qu'avons-nous fait ?
- Rien.
Rien ne s'est passé.
On s'est juste endormis.
On s'est endormis ? Je ne m'endors pas
dans le même lit qu'une femme
sans rien tenter.
Comment... Toi.
Tu m'as fait des mamours
contre ma volonté.
Eh, il faut être à deux
pour faire des câlins.
On...
On...
On a redécoré mon appartement.
On n'est pas sortis un vendredi soir
pour regarder Letterman,
et on a dormi ensemble
et on n'a pas couché ensemble ?
Oh mon dieu,
on est dans une relation.
C'est ce que tu penses
être une relation ?
Tu devais être le vaccin,
mais tu m'as donné la maladie.
Il faut que tu partes.
Barney.
Je ne crois pas que tu sois fâché
après moi. Tu es fâché après toi.
Tu as laissé tomber ta garde,
et laissé quelqu'un entrer dans ta vie,
et en fait, c'était bien.
Et ça te terrifie.
Uh-huh. Il faut que tu partes.
Eh, tu ne peux pas simplement me virer !
J'ai fait beaucoup de choses dans cet appart,
et je me suis habituée
à un certain niveau de vie.
Un certain niveau de vie ?
Tu n'as pas payé un seul...
Et ainsi, Mr. et Mrs. Stinson,
après deux semaines de mariage,
ont décidé d'y mettre un terme.
Heureusement,
ils sont arrivés à un accord.
Et voilà comment tante Lily
a meublé son appartement.
Marshall tomba à nouveau sur Brad
quelque temps plus tard.
Oh mon dieu, c'est Brad.
Rigole comme si j'avais dit
quelque chose de vraiment drôle.
C'est ça, c'est ça.
Hey, Marshall.
Oh, hey, hey, comment ça va ?
Ça va bien.
- Hey, je...
- Ouais, je sais qui tu es.
Bien, je dois y aller.
J'ai un truc à faire.
Ouais, moi aussi,
mais plus important.
Donc je suppose que
je te reverrai dans les parages.
Bien sûr. Bien sûr.
Même si tu ne trouves pas,
dis-moi qu'il a l'air gros.
Il a vraiment l'air gros.

Les enfants, quand vous atteindrez votre
20ème année, vous pourriez être surpris
de découvrir que vous n'avez pas encore
la vie que vous imaginiez.
Comme Tante Lily.
Bien qu'elle soit revenue
de San Francisco,
elle continuait de se chercher.
C'est juste que tout ce que j'ai jamais
fait, c'est enseigner au jardin d'enfants.
Je veux sortir de là
et changer le monde.
Je veux trouver ma passion.
Et elle l'a trouvée.
Je vais être life coach.
En fait, elle l'a trouvée
encore et encore.
Je vais être biologiste marine.
...poète slam.
...apicultrice !
Pas apicultrice.
Le tout nouveau rêve de sa vie ?
Chanter dans un groupe punk rock.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait
pour l'argent en attendant ?
Oh, elle est serveuse
au Big Wave Luau.
Attends, tu veux dire
ce restaurant Hawaïen
où ils portent
ces tenues embarrassantes ?
Non.
La voilà.
La voilà.
Bienvenue au Big Wave Luau.
Puis-je prendre votre commande de boissons ?
Merde.
Désolée.
Oh, salut, Lily.
On passait juste dans le coin,
et on a pensé déjeuner.
On ne savait même pas que tu serais là.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
Oh, je ne pense pas que ça soit
comme ça que tu es censée accueillir
un client au Big Wave Luau.
Aloha, visiteurs de l'île.
La grande vague
vous a menés à notre humble luau.
Nous vous en remercions.
Ou dans ma langue maternelle, mahalo.
Je n'ai pas saisi ton nom.
Vous avez saisi son nom vous autres ?
Non.
Mon nom est Anuhea.
Ça veut dire fraîche et parfumée,
tout comme chacune
de nos 12 spécialités de boissons.
Robin, rien à ajouter ?
Non. Lily est mon amie
et je ne vais pas me moquer d'elle
parce qu'elle essaye
de réaliser ses rêves.
Merci.
Mais tu pourrais sortir
le grand tambour hawaïen
parce que je suis pratiquement sûre
qu'aujourd'hui, c'est mon anniversaire.
C'est son anniversaire !
Je n'ai jamais eu autant
besoin de bière que maintenant.
J'ai cru que tu avais dit que
ton semestre allait être du gâteau.
Je m'en souviens parce
qu'on mangeait du gâteau à ce moment-là
et tu as dit :
"Mec, mon semestre va ressembler à ça."
Ouais, eh bien,
ça devait être le cas,
mais je n'ai jamais vu
un professeur noter aussi sévèrement.
Elle a traversé
un mauvais divorce cet été
et maintenant,
elle se défoule sur nous.
Pour vous dire la vérité, je crois
qu'elle a juste besoin de s'envoyer en l'air.
Vraiment ?
S'envoyer en l'air, tu dis ?
Elle ne t'intéresserait pas.
Elle a presque 50 ans.
Elle est sexy ?
Ouais, je suppose
qu'elle est plutôt sexy, ouais.
Et elle recherche de l'action.
Elle m'a tout l'air
d'être une panthère.
- Une quoi ?
- Une panthère.
Une femme plus âgée,
habituellement dans les 40 ou 50 ans,
célibataire et à la recherche
d'un homme plus jeune.
Et qu'est une femme
dans les 60 ou 70 ans ? Une tortue ?
Marshall, j'y ai réfléchi
et j'accepte ton défi.
- Je ne t'ai pas défié de coucher...
- Demain, la chasse à la panthère commence.
Voilà, j'ai démissionné.
Je ne pouvais vraiment pas
en supporter davantage.
Environ 50 fois par jour,
des types me demandaient un collier...
Classique.
Ted, tu ne m'as pas dit qu'ils avaient
besoin d'une assistante à ton bureau ?
Ouais.
Quelqu'un vient de démissionner.
Alors, on mange où aujourd'hui ?
Oh, génial, tu as apporté
à manger pour tout le monde ?
Mec, c'était vraiment cruel.
C'était une erreur facile.
Ecoutez, quand quelqu'un ouvre
un tupperware avec un poulet entier,
on est en droit de supposer
qu'elle a fait à manger pour tout le monde.
Ted, cette fille n'a pas démissionné.
Tu l'as détruite.
C'était un poulet entier.
Et j'ai précisé
qu'elle avait 12 côtés ?
Oh, maintenant tu vas t'en prends
à son physique ? Très classe, Ted.
Alors Lily, qu'est-ce que tu en dis ?
Tu veux ce boulot ?
Je devrais faire quoi ?
En gros, tu es une sorte
d'assistante de direction.
Tu seras là.
Mon bureau se trouve là-bas.
Et c'est un peu
la folie en ce moment
parce qu'on soumet
un nouveau bâtiment à un gros client.
- Oh, c'est vrai, c'est le...
- Ouais.
Voilà la maquette.
Tu ne plaisantais pas.
On dirait vraiment un pénis géant.
Je sais.
Pour d'obscures raisons,
Mr. Druthers ne le voit pas.
Comment ne peut-il ne pas le voir ?
- Je veux dire, il y a le...
- Je sais.
- Et la façon dont...
- Je sais.
- Et les deux petites...
- Je sais.
- Wow, c'est tellement...
- Spectaculaire ?
B'en merci.
Lily, voici Mr. Druthers,
l'architecte en charge du projet.
Lily sera notre nouvelle
assistante de direction.
- Ah.
- Ravie de vous rencontrer.
N'est-ce pas ?
Ted, j'ai regardé votre plan
pour le balcon du dernier étage.
Dites-moi,
voulez-vous devenir architecte ?
Je... je suis architecte.
Vraiment ?
Mon neveu de 6 ans
joue avec des Legos.
Est-il architecte ?
Il ne l'est que
s'il n'a pas réussi tous ses examens.
Ted, vous êtes prometteur.
Mais il faut que vous étudiiez
plus attentivement ce que je fais.
Je veux que vous fabriquiez
des arbres en polystyrène
pour la maquette du bâtiment.
- Vous pensez pouvoir gérer ça ?
- Absolutement.
Bien. Alors
vous allez fabriquer des...
- Arbres en polystyrène.
- Encore une fois, avec de l'émotion.
- Des arbres en polystyrène.
- Des arbres en polystyrène !
- Des arbres en polystyrène!
- Voilà l'esprit.
Maintenant, approchez-vous.
Il ne s'agit pas seulement d'arbres,
Ted. Il s'agit de la vie.
Et parfois dans la vie,
il faut bien réussir les arbres
ou on est viré.
Bon sang, ce type est un vrai...
Okay, attends, attends.
Voilà le bureau du Professeur Lewis.
Okay, jetons-y un oeil.
Oh, ouais,
c'est une magnifique panthère.
Un specimen de premier choix.
Tu vois, on peut identifier une panthère
grâce à quelques caractéristiques clés.
Commençons par les cheveux.
La panthère suit
les coupes de cheveux actuelles
en guise de camouflage.
La proie peut ne pas se rendre compte
qu'elle est attaquée par une panthère
jusqu'à ce qu'elle se fasse
traîner, impuissante,
jusqu'à sa tanière.
Maintenant, le chemisier.
La panthère laisse voir
un décolleté plongeant
pour captiver sa proie.
Si tu les vois s'agiter,
c'est qu'elle est
sur le point d'attaquer.
Tu vois les griffes ?
Longues et acérées,
pour écarter
toutes les femelles rivales...
ou ouvrir
les chèques alimentaires.
Ouais, c'est une vraie merveille.
Okay, que la chasse commence.
Attends, attends.
Je ne suis pas sûr d'être à l'aise
de te voir pourchasser mon professeur
de loi constitutionnelle.
Qui préfères-tu
qui te corriges tes devoirs ?
Un chat sauvage
mangeur d'hommes,
ou un chaton satisfait
qui ronronne ?
Vas-y, Barney.
Va monter cette panthère.
Scusi, je suis Luigi,
un étudiant italien.
Je me... rendais dans ma classe,
mais je vous ai vue...
bella principessa...
Dites-moi ce que vous voulez
ou sortez d'ici.
Directe.
J'aime ça.
Le nom est Barney.
Ce que je veux...
c'est vous.
Tournez-vous.
Mon appart.
Dans deux heures.
Ne soyez pas en retard.
Je n'arrive pas à croire
comment Mr. Druthers traite les gens.
Et ce bâtiment ?
Parlons de surcompensation.
D'habitude,
il n'est pas si terrible.
C'est juste que les associés
nous ont clairement fait comprendre
que ce projet sera
notre succès ou notre ruine,
alors dernièrement,
il a été un peu irritable. (testy)
Vous voyez ce que
je veux dire... querelleux.
Je dis juste que
ça a été dur pour lui.
Bon, arrêtez.
- Tu as montré tes plans à Lily ?
- Non.
- Quels plans ?
- C'est rien.
C'est fantastique.
Juste pour s'amuser,
Ted a travaillé sur ses propres plans.
Et ça ne ressemble pas du tout
aux organes génitaux masculins.
En tout cas,
pas des organes en bonne santé.
Ted, tu devrais soumettre
ton bâtiment à Druthers.
Tu plaisantes ?
C'est Hammond Druthers.
C'est une légende.
Je fais juste partie de son équipe.
Ce bâtiment est énorme
pour l'entreprise,
alors c'est vraiment important
de ne pas tout foutre en l'air.
C'est bon, ça suffit.
Oh mon dieu...
Incroyable.
Hmm... C-.
C- ?
De quoi tu parles ?
J'ai tenu toute la nuit !
Tu n'as pas bien budgété ton temps,
tu as juste survolé certains
des points les plus importants,
et tes performances orales étaient bâclées
et peu concluantes.
Mr. Druthers a démandé
si tu faisais les arbres
ou si tu attendais
qu'ils poussent tout seuls.
Ensuite il m'a fixée
jusqu'à ce que je rie.
Okay, j'ai fini.
Super. Je vais ranger la peinture.
Va lui montrer.
Génial. Merci.
Eh bien, enfin.
Je me demandais
si vous faisiez les arbres
ou si vous attendiez
qu'ils poussent tout seuls.
Elle est bonne, monsieur.
Quoi qu'il en soit, les voilà.
- Trop verts.
- Trop verts ?
Oui, les feuilles devraient plus tendre
vers une teinte marron naturelle.
Presque brune.
Et pensez plus touffu.
Je veux que cette tour s'élève
d'un bosquet de buissons sauvages,
indisciplinés, bruns.
Pouvez-vous l'imaginer, Ted ?
Je ne peux pas ne pas l'imaginer.
Bien.
Oh, mon dieu.
Elle a disparu !
Quoi ?
Qu'est-ce qui a disparu ?
Ma balle de base-ball
signée trois fois par Pete Rose.
Eh bien, elle doit être quelque part
dans le coin.
Qu'en pensez-vous, Ted,
elle est juste sortie toute seule de sa boîte
en plastique et s'est mise à rouler ?
Quelqu'un l'a volée.
Eh bien, je ferais mieux de retourner
à ces arbres en polystyrène.
Oh, qui se préoccupe des arbres ?
C'est juste une occupation pour
vous donner l'impression de contribuer.
Stimulant comme toujours, monsieur.
Lily ?
Où a t'elle mis ces peintures ?
Hey.
Hey. Lily, j'ai une question.
Pourquoi ai-je trouvé la balle
de base-ball de Mr. Druthers
signée trois fois par Pete Rose
dans le tiroir de ton bureau ?
C'est facile.
Je l'ai prise.
Pourquoi ?
C'est simple.
Je n'en reviens pas qu'il n'y ait pas
de raifort pour le rôti.
J'imagine que vous étiez malade le jour où
ils ont enseigné ça à l'Université de Sandwich.
Mère, personne ne te vole
à la maison de repos.
Je ne t'ai pas offert
de cadeau d'anniversaire.
Quoi ?
Tu vas pleurer ?
Le petit pleurnichard va pleurer ?
Hey, tout le monde, regardez !
Le petit pleurnichard va pleurer !
J'ai perdu ma glace !
Okay, j'ai peut-être exagéré cette fois,
mais le fait est qu'il a été méchant.
Et c'est pourquoi j'ai pris sa balle.
Qu'est-ce que sa balle vient
faire là-dedans ?
On doit apprendre à Druthers
qu'il ne peut pas se comporter comme ça.
Quand j'enseignais au jardin d'enfants,
chaque fois qu'un enfant était méchant,
je confisquais l'un de ses jouets.
L'enfant commençait par être furieux,
mais ensuite il apprenait
à arrêter d'être méchant.
Hey. Que se passe t'il ?
Lily a volé la balle de base-ball de mon patron
signée trois fois par Pete Rose.
Pourquoi ?
Il a été méchant ?
- Tu es au courant de ça ?
- Ouais.
C'est son idée personnelle
de la justice.
Tu lui as parlé de cette fois chez Gap ?
Oh, elle était bonne.
Ce vendeur était grossier avec Robin,
alors j'ai pris un treillis.
Je te l'ai offert pour ton anniversaire.
Alors je me balade avec un treillis volé ?
Je préfère l'appeler
le "treillis de la justice".
Ce n'est pas de la justice.
C'est du vol à l'étalage et c'est un délit.
Comme la méchanceté.
Lily, ton petit système
n'a absolument aucun sens.
A la maternelle,
l'enfant savait pourquoi il était puni.
Druthers pense juste
que quelqu'un a volé sa balle.
C'est pour ça que j'ai laissé un mot.
- Un mot ?
- Ouais.
Quand il le trouvera, il comprendra
pourquoi sa balle a été confisquée,
il arrêtera d'être méchant,
et le bureau sera un endroit
plus agréable pour travailler.
Peut-être qu'il sera même ouvert
à entendre tes idées.
Ecoute, Lil, on tolère tous
cette dépression nerveuse prolongée
qui t'atteint de toute évidence,
avec le groupe punk et l'apiculture
et le petit larcin,
mais c'est ma carrière
que tu fiches en l'air.
Je ne suis pas sûre d'aimer ce ton.
Tu sais quoi ?
Maintenant tu viens de perdre la balle.
Hey.
Je te demanderais bien comment
s'est passée la nuit dernière,
mais on a eu un QCM aujourd'hui.
Personne n'a eu plus de C-.
Je sais, je sais.
Tu prétends baiser tellement.
Je présumais que tu étais bon.
Ecoute, j'ai fait un mauvais calcul.
Je pensais qu'elle serait vieille et fragile,
comme la plupart des panthères.
Mais le chaton avait des griffes.
Mais ne t'en fais pas.
Ce soir, je la revois.
Laisse tomber, mec.
Tu empires les choses.
Je te le promets, après ce soir,
cette panthère sera mon animal de compagnie,
et moi son maître.
Je pense que je tombe amoureux de toi.
Oh, mon dieu. Ce n'était pas
ta première fois, n'est-ce pas ?
Encore que ça expliquerait
bien des choses.
Quoi ? Non.
On a fait l'amour hier.
Oh, c'est vrai. Ça.
Eh bien, tu as fait l'amour hier.
J'ai revu mon programme
pour le prochain semestre.
Quand Druthers ira chercher son bagel,
Je vais entrer, prendre le mot,
remettre la balle.
Si quelque chose tourne mal,
crie : "Qui veut un expresso ?"
comme ça je saurai qu'il arrive.
Pigé ?
Okay, maintenant donne-moi la balle.
- Non.
- Que veux-tu dire par non ?
Je veux dire que je maintiens
ce que j'ai fait, Ted.
Allez, Lily.
On manque de temps.
Que tout le monde
vienne ici maintenant !
Qui veut un expresso ?
Comme la plupart
d'entre vous le savent,
ma balle de base-ball Pete Rose,
Pete Rose, Pete Rose a été volée.
Et je viens de trouver ce mot.
"Cher Mr. Druthers, moi,
votre balle de base-ball, je m'en vais.
Peut-être que si vous commencez
à être gentil, je reviendrai.
Sinon, d'autres objets de votre bureau
pourraient suivre mon exemple.
En fait, j'ai entendu
votre iPod parler,
et il se pourrait qu'il s'en aille
d'une minute à l'autre."
Normalement, je crierais sur tout le
monde jusqu'à ce que ma voix s'éraille,
mais peut-être que c'est
la mauvaise attitude à adopter ici.
Intéressant.
A la place, je vais donner
à ma balle de base-ball jusqu'à ce soir
pour décider qu'elle est nostalgique,
ou demain matin, je virerai
3 personnes toutes les heures.
Et si le voleur
ne me croit pas, eh bien...
alors vous flambez plus
que Peter Rose,
leader absolu
de la ligne de baseball,
un homme dont l'absence parmi
la galerie des célébrités est une farce
du monde du sport...
toujours "prétendument" !
Wow. On dirait que ça va être
bye-bye iPod.
Rends-lui sa balle tout de suite.
Des gens vont se faire virer.
Non. C'est juste une colère, Ted.
J'ai vu ça à la maternelle
tout le temps.
Ce n'est pas la maternelle.
Mr. Druthers est un adulte,
et il veut récupérer sa balle.
Bien, je la lui rendrai
si tu lui montres tes plans.
Non, tu vas la lui rendre
ou tu es virée.
Je suis désolée, Ted.
Je ne peux pas faire ça.
Alors tu es virée.
Bien.
Voilà la balle.
Au moins maintenant,
tu en as une.
Mec, tu me tues.
Tu n'as pas apprivoisé la panthère.
Tu l'as juste encore plus énervée.
Tu ne vois pas
la barre de céréales dans ma main ?
Je me ravitaille.
Alors tu vas y retourner ?
Oh, ouais.
Et ce soir, tout comme
John Mellencamp,
je vais me débarrasser
de cette "panthère" une fois pour toutes.
Pigé ?
Parce que c'est
ce qu'il a fait avec son nom.
Je ne peux m'empêcher
de penser à toi.
S'il te plaît,
donne-moi une autre chance.
Barney,
j'enseigne toute la journée.
C'est la dernière chose
dont j'ai envie en rentrant chez moi.
Mais tu ne comprends pas. Tu vois,
j'y suis allé doucement avec toi,
je me suis retenu, parce que
j'avais peur de te casser une hanche.
Mais cette fois-ci, aucune pitié.
Je me fiche du temps que ça prendra :
des jours, des semaines,
la moitié d'une année.
Bien. Entre.
Tu pourras commencer pendant
que je termine de noter mes copies.
Dépêchez-vous. Les clients
seront là d'un moment à l'autre.
Glissez-le plus près de sa chaise.
Je veux que cette chose
lui claque en plein visage.
Mr. Druthers, encore merci
de votre compréhension envers Lily.
Oh. Eh bien, je la plains.
Voler dans mon bureau,
puis écrire cette note calomnieuse...
Vous pourriez dire que
Lily était mentalement dérangée.
Vous pourriez le dire, Ted.
Lily était mentalement dérangée.
Vous pourriez le dire suffisamment fort
pour que tout le monde l'entende.
Lily était mentalement dérangée !
Oh ! C'est un peu dur,
vous ne trouvez pas, Ted ?
Les clients sont là.
Excellent.
Faites-les entrer.
Notre client était une importante banque
et une compagnie financière de Spokane.
Ils voulaient un gratte-ciel moderne
qui garde quand même
la saveur particulière
et l'histoire du nord-ouest.
Mesdames et messieurs, voici
le bâtiment de
la Banque Nationale de Spokane.
C'est un pénis !
C'est... c'est ridicule.
Pas moyen que cette majestueuse
tour puisse être confondue
avec l'organe masculin de l'amour.
On ne va pas construire un pénis.
Vous avez d'autres idées ?
D'autres idées ?
Vous avez dit que
vous vouliez du Hammond Druthers.
Ceci est du Hammond Druthers.
Eh bien,
chapeau bas à vos compagnes,
mais je ne vais pas construire ça.
On en a terminé ici.
La trajectoire de toute ma carrière
aurait pu être différente
si je n'avais pas inconsciemment porté
mon treillis de la justice ce jour-là.
Attendez !
On a une autre idée pour vous.
Ted, que faites-vous ?
J'ai un autre plan.
Asseyez-vous,
et taisez-vous tout de suite.
Non.
# Thank you for the invitation #
# She showed me very nice... #
A Ted ! La personne la plus jeune
à jamais avoir dessiné un bâtiment
de plus de 70 étages.
Probablement !
Probablement !
Félicitations, Ted.
Hey, merci de m'avoir dit
de tenir tête à Druthers
et de soumettre mon idée.
Sérieusement, rien de tout cela
ne serait arrivé sans toi.
Oh. Tu sais quoi, Ted ?
C'était vraiment gentil.
Tu as mérité de récupérer ces vis.
Ne t'assieds pas sur ton fauteuil
avant de les avoir remises.
Hey, je suis chef de projet
maintenant,
alors si tu veux récupérer
ton ancien travail...
Non merci.
Je crois que j'ai trouvé ce que
je veux être quand je serai grande.
Casey, ce n'est pas comme ça
qu'on traite les gens.
Tu le récupèreras quand
tu auras appris à être gentil.
- Barney ! Oh mon dieu !
- Que s'est-il passé ?
Il s'est cassé la hanche.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Elle est juste temporairement démise.
Sérieusement, je vais bien.
Non, il ne va pas bien.
Professeur Lewis, bonsoir.
Mr. Eriksen. Hello.
J'ai noté votre devoir ce soir.
J'ai été agréablement surprise.
Ouais.
B +.
B + ?!
Marshall, lorsque j'aurai fait
mes 8 semaines de rééducation,
j'irai t'avoir ce "A" !
Laisse-la partir.
Elle mérite d'être à l'état sauvage.
Tu devrais être fier.
Tu as combattu la panthère
et tu as survécu.
C'était un safari extraordinaire.
J'ai hâte de vous montrer les diapos.

- Alors, j'imagine que c'est réglé.
- Yup.
Traîner dans un café
est loin d'être aussi drôle
que traîner dans un bar.
Mec, qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Quoi ?
Cette mignonne serveuse a dessiné
un coeur à côté de ton nom.
Quelqu'un a craqué pour toi.
Quelqu'un pense que tu es moi.
Tu penses vraiment
qu'elle m'aime bien ?
Je veux dire, j'imagine que
ça n'a rien de surprenant.
Chaque fois que je viens ici,
je la fais littéralement éclater de rire.
Marshall, voici votre lait potiron.
Wow. Comment avez-vous fait rentrer
un potiron dans cette petite tasse ?
Je voudrais un lait potiron.
Comment ont-ils fait rentrer un potiron
dans ces petites tasses, déjà ?
Quoi ?
Vous avez un rayon réducteur là derrière ?
Ouais.
Hey, vous vous souvenez
de cette fois où j'ai dit ce truc
sur comment ils ont fait rentrer
un potiron dans cette petite tasse ?
- Quelle fois ?
- La première fois.
Ouais.
C'était vraiment drôle.
C'est vrai.
D'accord, elle n'a pu rire
de ça que pour deux raisons.
Une, c'est la première blague
qu'elle ait jamais entendue,
ou deux, elle t'aime bien.
Tu devrais l'inviter à sortir.
Tu crois ?
Ouais, c'est pour ça que tu n'est pas
retourné avec Lily, pas vrai ?
Pour pouvoir ressentir
ce que ça fait d'être célibataire.
Eh bien, et si le coeur
ne veut rien dire ?
Et si elle en dessine
sur toutes les tasses ?
La mienne dit "Ted", pas de coeur.
La mienne dit... "Swarley".
Comment obtiennent-ils "Swarley"
à partir de "Barney" ?
Ce n'est même pas un nom.
Qui s'appellerait "Swarley", déjà ?
Oh, ne commencez pas à m'appeler
"Swarley", s'il vous plaît.
Ça n'arriverait jamais dans un bar !
Houlà !
Qu'est-ce qui se passe avec Swarley ?
Je sais. On ne voit presque jamais
ce vieux Swarlz s'emporter comme ça.
Hey, devine quoi ?
Oh, désolé.
Ce n'est que ma mère.
Elle divague, comme d'habitude.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Marshall a invité une fille à sortir.
Wow.
Bah, en tout cas,
c'est de la faute de papa.
Ça va l'occuper un moment.
Oh, bien sûr, tu sais,
il a été un peu aidé.
Swarley l'a présenté ?
Oh, bien.
Tu as eu mon texto.
- Ouais.
- Oh. Non, c'était moi.
J'ai donné l'un de mes secrets
à Marshall.
- Alors, elle dit quoi ?
- Rien.
Je ne pense pas qu'elle m'ait entendu.
Ça se bouscule par là.
Quoi ?
Tu lui a fait le regard, hein ?
Tête baissée, regard vers le haut,
mains dans les poches,
épaules redressées,
tête légèrement inclinée,
traduisant la vulnérabilité timide.
Je crois.
Ecoute, on peut s'en aller ?
Lait potiron pour Marshall.
Je n'ai pas commandé ça.
Numéro de téléphone.
J'adore ce regard.
Je pense que j'ai couché avec toi
à cause de ce regard.
Et c'est une feinte ?
Oh, et toi qui mords ta lèvre inférieure,
en regardant timidement au loin
et en faisant ressortir ta poitrine
c'est naturel ?
Ouais, je vois ce que tu veux dire.
- Hey !
- Hey, les amis.
Vous êtes libres demain soir ?
Je pensais faire une fête
dégustation de vins slash
"aidez-moi à attraper
le rat dans mon appartement".
C'est une super idée.
Tu peux sortir du fromage pour nous deux.
Je devrais inviter Marshall, hein ?
Ça ferait bizarre
si je ne le faisais pas.
Ouais, je ne pense pas
qu'il puisse venir.
Vraiment ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Heu... okay, hmm...
Lily, on a quelque chose
à te dire.
Marshall a un rencart.
Oh. Eh bien...
tant mieux pour lui.
Vraiment ?
Ça ne te pose pas de problème ?
Ecoute, ça fait presque six mois
qu'on a rompu.
Je veux dire, je ne peux pas dire
que l'idée m'enchante,
mais il a tous les droits de sortir
avec quelqu'un d'autre.
C'est très mature.
Pourquoi tiens-tu le téléphone ?
Oh, merde.
C'est hilarant, maman.
Elle n'a même pas remarqué.
Hey, mon pote, au fait,
j'aime vraiment ce costume.
Parle-moi du tissu.
C'est étranger ou quelque chose comme ça ?
Wow. C'est étranger.
Je suis impressionné, Ted.
- C'est marocain, en fait.
- Whoa.
J'ai un appel pour Swarley.
Y a t'il un Swarley ici ?
Mon costume ne t'intéressait pas du tout,
n'est-ce pas ?
- Hmm ?
- Swarley !
Ouais, je sais qu'il est là.
C'est vraiment important.
Pourriez-vous redemander ?
Appel important pour Swarley !
Bon sang, tu ne l'entends pas, Swarley ?
Il y a un appel pour toi.
Arrête de m'appeler comme ça.
Hey, les mecs, j'aimerais
vous présenter officiellement Chloé.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Salut.
C'est sympa de vous rencontrer.
- Je reviens.
- C'est par là tout droit.
Alors ? Alors ?
Elle est canon !
Et elle m'aime bien ?
Elle aime manger italien.
J'aime aussi manger italien.
Elle aime Billy Joel.
J'aime aussi... la musique.
Et je pense qu'on va encore sortir.
- Mon pote, tu dois la laisser tomber.
- De toute évidence.
Pourquoi ?
Elle a un regard hypnotique.
Mon pote.
Les yeux.
Ils hypnotisent.
Les mecs, qu'est-ce que
vous entendez par regard hypnotique ?
C'est un état bien connu
des pupilles, ou pupi.
Non.
Juste pupilles.
C'est un indicateur
de future instabilité mentale.
Elle n'a pas le regard hypnotique.
Tu ne peux pas le voir
parce que tu es affligé
de l'aveuglement "ça fait un moment
que je n'ai pas baisé".
Elle était trop loin au café,
mais quand je l'ai vue
de près tout à l'heure...
Hey, les mecs, j'aimerais
vous présenter officiellement Chloé.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Salut.
C'est sympa de vous rencontrer.
Les mecs, je ne vais pas arrêter
de sortir avec Chloé
juste parce que vous pensez
qu'elle a un regard hypnotique.
Tu peux continuer à sortir avec elle,
mais tu vas le regretter.
Une fois, j'ai rencontré une fille
à ce même bar.
J'ai vu qu'elle avait
le regard hypnotique...
...mais je suis passé outre.
Et puis, bien entendu.
Barney,
je peux te poser une question ?
Tout ce que tu veux.
Tu aimerais faire une partie à trois ?
Bien sûr.
Génial.
Ça sera toi, moi et Mr. Weasels.
Alors, tu l'as fait ?
Non.
Finalement c'est resté une partie à deux,
avec le troisième qui regardait
d'une chaise.
Lequel étais-tu ?
Je préférerais ne pas le dire.
Ecoute, il fut un temps où je ne croyais pas
au regard hypnotique non plus,
et puis j'ai rencontré Jeanine.
Elle avait un regard
sérieusement hypnotique.
Je me suis dit que je n'avais
fait que l'imaginer, mais ensuite...
Alors, on va prendre un verre ?
Tant que c'est dans ton appartement.
Whoa, je suis désolée.
Regarde ! Où !
Tu ! Vas !
Alors, où habites-tu ?
Les mecs, Chloé ne va
rien faire de tout ça.
C'est une gentille fille
du Nebraska.
Elle n'est pas folle.
Elle est...
elle est formidable.
Mais on ne peut pas éviter
le regard hypnotique éternellement.
Tôt ou tard,
la folie remonte à la surface.
Allô ?
Marshall, c'est Chloé.
C'est toi qui m'as appelé
genre neuf fois ?
Ouais.
Tu pourrais venir me chercher ?
Je suis au beau milieu d'un examen.
S'il te plaît.
J'ai si peur.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Ce nain bizarre a commencé à me suivre
et il m'a crié dessus
et il boîte et il a une grosse bosse
dans le dos
et la police ne m'a pas crue
et j'ai presque été piétinée
par un cheval et...
Mon dieu, je dois te sembler
complètement folle maintenant.
Non. Pff.
Pas du tout.
Donc, c'est une folle dépendante.
C'est l'une des pires sortes.
J'en ai eu une.
Inventer des histoires
pour attirer l'attention.
Je suis sorti avec elle pendant trois semaines...
son père est mort deux fois.
Les mecs, elle paniquait vraiment, okay ?
Peut-être que l'histoire
est vraie.
Qu'est-ce qui pourrait bien te faire croire
que c'est une histoire vraie ?
Elle est vraiment canon.
Elles le sont toujours.
- Tu as fini, Ted ?
- Ouais.
Ned.
Je t'ai dit de l'appeler Ned.
Si c'est pas triste...
Désolée, Swarley.
Donc, tu habites ici juste avec Ted
ou bien Swarley vit-il ici aussi ?
Nah. Swarley a son propre appartement.
Qu'est-ce que c'était ?
Oh, j'ai fait tomber mes clés.
Et voilà.
Deux bières potiron.
Je plaisantais.
Ce sont des bières normales.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Ce cadre est cassé.
Oh. C'est dommage.
C'est Lily ?
C'est la fille
que tu devais épouser ?
Ouais.
C'était ça ce son ?
Tu as cassé ça ?
Non.
Pourquoi aurais-je fait ça ?
Regarde-moi dans les yeux.
Okay.
J'ai vraiment passé
une très bonne soirée.
Ouais, moi aussi.
Arrête de cligner des yeux.
J'aime beaucoup tes yeux aussi.
Stop !
Salut.
Je suis Lily.
Stop !
Maintenant, les enfants, je sais que
Lily cachée dans l'appartement
pendant que Marshall avait un rencart
avec une autre fille semble plutôt dingue,
mais quand vous aurez entendu
sa version de l'histoire...
eh bien, c'est toujours aussi dingue.
Quoi de neuf, Swarlz ?
Non, okay ?
Non, ça suffit.
Je ne vais pas laisser ça
devenir un truc. C'est terminé.
Plus de Swarley.
Plus de Swarlz.
Plus de Swar-lay.
Plus de Swar...
j'y arrive... ley.
Plus de Bob Swarley-mon.
Ça suffit. Non !
C'est terminé.
Vous avez compris ?
- Oui.
- Oui.
Merci.
Sympa.
- Pourquoi ne m'as-tu pas appelée ?
- Je devais t'appeler ?
Ouais, à propos de Marshall
qui sort avec une autre fille.
Tu as dit que
ça ne te faisait rien.
Ouais, devant Ted, mais ensuite
je t'ai lancé un regard.
- Quel regard ?
- Celui-là.
Ça ne ressemble pas à un regard.
Si. Ça veut dire : "Je suis bouleversée,
appelle-moi plus tard".
Tu aurais dû m'entraîner à l'écart
et m'expliquer ce que ça voulait dire.
Si je t'avais entraînée à l'écart,
je n'aurais pas eu besoin du regard.
Peut-être que si c'était
un regard plus révélateur...
Okay, le regard
n'est pas important.
Ce qui est important,
c'est que je ne supporte pas l'idée
de savoir Marshall
avec une autre femme.
Et s'il tombait amoureux d'elle ?
Si ça peut te rassurer,
Ted a dit qu'elle a
le regard hypnotique.
C'est quoi ça ?
Apparemment, un truc que les femmes ont
que seuls les homme peuvent voir
et qui les prévient
que la fille est cinglée.
Oh, un peu comme le fait que tu ne
veuilles jamais sortir avec un type
avec des ongles parfaits ?
Des ongles de crétin.
Exactement.
Est-ce que Ted a dit
si elle était mignonne ?
Parce que si je savais
qu'elle est laide,
peut-être que
je ne flipperais pas autant.
Il n'a rien dit,
mais tu peux le découvrir toi-même.
Je crois qu'elle s'appelle Chloé,
elle travaille au café Cosa
sur la 78ème.
Un appel pour Swarles Barkley ?
Hey, Ted.
Non, il n'est pas là.
Mais c'est bien trouvé.
Rappelle t'en.
Est-ce que Chloé est là ?
Elle vient de partir. Vous pouvez
probablement encore la rattraper.
Elle est facile à repérer,
elle a un parapluie rose.
Oh, merci, Brian.
Je m'appelle Scott.
Sur votre badge, c'est Brian.
Je sais,
c'est une histoire amusante.
Je me suis réveillé ce matin, et...
Ouais, à la prochaine, Brian.
La voilà.
Elle ne m'a pas l'air
si géniale que ça.
Elle n'est pas grosse,
mais ça ne veut rien dire.
Je connais un tas
de femmes maigres et laides.
C'est exact, petite cradingue
de mon cours de yoga,
je parle de toi.
Allez, Chloé, tourne-toi.
On y est.
Tourne-toi, Chloé.
Allez, montre-moi
ce visage hideux.
Mince !
Oh, je sais, je vais la dépasser,
puis je ferai demi-tour
pour... Ah !
Oh mon dieu, ça fait mal !
Tourne-toi !
Allez !
Tourne-toi !
Okay, c'est ridicule.
Hey !
Tourne-toi !
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas chez toi ?
Hey, toi !
Tourne-toi !
Tourne-toi, Chloé !
Elle est canon ?
Je suis vraiment désolée.
Non, ça va.
Ça rend les choses plus faciles.
Maintenant que je sais
qu'elle est une menace,
il ne me reste plus
qu'à empêcher Marshall de la revoir.
Okay, j'ai deux plans.
Tu peux m'aider à choisir.
Plan A...
tu te souviens de la fois
où Marshall et moi avons
fait l'amour dans la salle de bains ?
Oops, j'ai été engrossée.
- Lily.
- Okay, le plan B
s'appelle "L'accident de Chloé."
- Arrête.
- Quoi ?
Lily, tu ne peux
rien faire de tout ça.
Si jamais vous deviez
vous remettre ensemble,
il faut que tu le laisses
expérimenter ce qu'il veut.
Je sais.
Tu as raison.
Allez, viens, Ted nous a demandé
d'être en haut à 18h.
Une sorte de surprise pour Barney.
- Barney ?
- Uh, Swarley.
- Salut les filles.
- Hey.
Où est Marshall ?
Oh, il est chez le coiffeur.
Oh. Pour son rencard.
Tant mieux pour lui.
J'espère qu'il passera
un bon moment ce soir.
Du calme,
tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter.
Cette fille est cinglée.
Merci !
Ils feront juste l'amour
comme des bêtes cinq fois au plus,
et ça sera terminé entre eux.
Encore merci.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je veux juste écouter
un peu de musique, c'est tout.
Et la prochaine est pour Swarley.
Tous vos amis savent
que Barney vous manque,
mais il est parti,
et il vous faut l'accepter, bébé.
Et, Swarley, vous n'en serez
qu'une meilleure femme.
Voilà "I Am Woman"
de Helen Reddy.
Ha-ha ! Maintenant
je suis une femme. J'adore ça !
Vous savez, hier soir, je réfléchissais
à toute cette histoire de nouveau nom,
et vous savez ce que j'ai réalisé ?
J'aime bien.
Tu aimes bien
qu'on t'appelle Swarley ?
Tu plaisantes ?
Je veux que vous m'appeliez comme ça.
Tu crois vraiment
que ça va marcher ?
Que quoi va marcher ?
Je dis juste que j'aime mon nouveau nom,
alors s'il vous plaît, appelez-moi
uniquement comme ça dorénavant.
T'appeler comment ?
Tu sais, par ce nouveau nom
que vous m'avez donné.
Dis-le.
Pourquoi ?
Vous savez ce que c'est.
Dis le nom.
Non, je ne veux pas !
Je le déteste !
Je le déteste !
Ce n'est pas marrant !
Ça n'a jamais été marrant !
Je n'ai jamais rien fait...
Non !
Il va vraiment péter un câble
quand tous les abonnements
aux magazines vont arriver.
Je l'ai abonné à "Vocable Espagnol",
mais je l'ai adressé à Swarlos.
Eh, où est la photo
de Marshall et moi sur la jetée ?
Est-ce qu'elle n'était pas
près de cette fenêtre ?
Oh ouais, il l'a en quelque sorte
enlevée quand tu es partie.
Il l'a mise
derrière des livres, je crois.
Eh bien, peut-être
que je devrais la remettre.
Pourquoi, pour que
Chloé la voie et panique ?
Non.
Pour que Marshall la voie
et se sente coupable.
Ouais, bien.
Mais elle n'allait pas bien.
Plus tard ce soir là,
alors que Marshall était à son rencard,
Lily revint.
"...anymore."
Plutôt impressionnant, hein ?
Wow, tu as vraiment mémorisé toutes
les paroles de "We Didn't Start the Fire."
Je peux te proposer un verre ?
Je prendrais bien une bière.
Ça marche.
Lily fit ce que
toute femme sensée aurait fait.
Elle se cacha sous le bureau.
Et elle resta là
à écouter son ex-fiancé
lors de son rendez-vous
avec une autre femme.
J'ai vraiment passé
une très bonne soirée.
Ouais, moi aussi.
Arrête de cligner des yeux.
J'aime beaucoup tes yeux aussi.
Finalement, comme Billy Joel,
elle ne put en supporter davantage.
Stop !
Salut.
Je suis Lily.
Lily... Lily,
mais que fais-tu ici ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je ne sais pas... ce que je fais.
Oh, la bière potiron,
c'était bien trouvé.
Je... je vais y aller.
Je... je suis vraiment désolée.
Profitez du reste
de votre rendez-vous.
Elle a l'air gentille.
- Lily, bon sang, que...
- Je suis désolée.
Je me suis seulement faufilée
là haut parce que...
hier, quand j'ai vu comme
elle était mignonne, j'ai flippé.
Lily, tu l'as vue hier ?
Ouais, je l'ai en quelque chose
suivie dans la rue.
Attends, alors c'était toi
le bossu qui boitait ?
Ouais.
Et elle n'a pas brisé le cadre,
c'était moi.
Alors Chloé n'est pas cinglée,
elle est...
juste une gentille fille
tout à fait normale.
Ouais.
Et tu mérites une gentille fille
tout à fait normale.
Alors tu devrais remonter
et terminer ton rendez-vous.
Ouais.
Okay.
Okay.
Attends, si tu étais le bossu, pourquoi
a t'elle cru que tu étais un mec ?
J'ai peut-être utilisé une voix
qui sonnait comme ça.
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que je ne voulais pas
qu'elle sache que c'était moi, et je réalise
maintenant que ça n'avait aucun sens,
parce qu'elle ne m'avait
même pas rencontrée.
Tu es cinglée.
Tu as les yeux les plus hypnotiques
que j'aie jamais vus.
Tu ne devrais pas remonter...?
Je veux dire,
tu as perdu la tête.
Tu es... complètement tarée.
Tu ne devrais pas remonter ?
Tu m'as tellement manqué.
Okay, j'ai demandé au groupe
ce qu'il en pensait,
et on a décidé
qu'on allait te laisser le choix.
On sera d'accord
pour arrêter de t'appeler Swarley,
mais à la place,
on t'appellera Jennifer.
Alors ?
Je réfléchis.
Que dis-tu de ça ?
Les lundi, mercredi et vendredi...
Hey.
Regardez-moi ça.
Juste ici, à l'endroit exact
où 6 mois plus tôt
j'avais trouvé Marshall seul,
pleurant sur sa rupture avec Lily,
je le retrouvais.
Seulement cette fois-ci,
il n'était pas seul,
et il était heureux.
Alors on est allés au bar
pour fêter ça, et c'était génial.
J'étais avec Robin, Marshall
et Lily étaient à nouveau ensemble,
et Barney avait
un nouveau nom super cool.
Tout allait parfaitement bien...
jusqu'à ce
qu'on retourne à l'appartement.
Oh, mon dieu.
Hey, Chloé, je...
suppose que j'ai oublié
que je t'avais laissée ici.
J'allais partir, mais
je n'arrive pas à trouver mes clés.
Elle sont juste là,
sur la table basse.
Comme je suis idiote.
J'ai dû regarder partout ailleurs.
Bien... je vais y aller.
Oh, je ne crois pas
qu'on ait été présentées. Je suis Chloé.
Robin.
Enchantée, Roland.
A la prochaine.
Roland ?
Tu t'appelles Roland.
C'est marrant, pas vrai ?
"Rock and Roland."
Varsovie est la capitale de quoi ?
La Roland.
Tu es Monica Roland-ski.
Hey, ouais, voilà comme je Roland.
- Bien essayé, Swarley.
- Merde.
Swarley !

Et ainsi, aprčs six mois
de séparation,
tante Lily et oncle Marshall
s'étaient enfin remis ensemble.
Oh, mon dieu.
Ces pancakes sont délicieux !
Oui. Merci.
J'ai appris ŕ cuisiner pendant
que tu étais partie cet été.
Oh. Tu veux cuisiner ce soir ?
Ouais, bien sűr.
Pourquoi pas des pancakes ?
Et les choses étaient revenues
ŕ la normale... presque.
On n'a peut-ętre pas grand chose,
mais au moins j'épouse un type
qui sait faire les pancakes.
Oh, hmm...
Je veux dire, hmm...
Je... je me rends compte
qu'on n'a pas vraiment discuté
si le fait qu'on se remette ensemble
voulait dire qu'on allait se marier, mais...
Je le veux toujours.
Tu le veux toujours ?
Vraiment ?
Bien sűr,
je t'aime.
Non, je veux dire,
comme ça que tu vas le faire ?
"Tu le veux toujours ?" C'est genre
la demande la plus nulle de tous les temps.
Quand je l'ai fait, je me suis mis ŕ genoux...
je ne sais pas, je dis ça comme ça.
Marshall Eriksen, veux-tu...
- Non, non, non, non, non, non.
- Quoi ?!
Tu ne peux pas amener ça comme ça.
Tu dois... développer.
Tu dois faire genre
un petit discours.
Tu te souviens
de ta demande ŕ toi ?
J'avais préparé un discours.
Qu'est-ce que
tu veux entendre ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je veux dire tu pourrais me dire,
par exemple, combien je suis beau
et drôle et intelligent,
et que je me suis développé
derničrement.
Ça serait sympa que tu mentionnes
quelque chose... ŕ ce propos.
Marshall...
- tu es beau...
- Merci.
- Tu es drôle.
- Oh, merci.
- Tu es intelligent.
- Et quelques larmes ne feraient pas de mal.
Okay, vas-tu te décider
ŕ m'épouser bientôt ?
Je vais t'épouser.
Bien sűr.
Mais... jusqu'ŕ ce que tu voies un anneau sur
ce doigt, ne t'attends pas ŕ ce que je couche.
Ouais, c'est ça.

Je t'accorde ça.
C'était une utilisation trčs créative
du sirop.
Je ne peux męme pas regarder
Mrs. Butterworth dans les yeux.
Oh, mon dieu.
On va se marier !
Je sais, je sais.
C'était un moment
de bonheur,
suivi bien entendu
d'un moment de panique totale.
Vous voyez, quand ils ont annulé
leur premier mariage,
tante Lily est partie
pour San Francisco
en laissant ŕ oncle Marshall
la tâche ingrate
de le dire ŕ toute sa famille.
Ouais, donc maintenant elle est partie
et le mariage est annulé.
Comment appelles-tu quelqu'un qui laisse
tout tomber et s'en va comme ça ?
Comment appelles-tu ça ?
Je pense que
c'est un peu dur.
Je n'en reviens męme pas que
tu puisses prononcer un mot comme ça.
Bon dieu, Grand-mčre.
Bon sang, j'ai fichu un gros bordel
en annulant ce mariage, n'est-ce pas ?
C'est rien, bébé.
Tu ne viens pas juste
de t'en rendre compte, n'est-ce pas ?
Mon dieu, l'idée de me tenir lŕ,
debout devant tous ces gens
qui me détestent...
me donne juste envie d'aller direct ŕ
Atlantic City et de me marier aujourd'hui.
Ouais.
A venir ŕ 11 heures :
Y a t'il des piranhas dans l'East River ?
Ce que vous ne savez pas...
pourrait vous manger.
Robin !
Arrętez les infos !
- C'est quoi ça ?
- C'est okay. Ce sont mes amis.
On va ŕ Atlantic City se marier ŕ la sauvette.
Tu dois venir avec nous.
Oh, mon dieu,
c'est si fantastique !
Je... je ne sais pas
si je peux quitter mon travail.
C'est okay ;
Mike peut lire les infos ce soir.
Hey, Mike...
tu sais lire, hein ?
Ouais, je suis le meilleur
en lecture.
- Partons ŕ Atlantic City !
- Ouais !
Vous allez vous marier ŕ la sauvette !
Oh, c'est fantastique.
Attendez, c'est parce qu'il y a un délai
dont oncle Ted devrait ętre informé ?
J'espčre que non parce que
j'ai l'intention de me saouler.
Ça a l'air super marrant,
mais je ne peux vraiment pas quitter le boulot.
Je suis plutôt important, lŕ, vous savez ?
C'est moi le chef de projet.
Ted, pour le reste de notre vie,
on va raconter
l'incroyable histoire
de comment on est allés ŕ Atlantic City
et qu'on s'est mariés.
Tu ne veux pas faire partie
de cette histoire ?
Bien sűr que si.
- Partons ŕ Atlantic City !
- Ouais !
Oh, mais quand on va raconter l'histoire,
vous pourrez omettre la partie oů j'hésite ?
Vendu.
Hey, les amis.
Wow. Un pédicure.
S'il y avait la moindre honte ŕ ce
qu'un type se fasse faire une pédicure,
je ne pense pas qu'ils auraient fait un article
ŕ ce sujet dans "Details magazine".
On va ŕ Atlantic City
nous marier ŕ la sauvette sur le champ !
Oh, félicitations, Lily.
Marshall, tu vas te marier ?
Pourquoi ?
Alors, tu en es ou pas ?
Ouais, j'en suis !
C'est juste que...
j'ai presque fini.
- Non, on va aller au...
- B'en, en fait, je veux dire...
C'est le jour de mon mariage,
et puisqu'on est lŕ...
Alors on s'est tous fait faire
une pédicure et puis on est allés...
ŕ Atlantic City.
Wow.
Regardez cet endroit.
J'imagine que j'aurai le choix
pour quelque chose de vieux.
Et quelque chose de bleu. Quelqu'un
devrait vraiment surveiller cette dame.
Ah, A.C., toujours sur le déclin,
ne touche jamais le fond.
C'est bon d'ętre de retour,
vieil ami.
Tu es déjŕ venu ici ?
Oh, une ou deux fois.
Barney !
Ah, ravi de te voir aussi.
Trois fois, peut-ętre.
La chapelle de mariage...
c'est elle.
Tu es pręt ŕ le faire ?
Je suis pręt.
- Marions-nous.
- Ouais.
Oh, merde.
Je n'ai pas de voile.
Je suis une mariée ;
je ne peux pas me marier sans voile.
Et un bouquet.
J'ai besoin d'un voile et d'un bouquet.
Oh, mon dieu,
on se marie.
Ne t'en fais pas. Détends-toi.
On va te trouver un voile, chérie.
Oh, Robin, tu es vraiment
bien habillée.
Oh, vraiment ? Merci.
Ouais, il faut l'enlever. Je suis la mariée,
tu ne peux pas ętre plus jolie que moi.
Réglé.
Je vais chercher le bouquet.
Vous allez chercher le voile.
On se retrouve dans la chapelle
dans 20 minutes.
Pręts, c'est parti.
Vous voulez aller flamber ?
Non, on va chercher le voile.
Ou on a cherché partout,
et on n'en a pas trouvé.
Ouais, okay.
Non, allez-y, vous.
Je vais chercher le voile.
Alors on y est, hein ? Les derničres
20 minutes de ta vie de célibataire.
- Je suis fier de toi, mon pote.
- Merci.
- Comment te sens-tu ?
- Super, un peu nerveux.
- Ouais ? Craps ? (la chiasse)
- Pas nerveux comme ça.
- Non, je te demande si tu veux jouer au craps.
- Oh, ouais, absolument.
Okay, j'ai le voile.
Elle n'était pas pręte
ŕ se marier.
D'accord, parlons de fęte
d'enterrement de vie de garçon.
On pense club de strip-tease total,
ou devrait-on louer une salle
et avoir une représentation
privée... whew.
Qu'est-ce que tu viens de dire ?
- Barney, non.
- Marshall, je suis ton témoin.
- Tu n'es pas mon témoin.
- Juste lŕ.
Et en tant que ton témoin, je dois t'organiser
une fęte d'enterrement de vie de garçon.
C'est un rôle qui revient
ŕ un meilleur ami.
- Tu n'es pas mon meilleur ami.
- Juste lŕ.
Barney, je n'ai pas de temps
pour un enterrement de vie de garçon.
J'ai genre 18 minutes.
18 minutes.
Oh, bien.
Tu as le voile ?
Bien sűr.
Et il nous a fallu exactement
18 minutes.
On est allés dans un club
de strip-tease.
- Mec !
- Inimaginable !
On n'y est pas restés trčs longtemps.
Ce n'est pas comme si j'avais eu le temps
d'avoir une lap dance ou quelque chose
comme ça. J'ai eu une lap dance.
- La derničre lap dance de ta vie.
- Exact...
Quoi ?
Okay, je suis lŕ.
C'est bon ?
Oh, mon dieu, les choses dans lesquelles
les gens gaspillent de l'argent ŕ Atlantic City.
Ça ne sent pas la strip-teaseuse ici ?
C'est bizarre, hein ?
Marshall et Lily se marient !
Bon sang, ouais, regardez ça.
Oh, bébé, c'est ça.
- Allons le faire.
- D'accord.
Salut.
Nous sommes ici pour nous marier.
Félicitations.
Nous proposons diverses formules
pour vous offrir le jour spécial
dont vous avez toujours ręvé.
On ne veut pas de tout ça.
Votre mariage rapide basique sera parfait.
Ouais.
Vous savez que ce n'est pas
Végas, n'est-ce pas ?
Bien sűr. A Végas,
les casinos fournissent l'oxygčne.
Ici, on dirait que chacun doit
apporter le sien.
Quoi ?
Ça prend aussi trois jours pour obtenir
une licence de mariage dans le New Jersey.
Je ne peux rien vous réserver
avant lundi au plus tôt.
Non, non, non, ça doit ętre aujourd'hui.
C'est le plus important.
Ecoutez, je ne sais pas
quoi vous dire,
mais si vous ne voulez ni
réserver un mariage pour lundi,
ni faire une partie de Keno,
je ne peux rien pour vous.
Trente cinq.
Attendez, je ne comprends pas, des gens
se marient sans arręt ŕ Atlantic City.
Oui, c'est vrai,
mais pas ŕ la sauvette.
Ils choisissent Atlantic City
pour ses plages de sable blanc,
son confort mondialement célčbre,
et la sensation exotique de la Riviera.
Vous ętes allée dehors ?
Il y a une moitié d'orque en décomposition
ŕ moins de 6 mčtres de la cabine.
Calmez-vous.
Vous ętes sűre de ça ?
Des lois sur le mariage de l'Etat oů
je travaille dans une chapelle de mariage ?
Ouais, je suis plutôt sűre.
Il faut voir le bon côté : la fęte
d'enterrement de vie de garçon continue !
Oui !
Continue ? Tu veux dire "commence".
Il veut dire "commence".
On est allés dans
un club de strip-tease.
Vingt-sept.
Y a t'il un moyen qu'on puisse
avoir une licence aujourd'hui ?
Vous pourriez aller au tribunal.
En cas de force majeur,
la période d'attente peut ętre supprimée,
mais vous devez avoir
une bonne raison.
Eh bien, on est amoureux.
Quelle meilleure raison
pourrait-il y avoir ?
La derničre que
j'aie entendue c'était :
"Je pars en Irak demain
pour défendre mon pays",
mais vous savez,
tentez votre chance.
Alors on est allés au tribunal.
Bon dieu, ça dure une éternité.
Je n'arrive pas ŕ croire
qu'ils se marient.
Je sais.
Je suis si fier d'eux.
Aprčs tout ce qu'ils ont traversé.
En fait, ce parcours de folie
les a menés
tout droit
ŕ Atlantic City.
Ted, par ici.
Tu regardais
les seins de mon t-shirt.
Non !
Pas du tout.
Je regardais le superbe corps
sous le t-shirt.
Okay, peut-ętre
que je regardais ton t-shirt,
mais c'est un t-shirt
super marrant.
Hey, c'est Barney !
- Barney !
- Salut.
...costume.
...légende.
...pčre.
Pčre américain.
C'était quoi ça ?
Un... Chinois ?
Salut. Bonjour.
Il nous faut une licence de mariage,
mais la période d'attente doit
ętre supprimée, parce que...
on est amoureux.
Ah, je vais vous dispenser
de la période d'attente tout de suite.
Oh, vraiment ?!
C'est ce que je dirais si je pouvais
vous dispenser de la période d'attente,
mais malheureusement,
seul un juge peut faire ça.
Oh. Alors on peut voir un juge ?
- Absolument.
- Vraiment ?!
C'est ce que je dirais si vous aviez
une chance de voir un juge aujourd'hui,
ce qui n'est pas le cas.
Pourquoi vous nous faites ça ?!
Parce que vous ętes
ŕ Caméra Cachée !
- Vraiment ?!
- C'est ce que je dirais...
Vous savez quoi ?
On a compris.
Okay, c'est un bon plan B.
Les juges sont des personnes.
Les personnes vont aux toilettes.
Un juge finira forcément par venir,
et on se mariera.
Je suis sűre
qu'on n'attendra pas longtemps.
Bon sang, on s'éloigne 30 secondes
ŕ un distributeur automatique.
Les vautours.
Quoi ?
Ici ?
Ouais. On a un peu de temps ŕ tuer.
Oh mon dieu,
c'est le t-shirt, n'est-ce pas ?
Non.
Un peu.
Quelque chose ne va
vraiment pas bien chez toi.
Alors quoi, c'est un non ?
- D'accord, faisons-le.
- Bien.
Et aussi...?
- Oui, je le garderai sur moi.
- Super.
Les amis, laissons tomber.
Ça ne marchera jamais.
Ecoute, je sais que
ça tourne un peu au désastre,
mais crois-moi,
c'est mieux que l'alternative.
Que tu organises une grande fęte
avec un tas d'alcool et ŕ manger,
avec toutes tes amies célibataires
et désespérées de la fac ?
Ouais, ravi qu'on ait évité le pire.
Un juge ! Un juge !
Venez, venez, venez !
- Eteignez-moi ça.
- Okay.
S'il vous plaît, est-ce que
vous pourriez nous marier aujourd'hui ?
En temps normal,
je dirais non ŕ une telle requęte,
mais vous m'impressionnez,
tous les deux.
Rien que le fait que
vous soyez ensemble depuis 10 ans,
côte ŕ côte dans les bons
et les mauvais moments,
sans jamais hésiter.
- C'était quoi ça ?
- Quoi ?
Ce petit regard. C'était quoi ?
Le regard de l'amour.
Vous ętes restés l'un prčs de l'autre dans
les bons et les mauvais moments, n'est-ce pas?
- C'est quoi des bons ou des mauvais moments...
- Ouais... ouais.
Moi oui.
Bon, c'était quoi ce regard ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Ils ont rompu durant l'été.
et ces deux-lŕ viennent
de faire l'amour dans le placard.
Quoi ? On est sous serment.
Non.
Si. C'est un juge.
On a pręté serment ?
Est-ce que tu sais seulement
ce qu'est un serment ?
Euh, ouais. Tribunal.
Serment. On se trouve en dessous.
Les amis, on dirait
que ça n'arrivera pas.
Non, Marshall,
on va se marier aujourd'hui.
Bébé, partout oů on ira,
il nous faudra une licence de mariage.
Sauf dans les eaux internationales.
Alors allons trouver
le capitaine d'un bateau.
Le capitaine d'un bateau
pourra nous marier.
Il y a des bateaux partout.
Oh, c'est donc ça, ces trucs en bois
qui flottent entre les détritus ?
C'est une super idée.
Ça va marcher. Allons-y.
Excusez-moi.
Etes-vous le capitaine d'un bateau ?
C'est ma machine.
- Je devrais aller lui parler.
- Non, laisse-moi y aller.
- Un blackjack ?
- Ouais.
J'ai trouvé un mec qui a dit qu'il serait
pręt ŕ mettre son bateau dans mon slip,
alors on s'approche du but.
Okay, Lil, pourquoi est-ce
si important de faire ça aujourd'hui ?
Parce que...
si on ne le fait pas aujourd'hui,
je sais qu'on va se retrouver
ŕ faire un gigantesque mariage
avec une foule
de gens immenses du Midwest
qui me regarderont
en désapprouvant et en me jugeant,
tout en sirotant
de petits pots de mayonnaise
et en lâchant des blagues
de mariées en cavale toute la soirée.
- Personne ne fera ça.
- Non,
parce que je ne vais pas
leur laisser cette chance.
Je vais trouver le capitaine d'un bateau
et on sera mariés ce soir.
Chérie, c'est dingue.
Tu ne trouveras pas
de capitaine de bat...
Hey, Lily.
J'ai trouvé un capitaine de bateau.
- Quoi ?
- Yeah.
Le premier type auquel on a parlé.
Il est capitaine d'un bateau.
C'est pas génial ?
Vous voyez ? C'est le destin.
Alors, capitaine, pouvez-vous nous emmener
dans les eaux internationales et nous marier ?
Bien sűr.
Il y a deux choses que j'adore, c'est unir
deux personnes par les liens du mariage
- et me faire 5000 $.
- Quoi ?
Ça marche. 5000 $, okay,
on peut faire ça. Allez tout le monde.
Balancez tout votre argent.
Ne réfléchissez pas. Faites-le.
Je peux nous avoir cet argent.
Comment ?
As-tu remarqué que toute la journée
des Chinois n'ont cessé de me saluer ?
Oui. As-tu remarqué que
je ne t'ai posé aucune question lŕ-dessus
parce que j'avais trop peur
de la réponse ?
B'en ce sont mes vieux amis de jeux.
En vérité...
je venais tout le temps ici.
Je jouais ŕ un vieux jeu chinois
qui s'appelle "Shing Hasabu Shing".
J'avais un petit problčme de jeu.
En fait, il n'était pas
si petit que ça. J'ai...
en quelque sorte perdu
toutes mes économies.
Mais ce soir, je ne sais pas,
je me sens en veine.
Je crois que je peux
nous gagner cet argent.
Non, on ne va pas te laisser
flamber tout notre argent.
On ne flambe pas si on sait
avec certitude qu'on va gagner.
Je vais nous avoir cet argent.
Je le jure. Nan...
je pręte serment.
Je suis allé dans un tas de casinos
avant ce soir-lŕ,
et je suis allé dans un tas
de casinos depuis,
mais je n'ai jamais revu
un jeu comme celui-lŕ.
A ce jour, je n'ai aucune idée
de la maničre dont ça se jouait.
Mais heureusement, Barney le savait.
Vous comprenez ce qui se passe ?
Pas du tout.
Tu crois qu'il gagne ?
Je ne sais męme pas s'il joue.
Attendez, j'y suis.
Je comprends ce jeu.
Non.
Je comprends parfaitement
ce jeu, Theodore.
Barney, divise tes jetons. Tu peux tripler
tes gains si tu trouves le Dragibus.
Marshall, je t'en prie.
Tu ne crois pas que je sais ce que je...
Mon dieu, tu as raison.
Wow. C'est magnifique.
Merci, Barney.
Vous m'avez vu ?
J'étais en feu ce soir.
Bon sang, j'ai hâte
de retourner sur le rivage.
Bon dieu, j'adore flamber !
Quand on rentrera,
on ira a une petite réunion. Okay ?
Pourquoi je ne peux pas
jouer juste un peu ?
Okay.
Commençons.
Okay...
Vous voulez la version sérieuse
ou la marrante ?
Oh, je crois... que la version
sérieuse passerait mieux.
Vous ętes sűre ? J'ai un tas
de blagues navales marrantes.
Comment chacun d'entre vous met ŕ flots
le bateau de l'autre, des trucs comme ça.
Ouais, la version sérieuse
est probablement trčs bien.
"Nous sommes réunis aujourd'hui
pour célébrer l'union
de Lily et Marshall."
"Aujourd'hui,
vous ne serez plus qu'un,
partageant vos vies,
le bonheur, la tristesse,
la frustration et la joie..."
C'est plutôt cool.
Je n'arrive pas ŕ croire
que tu ne veuilles jamais te marier.
Je n'ai jamais dit "jamais".
"...pour proclamer votre amour
et votre dévouement
l'un envers l'autre
devant vos amis et votre famille,
toutes ces personnes
qui comptent le plus pour vous."
C'était quoi ça ?
Quoi ?
Ce petit regard.
Vous venez d'échanger un regard.
- On ne veut pas faire ça.
- Non.
Vous plaisantez ?
Vous annulez un autre mariage ?
Aprčs que j'ai dépensé tout cet argent
dans un t-shirt de demoiselle d'honneur ?
J'avais parié contre quelqu'un qu'ils
l'annuleraient ? Hein ? Contre qui ?
Vous vous attendez ŕ ce que l'un
d'entre nous vienne ŕ votre 3čme mariage ?
Oui.
Parce qu'il sera extraordinaire.
Ecoutez, avant j'avais peur
d'affronter la famille de Marshall
et je ne voulais pas me donner
toute cette peine, mais...
maintenant qu'on est lŕ...
je me rends compte qu'il faut que
je fasse face ŕ la famille de Marshall
et je veux vraiment
m'en donner la peine.
Moi aussi.
Et ouais, il se peut que ma famille
soit encore fâchée aprčs toi.
Mais quand ils nous verront, ils se
rendront compte ŕ quel point on s'aime,
et rien d'autre
n'aura plus d'importance.
- Je t'aime, Marshall.
- Je t'aime aussi, Lily pad.
Je vous déclare maintenant
mari et femme.
- Quoi ?!
- Quoi ?!
Quoi, ce n'est pas juste ?
On est mariés ?
Vous venez de nous marier ?
Vous n'écoutiez pas ?
On ne veut pas ętre mariés.
Euh... je suppose
que je pourrais l'annuler.
- Annulez-le.
- Annulez-le !
Trčs bien, je vous annule
en tant que mari et femme.
Oh, whew... on a eu chaud.
Et voilŕ comment
votre oncle Marshall et votre tante Lily
se sont retrouvés mariés
pendant 12 secondes
quelque part au large
d'Atlantic City.
- Hey, les amis.
- Hey.
Ted.
Est-ce que Robin est lŕ ?
Je l'espčre.

..apprendre à propos des relations,
c'est que vous n'avez jamais fini
de connaître quelqu'un.
Tout le monde a des secrets.
Certains sont sympas.
Tu sais faire les crêpes ?
C'est si cool.
Certains sont moins sympas.
Et puis il y a eu Derek,
et en te comptant,
- ça amène le total à...
- Oh, j'ai ton total.
J'ai compté au fur et à mesure.
Et certains sont juste bizarres.
Tu as peur des sept nains ?
Juste Doc.
Il donne la chair de poule.
Je veux dire, le type est allé
à l'école de médecine.
Pourquoi vit-il avec six mineurs ?
Oh, la vache ! Je suis si excité.
Je n'ai pas pu dormir la nuit dernière.
- Je parie que vous non plus.
- Pourquoi ?
Rien que le Gala pour la Grande Ouverture
du 500ème magasin Sharper Image.
Vous n'avez pas reçu mon e-mail ?
Non, j'ai bloqué ton adresse
après la quatrième fois
que tu m'as envoyé la vidéo du singe
qui se renifle le cul.
Allez ! C'est pour moi. J'offre à trois
d'entre vous un massage des pieds
et à l'un d'entre vous une tondeuse
pour poils de nez. Vous vous reconnaîtrez.
Venez, allons-y.
Okay, j'en suis.
- Au Centre Commercial Willowbrook !
- Au Centre Commercial Willowbrook !
Oh, c'est dans un centre commercial ?
Je n'y vais pas.
Quoi ? Pourquoi pas ?
Ça ne me dit rien d'aller
dans un centre commercial.
On peut partager un Cinnabon.
- Non, je ne viens vraiment pas.
- Viens, ça va être marrant.
Non, je ne vais pas
aux centres commerciaux !
Désolée, je n'aime pas
les centres commerciaux.
Pourquoi ?
Je préfèrerais ne rien dire.
- Sharper Images.
- Mais c'est là que vivent les vêtements.
Les amis, les amis, les amis,
Robin n'aime pas les centres commerciaux.
Si elle ne veut pas nous dire pourquoi,
elle n'a pas à le faire.
Je pense qu'on devrait tous respecter
son intimité.
Merci, Ted.
Alors, c'est quoi ton problème
avec les centres commerciaux ?
Je pensais que tu avais dit
que si je ne voulais pas en parler,
je n'avais pas à le faire.
Ouais, avec ces personnes.
Mais je suis ton petit-ami.
Allez. Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
On t'a arrêtée dans un centre commercial ?
Non.
- Jetée dans un centre commercial ?
- Ted.
Découvert que tu étais Canadienne
dans un centre commercial ?
Laisse tomber.
Piégée sous un faux rocher
dans un centre commercial ?
- Laisse tomber.
- Molestée dans un centre commercial ?
Laisse tomber !
Et qui s'est retrouvé piégé sous un faux rocher
au centre commercial ?
Pas moi en Ohio quand j'avais 9 ans,
ça c'est sûr.
Je ne comprends pas.
Pourquoi Robin ne me dirait-elle pas
pourquoi elle déteste
les centres commerciaux ?
Ted, tu devrais être heureux
que Robin ait un secret.
Plus tu en apprends sur une personne,
plus tu as des chances de tomber
sur le moment fatal "Oh".
Le moment "Oh" ?
Ouais, ce moment où tu découvres
ce fameux détail sur une personne
qui va mener à la rupture.
C'est une bague de fiançailles.
J'ai fait un pacte avec dieu
de rester vierge jusqu'au mariage.
Je n'ai pas de trouble de l'alimentation.
C'est juste que quand je mets
de la nourriture dans ma bouche,
je la mâche, et puis je la crache.
Je viens d'avoir 30 ans.
Alors fais-moi confiance, tu veux retarder
le plus longtemps possible le fait
de tout savoir l'un sur l'autre.
Je ne suis pas d'accord.
S'il y a un moment "Oh" potentiel,
je veux le savoir tout de suite.
Je veux dire, quelle est l'alternative ?
Je vous déclare maintenant mari et femme.
Je t'aime.
Avant, j'étais un mec.
Ouais, je suis d'accord avec Ted.
Dans une vraie relation,
tu partages tout.
C'est pourquoi Marshall et moi
n'avons aucun secret.
Tu es tellement mignonne.
Voilà 25 centimes.
Va mettre une chanson dans le jukebox.
Non, c'est vrai.
Ils se disent tout.
Je peux trouver une tonne de trucs
qu'il n'y a pas moyen que Marshall t'ait dit.
Je t'écoute.
Que sais-tu de l'époque
où Marshall était à Trenton ?
Un âne a mangé son pantalon. Yup.
La fête d'enterrement de vie de garçon
de Bill à Memphis ?
Oh, quand ils ont dû aspirer
toutes les pièces de son estomac ?
Wow. Okay. Seattle.
Question piège. Marshall n'est
jamais allé au Nord-Ouest du Pacifique
parce qu'il a peur de Bigfoot.
La vache, t'es bonne.
Je n'ai pas peur de Bigfoot, je pense juste
qu'on devrait tous être en alerte.
Crois-moi.
Non seulement ils se disent tout,
mais ils veulent tout savoir.
Alors après la douche je me brossais
les dents. Et j'ai fait genre,
"Oh, mince !
Je voulais prendre du jus d'orange.
j'aurais dû le faire d'abord."
Mais j'avais déjà le dentifrice
sur la brosse à dents.
Alors j'ai juste continué
et je les ai brossées quand même.
Qu'est-il arrivé ensuite ?
Ouais, en attendant,
Robin ne me dit rien.
Très bien. Tu veux connaître
le secret de Robin ?
Tu sais ?
Evidemment que je sais.
Elle n'arrivait pas à nous regarder,
son visage était cramoisi...
c'est la honte, mon ami.
Notre amie Robin faisait de la porn,
attendez la suite...
...ographie.
Ouais, on n'avait pas vraiment besoin
d'attendre pour ça.
Et c'est ridicule.
Je ne sais pas.
Il pourrait avoir raison.
Elle fait des bruits de faux orgasmes.
Hey !
Quoi ?
Les murs sont minces.
Ce n'est pas pour ça que je fais "hey".
Tu sais ce que ça pourrait être ?
Ça va sembler un peu dingue, mais...
et si Robin était mariée ?
Mariée ? Qu'est-ce que ça a
à voir avec le centre commercial ?
Eh bien, peut-être qu'elle s'est mariée
au centre commercial.
Chez moi dans le Minnesota,
une tonne de gens se marient
au "Mall of America".
C'est génial.
Il y a ce superbe parcours
de golf intérieur pour les photos,
de nombreuses options parfaites pour le dîner,
sans parler d'un raisonnable...
- On ne va pas se marier au centre commercial !
- Eh bien, viens juste voir le type.
Elle n'est pas mariée.
Robin déteste le mariage.
Parce qu'elle a déjà été mariée.
Au centre commercial.
Non, parce qu'avant que Robin
ne s'installe à New York, elle...
Qu'est-ce qu'elle faisait ?
Eh bien je ne sais pas.
Chaque fois que je la questionne sur le Canada,
elle refuse de parler en quelque sorte.
C'est quelqu'un de plutôt réservé.
A part quand elle parle...
Oh, l'une de mes amies au Canada
s'est mariée trop jeune
et ça l'a vraiment dégoûtée du mariage.
Que penses-tu de ce gâteau de mariage ?
Oh, je l'aime bien.
Hey, tu te souviens de cette amie
que j'avais au Canada
qui s'est mariée trop jeune ?
Son gâteau de mariage
c'était un cookie Mrs. Fields géant.
Non.
Mon amie du Canada
qui s'est mariée trop jeune,
ils ont dû prononcer leurs vœux deux fois,
une fois en français.
Ils parlent français là-bas aussi ?
Mon dieu, c'est le bazar cet endroit.
Alors tu ne penses pas
qu'il y ait d'amie au Canada ?
Oh, je suis sûr que si.
Juste comme j'avais un "ami"
qui a mouillé son lit jusqu'à ses 10 ans.
Sers-toi de ton cerveau, Ted.
Les enfants, il n'y a pas moyen
que Robin soit mariée.
Rien que le suggérer c'est risible.
- Merci, Barney.
- parce que c'est le porno.
J'ai besoin d'une autre bière.
Robin n'était pas dans le porno. Je te parie
tout ce que tu veux qu'elle est mariée.
20 000 dollars que c'est le porno.
Je n'ai pas 20 000 dollars.
Alors qu'est-ce que tu as ?
- Eh bien...
- Non.
Je l'ai.
Le pari ultime...
le pari de la gifle.
Oh, le pari de la gifle.
On le faisait quand j'étais gamin.
C'est quoi un pari de gifle ?
Celui qui a raison peut gifler
l'autre au visage.
aussi fort qu'il le peut...
mais pas de bague.
Vous allez vraiment faire ça ?
C'est si puéril.
- Tu peux être Commissaire au Pari de la Gifle.
- Ooh, j'adore ça. Quels sont mes pouvoirs ?
Si un problème survient et
qu'on ait besoin d'un arbitre, c'est ton job.
Mais tu dois être impartiale
et faire passer l'intégrité
du pari de la gifle avant tout le reste.
C'est un honneur que tu emporteras
dans ta tombe.
Sur ta pierre tombale, on lira,
"Lily Aldrin, épouse aimante,
amie affectueuse,
Commissaire au Pari de la Gifle".
Et sur ta pierre tombale on lira
"A été giflé par Marshall, si fort qu'il en est mort".
Okay. Et si je demandais juste carrément
à Robin si elle a un mari ?
Tu as dit que tu respecterais son intimité,
alors peut-être que tu devrais
juste laisser tomber.
Ouais, tu as raison.
Mari.
Il n'y a pas de "P" dans mari.
Wow, tu sembles en connaître
un rayon sur les maris.
Très bien. Je les reprends.
Oh, hey, puisque tu parles de mari,
c'est génial, tu vas adorer ça.
Marshall, tu connais Marshall.
Il pense que la raison
pour laquelle tu n'as pas voulu venir
au centre commercial l'autre jour
c'est que tu as été mariée
dans un centre commercial
et que tu as un mari au Canada.
Je lui ai dit qu'il était dingue.
Parce qu'il est dingue, pas vrai ?
Je veux dire, c'est pas dingue ça ?
Es-tu en train de me demander
si je suis mariée ?
Eh bien, tu peux me le demander.
Nope, je ne suis pas mariée.
A ton tour.
Qu'est-il arrivé au respect
de mon intimité ?
Ecoute, dis juste :
"Non, je ne suis pas mariée.
Ted, je ne comprends pas
pourquoi tu ne peux pas...
Dis juste :
"Non, je ne suis pas mariée."
Je ne peux pas.
Marshall a raison.
J'étais jeune et je me suis mariée.
C'était une erreur et il a déménagé, mais...
ouais. Je suis mariée.
Tu as un mari ?
J'étais jeune et stupide
et on s'est mariés dans un centre commercial
et on a rompu dans un centre commercial
et je... je ne suis plus allée
dans un centre commercial depuis.
Pourquoi n'as-tu pas divorcé ?
Il est parti à Hong Kong
pour son travail, et j'ai fait genre...
eh, c'est pas grave.
C'est pas grave ?
Si, c'est grave.
Tu commandes des pancakes,
tu as des gaufres, ça c'est pas grave.
Ecoute, je ne l'ai pas vu
depuis des années.
C'est juste une partie de ma vie
que je veux oublier.
N'en parle à personne, s'il te plaît.
Okay.
Mon pote, ta main est monstrueuse.
Ouais, à quoi tu t'attendais ?
Tu as vu mon pénis.
Je n'en reviens pas que tu nous aies dit
le secret de Robin.
Quoi ? Comment aurais-je pu garder
quelque chose comme ça pour moi ?
Et tu m'as supplié de te le dire.
Non, pas du tout.
S'il te plaît, dis-le nous. Dis-le nous.
Je t'en supplie.
Dis-nous. Dis-nous. Dis-nous.
S'il te plaît, s'il te plaît, s'il te plaît...
Très bien.
Robin est mariée.
Ouais, b'en tu n'aurais pas dû nous le dire.
Je veux dire, quelle sorte de petit-ami es-tu ?
Tu vois, justement,
je ne suis pas le petit-ami.
Je suis la maîtresse.
Non, pas la maîtresse.
Le maîtress.
Le maître.
Comment vous appelez ça ?
Uh, je suis plutôt sûr
qu'on va l'appeler maîtresse.
Qu'est-ce que je vais faire ?
Ma petite-amie est mariée.
Je lui demande de divorcer ?
Ted, même si elle est mariée,
c'est un mariage canadien.
C'est comme leur monnaie,
ou leur armée.
Personne ne prend ça au sérieux.
C'est sérieux pour moi.
Tu sais quoi, dans certains pays,
si tu es séparé
depuis plus de cinq ans,
techniquement, tu n'es plus marié.
Je peux le vérifier à la bibliothèque
de droit de l'école.
Je peux voir ma main
imprimée sur ton visage.
Ne te la pète pas trop, Gifleur.
Je viens de recevoir une livraison de pornos
du Canada que je dois passer en revue.
J'ai gagné le pari.
Pourquoi tu cherches encore ?
Ce n'est pas parce que
tu avais raison que j'ai tort.
Oh, c'est ça, comme si tu avais besoin
d'une excuse pour regarder du porno.
Porno canadien.
Crois-moi quand je te dis que
leur système universel de sécurité sociale
ne couvre pas les implants mammaires.
Si je dois encore me taper
une autre Néo-Ecossaise plate
qui monte un policier canadien
à l'arrière d'une surfaceuse,
je deviens dingue.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Ecoute, mon pote, il faut que je te parle,
mais tu dois me promettre
de ne pas le dire à Barney.
Très bien, je ne le dirai pas à Barney.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Robin n'est pas mariée.
- Quoi ?
Pourquoi m'aurait-elle dit
qu'elle l'était ?
Je ne sais pas, mais j'ai vérifié
tous les enregistrements au Canada.
Il n'y a aucune trace
qu'elle ait jamais été mariée.
Il doit y avoir une erreur.
Je te le promets.
Elle n'est pas mariée.
Elle n'est pas top pour
se garer légalement non plus.
Alors elle m'a menti ?
Qu... qu'est-ce que je vais faire ?
Je... je ne peux pas la confronter,
parce qu'elle saura que je te l'ai dit.
Tu vas l'avocater.
Tu vas lui poser un tas de questions,
essayer de l'embrouiller,
peut-être la faire se sentir coupable,
quoi qu'il en coûte
pour obtenir une confession.
Merci de m'avoir dit ton secret.
Ça compte beaucoup pour moi,
que tu puisses être si...
Bon sang, quel est le mot que je cherche ?
Honnête.
Merci, Ted.
Ouais. Tu sais ce qui est probablement
le meilleur à propos de ton honnêteté ?
C'est sa véracité.
Je dis qu'on passe à autre chose.
Eh bien, pour que j'arrive à clore
complètement tout ce truc
"ma petite-amie a un mari",
je pense qu'il me faudrait
un peu plus d'informations,
comme quel mois t'es-tu mariée ?
Juin. On s'est mariés en juin.
Ah, le Canada en juin.
C'est le rêve.
Repas ou buffet ?
B'en, c'est... bizarre
que tu en t'en souviennes pas.
Non, c'est juste que je ne sais pas
quoi répondre
parce qu'on a fait servir les hors d'œuvres
dans l'atrium,
mais le dîner par lui-même
c'était un buffet dans le Self
qui comportait un filet mignon
ou du saumon aux pommes de terre sautées
avec une langouste ciboulette
au beurre blanc.
Groupe ou D.J. ?
Un quatuor à cordes jouait à la cérémonie,
mais pour la réception par elle-même,
on avait un groupe de 7 membres.
On a payé un extra pour le saxo
parce que j'adore ce doux son d'alto.
- Combien de demoiselles d'honneur ?
- Sept.
- Les fleurs ?
- Des azalées.
- Couleur dominante ?
- Vieux rose et terre de sienne.
Nom du mari.
- Tu n'as jamais été mariée !
- Si je l'ai été.
- Non, ce n'est pas vrai.
- Comment le sais-tu ?
J'ai vérifié à la bibliothèque.
- Quelle bibliothèque ?
- Celle du 5ème.
- Quand y es-tu allé ?
- Aujourd'hui au déjeuner,
et j'ai pris un panini pomme-brie
avec une salade de pommes de terre...
Je me fiche de la partie déjeuner, Ted.
Quelle banque de données as-tu utilisée ?
J'ai utilisé Mariage 6000
Centre Commercial Canada.
Très bien, Marshall a vérifié à l'école.
- Tu l'as dit à Marshall ?!
- Tu m'as menti !
Tu vois, c'est pour ça que
je ne dis pas de secrets aux gens.
Tu étais censé être la personne
en qui j'avais le plus confiance
et tu n'as même pas pu garder un secret.
Mais c'était un faux secret.
Ouais, je te testais et tu as échoué.
Et maintenant tu ne sauras jamais
pourquoi je ne vais pas au centre commercial.
Et c'est bon aussi.
Tu me testais ?
C'est débile.
Oh, ouais ? Combien de temps
t'a t'il fallu pour dire à Marshall
mon secret le plus grand ?
Cinq minutes ?
- Ce n'était pas un vrai secret !
- Ouais, mais ça aurait pu l'être.
Tu me rends fou !
Pas étonnant que ton faux mari
ait déménagé à Hong Kong.
Il a déménagé pour le travail.
Toi.
Tu avais quelque chose à me dire ?
De quoi tu parles ?
Je sais que Robin n'a jamais
vraiment été mariée.
Comment est-il possible que tu saches ça ?
Et alors j'ai mis mon pyjama
et je suis entrée dans le lit.
Et toi ?
Oh, voyons... tout d'abord
j'ai pris le métro pour l'école.
Puis j'ai pris un bagel.
Ensuite je suis allé à la bibliothèque et j'ai
découvert que Robin n'avait jamais été mariée.
C'est dingue.
Ensuite j'avais encore faim alors
je suis retourné au distributeur,
mais le temps que je redescende,
je n'avais même plus faim.
- Tu lui as dit ?
- Il le fallait.
Je suis Commissaire au Pari de la Gifle.
Crois-moi, ça me fait plus mal
que ça ne va t'en faire à toi.
Ne compte pas là-dessus.
Je me suis entraîné sur un tronc d'arbre.
- Barney a droit a trois gifles.
- Trois ?
Une parce que tu as menti et deux
pour avoir été giflé prématurément.
Trois gifles.
Mais...
Oh, mon dieu.
- Tu vas pleurer ?
- Non.
Tu vas pleurer.
Je ne pense pas que ça soit sain
d'avoir de gros secrets dans une relation.
Mes parents ne se sont pas
vraiment parlé pendant 30 ans
et maintenant ils sont divorcés.
J'ai partagé plus de moi avec toi
que je n'en ai jamais
partagé avec personne.
Je demande juste que ce seul secret,
qui n'a rien à voir avec nous,
soit le mien.
Alors, je viens de recevoir
un coup de fil très intéressant.
De quoi tu parles ?
Je connais le secret de Robin.
- Quoi ?
- C'est vrai.
Je connais ton secret, Robin.
Ou devrais-je dire Robin Sparkles ?
Comment tu connais ce nom ?
Parce que je connais la vérité,
et je suis sur le point
de vous la montrer dès maintenant.
Approche-toi, Ted,
tu vas vouloir voir ça.
Ouais, non, je ne veux pas.
Quoi ?
Robin veut garder ce secret, alors...
ça va rester un secret.
Ouais, ça ne va pas rester un secret.
Tu vois, lors de mes recherches,
je suis tombé sur un certain gentleman
en Malaisie
qui est en possession
d'une certaine cassette vidéo.
Il m'enverra un e-mail
quand elle sera disponible
sur My Space dans environ... maintenant.
Le monde de Robin est
sur le point de basculer.
Je veux dire, j'imagine.
Barney, ne le fais pas, okay ?
Robin, ne panique pas s'il te plaît.
Je n'en montrerai que suffisamment
pour prouver à Marshall que j'avais raison.
Non, Barney, j'ai dit
qu'on n'allait pas regarder ça.
Non, il est temps.
Ecoute, j'apprécie ce
que tu essayes de faire,
mais si c'est là, ce n'est plus
la peine d'essayer de le cacher.
Regardons-la et qu'on en finisse avec ça.
Es-tu aussi terrifié que moi ?
Je ne veux pas être encore giflé.
Je veux préciser que j'étais jeune.
Ouais, tu l'étais.
Et je n'avais pas le choix.
Elles ne l'ont jamais.
Et ça a commencé comme un boulot
de modèle innocent.
Comme toujours.
S'il vous plaît, Mr. Johnson.
Je suis désolée d'avoir été une vilaine fille.
S'il vous plaît ne me collez pas.
Y a t'il quelque chose que je puisse
faire pour arranger ça avec vous ?
Oh, mon dieu.
Eh bien, de toute évidence,
j'ai prouvé que j'avais raison,
alors par respect pour Robin,
je n'en montrerai pas plus.
De surcroît, il se fait tard.
C'est déjà l'heure de la gifle.
C'était quoi ça ?
Heu... j'ai parié une gifle avec Marshall
que tu avais fait du porno, alors je gagne.
Du porno ?
J'aurais préféré que ça soit du porno.
Ç'aurait été moins embarrassant.
Je sais.
Et si je vous chantais une chanson ?
Allons au centre commercial,
tout le monde !
J'était une pop star adolescente au Canada.
# Put on your jelly bracelets #
# And your cool graffiti coat #
# At the mall, having fun #
# Is what it's all about #
C'est la chose la plus incroyable
que j'aie jamais vue.
- C'est toi ?
- Oui.
J'ai eu un petit succès.
J'ai dû parcourir tout le Canada et chanter
cette chanson dans les centres commerciaux.
Pendant toute une année, j'ai vécu
d'Oranges Juliuses et de Bretzels Wetzel.
# Everybody come and play #
# Throw every last care away #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Today #
Si c'est les années 90,
pourquoi ça a l'air d'être en 1986 ?
Les années 80 ne sont pas arrivées
au Canada avant genre 1993.
Faisons un break parmi le premier
des très nombreux visionnages,
je ne peux pas m'empêcher
de remarquer que ce n'est pas du porno.
Et pourtant, une gifle
s'est produite sans l'autorisation
du Commissaire au Pari de la Gifle.
On dirait que quelqu'un a subi
un giflage prématuré.
Oh, mon dieu, Robin rappe.
Les amis, Robin rappe.
# Went to the mall #
# with a couple of friends #
# I had a whole week's #
# allowance to spend #
Okay, je vais te laisser le choix.
Soit 10 gifles à la suite tout de suite,
soit 5 gifles qui peuvent
être données au hasard
à n'importe quel moment entre
maintenant et l'éternité.
Prends les 10 maintenant.
Pas moyen, pourquoi en prendre 10
quand tu peux n'en avoir que 5 ?
Ouais, mais la peur constante
de savoir qu'à tout moment,
tu pourrais être giflé,
te rendrait fou.
Je vais prendre les 5 pour l'éternité.
- Bon choix.
- Horrible choix.
Relax, mon pote,
je prends juste mon soda, mec.
Détends-toi.
Ça va être drôle.
# Let's go to the mall #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Today #
Alors, juste pour être claire,
tu voulais que tout le monde aille
au centre commercial aujourd'hui ?
Wow, on va beaucoup regarder ça.
Je n'en reviens pas d'avoir
porté un blouson en jean délavé.
Hey, juste pour que tu saches,
à 16 ans, j'aurais été dingue de toi.
Tu aurais pu être la petite amie au Canada
que je disais à tout le monde que j'avais.
Hey, je suis vraiment désolé
de m'être mêlé de ça.
J'aurais probablement dû
laisser tomber.
Tu sais quoi ?
Tu me connais mieux maintenant.
C'est sympa.
Et d'une.
# Everybody come and play #
# Throw every last care away #
Wow.
# Let's go to the mall #
# Today #
Tu devais rire comme ça à chaque fois ?
Oui.
# This boy I like #
# Met him at the food court #
# He's got hair like Gretzky #
# And he does jumps #
# on his skateboard #
# I hope he asks me out #
# Take me to my favorite spot #
# It'll be just him and me #
# But don't forget the robot #
Le robot. Hey !
# But, baby, I don't want to wait #
# Let's do it #
Non, elle ne veut pas attendre.
# I'm gonna rock your body anyway #
# I'm gonna rock your body #
# till Canada Day #
# Everybody come and play #
# Throw every last care away #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Today, today, today, today #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
# Let's go to the mall #
# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
# Let's go to the mall #

Les enfants, il n'y a rien
de plus merveilleux
que New York City en hiver...
à part la vue de New York City
en hiver
par la fenêtre de votre appartement.
Pendant l'hiver 2006,
Marshall, Lily, Robin et moi
étions tous en mode hibernation
profonde en couple.
Malheureusement, ça laissait
Oncle Barney dehors dans le froid.
Okay. Rave toute la nuit,
usine de pneus abandonnée à Newark.
On est sur la liste.
Qui est partant ?
- Nope.
- Non.
Jet privé. Aéroport de Teeterboro,
parachutisme-nu. Qui est partant ?
- Nope.
- Non, merci.
Une bière. Bar, en bas, 15 secondes
de marche. Qui est partant ?
Chut... Lily s'est endormie.
Ça allait si mal que Barney a essayé
d'être son propre ailier.
Salut. M'avez-vous rencontré ?
En dernier lieu, il décida
d'amener des renforts.
- Non.
- Non.
Oui. Et vous savez pourquoi ?
Accrochez-vous à vos escarres,
grands-parents de Willy Wonka,
parce que devinez qui est en route
pour cet appartement en ce moment même ?
Mon... j'y arrive...
frère, James. Réagissez.
- Hey !
- Hey !
- Tu as un frère ?
- Ouais.
C'est type le plus "formidable-issime",
le plus "sublime-issime"
et le plus génial de tous les temps.
Il est exactement comme Barney.
C'est ce que je viens de dire.
Eh bien, Barney et son frère ne sont pas
exactement identiques.
James est gay.
Vraiment ?
Même en un million d'années,
je ne t'aurais jamais imaginé avec
un frère gay, c'est formidable.
Ouais. Je voulais juste
que tu sois prévenue,
pour que tu n'aies pas l'air
toute surprise quand il arrivera.
Le voilà.
Quoi de neuf, New York.
Merci pour l'avertissement.
Bon sang, pourquoi le fait que
Barney ait un frère noir et gay
n'a t'il jamais été évoqué ?
Il est noir ?
J'imagine que je suis le genre
de personne qui se focalise plus
sur ce que les gens ont à l'intérieur
que sur la couleur de leur peau.
Je plaisante,
je voulais juste voir ta tête.
Ouais, alors le mariage est
de nouveau à l'ordre du jour.
A part ça, James, comment vas-tu ?
Formidable, comme d'hab.
Je viens de faire du parachutisme-nu.
Légendaire.
Et mon équipe de laser tag vient
de remporter les finales régionales.
"Plus légendaire".
Et tu dois déjà avoir
remarqué le costume...
allez-y, touchez.
Fait à la main par Pietro Dellacamera,
le célèbre tailleur de Milan de 101 ans
qui, alors qu'il accomplissait
le tout dernier point de ce costume,
est tombé raide mort,
ce qui est ironique,
parce que c'est comme ça
que je suis vraiment magnifique dedans.
Allez.
Tape m'en cinq.
"Tape m'en cinq" est de retour ?
Oh, ouais.
Je l'ai mis dans mon blog ce matin.
Les copains, "tape m'en cinq"
est de retour !
Oh, James, voici ma petite amie, Robin.
- Hey. C'est sympa de te rencontrer.
- Toi aussi.
Alors, je dois demander,
il y a une histoire, là.
- Je t'en prie.
- Je t'en prie.
La vérité c'est que Barney et James
ont eu beaucoup...
d'explications différentes
de leur mère au fil des ans.
Eh bien, les garçons,
vous êtes différents
parce que quand j'étais enceinte de toi,
je ne mangeais que
de la glace à la vanille.
Et quand j'étais enceinte de toi,
peux-tu deviner quelle sorte
de glace je mangeais ?
- Café ?
- Non, James,
Je mangeais de la glace au chocolat.
Mais j'ai bu des tonnes de café quand
j'étais enceinte de l'un comme de l'autre.
Je ne peux pas fumer sans mon café.
Je ne sais pas, les garçons, j'imagine
que c'est juste l'une de ces choses.
Arrêtez de me demander !
Vous savez ce que vous êtes tous les deux ?
Vous êtes des petits racistes !
Alors, qu'est-ce que
vous allez faire ce soir ?
Je vais te dire ce que James va faire.
Il va faire le boulot que tu as négligé.
Et, comme toujours, il le fera bien mieux
que tu ne l'as jamais fait.
Ted...
James est mon ailier maintenant.
Okay.
La dernière fois que James était en ville,
Barney s'est fait gifler une fois,
a eu de la chance deux fois, et...
dans le jacuzzi en terrasse
de qui as-tu terminé ?
Ah, personnage public,
accord de confidentialité.
Mais je dirai ceci :
beaucoup trop de poils pour un type
qui peut se permettre de s'offrir
une épilation au laser.
Et puis il y a eu la fois où ils ont marqué
avec le combo frère/sœur
C'était tout ce dont on avait
toujours rêvé de
quand on regardait Donnie et Marie.
Elle était un petit peu campagne.
Il était un petit peu intéressé
par les blacks.
Ouais, Barney et James ensemble
formaient une association mortelle.
Puisqu'il n'y avait jamais
de mélange dans les cibles,
James était toujours là pour apporter
l'aide voulue à Barney.
Whoa. Votre écharpe...
elle est terrible !
Merci. H & M.
Quoi ?
J'aurais pu ne jamais le savoir,
parce qu'elle est si chaude que mes yeux
fondent. Oh, je ne vois plus rien.
Hey ! Vous savez, en parlant de choses
qui feraient très bien
drapées autour de vous,
avez-vous rencontré
mon frère hétéro, Barney ?
Oh, il est fab... ne bougez pas...
"uleux". Okay ?
Et Barney retournait toujours le service.
A l'aide, je pense qu'il ne respire pas.
Quelqu'un sait faire le bouche à bouche ?
Oh, mon dieu, moi !
Okay, super.
Pourquoi pas vous à la place ?
Oh, mec, je suis si excité
que tu sois là !
Ça fait une éternité que
je n'ai pas traîné avec quelqu'un
même très loin d'être drôle.
Heu, oui, en voulant vous offenser.
Vous sortez toujours avec nous
ce soir, hein ?
- Non.
- Je suis en pyjama.
Ce soir ?
C'est après 21 heures et...
j'ai le ventre plein de soupe chaude.
Oh, non, non, non, non, non.
Les amis...
vous êtes des personnes jeunes,
attirantes
dans la ville la plus géniale du monde.
Il y a des garçons et des filles
dans Tout le Monde s'en fout, Wyoming,
qui souhaiteraient être là.
Mais au lieu de ça, ils sont
dans le sous-sol de quelqu'un,
à boire de la mauvaise
boisson maltée alcoolisée,
à discuter s'ils vont passer
leur samedi soir
dans le parking du supermarché
ou dans le sous-sol d'un autre type.
Vous leur devez de vous lever
et de balancer vos fesses flemmardes
dans quelque chose de sexy,
de sortir de là et de vivre leur rêve !
- Je peux avoir un "Bordel, ouais" ?
- Bordel, ouais !
- Je peux avoir un "Bordel, ouais" ?
- Bordel, ouais !
- Je peux avoir un "woo-woo" ?
- Woo-woo!
Faisons-le pour le Wyoming !
Oui !
Témoigne !
Alors ce soir-là,
Barney a réalisé son vœu.
On était tous sortis.
Papa est à la maison !
Ouais.
D'accord, frérot.
Qu'est-ce qui te branche ?
Le type au T-shirt noir super moulant ?
Le type noir super tendu ?
Le type qui ressemble à Mr. T. ?
Hmm, oui, oui, et...
reparle-m'en après deux Martini.
Concentrons-nous sur toi, mon pote.
Je me sens nonchalant.
Pourquoi pas la fille
avec le Chocolatini ?
Oh... boom, tatouage dans le dos.
Le héros et le porc ?
- En voiture.
- C'est sûr.
Bon sang, bébé, sympa le tatouage !
- Lâche-moi, espèce de porc !
- Hey ! Hey !
Son art corporel n'est pas
une invitation à la tripoter,
c'est une expression
de sa connaissance de soi.
Je suis sûre que de beaucoup de manières,
elle est le dauphin encerclé par les fleurs.
- Quoi ? Quoi ?
- Quoi ? Quoi ?
Cool.
S'il recommence à vous ennuyer,
dites-le moi.
Merci. Vous ne devriez pas
vous éloigner... juste au cas où.
Bien sûr. Si ça peut vous rassurer.
Je suis Barney.
Maintenant, les enfants, quand
vous êtes dans un bar bruyant et bondé,
vous pouvez toujours voir la différence
entre les célibataires
et les couples.
Il vous suffit de rechercher les signes.
- Rupture.
- Brûlant.
Les célibataires restent debout
pour la manœuvrabilité.
- Hey !
- Salut, comment allez-vous ?
Vous avez rencontré mon frère ?
Oh, hello.
Prenez un verre.
Enchanté de faire votre connaissance.
Les couples, épuisés rien que par
le fait d'avoir quitté la maison,
ne se préoccupent que de trouver
un endroit pour s'asseoir.
Il y a aussi beaucoup d'autres signaux.
Du choix du lubrifiant social...
...au langage du corps de base.
Tout ça pour dire,
il y a beaucoup de manières de dire
si quelqu'un a l'Endurance Célibataire
ou le Coma des Couples.
J'aurais mieux fait de mettre des baskets.
Je viens juste d'échapper
à un gros type velu,
dont le périscope sortait
de son pantalon en faux cuir.
Permission de monter à bord refusée.
Mon pyjama me manque.
Je n'en reviens pas de porter
un soutien-gorge pour ça.
Les soutien-gorges craignent.
Ils sont si confinants et artificiels.
Ouais, ils sont comme un zoo
pour nichons.
Pourquoi ne les retirez-vous pas,
pour laisser ces petites bêtes respirer ?
Oh, s'il vous plaît,
allez transpirer sur quelqu'un d'autre.
Pauvre mec.
Pauvre mec ?
Mes pauvres seins.
Eh bien, il lui a fallu beaucoup de cran
pour aborder une fille
et tu viens de l'écrabouiller.
Oh, ouais, ouais.
Il a l'air tout cassé de l'intérieur.
Vous les mecs, n'avez aucune idée
de ce que ça fait
d'écoper.
"Oh, pauvre de moi.
Je suis une jolie fille
et tout le monde, où que ce soit,
veut m'offrir des boissons
et faire l'amour avec moi."
Waa.
"Oh, pauvre de moi. Je dois commander
de savoureuses boissons roses
avec de vrais morceaux de fruits
que ces types aiment secrètement,
mais qu'ils ne peuvent pas commander
parce qu'on se foutrait d'eux."
- Mon pote.
- C'est délicieux !
Excusez-moi.
On trinque ?
Oh, non merci.
J'ai eu mon compte.
Il a trop la forme,
on passerait la nuit à parler
de son tissu adipeux corporel.
Maintenant, si vous voulez bien m'excuser,
Je vais aller chercher une savoureuse
boisson rose avec des fruits...
parce que je peux le faire.
Vous savez, c'était genre
le troisième type canon
que James envoie balader ce soir.
Ouais, il refuse des tournées,
il est fatigué,
il se plaint de ses pieds.
Il va aussi mal que nous.
Il l'est.
Attends, il va aussi mal que nous.
Vous ne pensez pas que James ait...
une relation ?
Non. Pas moyen.
C'est le frère de Barney.
Regardez ça.
Il envoie un texto !
Oh, mon dieu !
Il est en couple.
Ça va achever Barney.
Qu'est-ce qui va m'achever ?
Que se passe t-il ?
B... Barney ?
As-tu remarqué quelque chose...
de différent à propos de James ?
Non.
Je veux dire, il rayonne littéralement,
si c'est ce que vous voulez dire.
Nous avons des raisons
de croire que James est, heu...
peut-être en train
de te cacher quelque chose.
Je... je sais que tu ne vas pas
aimer entendre ça, mais...
Barney...
ton frère est...
monogame.
C'est ridicule !
Juste parce qu'il est
un peu somnolent,
et qu'il n'a baisé avec personne
dans un compartiment des toilettes...
Il n'a baisé avec personne
dans un compartiment des toilettes...
Et, Barney...
je déteste être celle
qui t'annonce ça, mais...
Il envoie des textos.
Non, il...
Non !
C'est... impossible.
Excusez... Excusez... Ex...
Hey, frérot.
Ne change pas de sujet.
Fais-moi voir ton téléphone.
Pourquoi ?
Je veux juste voir ton téléphone.
Fais-moi voir ton téléphone.
Non, c'est juste un téléphone.
C'est juste un téléphone !
Et il a l'accès à Internet
et un appareil photo intégré,
et tu peux surfer sur le Web
et faire ce que tu veux.
C'est vraiment dingue
comme la technologie est avancée.
Tu as quoi comme téléphone ?
J'ai...
Qui est-ce ?
Et la réponse ferait bien d'être :
"Je ne me souviens plus de son nom."
C'est Tom.
Et c'est mon fiancé.
Hey.
Je ne soutiens pas ça.
Le mariage gay ?
Pas le mariage gay !
Le mariage !
Comment peux-tu faire ça ?
On a été élevés dans la même maison,
avec les mêmes valeurs !
Crois-moi,
j'ai longtemps combattu ça.
Allez, c'est embarrassant.
Ecoute, à moi aussi au début
ça m'a semblé contre nature.
Mais je suis tombé amoureux.
Et Tom et moi avons réalisé
qu'on ne peut pas combattre l'amour.
Oh, mon dieu.
C'est ce que vous faites ensemble ?
Vous restez à la maison
à parler d'amour ?
Je crois... que je vais vomir.
Okay, okay, écoute,
Il faut que tu te fasses
à cette idée, okay ?
Parce que ça va arriver.
Et je veux que tu sois mon témoin.
Quoi ? Pas moyen.
Je suis désolé
que tu le prennes comme ça.
J'espère que tu changeras d'avis.
Deux bières, un shot.
Oh, c'est une putain d'épidémie !
Oh, chéri !
Tu l'as préparé pour moi ?
Oui.
Clam Bake. Staten Island.
Qui est partant ?
Okay, je n'avais pas
de grands espoirs pour ça.
Okay, voilà mon problème.
Si les gay
commencent à se marier,
alors soudain
le monde entier va le faire.
C'est comme ça que ça fonctionne.
Ils commencent quelque chose,
puis six mois plus tard,
tout le monde les suit.
Comme le fait que maintenant
tout le monde se fait faire des manucures.
Je ne me fais pas
faire de manucures.
Okay, alors le fait...
de se faire épiler le torse à la cire.
Tu te fais épiler
le torse à la cire ?
Vous voyez ce que je veux dire !
Le mariage gay va faire disparaître la vie
de célibataire telle qu'on la connaît.
Pensez à la façon dont
la famille américaine sera renforcée.
Barney, je suis désolé que ça te contrarie,
mais il va falloir que tu le digères
et que tu te comportes en homme.
Non.
Ça a toujours été lui et moi ensemble,
à faire des trucs géniaux,
alors que vous autres
marchiez deux par deux
sur votre arche de l'ennui
sans sexe.
Juste parce que James va se marier,
ça ne veut pas dire
que les choses vont changer.
Ouais. Comme si les choses
n'avaient pas changé pour vous.
Ecoute, ma sœur a épousé
un type que je n'aimais pas.
Des chaussettes dans des sandalettes ?
Voyons !
Mais on est sortis,
on a célébré ça.
C'était la chose à faire.
Tu dois le soutenir.
Tu as raison, Ted.
C'est un motif de célébration.
Il faut qu'on sorte
et qu'on célèbre l'engagement
que lui et Tom
sont sur le point de prendre.
Ouais. C'est ici qu'on célèbre
l'engagement que Tom et moi
sommes sur le point de prendre ?
Quoi ? Ouais !
Tu vois, cette cage
représente votre engagement.
Oh, mon dieu. La liberté
n'a jamais eu meilleur goût.
Hey.
Tu fais de l'exercice ?
Oui.
Et merci de l'avoir remarqué.
Manifestement, tu es également
en excellente forme.
J'essaie.
Tu veux danser ?
Tu sais quoi ? Je suis vraiment flatté,
et objectivement,
tu es un homme très séduisant,
mais voici ma fiancée.
Je suis désolé. Tu sais,
j'ai vu ton verre, et je...
Non, non, ce n'est pas mon verre.
C'est le sien.
Non.
Peu importe.
Et toi ?
Oh, je suis aussi hétéro.
Mais je te remercie
pour ton temps,
et j'apprécie l'intérêt
que tu portes à mon corps.
Vous voyez ça ?
Se faire draguer
n'est pas forcément si terrible.
Je me sens flatté,
et tout le monde garde sa dignité.
Eh, j'aime beaucoup ton chandail.
Wow. Tu le penses vraiment,
n'est-ce pas ?
Tu le mattes pas mes seins
ni quoi que ce soit.
Je m'appelle Gay Ken,
tu crois quoi ?
J'adore cet endroit !
Allons danser !
- Et sans se faire peloter !
- Whoo ! Merci.
- Eh ben...
- Merci !
- On est sexy.
- Complètement.
Et Tom dit alors au revendeur
que l'horloge géorgienne
faite à la main a un coin ébréché.
Blam, on a eu cette merveille à moitié prix.
Qu'est-ce que t'en dis ?!
Bam !
On dirait que tu as vraiment fait des affaires
à ce Salon Créations et Savoir-Faire.
Oh, ouais, oh, ouais.
Hey, oh mon dieu.
C'est tellement libérateur
de pouvoir en parler avec toi.
J'ai hâte que tu rencontres Tom.
Et j'ai hâte que
tu rencontres mon bon ami...
ce type.
Excuse-moi, tu connaîtrais
quelqu'un à qui ça dirait de payer
un verre à mon frère incroyablement
musclé, marrant et généreux ?
Eh, eh, eh, concentrons-nous
sur toi, Barnaby. Okay.
Bien. Je repère un groupe de femmes
qui a baissé ses défenses
parce qu'elles sont
dans un club gay.
Tu vois la nana là-bas ?
Elle pourrait bien craquer pour
un agent sportif et un joueur de foot.
Okay, je marche.
Je suis lequel ?
Je t'en prie.
Il est très timide, il aime le tennis
et le Brésil, et il baisse son pantalon
après trois Martini secs.
Maintenant vas-y, mec, vas-y !
Je n'aurais jamais imaginé
voir Barney aussi vulnérable.
Je suppose que personne n'a envie d'avoir
l'impression de traverser le monde seul.
Regardez-moi, au milieu
d'un appétissant sandwich !
Okay, on est en plein milieu
d'un truc, là, alors...
Ooh, je sais au milieu de quoi
je voudrais être. Des idées ?
Deux hétéros ne peuvent-il pas
venir dans un club gay,
apprécier de la techno et une chouette
conversation sans se faire importuner ?
Comment ça va, les mecs ? Vous appréciez
toujours les attentions des hommes ?
C'est au moins le huitième type
qui nous drague en 10 minutes.
C'est du genre, salut,
mes yeux se trouvent là.
Et ce ne sont jamais
les séduisants.
Ce sont toujours les losers.
Ça me gonfle !
On dirait que les garçons
ont appris leur leçon.
Ça te manque qu'on te drague ?
Oh, complètement.
Allons nous trouver un sports bar.
James, James, puisque tu aimes
les Salons Créations et Savoir-Faire,
regarde ce que Charles a fait
avec des tiges de cerises.
Il l'a fait avec sa langue.
Ouais.
Barney.
Alors Charles, tu pourrais mettre
ton numéro dans le téléphone de mon frère,
et lorsqu'il sera
d'humeur plus joyeuse...
Barney, Barney,
je ne veux pas de son numéro.
Je ne veux le numéro
de personne, okay ?
Je vais me marier.
Wow.
- Félicitations à vous deux.
- Merci.
Mon numéro est dedans.
Je suis très discret.
Okay, okay, pardon.
Barney, discussion de famille.
Okay, mec, il faut que
tu arrêtes ça, okay ?
Je sais que mon mariage
menace ton style de vie...
Oh, alors maintenant,
c'est mon style de vie ?
Je croyais que
c'était notre style de vie.
Tu lui as complètement
tourné le dos.
Regarde-toi,
tu ne portes même pas de costume.
Tu te souviens pourquoi
on porte le costume, James ?
Pour s'envoyer en l'air.
Pour montrer aux gens
qu'on est différents
des millions de moutons
en T-shirts et jeans.
Le costume montre qu'on est
une force sur laquelle on peut compter,
une armée de deux personnes
qui joue selon ses propres règles.
Mais tu as enlevé l'uniforme,
tu as franchi la ligne ennemie,
et tu m'as abandonné.
Eh bien, je ne vais pas
te laisser faire.
Il n'est pas trop tard pour faire
marche arrière dans ce stupide mariage !
Tu n'es pas obligé
de faire ça, frangin.
- Si.
- Pourquoi ?!
Parce que Tom et moi
allons avoir un bébé.
Quoi ?
Il va y avoir un bébé ?
Oui. On adopte.
Oh mon dieu.
Je vais être tonton ?
Pour le reste de ta vie.
Et c'est comme ça que
Barney est devenu oncle Barney.
Un an plus tard,
au mariage de James,
Barney n'aurait pas pu
être plus fier.
A James et Tom.
Que vous puissiez passer
une longue et heureuse vie ensemble.
Et que je puisse toujours avoir une peau
et une libido d'un homme bien plus jeune.
- Santé.
- Santé.
Bien dit.
Merci. J'ai décidé de laisser de côté
la phase hétéro de l'université.
Personne n'a envie d'entendre ça.
C'était parfait.
Tu as même fait pleurer
le père de Tom.
Ça fait peut-être ça
parce qu'il est républicain.
Whoa.
Il est 21h.
On devrait rentrer.
Vous voulez qu'on partage un taxi ?
Euh non, je crois que
je vais rester encore un peu.
Ouais, moi aussi.
Je ne suis pas du tout fatiguée.
Bon, il se fait tard. Il faut que
je raccompagne la femme à la maison.
Oh, arrête de m'appeler comme ça.
Ça donne l'impression que je suis grosse.
Oh, c'est une putain d'épidémie !
- Je peux ?
- Ouais.
Hey, mon pote.
Tes parents sont mariés.
Maintenant écoute-moi.
Juste parce que tu es élevé
par un couple marié
ne veut pas dire que
tu doives choisir ce style de vie.
Tope-là.
Heureusement, tu m'as.
Dans 20 ans 1/2, tu auras 21 ans,
et j'en aurai...
eh bien, je n'ai pas encore
décidé quel âge j'aurai.
Mais on va aller s'éclater,
dans le style oncle et neveu.
Reste avec moi, gamin.
Je vais t'apprendre à vivre.
Super costume, au fait.
Qui est le plus mignon ?
Je ne comprends pas.
Tom aimait ma poitrine en seconde.
Pourquoi
ne l'aime t'il plus maintenant ?
Pourquoi ?
Rosa, pourquoi toujours être attirée
par ceux qui ne sont pas disponibles ?
Pourquoi ne pas accepter le fait
que tu es une magnifique femme
qui mérite d'être aimée ?
Es-tu suffisamment courageuse
pour entendre ça ?
Tu...

Les enfants, comme vous le savez,
Noël est une période qu'on passe en famille.
Alors en décembre 2006,
j'avais 3 options.
Le passer avec ma mère
et son nouveau copain Clint,
le passer avec mon père
et sa nouvelle copine la brasserie,
ou aller à Staten Island
pour le passer
avec ma très religieuse
cousine Stacy et sa famille.
Alors je n'ai opté
pour aucune de ces solutions
et j'ai décidé de passer
Noël 2006 à Manhattan...
pour le fêter
avec mon autre famille.
Okay, il me reste un dernier devoir
à rendre aujourd'hui à 17h,
donc jusque là,
je serai à la bibliothèque de l'école,
mais je ne dois être dérangé
sous aucun prétexte.
Mec, ouvre les yeux.
Tu vas te faire mal.
Non, non. Le féerique réveillon
au paysage d'hiver sera ma récompense
pour avoir terminé mon devoir.
Bébé, est-ce que ce sont
tes biscuits à la cannelle que je sens ?
Oui.
Pauvre de moi
et de mes autres sens exacerbés.
Il faut que je sois fort.
Okay, je serai de retour à 17h.
Gardez-moi au moins 20 biscuits
et ne lavez pas le bol.
C'était un renne ?
Je ne veux pas savoir !
Eh, regarde.
Notre vieux répondeur.
Oh ouais. Après ton départ,
on l'a débranché
parce que ça rappelait à Marshall que
tu avais l'habitude de laisser des messages.
Mais vous êtes
à nouveau ensemble.
Je propose qu'on le rebranche.
C'est chouette
que tu sois de retour.
Merci.
Oh regarde,
il y a encore des messages dessus.
Salut Ted, c'est papa,
j'appelle pour avoir des nouvelles.
Je vais pêcher ce week-end
avec mon ami Clint,
alors si je n'ai pas de nouvelles de toi
avant, je te reparlerai le week-end prochain.
Oui, le même Clint.
Salut Marshall. T'es couché sur le canapé
à te morfondre au sujet de Lily ?
C'est ça, n'est-ce pas ?
Eh b'en arrête.
Elle n'en vaut pas la peine.
Il faut que tu oublies ce Grinch.
Mais je n'ai pas dit "Grinch."
J'ai dit un mot terrible.
Un mot vraiment vraiment terrible.
Oh, zut.
Mais je n'ai pas dit zut.
Je suis... un quoi ?
Je... C'était Barney,
c'était Barney.
- C'était toi, Ted.
- C'était Marshall.
Marshall a laissé
un message pour Marshall ?
Tu sais, c'était peut-être moi,
mais c'était il y a si longtemps.
Bon sang, cette machine
déforme vraiment les voix.
Tu sais, on aurait presque cru
que j'ai dit...
Pourquoi m'avoir appelée comme ça ?
C'était une question légitime.
Sa rupture avec Lily a plongé Marshall
dans une profonde dépression
et rien ne pouvait
l'en faire sortir.
Jusqu'au jour où...
Elle était parfaite.
J'ai perdu la femme parfaite.
J'aurais dû la mettre en cloque
quand j'en avais la possibilité.
Okay. Ça suffit.
Tu ne l'oublieras jamais
tant que tu la mettras sur un piédestal.
Donc plus de glace jusqu'à ce que
tu me cites un défaut chez Lily.
Il en existe une seule
comme elle ?
Okay.
Elle a annulé votre mariage
et t'a largué pour
aller peindre à San Francisco.
Comment tu appelles ça ?
Une redoutable indépendance ?
Du courage ?
Je suppose que
c'était légèrement égoïste.
On y est.
Et en un rien de temps, cette étincelle
s'est transformée en une belle flambée.
Ouais. Non, vous avez raison.
Lily riait pour tout.
Elle se lâchait
sur un mauvais calembour.
Je vous le dis,
c'est une rieuse facile.
Vous vous souvenez de la fois
où on l'a entendue rire
et qu'on a cru qu'elle regardait
Week-end chez Bernie,
alors qu'en fait, elle regardait
Week-end chez Bernie 2 ?
Et son art ?
"Je m'appelle Lily,
je suis une artiste."
Elle n'a même pas de béret.
Ouais, et si elle est
une si grande "artiste",
pourquoi est-elle
si nulle au Pictionary ?
Qui dessine une étoile Ninja
comme une Étoile de David, hein ?
Ouais !
- Une autre tournée !
- Ouais !
J'essayais de l'aider.
Je suis son meilleur ami.
C'est le boulot du meilleur ami.
Le boulot du meilleur ami
est de me traiter de ce mot ?
Ouais.
Oh, Ted.
Oh, Teddy boy.
Pourquoi en faire tout un plat ?
C'est juste un mot.
On utilise un tas de mots
tous les jours.
Il ne devrait pas être différent
de tous les autres mots.
Alors pourquoi
ne le dis-tu pas maintenant ?
Grinch.
Tu avais prévu ça,
n'est-ce pas ?
Exactement.
Eh b'en au moins
tu t'es excusé.
Tu t'es excusé, n'est-ce pas ?
Oh, ouais.
"Je suis désolé" sont les premiers mots
qui sont sortis de ma bouche.
Je suis désolé,
mais je ne vais pas m'excuser.
J'essayais juste
de le remettre sur pieds.
Tu l'avais réduit en pièces.
Tu ne vas vraiment pas t'excuser
d'avoir laissé ce message ?
- Non !
- Pourquoi pas ?
Parce que, Lily, cet été
tu étais une sorte de Grinch.
Oh, tu vas le regretter,
Ted Mosby.
Ted Vivian Mosby !
Ce n'est pas mon deuxième prénom.
Tu embrasses ta mère
avec cette bouche ?
Comme si tu n'avais jamais
prononcé ce mot.
Je n'embrasse pas ta mère
avec ma bouche.
Pas encore.
Tu es malade ?
On est malade quand on trouve
la maturité et l'expérience sexy ?
Non, je voulais dire :
est-ce que tu as un rhume ?
Je vais bien.
Je vais bien. Mon nez
a un trop-plein de grandiosité
et il fallait que
j'en laisse un peu sortir.
Maintenant, si vous voulez bien
m'excuser, les fêtes sont une période
où les gens sont seuls
et désespérés.
C'est la plus belle
période de l'année.
Je devrais aller m'excuser.
C'est le réveillon de Noël.
Ouais, enfin, des portes qui claquent
et des insultes proférées ?
Si j'avais voulu ça, je serais
rentrée chez moi pour les fêtes.
Je ne vois pas de gui, mais...
Oh ! Oh mon dieu !
Euh... "à vos souhaits"
aurait été sympa.
- Tu es malade.
- Je ne suis pas malade.
- Tu es malade.
- Tu sais quoi ? Je suis malade.
Malade que tu me dises
que je suis malade. Quoi de neuf ?
Ahh... trois étages
et pas une goûte de renversée.
Hey, mon pote.
Tu es sûr que ça va marcher ?
Ouais, c'est notre truc.
À la fac, à chaque fois que
je voulais me réconcilier avec elle,
je lui achetais une bière.
- Mignon, n'est-ce pas ?
- Tout à fait.
Avec en plus une chope gratuite.
Okay, viens.
En temps normal,
ça aurait marché,
mais il s'est avéré que c'était un problème
que même l'alcool ne pouvait pas résoudre.
En fait, la bière a un peu aidé.
Elle a emporté les décorations.
Elle a emporté les décorations !
Quel Grinch !
Cette fois-ci, j'ai dit "Grinch".
Très bien.
Je suppose qu'il faut
que je l'appelle, pas vrai ?
Portable de Lily.
Elle reviendra à la raison,
pas vrai ?
Oh, salut Billy.
En fait, c'est marrant,
la numérotation vocale t'a appelé.
Je voulais appeler...
Oh, désolé de l'apprendre.
Ouais, les fêtes sont une période
difficile pour tout le monde, Billy.
Okay, ouais,
dîner mercredi prochain.
Okay.
Satanée numérotation vocale.
Barney !
Mais qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Reviens à l'intérieur,
ça gèle dehors. T'es dingue ?
Eh, il faut t'en prendre à Lily
et à sa règle oppressive qui dit
"pas de cigare dans l'appartement".
Bon dieu, c'est comme si
Marshall épousait le Taliban.
Tope-là.
Beurk. Non.
Il faut que tu rentres chez toi
et que tu te couches.
Oh Robin, ma tendre amie
du nord sauvage,
laisse-moi te parler
d'une petite chose que j'aime appeler
"supériorité de l'esprit sur le corps".
Tu vois,
quand je commence à être malade,
j'arrête simplement d'être malade
pour être génial à la place.
Histoire vraie.
Ouais, dans 2 minutes,
je vais descendre un pack
de six Red Bull, sauter dans un taxi,
jouer deux heures de Laser Tag,
peut-être me faire
faire un bronzage par spray.
Ça va être légen...
attends la suite...
Lily !
Joyeux Noël, connard.
Um, Lily ?
Où sont les décorations de Noël ?
Dans mon appartement.
Tu veux bien les ramener pour qu'on puisse
fêter Noël ensemble, s'il te plaît ?
Ted, tu sais ce que je ferais
si l'un de mes élèves de maternelle
utilisait un tel langage ?
J'appellerais ses parents.
Ouais, je ne suis pas en maternelle.
Exactement. Tu connais
la signification de ce mot.
Tu sais que traiter les gens
de noms d'oiseaux est méchant et blessant...
connard.
Lily, si tu ne ramènes pas tout ça
tout de suite, on...
Elle a raccroché.
Elle est juste fâchée.
Elle va se calmer.
Lily...
N'oublie pas de sortir
les biscuits du four...
connard !
Bon sang !
Je pourrais être à Cleveland en train de
faire de la bière à la menthe avec mon père.
Où tu vas ?
Marshall rentre dans trois heures.
Il va débarquer, et pas de Lily,
pas de féerique paysage d'hiver.
Il faut que j'aille dans le Bronx.
...daire.
Salut mec,
comment avance ton devoir ?
On se fiche du devoir, à quoi ressemble
le féerique paysage d'hiver ? C'est magique ?
Oh... vraiment magique.
Quand on passe la porte,
on a l'impression
de se faire gifler par Noël ?
Bien sûr.
Écoute, je dois y aller.
Allez, décris-le moi !
Parle-moi des décorations.
Est-ce que Rudolph est là ?
Il est là, n'est-ce pas ?
Salut, Rudolph !
Ah, ouais, mais tu sais...
les décorations,
est-ce que c'est vraiment ça, Noël ?
Et comment !
Ce serait quoi sinon ?
Euh, essaie la naissance du Christ.
Tu sais, Christmas... Christ Mas,
qui signifie "Plus de Christ"
chez nos amis espagnols.
Ouais, b'en tout ce que je veux,
c'est passer cette porte
et voir le féerique paysage d'hiver,
Lily, et vous tous.
C'est juste que... j'ai hâte.
C'est ça. Je dois y aller.
D'accord. Okay.
Oh attends. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted.
Encore une chose.
Et les biscuits ?
Ils sont délicieux ?
Tu sais, honnêtement, ils ont le goût
de ceux achetés en magasin.
Oh ! J'ai un autre appel.
B'en dis à Lily que je l'aime.
D'accord.
- Allô ?
- Ted Evelyn Mosby !
Oh. Salut maman.
Joyeux Noël.
Je viens de recevoir un appel
des plus inquiétants de Lily.
Comment as-tu pu
utiliser un mot aussi terrible ?
Oh mon dieu,
elle t'a appelée ?
Est-ce que tu te comportes mal
à cause du divorce ?
C'est à cause de Clint ?
Non, maman, pourquoi
serait-ce à cause de Clint ?
Salut on pote, c'est Clint.
Comment tu vas, champion ?
Salut Clint. Écoute,
je n'ai pas vraiment le temps de...
Eh, eh, non, non, non.
Ted, Ted.
Tu ne le sais pas encore,
mais toi et moi
allons devenir de super amis.
Les Amérindiens ont ce rituel...
C'est un mauvais moment
pour le Barney.
Je devrais être en train
de jouer au Laser Tag en ce moment,
mais à la place...
Ne me regarde pas.
Je suis affreux.
Tu ressembles à un type normal.
Exactement.
Je suis un Ted. Je porte un pantalon
en laine polaire avec une taille élastique.
Et ce n'est pas plus confortable ?
Si.
Allez, il faut que tu manges.
Trop faible...
pour tenir... le bol.
Bien, je vais te nourrir.
Bobo dans ma bouche !
Je n'en veux pas.
Je veux de la glace.
Non, tu n'auras pas de glace pour
le dîner juste parce que tu es malade.
- Mais ma gorge me fait mal.
- Non.
Je te hais !
Ne me laisse pas.
Qui est-ce ?
Le livreur de pizza.
Wow.
Eh, tu m'as piégée.
Tu pensais vraiment
que c'était le livreur de pizza ?
Non, je savais que c'était toi.
Je pensais juste que tu aurais
au moins apporté une pizza.
Ouais, eh bien...
j'ai apporté une bière,
mais je l'ai donnée à un SDF.
D'accord, il me l'a prise.
Maintenant voudrais-tu
s'il te plaît revenir à l'appartement ?
Non, je ne passerai pas
Noël avec toi.
Okay, je suis désolé
de t'avoir traitée de...
ce mot,
durant l'été,
et pour l'avoir répété aujourd'hui.
Et pour l'avoir pensé énormément
dans le métro en venant ici.
Je n'avais aucun droit de dire ça.
C'était blessant, immature et je suis désolé.
Oh, la ferme.
Tu crois que je ne connais pas tes fausses
excuses depuis le temps, Ted Mosby ? Hein ?
Il est clair que
tu es encore fâché après moi.
- Je ne suis pas fâché après toi.
- Si, tu l'es.
Je ne suis pas fâché après toi, Lily.
Maintenant, est-ce qu'on pourrait juste...
Je me suis excusée auprès de Marshall
et il m'a pardonnée,
et on est passés à autre chose.
Pourquoi pas toi ?
Parce que tu ne t'es jamais
excusée auprès de moi.
Marshall n'est pas le seul
que tu aies laissé tomber.
Tu es partie trois mois,
tu n'as même jamais appelé.
Allez, Lily,
on était censés être amis !
Ouais, tu parles d'un ami,
tu m'as traitée de Grinch.
- Tu étais un Grinch !
- Comment peux-tu...
Grinch, Grinch, Grinch,
Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.
T'es content ?
Maintenant tu as énervé
le grand type du haut.
Ouais, je suis sûr
que ça intéresse Dieu si je...
Utilisez encore une fois ce langage
et je vous coupe l'eau !
C'est mon concierge.
Il vit au-dessus.
Génial.
Grâce à ton foutu langage,
je vais devoir passer Noël
seule dans le noir.
Bien. Je ne veux pas
gâcher Noël.
Tu peux avoir l'appartement. Tu n'as
pas besoin d'avoir peur de m'y voir,
je serai à Staten Island
avec ma cousine Stacy.
Juste....
Aïe.
Joyeux Noël.
Tu passes le réveillon de Noël
avec ta famille ?
Bébé, ça craint.
Je suis vraiment désolée.
Ils sont bien.
Ils sont juste... un peu bizarres.
Tu sais qu'ils ne croient pas
aux cadeaux ou aux sapins de Noël.
Et ils pensent que Santa
est la façon qu'a Satan d'écrire son nom
quand il veut nous piéger.
Tu veux que je vienne avec toi ?
C'était une offre sincère ?
Donne-moi d'abord ta réponse.
Reste ici. Préserve-toi.
On passera toute la journée
de demain ensemble.
Okay.
Oh, comment se sent Barney ?
Tu veux parler du pleurnichard
éternel en mal d'attention ?
Il me gonflait, alors j'ai corsé son thé
à base d'Echninacea avec de la codéine.
Tu seras une maman géniale.
Bonté divine, la période
magique de Noël est à nous.
Et Dieu merci,
on ne paye pas les charges.
Joyeux Noël !
Qu'y a t'il dans la boîte ?
Seulement le meilleur cadeau
pour la meilleure fille au monde.
Il m'a fallu la journée
pour le retrouver.
Je croyais que
tu écrivais un devoir.
Ah nan, j'ai laissé tomber.
Je demanderai un délai supplémentaire.
Les études ne sont pas importantes.
C'est quoi ce crépitement
sur le toit ?
Est-ce que ça pourrait être le bruit
d'une géniale histoire de Noël
sur le point
de descendre par la cheminée ?
Eh b'en oui, c'est ça.
C'était la veille de Noël...
Il était censé arriver
il y a cinq jour,
mais il a été perdu
puis dérouté.
J'ai vérifié dans deux autres agences,
ils m'ont finalement dit qu'il était ici.
Oui, tout ce qu'il me fallait,
c'était le numéro de suivi.
On dirait qu'il est parti pour
notre agence régionale de Poughkeepsie.
Quoi ?
Non, non, non, non,
il me faut ce colis aujourd'hui.
Écoutez, le camion est parti
il y a cinq minutes,
alors à moins que
vous vouliez lui courir derrière...
Arrêtez-vous ! Arrêtez-vous !
Arrêtez-vous,
s'il vous plaît, arrêtez-vous.
Arrêtez-vous !
Arrêtez le camion.
Il me faut un colis
qui se trouve dans votre camion.
Je pourrais s'il vous plaît
jeter un oeil à l'arrière ?
Bien sûr.
Mais je dois continuer à conduire.
Je suis en retard.
Désolé.
Ça va.
Eh mec, merci de m'avoir aidé
à faire un beau Noël pour ma fiancée.
Pas de problème.
C'est vraiment dommage que je ne puisse
pas livrer tous ces colis pour ce soir.
Attendez, des personnes n'auront pas
leurs cadeaux à temps pour Noël ?
Malheureusement non.
# They call me back door Santa #
# I make my runs #
# about the break of day #
# They call me back door Santa #
# I make my runs #
# about the break of day #
# Oh, ho, ho #
# I make all #
# the little girls happy... #
On a livré chaque colis
qui se trouvait dans le camion.
Mais il me reste un colis
à donner.
Ouais, j'ai réussi.
Joyeux Noël.
- Ouvre-le, bébé.
- Okay.
Oh mon dieu.
Un mini four pour enfant !
J'en ai toujours voulu un
depuis que je suis petite fille.
Exactement ce modèle.
Je ne te l'ai jamais dit.
Comment l'as-tu su ?
C'est notre premier Noël
depuis qu'on s'est remis ensemble.
Je veux lui trouver
quelque chose de vraiment spécial.
Alors je vais
lui acheter un juke-box.
Wow, c'est un cadeau génial.
Pas vraiment. Il fait cette taille
et distribue des chewing-gum.
Oh, je sais ce que
tu pourrais lui acheter
qui lui en mettrait
plein la vue.
T'es prêt ?
Il y a 8 ans...
Quand j'étais gamine, tout ce que
je voulais, c'était un mini four.
J'ai supplié et supplié,
mais je n'ai reçu qu'une stupide boîte
de Lego parce que ma féministe de mère
ne voulait pas que je me conforme
aux rôles traditionnels selon le sexe.
Mini four, c'est comme ça
que je vais appeler mon van.
Mec... comment était le concert ?
Je n'ai pas réussi
à trouver la sortie.
Je n'arrive pas à croire que Ted
s'en soit souvenu après toutes ces années.
Ouais,
et après toute cette beuh.
Il est où, au fait ?
À Staten Island.
Pourquoi ?
Okay, ne dites rien à votre mère,
mais je vous ai apporté des cadeaux.
Comme le cadeau
de l'amour de Dieu ?
Non, de vrais cadeaux.
Oncle Ted
nous a apporté des cadeaux !
C'est rien, Ted, on les donnera
simplement à une oeuvre de charité.
Yay !
Euh, pas toi, Charité.
Je voulais parler des nécessiteux.
Ted, voudrais-tu dire
le bénédicité ce soir ?
Euh, tu sais quoi ?
Pourquoi ne le dirais-tu pas ?
Je ne saurais
vraiment pas quoi dire.
Pourquoi ne réciterais-tu pas
ton passage préféré des Écritures ?
C'est une excellente idée,
Charité.
Mais franchement,
je ne sais pas.
Je veux dire, comment choisit-on
son passage préféré ?
C'est la Bible ; il y en a
tellement... de magnifiques...
Celui de Pulp Fiction
est plutôt cool.
Oh, je vais ouvrir.
Charité, je te passe la main.
Mon Père,
merci pour cette journée,
et merci d'avoir réuni
cette famille.
Amen.
Qui est-ce, Ted ?
Euh, ce sont... ce sont juste
des chanteurs de Noël.
# Silent night #
# Holy night... #
Je suis venue m'excuser.
Je suis vraiment désolée, Ted.
Excuses acceptées.
Donne-moi la bière.
Oh, oh, ça fait vraiment
du bien de vous voir.
Tu rentres à la maison ?
Et comment.
Mais d'abord, Lily,
je te dois des excuses.
Oh, pour l'amour de Dieu, t'en as
autant ras le bol des excuses que moi ?
Oui !
On pourrait directement passer
des excuses au pardon ?
Oui.
Et je te promets que je ne
te traiterai plus jamais de... tu sais.
C'est bon.
J'étais une sorte de Grinch.
C'est quoi un Grinch ?
Rien du tout. C'est un mot
qu'on ne doit pas prononcer.
Maman, c'est quoi un Grinch ?
Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...
Joyeux Noël tout le monde !
Courez, courez !
Joyeux Noël, Marshall.

Les enfants, vous vous rappelez
de mon premier jour avec Robin.
- Je crois que je suis amoureux de toi.
- Quoi ?!
Voilŕ le truc, les gens normaux, vous savez,
les gens qui ne sont pas votre pčre,
attendent d'habitude plus longtemps
pour dire "je t'aime".
Robin est passée
par les étapes habituelles.
- Araignée ! Araignée !
- J'ai laissé quelque chose dans l'entrée.
- Oů ?
- Juste lŕ.
Je l'ai.
D'abord, il y a le moment oů vous pensez
que vous le pensez.
Whoa, encore vivante.
Il y a le moment oů vous pensez
que vous le savez.
Oh, tu ne veux pas m'embrasser,
tu vas tomber malade.
Deux jours plus tard...
Ça valait vraiment le coup.
Il y a le moment oů
vous savez que vous le savez,
mais vous ne pouvez pas encore le dire.
D'accord, cette fois c'est la bonne.
A demain ?
Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit.
Attends, Ted ?
Ouais ?
Bonne nuit.
Super, ŕ trčs bientôt.
Bye, ma puce.
Hey. Devine quoi ?
Ma soeur Katie vient nous voir
le week-end prochain.
Elle arrive jeudi.
C'est formidable.
Tu sais ce que je vais faire ?
Je vais prendre mon vendredi.
On va l'emmener ŕ l'Empire State Building.
Vraiment ?
Tu ferais ça ?
Bien sűr. Tout le monde devrait voir
l'Empire State Building.
Et puis il y a le moment
oů vous savez que vous le savez,
et que vous ne pouvez pas
le garder pour vous plus longtemps.
- Ted.
- Ouais ?
Falafel.
(boulettes)
- Falafel ?
- Falafel.
Au lieu de dire ŕ Ted que tu l'aimes,
tu as dit "falafel" ?
- Je bloquais complčtement.
- Je ne comprends pas.
Pourquoi ne peux-tu pas dire ŕ Ted
que tu l'aimes ?
Oh, allez, c'est trčs important pour moi.
Oh, mon dieu, tu fais comme si
tu ne l'avais jamais dit ŕ un mec avant.
Non.
Okay, je n'ai pas l'habitude d'aller
aussi loin dans une relation.
D'habitude je prends la sortie 3 semaines.
Ne me dis pas que tu adhčres vraiment
ŕ la théorie de l'autoroute de Barney.
Regardez oů vous marchez
en vous levant, les enfants
parce que je suis sur le point
de laisser tomber des connaissances.
Les relations sont comme une autoroute.
Attends une minute, il y a un mois
tu m'as dit que les relations
étaient comme un cirque ambulant.
Non, c'est nouveau.
C'est encore mieux.
Les autoroutes ont des sorties.
Tout comme les relations.
La premičre sortie, ma préférée
personnellement, c'est 6 heures.
On se rencontre, on parle, on baise,
on sort quand elle est sous la douche.
Donc, chaque fille avec qui tu couches éprouve
le besoin immédiat de prendre une douche ?
En fait, ouais, je comprends ça.
Les sorties suivantes sont 4 jours,
3 semaines, 7 mois...
c'est lŕ que vous allez rompre,
notez-le sur vos calendriers.
Quoi ?
Puis un an et demi, 18 ans,
et la derničre sortie... la mort.
Ce qui, si vous ętes resté
avec la męme femme toute votre vie,
donne quelque chose comme :
"On arrive bientôt ?
Je ne suis jamais restée sur l'autoroute
aussi longtemps auparavant.
D'habitude, ŕ ce stade, je découvre
que le mec a un truc de personnalité bizarre
qui m'incite ŕ vouloir prendre
la prochaine sortie.
Ouais, j'ai connu ça.
Une fois je suis sortie avec un mec
qui ne pouvait aller aux toilettes que
quand il y avait de la musique classique.
Okay, c'était Marshall.
C'est juste que les choses
vont si bien avec Ted
que je ne veux pas les compliquer.
Détends-toi, ça arrivera
quand ça arrivera.
Conseil que j'ai également
donné ŕ Marshall
pour qu'il surmonte le truc
de la musique classique.
Ah, tiens, voilŕ Katie.
- Ta soeur est si mignonne.
- Ouais.
Ça me rappelle quand je la voyais
monter le chemin de l'école,
avec ses petites nattes
et son sac ŕ dos Hello Kitty.
- Hello, Kitty.
- Oh, non.
Non. Non. Non.
- Hey, Robin. Comment vas-tu ?
- Oh, bien, bien.
Alors, qui est cette...
personne avec la langue ?
Robin, voici mon petit ami Kyle.
On dirait que les filles sexy
se bousculent dans la famille.
Oh, t'as dit ça.
Génial.
Alors, vous ętes ensemble
depuis combien...
- Deux mois complets.
- Ouais.
En fait, il vient également
rendre visite ŕ sa famille ŕ New York.
C'est pas génial ?
Mon cousin. Il a 23 ans, c'est un chieur,
mais il m'achčte de la bičre, alors...
C'est cool.
Voici mon amie Lily.
Sexy.
Tu dis des choses !
Viens, on va aller chez moi
pour que tu puisses t'installer.
En fait,
je vais rester avec Kyle ce soir.
- Euh, non.
- Oh, allez.
C'est une soirée plutôt spéciale.
Si tu vois ce que je veux dire.
Quoi ?
Oh. Oh...
Je n'arrive pas ŕ croire que ma petite soeur
s'appręte ŕ perdre sa virginité avec un...
...simplet avec une cręte.
Ça ne peut se produire.
Il faut que vous m'aidiez
ŕ l'en dissuader.
Dissuader une fille de coucher.
Ouais, je ne sais pas
comment faire ça.
Décourager le sexe prémarital
est contre ma religion.
S'il vous plaît.
Je suis sa grande soeur.
Je suis censée lui apprendre
ŕ prendre les bonnes décisions.
Il est 14 heures et tu as déjŕ bu
trois whisky-sodas.
C'est pour ça
que j'ai besoin de votre aide.
Robin a convaincu Katie
de rester avec elle ce premier soir.
Et le jour suivant, j'ai emmené
tout le monde ŕ l'Empire State Building.
Vous avez de la chance
d'ętre venus ici avec un architecte.
Premier fait amusant
sur l'Empire State Building :
quand la construction
a débuté le 17 mars 1930,
le taux d'avancement de la charpente
était de quatre étages et demi par semaine.
Quatre étages et demi par semaine.
Quatre étages et demi par semaine.
Voilŕ.
On y est. Allez.
Ce sont des faits amusants,
les amis, amusons-nous avec.
Tu sais, Katie, ça fait si longtemps
que je veux venir ŕ l'Empire State Building,
mais j'ai attendu d'y venir
avec quelqu'un de spécial.
Oh, nous y voilŕ.
Marshall et moi ne sommes jamais venus
non plus ŕ l'Empire State Building.
Mais je suis vraiment
contente d'avoir attendu
pour faire quelque chose
de si important avec mon fiancé.
En parlant d'attente, j'ai signé
une promesse d'abstinence au lycée.
C'est vraiment cool d'attendre.
Et ne pas toucher ŕ la drogue....
ŕ part la beuh.
- Tu leur as dit ?
- Oh, okay, oui, je leur ai dit.
Mais seulement parce que je pense
que tu devrais aussi l'entendre
de la bouche d'autres adultes.
Tout le monde pense
que tu devrais attendre. Pas vrai ?
- Absolument. Tu devrais attendre.
- Le sexe, c'est sympa.
Tu vois ?
Tu es une vraie hypocrite. Tu n'avais
que 16 ans quand tu as perdu la tienne.
Comment sais-tu ça ?
Tu as laissé ton journal intime dans
ton ancienne chambre / ma nouvelle chambre.
Je te donne 10 000 dollars
pour ce journal intime.
Ecoute, je sors avec Kyle
depuis deux mois maintenant.
Ça fait une éternité.
On a déjŕ fait tout le reste.
- Je veux dire, on a męme...
- Oh. La, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
Męme Kyle a le droit de faire ça.
Tu n'as pas le droit
de me dire de ne pas le faire.
Mais avec Kyle ?
Pourquoi ne peux-tu pas attendre ?
Car si tu attends, tu pourras
avoir un gentil garçon comme Ted.
Robin, ça va se passer.
J'en ai déjŕ parlé
sur ma page Myspace.
- Il me faut une kretek.
- Tu fumes aussi maintenant ?
- Oh, tu te souviens des kreteks ?
- Non !
Pas de "tu te souviens des kreteks ?"
Ça ne peut pas se produire.
C'est ma petite soeur, okay ?
Elle devrait regarder La Petite Sirčne
et boire du Cacolac, et pas faire l'amour.
Allez, tu n'avais que 16 ans
quand tu as fait l'amour.
- J'avais 17 ans.
- On avait 18 ans.
Barney avait probablement 12 ans.
Bien envoyé, Ted.
J'avais... six... quator...
Quel âge avais-tu ?
- 17 ans.
- Moi aussi.
- Barney, ça va ?
- Ouais, bien sűr.
Quoi, vous ne me croyez pas ?
- C'était en camp, alors je...
- Quel camp ?
Cet endroit dans Catskills.
Suis un peu.
J'étais lŕ-bas
pour donner des cours durant l'été.
Des cours de quoi ?
Euh, de danse.
De danse ?
Ouais, Ted, de danse.
Peut-ętre que tu en as entendu parler.
C'était un simple job d'été,
mais ça a fini par ętre bien plus que ça.
Elle s'appelait Frédérique Houseman,
mais tout le monde l'appelait Bébé.
# Sylvia #
# Yes, Mickey? #
# How you call your loverboy? #
# Come here, loverboy #
# And if he doesn't answer #
# Oh, loverboy #
# And if he still doesn't answer? #
# I simply say, baby... #
# Oh, baby #
# My sweet baby #
C'est Dirty Dancing.
- C'est passé hier soir.
- Non, c'était avant-hier soir.
J'ai la chanson "She's Like the Wind"
en tęte depuis 40 heures.
Je venais de m'en débarrasser.
Maintenant elle est de retour.
Bordel, Swayze !
- Tu te souviens de notre premičre fois ?
- Ouais.
C'était ŕ la fac.
Oh, attends, attends...
Ecoute... je veux
vraiment faire ça, mais...
on devrait en faire
quelque chose de spécial, tu vois ?
Le faire correctement.
Okay.
Tu as raison.
Peut-ętre qu'on pourrait aller ŕ la plage
et louer une maison pour le week-end.
Ouais,
pour le réveillon du Nouvel An.
Okay.
Oh, et on allumera des bougies et
on pourra mettre de la musique classique.
Ce n'est pas une bonne idée.
Pourquoi pas ?
Longue histoire.
Mais on pourrait écouter du Al Green
et prendre un bain moussant ensemble.
Oh ouais,
ça a vraiment l'air sympa.
Oh, je t'aime, Marshall.
Je suis tellement contente
qu'on attende.
12 minutes plus tard...
Oups.
- Oh, c'est adorable.
- Ouais, raconte-lui la suite.
- C'était génial.
- Ouais.
Tu veux le refaire ?
S'il vous plaît, non.
- On s'est excusés.
- Ouais, alors pourquoi l'avoir refait ?
Tu sais quoi ?
Je t'ai pręté mon walkman.
Le fait est que ce ne sera jamais
aussi parfait que ce ŕ quoi on s'attend.
Ma premičre fois était horrible.
Attends, je n'ai jamais
entendu ton histoire.
Comme vous le savez,
j'avais 16 ans.
Et c'était avec mon copain Brian.
- Pręte ?
- Ouais.
- Ça me semble si normal.
- Oh, je sais.
- Oh, Robin.
- Oh, Brian.
Ouais, je suis gay.
- Je suis vraiment désolée.
- Ah, j'aurais dű m'en douter.
Il y avait des signes.
Oh mon Dieu !
Ma mčre est rentrée.
Vite !
- Va sous mon lit.
- Quoi ?!
Oh mon Dieu !
On n'a droit qu'ŕ un seul essai
pour perdre sa virginité.
Et bien que j'aie
ŕ peine fait l'amour, ça compte.
Comment ça, ŕ peine ?
Eh bien, il n'a pas entičrement
plongé dans la piscine, mais il...
a pataugé
dans le petit bassin.
Alors tu ne lui as pas donné
ta virginité.
- A peine, ça ne compte pas.
- Si, ça compte.
- Non.
- Si.
Non, ça ne compte pas.
Fin de l'histoire.
Ooh, Lily Aldrin,
espčce de petite dévergondée.
Est-il possible
qu'avant que Marshall ne plonge,
quelqu'un d'autre ait testé l'eau ?
Non. Personne d'autre
n'a testé l'eau, n'est-ce pas ?
Scooter ?
Qui est Scooter ?
Mon copain du lycée,
avec qui je n'ai pas couché.
Je... je n'arrive pas ŕ y croire.
On est Marshall et Lily.
Quand les gens nous voient, ils disent :
"Oh, regarde-les, ils n'ont fait
l'amour que l'un avec l'autre."
Non, Marshall, ils disent :
"Oh, regarde-les,
ils n'ont fait l'amour
que l'un avec l'autre."
Mais maintenant,
ce n'est plus vrai.
Maintenant, tu as couché
avec deux fois plus de personnes que moi.
Je savais que tu étais trop douée.
Tu sais quoi ? Je n'ai plus envie de voir
le stupide Empire State Building.
- Il n'est pas stupide.
- Je vais voir Kyle.
Katie, s'il te plaît.
Tu ne peux perdre ta virginité qu'une fois.
Tu ne devrais faire l'amour qu'avec
avec quelqu'un de spécial.
Oh, je t'en prie, tu as couché
avec une centaine de mecs.
Pas une centaine de mecs.
Pas une centaine de mecs.
Je suis sűre que tu étais follement
amoureuse de chacun d'entre eux.
J'avais différents degrés
de sentiments pour chacun du...
nombre trčs raisonnable de mecs.
Vraiment.
Eh bien, tu aimes Ted ?
Tu aimes Ted ?
Je...
Okay, fait amusant numéro 22
sur l'Empire State Building :
il y a des tas d'endroits oů les gens
peuvent avoir une conversation privée.
- Tu es tirée d'affaire.
- Laisse-moi m'expliquer.
Tu n'as rien ŕ expliquer.
Tu n'as pas besoin de le dire, c'est rien.
Okay, mais si les relations
sont comme une autoroute, alors dire...
"hm hm hm", c'est comme... emprunter
la voie pour Véhicule ŕ Haute Occupation.
Et je ne veux pas
prendre de sortie, mais...
en męme temps, je ne suis pas pręte
ŕ emprunter la voie pour VHO.
Parce que... qu'y a t'il
sur la voie pour VHO ?
Oh, il y a un gros diamant,
et je ne suis pas pręte ŕ...
Okay, Robin, Robin, arręte.
C'est rien,
tu n'as pas besoin de le dire.
Cc sont des paroles importantes
et je ne veux pas le dire trop tôt.
Quoi, tu veux dire comme moi ?
Non. Je ne...
Ouais, comme toi.
Tu dois l'admettre, Ted,
c'était un peu étrange.
- Etrange... ou courageux ?
- Je suis sűre que c'était étrange.
Qui lâche ça
lors du premier rendez-vous ?
Allez, ça montre que je suis courageux
et audacieux, comme un chevalier.
Non, ça montre que
tu es une traînée du "je t'aime".
Alors tu es
une prude du "je t'aime".
Tu sais quoi ?
Je reprends le mien.
- Tu... Quoi ?
- Je reprends mon "je t'aime".
- Tu ne peux pas le reprendre.
- Je viens de le faire. Je l'ai lŕ.
Mais je suis une vraie traînée,
je vais simplement le donner.
Eh, vous, monsieur.
Je vous aime.
Merci, mec.
J'allais monter pour sauter.
Marshall,
pourquoi c'est si grave ?
Pourquoi c'est si grave ?
Oh, désolé, Christophe Colomb, devine
qui a vraiment découvert le Nouveau Monde ?
Un mec prénommé Scooter.
Oh, Neil Armstrong,
ça se présente en fait comme ça :
"Un petit pas pour l'homme,
un pas de géant pour Scooter."
Whoa, eh, Adam,
devine qui était avec Eve
- avant toi...
- Okay, Marshall, j'ai compris.
C'est grave parce que
ça réécrit notre histoire.
Non, c'est faux.
Est-ce que tu es allé
ŕ l'Empire State Building ?
Non. Tu n'es allé que dans l'entrée.
Les gens n'achčtent pas de ticket
pour aller dans l'entrée.
Ils achčtent des tickets
pour monter au sommet.
Scooter n'est arrivé que dans l'entrée,
et l'entrée ne compte pas.
Vraiment.
Excusez-moi, monsieur, pouvez-vous me dire
comment aller ŕ l'Empire State Building?
On y est.
Merci, monsieur.
Vous ętes un homme sage et brillant.
Vous avez raison.
Pourquoi
voudrais-je perdre tout ça ?
Je passe la meilleure des journées !
Katie, je l'admets, peut-ętre
que je ne suis pas la mieux placée
pour te faire la morale
sur les aventures romantiques, mais...
mais je ne veux pas que
tu fasses les męmes erreurs que moi.
- Oh, crois-moi, Kyle n'est pas gay.
- Ce n'est pas ce que je voulais dire.
J'aimerais juste que tu ne sois pas
si pressée de grandir.
S'il te plaît, ne fais pas ça.
Mais, les enfants, plus tard
ce soir-lŕ, Katie l'a fait,
et elle est tombée enceinte...
de quintuplés...
et elle a vécu sa vie
dans un camping...
oů elle est morte alcoolique.
Alors la morale, les enfants :
Ne faites pas l'amour avant le mariage.
Peut-ętre męme attendre
un ou deux ans de mariage.
- Papa !
- Allez, que s'est-il vraiment passé ?
Trčs bien, voilŕ
ce qui s'est vraiment passé.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Elle ne l'a pas fait.
Eh, c'est génial !
Tu as réussi ŕ l'atteindre.
Non, pas moi. Toi.
Elle m'a dit
que tu lui avais parlé.
Salut, Katie.
Salut.
Tu as un autre fait amusant
sur l'Empire State Building pour moi ?
Non. Je ne voudrais pas t'ennuyer
avec les sept millions d'heures de travail
qu'il a fallu pour construire ce testament
de la volonté humaine de 102 étages.
Alors, ça va ?
Je ne vois pas pourquoi
tout le monde en fait une histoire.
Kyle est un garçon vraiment gentil.
Il aurait pu me tromper
avec ma partenaire de science,
Gretchen Gwynn,
mais il ne l'a pas fait.
Parce qu'il a dit
qu'il savait que je le découvrirais.
Quel gentleman.
Moi non plus, je ne vois pas pourquoi
ta soeur en fait toute une histoire.
- J'ai ton âge lors de ma premičre fois.
- Oh, vraiment ?
Ouais, ouais. C'était...
c'était avec cette fille, Molly.
Je t'aime, Ted.
Oh, je t'aime aussi, Molly.
Mais ce n'était pas le cas.
C'était génial.
Ecoute, je dois y aller.
Oů vas-tu ?
Mon cousin a ramené
des pétards du Mexique.
On va aller dans les bois
pour les allumer, ça va ętre génial.
Tu vas m'appeler ?
Ouais. Ouais,
bien sűr que je vais t'appeler.
Mais je ne l'ai pas fait.
Molly ?
Ouais ?
Je peux t'emprunter 20 dollars ?
Je te rembourserai sans faute.
Mais je ne l'ai pas fait.
Et je ne l'ai jamais revue.
Je lui ai dit que je l'aimais, mais...
je voulais juste coucher avec elle.
J'aurais dit n'importe quoi
pour que ça se passe, et...
c'est exactement ce que j'ai fait.
Ecoute, je ne te dis pas
quoi faire.
Je te dis juste comment fonctionnent
tous les garçons de 17 ans.
Męme les gentils.
Alors j'ai dit ŕ Kyle que
je voulais attendre... et il m'a larguée.
Oh, oh, chérie,
je suis vraiment désolée.
Oh, chérie.
Je te promets
que tout ira bien.
Tu veux regarder La Petite Sirčne
et boire du Cacolac ?
Seulement si tu mets
une bonne dose de Kahlua dedans.
Ne dis rien ŕ maman.
Merci pour tout.
De rien. Je savais que
c'était important pour toi.
Mais ton histoire,
elle ne te ressemble męme pas.
Ouais, eh bien...
Je t'aime, Molly.
Oh, je t'aime aussi, Ted.
Wow. C'était génial.
Ecoute, je dois y aller.
Oů vas-tu ?
Mon cousin a ramené
des pétards du Mexique.
On va aller dans les bois
pour les allumer,
ça va ętre génial.
Tu vas m'appeler ?
Ouais. Bien sűr
que je vais t'appeler.
- Oh, Ted ?
- Ouais ?
Je peux t'emprunter 20 dollars ?
Je te rembourserai sans faute.
- Mais elle ne m'a pas rappelé.
- Oh, viens lŕ.
Je t'aime.
Je l'ai dit.
Ça me semble normal.
- Je t'aime.
- Je suis gay.
Je plaisante.
Je t'aime aussi.
Eh... tu as perdu
ta je-t'aime-ginité.
Ouais.
Je suppose que j'attendais
juste le bon.
Katie a fini par avoir
une géniale premičre fois ŕ New York.
et la derničre chose
qu'on ait faite avant qu'elle parte,
c'est d'aller
ŕ l'Empire State Building.
Je suis si content
qu'on le fasse enfin.
De quoi tu parles ?
On était lŕ hier.
Ouais, mais
ça ne compte pas vraiment.
- Oh, merde.
- Exactement !
Donc, hier ne compte pas comme si
on était venus ŕ l'Empire State Building.
Alors je l'ai perdue avec toi,
Marshall.
Et j'ai pris cet ascenseur
jusqu'au sommet,
et j'ai vu ce panorama,
et j'ai baigné dans le Nirvâna.
Et voilŕ notre histoire.
Ouais. Ouais,
c'est notre histoire.
On n'a fait l'amour
que l'un avec l'autre.
On n'a fait l'amour
que l'un avec l'autre.
Ils n'ont fait l'amour
que l'un avec l'autre.
Ooh, okay, on y va, on y va.
Okay, fait amusant numéro 81
sur l'Empire State Building :
Il y a 1860 marche de ce...
Whoa, whoa ! Allez !
Maintenant, vous pouvez enfin dire que
vous ętes allés ŕ l'Empire State Building.
Comment avez-vous pu vivre ici aussi
longtemps sans jamais ętre allés au sommet ?
Bah, d'habitude on est occupés...
ŕ boire.
A propos de premičre fois,
on n'a jamais appris
- l'histoire de ta virginité.
- C'est vrai, j'ai presque oublié.
Okay, j'avais 16 ans, et c'était
dans un abri de terrain de baseball.
Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
Je veux dire que j'étais dans
un métro avec une call girl de luxe...
Risky Business.
J'avais accidentellement hacké
l'ordinateur de NORAD...
C'est War Games et il n'y a męme pas
de scčne de sexe dedans.
D'accord !
J'avais 23 ans et c'était avec l'amie
divorcée de 45 ans de ma mčre, Rhonda.
Elle m'a appelé "Barry" tout le temps
et pendant deux semaines,
mon édredon a senti les cigarettes
au menthol. Vous ętes contents ?
Hey...
Pourquoi ne nous racontes-tu pas
encore une fois
ta premičre fois au camping
dans les Catskills ?
Bébé et sa famille
passaient chaque été ŕ Kellerman.
Son pčre n'approuvait pas notre amour.
- Quelqu'un a mis Bébé dans un coin ?
- Oh mon Dieu, non.
Tout ce que je peux dire,
c'est que je...
j'ai passé
les meilleurs moments de ma vie.
Histoire vraie.

Certains enfants rêvent
d'être astronautes.
Certains enfants rêvent
de jouer au base-ball.
Quand j'étais enfant,
je n'avais qu'un seul rêve.
Construire un gratte-ciel.
C'est stupide.
Le chemin fut parsemé d'obstacles.
Mais au final, mon rêve devint réalité.
Je suis devenu architecte.
Bonjour, tout le monde !
Alors, j'ai eu une idée pour l'atrium.
Prêts ?
Des colonnes.
C'est stupide.
Transcript : Raceman

Je... je n'en reviens pas que
vous ayez fait tomber ma maquette.
Bah, c'est... ce n'est pas nouveau,
n'est-ce pas... des colonnes ?
Je veux dire, c'est quoi votre prochaine
idée avant-gardiste... des plafonds ?
Des sols ?
Des fenêtres ?
Je sais ce que vous pensez :
qui c'est ce connard ?
Eh bien, ce connard
c'était Hammond Druthers,
une légende dans le milieu architectural.
Très important dans les années 80.
Il était aussi, et de loin,
le pire patron que j'aie jamais eu.
Puis, j'ai conçu l'immeuble
de la Banque Nationale de Spokane.
Et soudain... je fus son patron.
- Et ça ne lui a pas plu.
- Des escaliers ?
Et pour être honnête, je n'étais pas
sûr que ça me plaise non plus.
Vous voyez, avant,
quand j'étais juste un autre employé,
j'étais heureux, insouciant.
Le type qui traînait dans la salle
de repos en se moquant du patron.
Vous avez vu ce qu'il portait
aujourd'hui ?
On aurait dit que son pantalon
était retenu par ses mamelons.
Ouais, et cette chemise avec les fleurs,
j'ai le rhume des foins rien qu'en la regardant.
Mais, tout à coup,
j'étais un type différent.
Hey, les mecs.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a de si drôle ?
Rien.
Heu... belle chemise.
Merci.
Les horaires étaient dingues.
Je travaillais toujours,
même quand je n'étais pas au travail.
Oh, Robin...
je viens d'avoir une super idée.
Oh, fais ce que tu veux de moi,
pourvu que tu ne me réveilles pas.
Avant, j'étais ce type.
Mon pote, bien sûr que
tu devrais prendre cette journée
pour le concert des Foo Fighters.
Dis juste que tu es malade.
Mais maintenant...
j'étais ce type.
Malade, hein ?
Déboutonne cette chemise.
Hmm... "Foo Fighters".
Remets-toi au travail.
Mais quand même,
le pire c'était Druthers.
- Je pensais...
- Des plafonds ? Oups.
J'ai déjà dit ça.
En même temps, vous semblez
aimer les vieilles idées réchauffées.
Je plaisante, bien sûr.
Un autre trou en un, patron.
(golf)
Oh, wow, il doit être vraiment beau.
Pourquoi tu dis ça ?
Parce que seuls les canons peuvent
s'en tirer en disant des choses comme ça.
J'ai découvert que c'était vrai.
C'est une bénédiction et un fléau,
vraiment.
Ted, tu ne peux pas le laisser
te traiter comme ça.
Oui, tu dois te demander :
Who's the boss ? (Madame est servie)
- Tony.
- Angela. - Mona.
Mona ?
Regarde attentivement
Ça va changer ta vie
Alors, qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
B'en... c'est délicat,
le type était mon patron.
Alors je suis allé parler
au directeur adjoint.
Virez-le.
Je pensais qu'il pourrait être mis
sur un projet différent, monsieur.
Virez-le !
C'est un casse-couilles arrogant
et dépassé.
En fait, virez tous ceux de ce projet.
Druthers, Mosby, tout le monde.
Mosby, monsieur ? Je, je... j'ai entendu
dire que Mosby faisait du très bon travail.
Très bien, Mosby peut rester.
Mais dites-lui qu'il marche sur des oeufs.
Venez ici.
Je vous aime bien, Crosby.
Ça t'ennuie si je charge mon téléphone ?
Vas-y.
Ted, si tu vires Druthers,
la clé c'est le timing.
Tu te souviens quand j'ai dû
virer ma maquilleuse ?
Vicki... je suis vraiment désolée,
mais il y a eu certaines coupes
dans le budget et...
nous devons vous laisser partir.
Je veux dire, après ce soir.
J'ai encore besoin de maquillage
pour l'émission.
Donc...
Nos pensées et prières
vont aux familles des victimes.
Tu sais quoi ? Je vais le faire.
Je vais virer Druthers demain.
- Oh, mon dieu !
- Quoi ?
- Tu es au courant de ça ?
- Non.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Rien que la plus grande chose
de tous les temps.
Attendez, attendez, attendez...
c'est encore trop faible.
S'ils devaient guérir le cancer demain,
ça resterait le plus grand évènement
de toute la semaine.
Okay. Maintenant, vous êtes prêts
pour Marshall nu.
Oh, mon dieu.
C'est terrible fois terrible.
C'est terrible au carré.
Je sais, hein ?
Derrière le piano tout ce temps.
Attends. Si Marshall s'est donné
tout ce mal pour le cacher,
il ne veut clairement pas
qu'on le trouve.
Oh, allez, Robin.
Non, je dis que ça doit
vraiment l'embarrasser.
On va s'éclater.
Je sais ! On va vraiment s'éclater !
Oh, désolé, je suis en retard ;
le déjeuner a duré un peu longtemps.
Vous vouliez me voir, Mosby ?
Ouais, il y a genre quatre heures.
Excusez-moi d'avoir passé
les quatre dernières heures
à dessiner des plans
pour votre bâtiment.
C'est une serviette à cocktail.
Couverte de blasphèmes.
Ecoutez, Hammond...
il n'y a pas de manière facile
de le dire, alors...
pourquoi ne passerions-nous pas
dans votre bureau.
# Happy birthday to you #
- # Happy birthday to you #
- Oh, vous m'avez eu. Vous m'avez bien eu.
# Happy birthday, dear Hammond #
# Happy birthday to you #
Alors, tu ne l'as pas viré ?
Je ne peux pas virer un type à son anniversaire.
Tout le monde m'aurait détesté.
En outre, ils m'ont mis un chapeau.
Mon autorité était compromise.
Oh, hey, Marshall.
Prends un siège.
Je sais à quel point
tu aimes les tabourets.
Merci. Ouais, les tabourets sont meilleurs
pour le maintien.
Et... je... t'ai pris une rose.
Merci. C'est très gentil.
Vous êtes... très gentils.
Hey, les amis. Devinez ce que j'ai.
Une fléchette neuve. (new dart)
Oh, wow, une fléchette neuve.
Hey, cette fléchette neuve est super.
Je ne savais pas que tu étais si fan
de fléchettes neuves, Barney.
Oh, oui, Robin, j'adore
les fléchettes neuves. (new dart)
L'art du nu. (Nude art)
- L'art du nu.
- L'art du nu.
Okay, d'accord, et alors,
vous avez trouvé la peinture, hein ?
Je savais que ce jour arriverait.
Comment tu savais ça ?
Parce que je ne l'ai pas
très bien cachée.
L'histoire de la peinture,
c'est qu'à l'université,
Lily voulait faire un nu
pour son cours d'art.
Marshall n'était pas
vraiment fan de l'idée.
Je... je ne pense pas qu'un type
laisserait tomber le pantalon
juste pour poser pour toi.
C'est pour le cours et c'est juste ce gamin bizarre
Hunter de mon couloir de première année.
Le mec au frisbee avec la barbichette ?
C'est genre le type
le plus canon de l'école !
Non, en fait il est un peu musclé...
Oh, il est adorable !
Et compliqué...
et un chouilla neuneu.
Juste assez pour que tu penses
pouvoir peut-être le changer.
Okay, oublie ça.
Tu vas dire que je suis vieux jeu,
je pense que je suis le seul type
que tu devrais voir nu.
Alors tu vas devoir le faire.
Tu te moques de moi ?
Et si quelqu'un le voit ?
On n'est plus au lycée.
Les gens ne se moquent pas de toi
parce que tu as posé nu pour une peinture.
On est adultes maintenant.
On a vu ton cul.
Cette peinture a déjà provoqué
trop de peine.
Je la détruis sur le champ.
Oh, non, quel est le problème, Marshall ?
Où est-elle ?
Je te dirai où elle est
si tu réponds à cette charade.
Tu l'as accrochée au bar, n'est-ce pas ?
Yo, pourquoi t'as fichu
ma charade en l'air ?
Sortie éducative !
Oh, non. Quelqu'un a accroché ta peinture
derrière le bar.
Classique !
Quelle farce mémorable.
Hey, Marshall.
Qu'est-ce que tu prendras ?
Qu'est-ce que je prendrai ?
Je ne sais pas, peut-être une bière
et cette peinture de moi nu
accrochée derrière le bar !
Ooh, je suis désolé,
cette peinture est la propriété du bar.
Je sais que Barney t'a donné
cette peinture.
Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles.
Quoi qu'il te paye,
je te payerai le double.
J'en doute.
Quoi qu'il t'ait payé, je te le payerai,
plus 10 dollars.
J'en doute.
D'accord, tu sais quoi, Carl,
tu viens de perdre un bon client.
J'en doute.
Cette peinture est la pire chose
qui me soit jamais arrivée.
Okay, où devrait-on l'accrocher ensuite ?
A son école de droit ?
Ooh sur le côté d'un bus.
Oh, oh!
Combien ça coûte un panneau publicitaire ?
Du calme, Scherbatsky.
En finesse.
J'ai un plan sur cinq ans.
Je tiens à vous dire que cette peinture
a des engagements dans toute la ville.
Puis, après New York...
L'une de mes pires craintes s'est réalisée...
Je viens de voir Marshall se prendre nu.
Bon, il faut que j'y aille.
Croyez-le ou pas,
je dois retourner au bureau.
Oh, je t'accompagne.
Bye, les amis.
Tu sais, j'aurais préféré que tout le monde
ne se moque pas de cette peinture.
Eh, on ne se moque pas de la peinture,
on se moque juste de Marshall.
En fait, la peinture est vraiment géniale.
- T'es sérieux ?
- Ouais.
Merci.
Tu sais, la revoir me fait réaliser
que peindre des nus me manque.
Quoi ?
Peins-moi.
Quoi ?
Peins-moi.
Qui est-ce ?
Qui est là ?
Hammond, c'est vous ?
Mosby ?
Druthers et moi étions seuls au bureau.
Si je devais le virer,
ça serait la meilleure occasion
que j'aurais jamais.
Ecoutez, juste une seconde, Ted.
Non, je... je dois vraiment vous parler.
Ecoutez, il n'y a pas
de manière facile de dire...
Que... que faites-vous ?
Que faites-vous ?
Je suis là, avec un pantalon.
Vous dormez ici ?
Que se passe t-il ?
Okay, très bien, oui.
Ce n'est pas que ça vous regarde
mais ma femme a piqué une petite crise
il y a quelques semaines,
et je dors ici jusqu'à
ce qu'elle se calme.
Okay, eh bien vous avez raison...
ça ne me regarde pas.
Ecoutez, il n'y a pas de manière facile
de le dire... Je...
De qui je me moque ?
Elle ne va jamais me laisser revenir.
Ça va aller.
Qu'est-ce que vous vouliez me dire ?
Bon anniversaire, mon pote.
Donc, vous vivez au bureau ?
Oui.
Je suis un architecte sans maison.
Vous voyez l'ironie tragique là-dedans ?
- Ouais, je vois.
- Parce que je conçois des maisons.
- Je vois.
- Mais je n'ai pas de maison.
Ça ne m'a pas échappé.
Mais je ne comprends pas...
pourquoi n'allez-vous pas à l'hôtel ?
Vous pourriez dormir sur un matelas
au lieu de...
ce qui semble être les dessins
déchirés de mon immeuble.
Pourquoi irais-je à l'hôtel,
alors que d'une minute à l'autre,
elle va appeler et me dire
de rentrer à la maison.
C'est une dame très spéciale, Ted.
Elle est assez... masculine.
Elle m'apporte ce dont j'ai besoin.
Vous comprenez ça ?
Heu... non, pas du tout.
Si vous étiez perdu dans le désert,
elle pourrait assurer.
Eh bien, c'est le rêve.
Je suis content
que vous soyez venu ce soir, Ted.
Moi aussi, Hammond.
- Appelez-moi Ham.
- Non merci.
- Hammy D ?
- Non, juste Hammond, je pense.
Donc, j'imagine que tu ne l'as pas viré.
J'étais à ça près.
Pendant ce temps-là,
Lily n'avait pas dormi de la nuit,
en proie à un dilemme.
- Oh chéri, tu es réveillé ?
- Je suis réveillé.
- Tout va bien ?
- Ouais.
Je lutte en quelque sorte
avec quelque chose.
Et si je te disais que j'ai un moyen
de payer notre lune de miel ?
Bébé, notre lune de miel est déjà payée.
On va à Howe Caverns.
Ouais, mais... mais si on ne voulait pas
passer notre lune de miel dans une caverne ?
Ce n'est pas juste une caverne,
c'est tout un labyrinthe de cavernes.
C'est une aventure souterraine.
Il y a une caverne qui est si sombre
que tu ne sais même pas que tu es dedans.
Je veux dire, on va expérimenter
une toute nouvelle sorte d'obscurité.
Eh bien, et si je trouvais un moyen de
nous faire un peu d'argent supplémentaire
de manière à ce qu'on ne passe pas
notre lune de miel à Howe Caverns,
mais en Ecosse ?
- Le Loch Ness ?
- Ouais.
Et tu sais, Edimbourg et les Highlands
et Glasgow...
Le Loch Ness. Nessy.
Bébé, j'adorerais chercher
la créature enchantée du Lac d'Emeraude,
mais... on ne peut pas se le permettre.
Peut-être qu'on peut.
Peins-moi.
Okay, je ne comprends pas.
Tu n'as pas arrêté de te moquer
de cette peinture
et maintenant tu veux que je te peigne ?
On savait qu'on pourrait torturer Marshall
parce qu'il avait honte.
Pas moi.
Dans mon corps, là où la glande
de la honte devrait être,
il y a une seconde glande formidable.
Histoire vraie.
Ouais, ce n'est pas de la glande
que je m'inquiétais pour la peinture.
Ouais.
Un Barney nu est un défi.
Mais je pense que tu as assez
de talent pour immortaliser ça.
Maintenant il est temps...
j'ai 31 ans.
Je suis au summum
de ma beauté physique.
Si j'étais une femme, je l'aurais dépassé
depuis très, très longtemps.
Très longtemps.
Oublie ça.
J'ai promis à Marshall qu'il serait
le seul type que je verrais jamais nu.
Je te donnerai 5 000 dollars.
On va au Loch Ness !
Ouais !
Ce chauffeur de taxi n'arrêtait
pas de parler.
Ouais, on devrait l'appeler un causeur.
Je le pense, vous le dites.
Hey, heu... merci de m'avoir supporté
hier soir, mon pote.
Faites-les souffrir.
Bonjour tout le monde.
Alors, j'ai réfléchi,
et je dis qu'on revisite les colonnes.
Oh, mon dieu, pas ça encore.
Ted, un homme en toge vient d'arriver
et d'apporter un parchemin.
Laissez-moi le lire.
Oh ! C'est de la Grèce Antique.
Ils veulent récupérer
leurs éléments architecturaux de base.
- Mon dieu.
- Quoi ?
Vous ne m'avez pas entendu ?
Toge, parchemin...
Je peux vous voir une seconde ?
Ooh, j'ai des problèmes maintenant.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Je pensais qu'on était amis.
Vous avez dormi sur mon canapé,
vous avez mangé mes céréales.
Je vous ai balancé
plus de papier toilette.
On est amis.
Mais ça ne rend pas miraculeusement
vos mauvaises idées bonnes.
Quoi ? J'en reviens pas !
Vous... vous... vous portez mes fringues !
Et les baskets... de ma petite amie...
Mec, vous avez les pieds
bizarrement petits.
Ted, j'espère que vous n'allez pas laisser
nos désaccords professionnels
interférer avec notre amitié,
parce que j'ai vraiment
besoin de vous en ce moment.
Okay, finissons-en.
Hey, hey !
Je ne veux pas que tu bâcles.
Cette peinture pourrait devenir
une vraie œuvre d'art un jour.
Je veux dire, tu as été dotée
d'un don incroyable.
Merci.
Je parlais de moi.
J'aime comme tu as capturé
l'essence de Marshall.
Ridicule et libéré, avec humour.
Mais moi, je veux quelque chose
de plus majestueux.
Quelque chose que ma progéniture
pourrait regarder et dire,
"Ici se tient Barnabus Stinson".
Il était sage...
et fort.
Je ne pense pas que ton épée tiendra.
J'en ai vu d'autres.
Et donc, alors que Lily
commençait à peindre,
Marshall pensait aux 5 000 dollars
et à ce que sa fiancée faisait
pour les gagner.
Ce n'est pas bien.
Ce n'est pas bien du tout.
Au bout du compte,
il ne put plus le supporter.
Ne bouge pas.
Ne bouge pas.
- Ne bouge pas !
- Peins plus vite !
Okay, j'imagine qu'il est temps.
Enlève ton caleçon.
Ouais.
Attends, attends !
C'est trop faible. J'ai besoin...
Dans un monde sans justice,
un seul homme...
- Oh, enlève-le !
- D'accord.
- Non ! Non, ce n'est pas bien !
- On avait un marché !
Eh bien, je reviens sur le marché.
Barney, dégage !
- Tu... !
- C'est terminé !
Lily, je ne peux pas
te laisser faire ça !
J'ai trouvé un château où on peut descendre,
mais c'est 2 000 dollars de plus.
Ce n'est pas bien du tout !
Il est beau et ils disent qu'il est hanté.
Je ne peux pas laisser la femme que j'aime
compromettre ses valeurs pour de l'argent !
Je pense qu'on peut lui tirer
plus d'argent.
Je ne laisserai jamais ma fiancée,
jamais... !
Oh, tu es encore là ?
Avant que tu dises quoi que ce soit,
je te donnerai 5 000 dollars de plus.
On accepte.
Vous êtes si faciles à manipuler.
Dansez pour moi, marionnettes, dansez.
Et c'est comme ça qu'Oncle Barney a payé
la lune de miel de Lily et Marshall.
Allez, Ted, écoutez,
pourquoi ne pas nous y remettre
et finir de tracer les plans d'un immeuble
qui, à mon avis, ne sera jamais construit,
comme ça, vous et moi pourrons sortir d'ici
et prendre quelques bières.
Non.
Ecoutez, Hammond, il n'y a pas de manière
facile de le dire, mais...
Je cherche Hammond Druthers.
Oh, c'est moi.
Je suis Hammond Druthers.
C'est les papiers du divorce.
On vous les as remis en mains propres.
Oh, mon dieu.
Elle va vraiment aller jusqu'au bout.
Alors ça y est.
C'est fini.
Il n'y a pas de manière facile
de le dire, mais...
Elle me donne les restes de Wolfie ?
Mon chien est mort ?
Oh, mon dieu. Je ne peux pas y croire.
Elle a toujours joué
trop violemment avec lui.
Croyez-moi, il n'y a pas de manière
facile de le dire...
- # Happy birthday to you... #
- Vous devez vous moquer de moi !
Les mecs, vous n'avez aucune idée
d'à quel point ça me touche en ce moment.
Attendez, c'était hier son anniversaire !
Ouais, mais une partie d'entre nous
était à la conférence à Montréal,
- alors on a pensé...
- Non ! Pas d'anniversaire ! Non !
J'avais quelque chose à dire
et je vais le faire.
Hammond, écoutez-moi.
Je suis désolé que votre chien soit mort,
et que votre femme divorce, et que...
votre vie se casse la figure et que
ces types aient raté votre anniversaire.
Et il n'y a pas de manière facile
de le dire...
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Que se passe t-il ?
Oh, mon dieu...
Oh, allez, vous n'allez pas jouer à ça,
n'est-ce pas ?
Oh ! Regardez, ouais, c'est ça.
Maintenant on tombe par terre.
Eh bien, bien essayé, mais devinez quoi ?
Vous êtes viré !
Vous êtes viré... vous comprenez ?
Vous m'entendez ?
Vous êtes fini !
Vous êtes viré.
Pour ma défense,
je pense qu'on soupçonnait tous Hammond
de faire semblant.
D'un autre côté, les secouristes
semblent penser qu'il va se remettre
et, comme vous l'avez vu,
ils ont reconnu que je n'avais pas
provoqué la crise cardiaque,
même s'ils l'ont dit un peu à contrecœur.
Et ça y était, je touchais le fond :
Ils me détestaient tous.
Mais au moment où tout semblait perdu,
j'ai eu l'idée la plus géniale
de toute ma carrière.
Des vendredi Margarita...
super idée, patron.
Okay, c'est fini.
Je vais faire un tour dehors,
que tu puisses l'admirer.
Merci beaucoup, Lily.
Marshall, tu as l'argent ?
- Ouais.
- Foutons le camp d'ici !
Une surface lisse ?
Tu m'as transformé en poupée Ken ?!
Elle a oublié Petit Barney.
Barnacle Junior.
Ma Barnana est...
Barnito Suprème.
Les enfants, je vous ai raconté
des histoires sur toutes les grandes fêtes...
Noël...
Halloween...
Thanksgiving...
mais une fête a toujours été
ma préférée...
Le Dimanche du Super Bowl.
Et il y eut un Super Bowl en 2007
que je n'oublierai jamais.
Marshall, tu t'occupes de la bière.
Lily, tu fais la sauce aux fayots.
Robin, tu t'occupes des chips
et des bretzels,
et Barney, je ne te donne rien à faire
alors tu peux te concentrer
sur le contrôle de tes problèmes de jeu.
"Problèmes".
Oh, pauvre Superman, il devrait
vraiment faire quelque chose
à propos de ses problèmes de vol.
Ce n'est pas un problème
si tu le fais formidablement bien.
Et je passerai chez Quinn, prendre
la plus géniale nourriture du monde,
le plateau d'ailes de poulets épicées
du Super Bowl.
Si j'étais un poulet, je deviendrais
cannibale pour ces garnements.
Dévorer mes propres putain d'ailes.
Je m'en fous.
J'en suis dingue à ce point-là.
Voilà les infos pour demain soir.
Qu'y a t'il demain soir ?
Oh, mon dieu,
vous n'êtes pas au courant ?
Mark est mort.
- Oh, mon dieu.
- Oh, mon dieu.
Les funérailles sont demain à 18 heures,
et je sais
que ça aurait représenté beaucoup
pour Mark que vous veniez.
Vous étiez ses clients préférés.
- Sois forte.
- On est tellement désolés.
Qui était Mark ?
- Aucune idée.
- Pas la moindre idée.
J'imagine qu'on devrait y aller, hein ?
Attendez... demain soir à 18 heures
c'est le Super Bowl.
Okay, je me sens abominable, mais la vérité
c'est qu'on ne connaissait pas Mike.
- Mark.
- Mark,
et tant qu'on envoie des fleurs,
je ne vois aucune raison
pour qu'on doive y aller.
Sors d'ici !
Je ne veux plus jamais voir
ta tronche dans ce bar !
Cet insensible bâtard vient de me dire
qu'il ne pouvait pas venir aux funérailles de Mark
parce qu'il veut regarder le Super Bowl.
Vous arrivez à y croire ?
Vous venez, pas vrai ?
Oui... On ne manquerait ça
pour rien au monde.
Okay, voilà le plan :
enregistrer le match,
aller aux obsèques,
- présenter nos respects à Matt...
- Mark.
Mark, et ne commencer à regarder
qu'avec une heure de retard.
Okay, c'est génial, mais
juste pour être sûrs que ça enregistre,
peut-être qu'on devrait incliner
notre tête et dire une prière
aux dieux du TiVo.
TiVo tout puissant,
nous te remercions pour tous
les dons que tu nous as faits :
le pouvoir de figer la télé
en direct pour aller pisser
n'est rien de moins que divin.
Sans oublier l'avance rapide
pendant les pubs.
Il semble cupide
de t'en demander davantage,
Ô boîte magique,
mais si tu fonctionnes mal
et que tu rates le Super Bowl,
on te détruira dans l'allée
avec des battes de base-ball.
- Amen.
- Amen.
On ne fait pas d'avance rapide
pendant les pubs.
Ouais, c'est le meilleur.
Oh, allez.
Vous vous souvenez de l'an dernier ?
Qui veut regarder un singe avec un soutif
en noix de coco commander une pizza ?
Oh, mon dieu.
Ce singe était si mignon.
Sérieusement, c'est la dernière fois
que je t'appelle aujourd'hui.
Okay.
Au revoir.
Tu n'as pas raccroché non plus !
Je sais !
Tu raccroches !
Tu raccroches !
Mon bookmaker. Un mec super.
Laisse-moi résumer. La seule fois où tu ne mets
pas de costume, c'est pour des funérailles ?
Je ne t'ai rien appris, Ted ?
Littéralement.
Les costumes sont pleins de joie.
Ils sont l'équivalent vestimentaire
d'un sourire de bébé.
"Vestimentaire" ?
"Ou concernant des tailleurs
ou leur commerce".
Les costumes sont pour les vivants.
C'est pourquoi quand viendra
mon heure de R.I.P.
Je partirai de ce monde
de la même manière que j'y suis arrivé...
nu. Ouais.
Ça va être formidable.
Open bar pour les messieurs,
open cercueil pour les dames.
Comment va ?!
- C'est une telle perte.
- Je sais.
Il était si jeune.
Un Dolce & Gabbana cousu main,
cachemire, croisé.
Il doit être si effrayé.
Ça va plus vite que ce que je pensais.
On va faire une apparition au bar
pour la veillée,
on regardera le match à 20 heures.
Et même si nous n'avons vu aucune baleine,
Mark et moi disions que
c'était le meilleur jour de notre vie.
Okay, je vais nous chercher
une autre tournée.
Et quand je reviendrai,
chacun racontera son histoire
de Mark préférée.
Priorité sur celle
que Carl vient de dire.
Okay, je dois être au travail à
exactement un Super Bowl de maintenant.
Oh, regardons les choses en face,
on ne va pas pouvoir le regarder.
On devrait juste découvrir le score.
Oh, dieu merci !
Je vais le trouver.
Non, non, non, on ne peut pas !
On doit regarder le match ensemble.
C'est une tradition.
Pensez aux grands moments
qu'on a vécus en regardant ce match.
Second down, tout le monde boit.
Ted, ce n'est pas un jeu à boire
si tu bois à chaque fois
que quelque chose arrive.
Ce sont des ailes de poulet
ou des ailes d'ange ?
Mon dieu, j'adore ces machins.
Je vous aime.
C'est si génial, nous tous
regardant le Super Bowl ensemble.
C'est spécial.
On doit faire ça tous les ans...
promettez-le-moi !
Du calme, mon pote.
Oh, les pubs !
Tout le monde boit !
Mon dieu, c'est une si grande tradition,
nous tous regardant le match ensemble.
Comment ça a commencé ?
Hey, Barney, je te parie 20 billets
que Casey rate ce but.
Je ne parie pas.
Parier c'est pour les nigauds.
On peut miser 1$ ou quelque chose comme ça,
tu sais. Qu'est-ce que ça fait ? C'est rien.
Très bien.
Tu vois, ça y est, il a réussi.
Tu gagnes.
Attends.
C'est à moi, juste comme ça ?
Mon dieu, c'est agréable.
Non, c'est vraiment... agréable.
Qu'est-ce qu'on peut parier d'autre ?
Rien, c'est le show de la mi-temps.
Oh, c'est naze.
Personne ne fait attention.
Je veux dire, Janet Jackson,
qui ça intéresse ?
Elle est pas cool, Robin ?
Je n'en reviens pas que tu aies invité cette fille
qu'on ne connaît que depuis quelques mois
à notre jour sacré.
Maintenant elle va être
sur toutes les photos.
Ouais, ouais, peu importe.
Je te parie les Seahawks
plus six points pour 500 dollars.
T'es dingue ?
Peut-être pour 50 dollars.
50 dollars ?!
Où est le plaisir pour 50 Dollars ?!
Pourquoi ne pas parier du vent ?!
Bon sang, Marshall !
Okay, 50 dollars.
Hey, je vais participer.
Les Seahawks, mais avec 4 points
et pour 1000 dollars.
Hey, ces ailes, ce sont des ailes
de poulet ou des ailes d'ange ?
Oh, les pubs !
Un singe avec un soutien-gorge
en noix de coco. Hilarant.
Ecoutez, on regarde toujours
le Super Bowl ensemble.
Alors faisons le pacte
de le regarder demain à 18 heures
et passons les prochaines 18 heures
sans se renseigner sur le gagnant.
C'est impossible.
Je ne vais pas vous mentir.
Ça ne va pas être facile.
Ça veut dire pas de télé,
pas d'Internet,
pas de journaux, rien.
Extinction des médias.
Mais notre tradition survit.
Qui est partant ?
- Je suis partante.
- Je suis partante.
- Je suis partant.
- Pourquoi pas, je suis partant.
- Topez là ! (high = haut)
- Mon pote, on est à une veillée.
Désolé. Topez ici solennellement.
(low = bas)
Au lever du jour, aucun d'entre nous
n'avait la moindre idée de la difficulté
de passer 9 heures sans apprendre
le résultat du Super Bowl.
J'ai décidé de travailler à la maison
pour éviter d'être contaminé
par le monde extérieur.
Hey, prends cette clé et avale-la.
Quoi ? Non.
Allez, Ted, tu manges de la salade.
Elle sortira à l'heure du match.
A plus forte raison, non.
Je ne déconne pas, Théodore.
J'ai beaucoup d'argent
qui dépend de ce match.
Si je ne me menotte pas à ce radiateur,
je regarderai le score.
Prends la clé s'il te plaît.
Très bien.
Mais seulement parce que
tu n'as pas pensé à un plan toilettes
et je pense que c'est drôle.
L'extinction des médias était
particulièrement dure pour Robin,
parce qu'elle était les médias.
Mais malheureusement,
la Ville ne réparera pas
le nid de poule exceptionnellement
gros de sitôt,
alors bouclez votre ceinture si vous êtes
sur la voie rapide Brooklyn-Queens.
Ça va être chaotique.
Comme si les trajets matinaux
avaient besoin qu'on les complique.
Vous avez raison, Kevin.
Eh bien, Robin, qu'en dites-vous ? Je pense
qu'il est temps de nous tourner vers Sid
- pour les nouvelles sportives.
- Non !
- Quoi ?
- Non.
Mais c'est... l'heure du sport.
Non, pas du tout.
C'est l'heure de la météo.
On... on vient d'avoir la météo.
Eh bien, la météo est plutôt erratique,
ça peut avoir changé.
Que se passe t'il là dehors, Lou ?
Plus ou moins la même chose
qu'il y a deux minutes.
A vous, Robin.
Okay, maintenant c'est l'heure du sport.
Non! Passons à Traffic Todd
dans l'hélico de contrôle
d'embouteillages de Metro News 1.
Robin, c'est l'heure du sport !
C'est à vous, Sid.
Merci, Kevin et Robin.
Parlons du Super Bowl.
Des semaines auparavant,
Marshall avait promis à Lily
qu'il viendrait dans sa classe de maternelle
pour une journée "montrer-parler"
Et il est un peu désarticulé...
Et son animal favori est
le monstre du Loch Ness.
Lily, combien de fois... ?
Nessie est une douce créature.
Essayons de rester loin
des termes comme "Monstre".
Eh bien, je pense qu'on peut tous
admettre qu'il est bien plus intéressant
que le poisson rouge borgne de Sally.
Trois semaines de suite ?
Allez, Sally.
Okay, eh bien, le temps est écoulé.
Artisanat d'art, tout le monde.
Hey. Je m'appelle Doug.
Oh, hey, moi c'est Marshall.
Tu vas rester là toute la journée ?
Ouais, en fait j'essaye de me cacher
parce que je ne veux pas savoir
qui a gagné le Super Bowl.
Je sais qui a gagné.
Oh, c'est génial, mais je ne veux
vraiment pas savoir,
alors si tu pouvais le garder pour toi.
A quel point ne veux-tu pas savoir ?
Excuse-moi ?
10 dollars.
Tu es sérieux ?
Ça vient juste de monter à 8.
Libère-moi, Ted.
Je ne suis jamais resté si longtemps
sans appeler mon bookmaker.
Il s'inquiète.
Pas avant l'heure du match.
Où tu vas ?
Chercher les ailes épicées.
Quoi ? Comment as-tu prévu d'entrer
et de sortir dans un bar sportif
sans voir le score ?
Il y a des télés partout.
Ah, ne t'en fais pas.
J'ai tout prévu.
Pour commencer :
j'ai mis du ruban adhésif
sur une paire de lunettes de soleil,
comme ça je ne peux voir qu'à travers
deux trous minuscules.
Ensuite, j'ai fabriqué des oeillères
avec une vieille boîte de céréales.
Et le fin du fin : des écouteurs
réducteurs de bruits haute technologie,
que j'ai achetés la première fois que
Marshall et Lily se sont remis ensemble
et qu'ils le faisaient beaucoup.
Je l'ai baptisé Privateur Sensoriel 5000.
Salut ! Je m'appelle Ted Mosby.
Je viens chercher mes ailes épicées.
Dans ma main, vous trouverez
l'appoint pour les ailes
plus un généreux pourboire.
Prenez l'argent s'il vous plaît.
Mettez les ailes dans ma main
et je repars.
Merci !
Et ceci pour conclure sur un Super Bowl
plein de surprises.
A vous, Kevin et Robin.
A très bientôt.
Et coupez.
Je suis désolée.
Heu... Robin, c'est moi,
ou avez-vous fait quelque chose
de différent là ?
Je n'ai pas encore regardé le match.
Je vous en supplie,
pour le reste du journal
il ne peut y avoir aucune référence
sur le gagnant du Super Bowl.
Je veux dire, changez le téléprompteur.
Pas de nom d'équipe,
rien de spécifique.
C'est dingue.
Je ne peux pas faire ça.
Mon ami Mark est décédé cette semaine.
Okay, ma chérie, okay.
Okay, je suis vraiment désolée.
Antenne dans cinq... quatre...
- trois...
- C'est juste si difficile.
Ha ! Qui est l'idiot maintenant ?!
Tu disais que le Privateur Sensoriel 5000
était stupide.
Mais ça a fonctionné !
Je n'ai pu ni voir ni entendre
ce qui se passait autour de moi.
Exact ?! Exact ?!
Non... !
Et comme si ça n'allait pas assez mal,
j'étais sur le point de réaliser
une chose horrible.
Où est la sauce ?
L'équipe qui a gagné,
tu veux savoir avec quoi son nom rime ?
Allez, mon pote.
Tu as promis que tu arrêterais
si je mangeais tous ces crayons.
Pourquoi fais-tu ça ?
Je suis amoureux de Miss Aldrin.
Eh bien, tu ne peux pas avoir
Miss Aldrin, elle est à moi.
Okay, qui a fait ça ?
C'est moi.
Ça veut dire que Marshall va au coin ?
Eh bien, Marshall est un adulte, alors...
Quand l'un de nous casse quelque chose,
il va au coin.
Désolée.
Et après le Super Bowl,
le maire de la ville
de l'équipe perdante doit payer,
en envoyant au maire de la ville
de l'équipe gagnante
15 livres d'une friandise
pour laquelle sa ville est réputée.
Meilleur allumage de tout type de grill,
steamer ou friteuse
qu'on peut utiliser pour cuisiner
cette friandise, Maire de l'Equipe Gagnante.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Je ne te parle pas.
Si, tu me parles.
Tu feras tout ce que je dis.
- Retiens ton souffle.
- Je ne retiens pas mon souffle.
L'équipe gagnante est...
Maintenant voilà comme ça va marcher :
Tu vas m'emmener à trois films
de cul par semaine...
Et puis Oncle Marshall eut une idée.
Une idée dont il ne fut pas fier
rétrospectivement,
mais à situation désespérée...
Oh, non.
Quelqu'un a mouillé son pantalon.
- Non, pas du tout.
- Oh, vraiment ?
Qui est-ce que tout le monde va croire ?
Je suis un adulte, étudiant
troisième année en droit à Columbia
et tu n'es qu'un petit mouilleur de pantalon.
Alors maintenant je te pose une question :
Tu veux pouvoir t'esquiver tranquillement
aux toilettes et sécher
ou bien vais-je avoir quelque chose
à montrer-parler aujourd'hui ?
- Hey, tout le monde...
- Okay, okay.
Tu gagnes.
Je veux récupérer mon argent.
Et ton dessert.
Monsieur, qui a gagné le Super Bowl ?
Désolée, j'ai raté le match.
Vous avez raté... ?!
Comment il a pu rater... ?!
Excusez-moi !
Qui a gagné le Super Bowl ?!
Je... ne suis pas vraiment le sport.
Oh, mon... !
Emmitt Smith !
Oh, dieu merci.
Ouais, j'ai beaucoup de ça.
Tu dois me dire,
qui a gagné le Super Bowl ?
C'était hier soir le match ?
Tu sais, une fois que tu as gagné
un ou deux de ces trucs,
c'est en quelque sorte... eh.
Mais tu es Emmitt Smith. Tu es footballeur,
c'est le Dimanche du Super Bowl.
Qu'est-ce qui pourrait être potentiellement
plus important que le football ?!
La danse, mon ami.
La danse.
Non... !
Salut ! C'est encore moi.
Oh ! Je ne vous avais pas reconnu.
Ouais, vous avez oublié
de me donner la sauce !
Ah. Oui.
C'est celle-là.
Il était 16 heures et jusque là,
on avait tous fait l'impossible.
Mais ensuite, presque simultanément,
les choses ont commencé à se gâter.
Et finissons la journée
sur une note joyeuse.
Il y a une nouvelle arrivée
au Zoo du Bronx.
Reportage de Trish Sanchez.
- Hey, mon pote.
- Hey, mec, fais gaffe.
Et en l'honneur
de la grande victoire d'hier...
- Hey, mon pote, fais gaffe.
- Mec, fais attention !
...le zoo a décidé de donner au bébé panda
le nom des champions du Super Bowl...
Non... !
Non... !
Non... !
Oui... !
Formidable.
Juste à temps pour le coup d'envoi.
Aucun de vous ne connaît le score, hein ?
- Mission accomplie.
- Pas découvert.
Super. Allons-y.
J'ai déjà fait avance rapide
sur les quatre heures de reportage
pré-jeu. Alors on est prêts.
Barney, je ne peux même pas te regarder.
Je ne veux aucun signe de qui a gagné.
Ne t'en fais pas,
je ne vais rien laisser échapper.
Ne vous gênez pas
pour commencer sans moi.
Ah... ! Stupide ! Stupide ! Stupide !
Tant d'argent !
Tu l'as fichu en l'air, Barney !
Tu as tout fichu en l'air !
Stupide ! Stupide ! Stupide !
Okay, regardons le match.
Barney, c'était quoi ça ?
On sait sur qui tu as misé.
Maintenant tu as gâché le match
pour tout le monde.
Ouais. Merci beaucoup, Barney.
T'as trouvé le moyen de le dire.
Ouais, je ne savais pas
et maintenant je sais.
Aucun intérêt de regarder le match.
Bah, au moins les pubs
ne sont pas gâchées.
Les ailes sont encore bonnes.
La bière fonctionne encore.
Ah, et puis merde.
Regardons Barney perdre de l'argent.
Hey, écoutez ça :
J'ai été racketté
par un gamin de 5 ans aujourd'hui.
J'ai failli être virée aujourd'hui.
J'ai rencontré Emmitt Smith aujourd'hui.
Ooh, tu commences.
J'ai essayé le Privateur Sensoriel 5000.
Ouais, vas-y, Barney.
Eh bien, je descendais la rue
en courant comme un malade
en essayant de savoir
le score du match...
Et voilà le plus drôle,
aussi inoubliable que fut ce Super Bowl,
nous voilà 23 ans plus tard
et je ne me souviens pas du gagnant...
Je ne me souviens même pas de qui jouait.
Ce dont je me souviens,
c'est qu'on a bu la bière,
on a mangé les ailes et on a regardé
le Super Bowl ensemble.
Parce que parfois, même si tu sais
comment quelque chose va finir,
ça ne veut pas dire que
tu ne peux pas profiter du voyage.
On a même porté un toast
à ce bon vieux Mike.
Je veux dire Mark. Matt.
Merde !
Pourquoi je continue à faire ça ?
Non seulement j'ai perdu le match,
mais j'ai perdu chaque pari individuel.
Distance totale de penalty,
nombre de remises en jeu,
tirage au sort...
Quelles sont les chances
de perdre le tirage au sort ?
50-50, approximativement.
Interceptions, buts, passes,
s'il devrait y avoir une sûreté
ou non, premier...

Les enfants, ne sous-estimez jamais
la puissance du destin.
Parce qu'au moment où vous vous y attendez
le moins, la moindre chose
peut provoquer un effet de vague
qui change votre vie.
Prenons pour exemple
mon voyage à Chicago.
Cette gardienne de sécurité
était un petit peu tripoteuse.
C'est drôle.
Elle m'a à peine touché.
Porte 23. Viens.
Si on rate ce vol,
je ne me le pardonnerai jamais.
Pourquoi ce vol était-il si important ?
Revenons quelques mois en arrière,
en automne 2006.
Je venais de vendre ma première
conception de bâtiment et j'étais devenu
le plus jeune chef de projet
de l'histoire de mon entreprise.
Subitement, les chasseurs de têtes
s'intéressèrent à moi.
Une entreprise avait même envisagé
de me confier son bureau de New York.
Ils me firent venir par avion
pour un entretien final
à leur siège social à Chicago.
C'était l'opportunité de toute une vie.
C'était mon destin.
Il n'y eut qu'un problème.
Bonjour, attendez, encore deux.
Désolée, vous avez trop de retard,
j'ai déjà fermé les portes.
Je suis sûr que si on tire vraiment
très fort, on peut les ouvrir.
J'aimerais que ça marche comme ça,
mais voyez-vous, une fois
que j'ai fermé ces portes, c'est fini.
Plus personne n'est autorisé
à emprunter cette passerelle.
A part ce type.
S'il vous plaît, si je rate ce vol,
je raterai l'entretien pour le job de mes rêves.
Je suis désolée, monsieur.
Le job de ses rêves !
Vous n'avez jamais rêvé d'un job ?
Une chose que vous avez toujours voulu
faire depuis que vous étiez petite fille ?
Je veux dire, bon sang, je suis sûre que
vous n'alliez pas vous coucher chaque soir
en rêvant d'être...
Je veux dire, heu...
C'est un boulot sympa.
Je vous en prie, je dois prendre ce vol.
Je vais voir ce que je peux faire.
Mais ça semble mal parti.
Merci.
Votre uniforme est joli.

Okay.
Ils n'ont pas encore armé les portes,
alors vous avez encore une chance.
C'est au capitaine de décider
et ils vont nous rappeler.
Super, tenez-nous au courant
dès que vous savez quelque chose.
Bien sûr, et à l'avenir,
nous vous recommandons d'arriver
à l'aéroport une heure et demie
avant votre vol,
non, vous savez, une minute après.
En temps normal,
je suis incroyablement fiable.
J'ai dû aller au tribunal ce matin
pour être condamné.
Non que je sois un criminel
ou quelque chose comme ça.
Ouais, il a juste sauté
par dessus un tourniquet du métro.
Vous semblez avoir beaucoup de problèmes
avec les règles du voyage.
Allô ?
Oh, c'est une grande nouvelle.
C'est ma mère... elle a trouvé
sa boucle d'oreille manquante.
Asseyez-vous. Je vous appellerai
quand j'aurai du nouveau.
Où elle était ?
Ce truc ferait mieux d'avoir
le signal d'appel.
Tu pourrais appeler la société
et expliquer ce qui se passe.
Il ne reste que trois personnes
et je sais qu'ils doivent
prendre leur décision aujourd'hui.
J'ai comme le sentiment que ne pas me
montrer pourrait jouer en ma défaveur.
Je suis si stupide.
Pourquoi ai-je sauté ce tourniquet ?
Hey, ne sois pas si dur envers toi-même.
Et tout ce truc n'est-il pas
de la faute de Barney ?
Elle marquait un point.
C'était en quelque sorte
de la faute de Barney.
Revenons quelques mois en arrière.
Oh, Marshall,
comment va l'orteil cassé ?
Oh, bon sang, ça tue.
Tu veux de l'aspirine, bébé ?
Tu sais que je ne crois pas
aux analgésiques.
Wow, ton premier os cassé.
Ça flingue toute ta théorie
de "l'incassable".
Marshall pensait
qu'il était indestructible.
Eh bien, ça tenait debout.
Je n'ai jamais rien cassé.
Je n'ai jamais été malade,
et en cas de besoin,
je peux rassembler une force incroyable.
Ted, raconte-lui l'histoire
de la porte vraiment lourde.
Il y avait une porte vraiment lourde.
Il l'a ouverte.
En tirant un seul coup.
Tu dois vraiment être déçu
de ne pas pouvoir courir demain.
Ouais. Ça craint,
tout cette énergie à m'entraîner pour
le marathon a été une perte de temps.
S'entraîner pour un marathon.
Quoi ?
Tu n'as pas besoin d'entraînement pour
un marathon. Tu le cours, c'est tout.
Tu plaisantes, hein ?
Pas du tout. Je pourrais courir
un marathon quand je le voudrais.
Alors genre demain, tu penses que
tu pourrais te réveiller, sortir du lit,
et courir le Marathon de New York City ?
Absolument.
Barney, on parle de 42 kilomètres.
Merci, Canada.
Je vais prendre la suite.
Barney, c'est genre 26 miles.
Voilà comment courir un marathon.
Etape un, vous commencez à courir.
Il n'y a pas d'étape deux.
Okay, tu sais quoi ?
Prouve-le.
Prends mon numéro et cours à ma place.
Je te parie 50 billets que
tu ne finis même pas la course.
50 billets ?
Grand-père, si je gagne,
peut-être que je pourrai
m'acheter une glace.
Monte à 10 000 dollars.
Tu as un problème de jeu.
Tu vas parier 50.
Très bien, alors pas de pari.
Okay, 50.
Le matin suivant,
comme le marathon commençait,
on était concentrés
sur l'ordinateur de Marshall.
Chaque coureur a une puce traceuse,
alors on peut les suivre on-line, voir
quand ils passent certains points de contrôle.
Barney a mis la mienne dans sa chaussure.
Ooh, il commence !
Ça devrait être bon.
Wow.
Il passe déjà le second point de contrôle.
Ce truc de traçage est incroyable.
Quand on sera mariés, tu en auras un.
Wow. Regardez son temps.
C'est plutôt impressionnant.
Il doit tricher, okay.
Il savait qu'on vérifierait.
Ouais, il ferait n'importe quoi
pour gagner un pari.
Souvenez-vous de cette fois où il a parié que
Men at Work chantaient "Hungry Like the Wolf",
et quand il a découvert que non,
il a essayé de les engager ?
On dirait que "Barney" devrait
arriver sur le pont Queensboro
et monter la 1ère Avenue à peu près
dans l'heure qui vient. Mais...
pas moyen que ça soit vraiment lui.
C'est vraiment lui.
Hey ! C'est à moi.
Ouais, tu ferais mieux de courir !
- Quoi de neuf, non-finisseurs ?
- Wow.
- Très impressionnant, Barney.
- N'est-ce pas ?
Ouais, mon temps aurait dû être
meilleur d'une demi-heure,
mais j'ai rencontré ce super canon
au Mile 7. On a fait un détour rapide
et on a fait notre mini-marathon
derrière un Mac'Do.
J'ai gagné.
Je doute que quiconque soit gagnant
dans cette histoire.
Alors où sont mes 50 dollars ?
D'accord.
Je dois l'admettre, tu l'as mérité.
Huh ? Je n'en reviens pas qu'ils n'aient
pas encore fait de pièce pour ça.
Quoi qu'il en soit, je rentre chez moi.
Je pourrais passer à la gym.
Oh, hey, juste pour info,
tous les marathoniens peuvent
emprunter le métro gratuitement
aujourd'hui.
Wow. Tu sais, je devrais vraiment
jeter un coup d'œil à ce "métro".
J'en ai tellement entendu parler.
Wow. Regardez-moi.
Je m'encanaille.
Je vais peut-être même
y passer un week-end
et j'appellerai ma copine qui passe
sa vie dans le métro ce soir.
Tu sors avec une fille du New Jersey ?
Non.
Ainsi, Barney l'a fait.
Il a vraiment fini le marathon.
Mais un petit moment plus tard...
j'ai reçu un coup de fil intéressant.
- Allô ?
- Ted, c'est Barney.
Ecoute-moi. J'ai besoin que
tu viennes me chercher dans le métro.
Quoi... de quoi tu parles ?
J'étais assis là, complètement
indifférent à ce qui m'entourait.
Finisseur.
Ouais, vous savez ce que je veux dire.
86ème Rue.
Mes jambes ne fonctionnent pas.
J'ai déjà parcouru deux fois
le métro du terminus au terminus.
J'ai vu où il fait demi-tour.
Ted, tu ne veux jamais voir
où le métro fait demi-tour.
Les jambes de Barney
ne fonctionnent pas.
Il a parcouru le métro
du terminus au terminus,
parce qu'il ne peut physiquement pas
sortir du train.
C'est les meilleurs 50 dollars
que j'aie jamais dépensés.
Ecoute-moi, Ted.
Je vais te perdre d'une seconde à l'autre.
Je suis voiture quatre du train six
se dirigeant au sud de Pelham Bay Park
dans le Bronx.
Retrouve-moi à la station 86ème Rue
dans environ une demi-heure.
D'accord. J'y serai.
Reste où tu es.
Ted, Ted.
Oh, allez. Vous n'allez même pas
renoncer à votre siège pour lui ?
Je suis désolé.
Je ne peux pas.
Crétin.
- Barney ?!
- Ted !
Hey !
Non... !
Tu vois ? Si Barney n'avait pas
essayé de courir le marathon,
tu n'aurais jamais sauté ce tourniquet,
tu n'aurais pas eu cette audience
au tribunal aujourd'hui,
et on aurait eu cet avion.
Tu as raison.
Tout peut être retracé jusqu'à lui.
Comme cette éruption
qu'on a tous eu à Noël.
D'accord, je dois voir ce qui se passe.
- Alors j'ai pu vous réserver deux sièges.
- Vraiment ? C'est génial !
Non, non, pas vous. Je parle à ma mère
du Blue Man Group.
Maman, je peux te rappeler ?
Okay, et pour notre vol ?
On peut monter à bord ?
J'attends encore...
On dirait que votre avion
est déjà parti.
Quoi ? Non, non, non, non.
Je dois être à Chicago aujourd'hui.
Il ne vous a même pas rappelée ?
Bah, c'est typique du pilote.
Ils ne vous rappellent jamais au travail
et ils ne vous rappellent pas après
avoir passé deux nuits avec vous
dans un Radisson à Orlando.
Il s'avérait qu'il y avait un autre vol
qui m'aurait emmené à Chicago
juste à temps
pour mon entretien d'embauche,
mais c'était carrément
de l'autre côté de l'aéroport.
Quel était le nom
de la compagnie aérienne, déjà ?
Je crois que c'était quelque chose
comme "Flights R' Us".
Avec le "R" à l'envers ?
Mon dieu, j'espère que non.
- Bon sang.
- Stupides chariots futés.
C'est plus des chariots débiles.
Si on rate ce vol,
c'est de la faute de Barney.
Tu sais, Barney n'aurait jamais
couru le marathon en premier lieu
- si Marshall ne s'était pas cassé l'orteil.
- Ouais, et alors ?
Quoi, tu penses que c'est de ma faute ?
Pour Marshall, l'idée initiale de courir
le marathon a pris naissance en Avril.
Mon pantalon commence
à me serrer un peu.
Oh, c'est rien.
J'aime ce mignon petit bide.
Je ne peux pas permettre ça.
Quoi ?
Je vais courir
le Marathon de New York City.
"C'est important de faire
le plein de glucides
deux à quatre heures
avant une grande course.
Pour le petit déjeuner, essayez
de prendre un bagel, une banane,
des flocons d'avoine, des fraises
et du jus d'orange."
Voilà, Marshmallow.
Exactement comme marqué sur le livre.
Ouais, mais à partir de maintenant,
je mange tout mon petit-déj. type-coureur.
Les liquides sont digérés plus vite.
Comme ça, pas d'énergie gaspillée,
et c'est essentiel pour la course.
"N'oubliez pas de vous emplir
d'encouragements positifs."
Ça va être ta meilleure course
jusqu'à présent.
Tu vas atteindre tous tes buts.
Tu es un robot envoyé du futur
pour gagner le marathon !
Tu es... Marshall.
Tu es.. Marshall.
Tu es Marshall ! Ouais !
"Des irritations ou ampoules peuvent
se produire en divers endroits,
y compris les pieds, les aisselles,
ou même les mamelons.
Essayez de passer de la vaseline
sur les zones affectées."
Oh, bon sang !
Mon pote,
tu es un coureur fantastique.
Demain tu vas courir et finir
le Marathon de New York City !
Tu es le meilleur.
Tu es beau.
Personne n'est meilleur que toi.
Marshall ?
Oh, mon dieu !
Alors oui, c'était de ta faute.
Si tu ne t'étais pas pointée à
l'appartement au milieu de la journée,
Marshall ne se serait pas cassé l'orteil,
Barney n'aurait pas couru à sa place,
je n'aurais pas sauté le tourniquet
et eu une audience au tribunal,
et on aurait eu notre avion
largement à temps !
Et je ne serais pas tombé en me mordant
la langue à l'aéroport.
Ce n'était vraiment pas de ma faute.
Je ne serais pas tombée sur Marshall
s'il n'y avait pas eu Lily.
Hey, réfléchis-y.
Hey, que se passe t-il ici ?
Oh, on dirait qu'ils campent
pour quelque chose.
Ouais, mais pour quoi ?
Je ne sais pas. D'habitude il y a
un Stormtrooper ou un Klingon dans la file
pour donner l'indication.
"Soldes annuels de robes de mariage.
Robes de concepteur avec remise de 90 %.
Les portes ouvrent demain à 8 heures."
Oh, mon dieu. Tu peux croire ce que certains rapiats
feraient pour épargner quelques dollars ?
On doit camper devant.
- Tu es sérieuse ?
- Tu ne comprends pas.
C'est une vente incroyable.
J'en ai déjà entendu parler,
mais je n'ai jamais su où c'était.
On fera un camp robe de mariée.
Ça sera marrant.
Je ne peux pas y aller.
J'ai ce truc.
- Quel truc ?
- Un pénis.
- C'est là.
- Oh, wow.
Badgley Mischka !
Melissa Sweet !
Vera Wang !
Oh, Robin, as-tu la moindre idée
de sur quoi vous êtes tombés ?
Tu as dit wang.
Oh, ça me rappelle la queue
à Lilith Fair en 1998.
Juste moins de coupes mullet.
Ça devrait te rassurer. Tu n'es que style
la 10ème mariée la plus dingue de New York.
Ooh, c'est confortable.
On devrait vraiment pouvoir dormir.
C'est un peu ennuyeux.
Je suis sûre que quelqu'un va venir
la couper d'une minute à l'autre.
Je ne pense pas pouvoir supporter ça.
A chaque fois qu'elle s'éteint,
je pense,
oh, peut-être qu'elle ne
se remettra pas en route,
mais ensuite elle recommence.
Pourquoi ça fait ça, Robin ?
Pourquoi ça n'arrête pas ?
Ça va aller, chérie. Pourquoi....
Pourquoi n'en ferions-nous pas
un jeu, okay ?
Pourquoi ne pas chanter dessus ?
Si on survit à ça,
je jure de vivre ma vie différemment.
Je veux juste dire une dernière fois
à mes parents que je les aime.
Bonjour, mesdames.
- C'est lui. C'est le type de la voiture !
- Dégage !
Le matin suivant, Robin était trop
fatiguée pour retourner à Brooklyn,
alors pendant que j'étais au travail,
elle est venue dormir chez moi
quelques heures,
et c'est là que...
Personne n'est meilleur que toi.
Marshall ?!
Oh, mon dieu !
Donc, si Lily ne m'avait pas traînée
au magasin de robes de mariage,
on aurait eu le premier vol.
Oh, dieu merci. Les portes sont
encore ouvertes. On a réussi.
Bonjour. S'il vous plaît.
On doit vraiment prendre ce vol.
Oh, mon dieu !
Vous êtes cette journaliste de Metro News 1.
Oui, oui, c'est moi.
Je n'en reviens pas
que vous m'ayez reconnue.
- Vous aviez cette histoire de pizzas géantes ?
- Voudriez-vous vérifier
- s'il vous reste des places ?
- Un moment, monsieur.
Ces pizzas étaient réelles ?
Allez, elles l'étaient ?
- Robin...
- Une seconde, Ted.
Vous savez, beaucoup de gens
me le demandent.
La vérité c'est :
les pizzas étaient réelles.
- Calzones. Photo truquée.
- Je le savais !
Mon dieu, c'est si agréable
de rencontrer un fan !
Et je serais fan de votre travail
si vous pouviez nous trouver
deux sièges sur ce prochain vol.
Les... hôtesses de l'air viennent
de finir leur compte final de sièges.
Voyons ce que je peux trouver.
Ça aiderait si je montais faire
un discours passionné sur mon destin ?
Je pense que ça pourrait faire mal.
C'est un tel cauchemar.
Okay, alors on est d'accord ?
Ça ramène à Lily qui voulait camper
pour une robe de mariage ?
Non.
Attends. Ça remonte plus loin.
Tu te souviens pourquoi on mangeait
des hot dogs sur l'East Side ?
1939 ?!
Ce penny est de 1939 !
Un penny de 67 ans.
Tu réalises que ce penny a été frappé
pendant la seconde guerre mondiale ?
Comme mon grand-père,
mais ça ne le rend pas plus intéressant.
Ecoute, je m'y connais un peu en pièces,
et ce bébé vaut quelque chose
pour un collectionneur.
- Non, pas du tout.
- Bien sûr que si !
Tu sais quoi ?
Je vais t'emmener dîner
avec l'argent que je retirerai
de ce petit mec.
Et c'est exactement ce que j'ai fait.
Tu as de la chance qu'il existe encore
un endroit qui serve quelque chose pour 1.5 $.
Hey, c'est 150 fois sa valeur d'origine.
En fait, le repas n'avait coûté
que 1.49 dollar.
1984.
Hey, dans 50 ans on on pourra
à nouveau dîner ?
Comment oses-tu.
Hey, que se passe t-il ?
Je ne sais pas. On dirait qu'ils campent
pour quelque chose.
Ouais, mais pour quoi ?
C'était moi.
J'ai commencé ça.
Si je n'avais pas ramassé ce penny,
on n'aurait pas traversé la ville
pour aller chercher des hot dogs.
Et on n'aurait pas vu
ce magasin de robes de mariage,
Lily n'aurait pas voulu camper,
et je n'aurais pas eu besoin
d'une sieste chez toi le lendemain.
Marshall ne se serait pas cassé l'orteil.
Barney n'aurait pas couru le marathon.
Je n'aurais pas sauté ce tourniquet,
été arrêté, eu cette audience
au tribunal...
Et on aurait eu notre avion.
Je ne pense pas qu'on puisse
remonter plus loin que ça
à moins que tu saches
qui a laissé tomber le penny.
J'aimerais.
Bien que cette personne
ait déjà été assez punie,
en perdant un beau penny comme ça.
Monsieur ?
Oh, s'il vous plaît, dites-moi
que vous avez de bonnes nouvelles.
J'ai peur que non.
Il n'y a pas de places supplémentaires
dans l'avion.
Je suis désolé.
D'accord, merci d'avoir essayé.
J'en reviens pas.
C'est tout, c'est fini.
Ted, allez.
Ton destin n'était pas d'aller
à Chicago aujourd'hui.
Quoi qu'il en soit, si cette société
te veut, ils reprogrammeront.
Mais ce n'est pas ce qui est arrivé.
Ils n'ont pas reprogrammé.
Ils ont engagé quelqu'un d'autre.
Et il s'est avéré que
trois mois plus tard,
ce type a fini par devoir
déménager à Chicago.
Les enfants, ce qui est drôle
au sujet du destin...
je pensais que j'étais destiné
à avoir ce boulot.
Mais j'avais tort.
Mon destin était de rester à New York.
Parce que si je ne l'avais pas fait,
je n'aurais jamais rencontré votre mère.

Les enfants, la clé d'une bonne
relation est la communication.
- Il faut parler.
- Que dirais-tu d'aller chez Mimi ?
Nan, chez Mimi,
ça ne me dit trop rien.
J'ai faim.
Choisissons un resto et allons-y.
Tu sais oů on devrait aller ?
Chez Cynthia.
Tu adores ce resto. Tu te souviens du bon
temps qu'on y a passé la derničre fois ?
- Ah bon ?
- Ouais, ouais.
Il y avait ce serveur taré qui n'arrętait
pas de dire : "Vous devriez vous marier !
Vous devriez vous marier !"
Il est aussi important de savoir
quand s'arręter de parler.
Allez ! Puis on est sortis.
Il pleuvait.
C'était si romantique.
Pourquoi ne t'en souviens-tu pas ?
Parce que ce n'était pas moi ?
Oh, exact !
C'était...
ma soeur.
Vous voyez, arrivé
au début de la trentaine,
vous ętes sorti
avec pas mal de personnes,
mais quand vous ętes dans une relation,
il est courtois de prétendre
que ça n'a pas été le cas.
Oh mon Dieu, c'est Van Helsing.
Tu te souviens
quand on est allés le voir ?
On était assis au dernier rang.
Je n'ai jamais vu Van Helsing.
C'est vrai.
Je l'ai vu avec ma soeur.
Mon patron
vient de rentrer de Maui.
Il a dit que
c'était vraiment romantique.
Oh, c'est trčs romantique.
Quand es-tu allé ŕ Maui ?
- J'y... suis allé avec ma soeur.
- Avec ma soeur.
Pourquoi dis-tu toujours ça ?
On n'a plus 16 ans. On est tous les deux
sortis avec d'autres personnes.
C'est idiot de faire
comme si ce n'était pas le cas.
Tu as raison.
On devrait ętre honnętes.
Absolument.
Tu vois cette fille lŕ-bas ?
Il y a 3 ans,
j'ai super flirté avec elle.
Je ne veux pas entendre ça.
- Quoi ? Tu as dit...
- C'est d'une indélicatesse !
- Tu te souviens de l'honnęteté ?
- T'es un salaud !
Tu es...
déconcertante.

Tu es obligé de faire l'amour
avec l'une d'entre elles.
Soit une sirčne classique :
le bas poisson, le haut humain,
soit une sirčne inversée :
le haut poisson, le bas humain.
Vas-y !
Je sais pas.
Elle est grosse ?
Ouais, mais c'est un poisson,
alors c'est de la bonne graisse.
Ŕ peine sortis
de l'impression !
Je n'accepte pas
de prospectus.
Tu en a pris un
deux secondes avant d'entrer ici.
C'est différent.
C'était pour un club de strip-tease.
Deux dollars de réduc sur les ailes.
Combien ton prospectus me fait
économiser sur les ailes ?
Trčs bien.
C'est un propectus pour ma pičce.
Lily, j'adorerais venir,
mais on n'est plus ŕ la fac
et je n'essaie pas
de coucher avec toi.
- Alors, cette sirčne...
- L'ami de Lily lui a demandé
de jouer dans cette pičce,
et ça va ętre vraiment bien.
Lily, je t'aime,
mais on est trop vieux pour ça.
Demander ŕ quelqu'un
de venir voir ta pičce
c'est comme demander ŕ quelqu'un
de t'emmener ŕ l'aéroport,
de dormir sur ton canapé,
ou de t'aider ŕ déménager.
Appelle un taxi,
réserve une chambre,
engage des déménageurs
et répčte aprčs moi :
les amis ne laissent pas leurs amis
venir voir leur pičce merdique.
Tout d'abord, j'y ai réfléchi,
et haut poisson.
Ensuite, il faut que
vous décidiez quelque chose pour nous.
Oui, vous devriez rompre.
Plus tôt dans la soirée...
Mmm, on devrait descendre au bar.
Je sais qu'on devrait,
mais tu es si sexy
dans mon sweat-shirt rouge.
Oh mon Dieu, pourquoi
ça fait partie de l'histoire ?
On y arrive.
Mon visage est vraiment sec.
Tu as de l'hydratant ici ?
Oui, dans la salle de bains.
Va t'hydrater !
Il faut garder
ce joli visage hydraté.
Oh, non, non, non, non, non !
- Qu'est-ce qu'elle a ?
- Elle déteste ce mot.
- Quel mot, "hydratant" ?
- Non ! Vraiment, arręte !
Bref, Ted va donc dans la salle
de bain chercher l'hydra...
la lotion pour le visage...
Wow, c'est un produit de qualité.
Maintenant je connais le secret
de ton magnifique teint.
De quoi tu parles ?
C'est ŕ toi.
Non.
Oh... alors c'est ŕ Lily.
Non.
Ŕ qui est cet hydratant, Ted ?
Ŕ ma soeur.
Donc en d'autres mots,
ŕ une fille avec laquelle tu es sorti.
Um... je t'aime.
Dégoűtant. Tu me laisses mettre
le męme hydratant qu'une de tes ex ?
C'était probablement ŕ Carla.
Son visage était une ruine.
Je ne pense pas que Ted soit
sorti avec elle pour son visage.
Merci, Marshall.
Merci beaucoup.
Pourquoi est-ce encore
dans ton appartement ?
Je sais pas.
Je ne l'ai jamais jeté.
Pourquoi ? Tu as encore
des sentiments pour cette fille ?
Ouais. Je suis éperdument
amoureux d'elle,
et le seul moyen que
j'aie trouvé pour y faire face,
c'est de garder
un tube de lotion ŕ 3 dollars.
Pas 3 dollars ! Plutôt 14.
Pourquoi est-ce un tel drame ?
Parce que je ne veux pas
utiliser l'hydratant d'une pute !
Wow, ce n'était pas une pute.
Elle laisse des lotions
hyper chčres dans toute la ville.
Elle me donne l'impression
d'ętre une pute.
Tu as gardé quoi d'autre
de tes ex-copines ?
Rien. C'est tout.
Enfin, ŕ part
la cabine téléphonique.
Et la lampe sur le bureau.
Et le...
Non.
Non ! Non ! Oh, Ted !
Ah, l'éternelle question :
aprčs avoir rompu avec quelqu'un,
que faire de ses affaires ?
Une question ?
Ce n'est pas une question, fillette.
Ŕ l'évidence,
il doit s'en débarrasser.
Ce qui ŕ l'évidence est dingue,
et je ne vais pas le faire.
Alors on a décidé
que c'est vous qui alliez décider.
Ouais, comme on l'a fait
pour le pantalon de Marshall.
Ah, l'affaire de 2005 de
Lily vs le Pantalon de Joey Buttafuoco.
Pas mal, hein ?
Je vais devoir dire non.
Je ne veux pas qu'une fille de 16 ans
tombe amoureuse de toi
et donne un coup de poing ŕ Lily.
Oui !
Je dis qu'il peut le garder.
"Regarde le crétin dans son pantalon
parachute" est une belle entrée en matičre.
Ted.
Ted ? Ted ?
Désolé, mon pote,
ce sera aussi un "non" pour moi.
Et au fait,
les Bel Biv Devoe ont appelé.
Męme eux ne veulent pas
récupérer ce pantalon.
Il était incroyablement confortable !
C'était comme un pyjama
qu'on pouvait porter ŕ l'extérieur.
Marshall, c'est terminé.
On t'a męme accordé un appel, et
ça ne rendait pas mieux avec des rangers.
Bien, écoutons les arguments.
Ted, tu commences.
Okay. Le fait que j'aie toujours
des affaires de mes ex n'est pas grave.
Quand je vois la cabine
téléphonique sur le piano,
je ne pense pas ŕ Jeannie Radford,
je pense au bon temps que j'ai passé
en voyageant ŕ travers l'Europe.
Et quand je vois la lampe,
je ne pense pas ŕ Allison Moses.
Je me souviens que j'étais fauché,
ŕ peine sorti de la fac,
et j'avais vraiment besoin
d'une lampe.
Et quand je vois ce coussin,
je ne pense pas ŕ Lauren Stein.
je pense ŕ cette tache brunâtre
et comment elle est arrivée lŕ.
Du Mr. Freaze
et de la sauce de dinde,
pas en męme temps.
C'est adorable,
mais maintenant, quand j'entrerai dans
l'appartement, voilŕ ce que je verrai.
J'étais la copine de Ted ŕ la fac.
Il m'a fait 12 cassettes de compilations.
Combien t'en a-t-il fait ?
Il t'appelle sa "puce" ?
Il m'appelait sa "puce".
Je suis stupide, mais mes nichons
sont plus gros que les tiens.
Vraiment ? Tu n'arrives pas
ŕ regarder un coussin
sans voir mon ex-copine.
Un coussin !
Oui, Ted, le fait que tu aies toujours
ce coussin est horrible et écoeurant.
- Tu es horrible et écoeurante.
- Ta mčre est horrible et écoeurante.
Un peu de discipline !
Je suis du côté de Robin.
C'est ta copine, et si ces affaires
la dérangent, tu dois t'en débarrasser.
Je suis du côté de Ted.
Ce n'est pas parce que tu as encore
des choses qu'une ex-copine t'a donné,
que tu tiens ŕ elle.
D'accord, Barney.
Tout dépend de toi.
- Je suis du côté de Robin.
- Quoi ?
Ted, ton appart est trop chargé.
On dirait que tu habites
dans un Bennigan's.
Ou un Danby's.
Quoi, il n'y a pas de Danby's
aux États-Unis ?
Vraiment ?
Alors oů mangez-vous des sandwichs
de patte de grizzly ŕ la crčme glacée ?
Arręte, ma puce.
Donc je n'avais pas le choix.
J'ai rangé tout ce que
j'avais reçu de mes ex-copines.
C'était douloureux,
mais pas aussi douloureux que ce que
j'allais devoir endurer ce soir-lŕ.
New York est connu
pour ses théâtres,
mais il y a différents niveaux.
Il y a Broadway,
sous-Broadway,
sous-sous-Broadway,
des SDF qui hurlent dans le parc,
et en dessous de ça,
la pičce dans laquelle jouait Lily.
Huit étages de marches.
Qui installe un théâtre
au huitičme étage ?
C'est quoi comme immeuble ?
D'aprčs l'odeur,
je dirais une usine d'urine.
Oů voulez-vous vous asseoir ?
Je sais oů
je ne veux pas m'asseoir.
Les amis, quatre places ensemble !
J'ai apporté un sac
au cas oů quelqu'un voudrait vomir.
Allez,
ça ne va pas ętre si mauvais.
Non ? Okay.
Je... suis.. la Colčre !
Je... suis... l'Avarice.
Je suis la Rage... l'Envie !
Je me tire d'ici.
Non. Tu dois rester.
Voici le visage du Consumérisme !
Oh mon Dieu.
Ted fait partie de la pičce.
Bonjour Avarice, Colčre...
Envie...
et Consumérisme.
Je... suis votre pčre...
Amérique !
Oh bébé, c'est magnifique !
Absolument, je n'avais aucune idée
que l'Avarice était la meurtričre.
Et quand c'est devenu
une pičce dans la pičce,
j'ai fait
"maintenant, on y va franchement !"
Wow, Lily, c'était nul !
Barney !
Quoi ? C'était horrible.
Allez, vous ętes d'accord, non ?
Désolé, je suis juste honnęte,
parce que... on est amis.
Non, les amis
se font se sentir bien.
Ils se construisent mutuellement
et se soutiennent.
Ça ce sont de bons amis.
Ouais, si tu es un Schtroumpf.
Si tu jouais dans une pičce,
je resterais tout le long
pour te complimenter ŕ la fin.
Oh vraiment ? Oui ?
Ouais.
Mauvaise idée, Aldrin,
mauvaise idée.
Nous allons commencer l'interview
avec le metteur en scčne...
moi-męme...
ici męme dans 5 minutes.
T'arrives ŕ croire ce que Barney
a dit sur la pičce de Lily ?
Je sais. Il peut ętre
vraiment indélicat.
Mais c'était assez mauvais.
Oh mon Dieu,
c'était vraiment mauvais.
Oh mon Dieu, on t'a cambriolé !
Nope.
Toutes ces affaires
venaient de tes ex-copines ?
Tu ne t'achčtes rien toi-męme ?
Que puis-je dire ?
Papa reçoit des cadeaux.
Et ceci aurait dű ętre la fin
de tout ça. Mais le jour suivant...
Au début j'étais vraiment énervé de devoir
me débarrasser de toutes mes affaires.
Mais de voir comme ça te rend
heureuse... ça valait le coup.
Je me sens comme ça quand je fais
l'amour ŕ contrecoeur avec toi
quand je suis vraiment fatiguée.
Exactement. Parfois tu dois
prendre sur toi pour l'équipe.
Allez, assieds-toi.
Assieds-toi, ouais.
Alors tu ne gardes jamais rien
de ce que tes ex-copains te donnent ?
Nope.
Enfin, sauf mes chiens.
Donc j'ai dű me débarrasser de toutes
les affaires de mes relations passées
parce que tu ne gardes rien
de tes relations passées
sauf... uh, d'oů viennent
tes cinq chiens ? Oh c'est vrai...
de tes relations passées.
Oů veux-tu en venir, Ted ?
Tu te souviens quand tu as dit que
quand tu venais dans mon appartement,
tout ce que tu pouvais voir,
c'était mes ex-copines ?
Quoi, quand tu regardes mes chiens, tout
ce que tu vois, ce sont mes ex-copains ?
Maintenant, oui.
C'est ridicule.
Tu avais dit que tu t'étais débarrassée
de tout ce que tes ex t'avaient donné.
Ouais, mais pas mes chiens.
Tu as dit tout.
Mais pas des choses vivantes.
Dis ça au cactus de Bolivie
trčs rare que j'ai jeté.
Les choses avec un coeur qui bat
peuvent rester.
Ça te plaît ?
Pickles, va chercher ta balle.
Va chercher ta balle.
Admets-le. C'était
un peu hypocrite de ta part
de me faire jeter
toutes mes affaires.
Que veux-tu que je fasse, Ted ?
Que je me débarrasse de mes chiens ?
Devine dans quelle position
on l'a fait.
Oui. Oui, je veux que
tu te débarrasses de tes chiens.
Um, non.
Vraiment ? Je propose
qu'on en fasse part au groupe,
mais tu as peu de chances.
Elle ne va pas
se débarrasser des chiens.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas chez toi ?
- Męme moi, je ne ferais pas ça.
- Oui !
Tu peux demander ŕ quelqu'un
de se débarrasser de son iguane
aprčs qu'il ait fait caca dans
ses cheveux, mais pas de son chien.
Jebediah me manque.
Oh, j'ai failli oublier.
Des prospectus
pour ma nouvelle pičce.
Trčs amusant.
Oh, c'est pas une plaisanterie.
Demain, c'est la premičre
de mon one-man show.
Et męme si c'est terriblement
et atrocement long,
je m'attends ŕ ce que vous soyez
tous lŕ puisqu'on est de si bons amis.
Oh, on sera lŕ.
Ŕ moins que tu veuilles
admettre que tu avais tort...
- Jamais.
- Bien.
Okay, je dois aller répéter.
Oh, j'ai failli oublier.
Amenez un poncho.
Les trois premiers rangs
sont seront mouillés.
Je suis désolée de ne pas t'avoir dit
d'oů venaient les chiens.
Je suis désolé de t'avoir
demandé de t'en débarrasser.
C'était ridicule.
Alors tout va bien entre nous ?
Ouais, tout va trčs bien.
Et j'ai cru que c'était le cas,
mais comme ce fut le cas dans
le septičme acte de la pičce de Lily,
la Jalousie refit surface.
Oh ouais, c'est une super place.
Mec, je dois pisser.
Je dois y aller.
Il a vraiment du mal
ŕ gérer ça, hein ?
Ouais, vraiment.
Ça m'a fait réfléchir. Peut-ętre que
je devrais me débarrasser de mes chiens.
Il est peut-ętre temps
de les envoyer ŕ la ferme.
- Tu vas tuer tes chiens ?!
- Non ! Non, non, non,
il y a vraiment une ferme.
Ma tante a une ferme
ŕ la campagne.
Oh, Dieu merci.
Tu sais, si j'étais cinq chiens,
je préfčrerais vivre dans une ferme
que dans un appartement ŕ Brooklyn.
Ouais. Je pourrais
leur rendre visite les week-ends.
Ma tante est trčs seule lŕ-bas.
Il n'y a qu'elle et sa compagne, Betty.
Oh, c'est parfait.
Elles adorent les chiens.
"Elles" ?
Que veux-tu dire par "elles" ?
Uh... uh.... uh...
les gens de la campagne.
Oh, regarde,
ça commence. Chut !
Tu es sűre que ça va aller ?
Tu sais que ça va ętre...
Je sais, mais je vais
rester assise jusqu'au bout,
et je dirai quelque chose
de sympa ŕ la fin.
Tu sais pourquoi ?
Parce que c'est
ce que font les amis.
Hydratant.
Hydratant.
Hydratant.
Hydratant.
Ce fut les 40 premičres minutes
du spectacle de Barney.
Hydratant.
Puis on a dű endurer
20 minutes de ceci.
Je dois aller le remplir.
Je reviens dans un instant.
La pičce n'est pas terminée.
On ne me choisit jamais
pour participer.
Puis c'est juste devenu bizarre.
Sentiments...
intérieurs.
Oh, non !
Et comme ça n'a pas marché...
Okay ! Arręte !
Tu gagnes. C'est bon.
Barney, je suis désolée
de t'avoir fait venir ŕ mon spectacle.
Merci, Lily.
Y a-t-il quelque chose que
tu voudrais dire sur mon spectacle ?
Non.
Non, je n'ai rien de gentil
ŕ dire sur ton spectacle.
Tu avais raison, Barney.
Allons au bar.
Oui ! Je gagne !
J'adore gagner !
Oh, Lily.
Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily.
Je commençais juste ŕ m'échauffer !
Si vous saviez ce qui arrive
dans l'acte deux... oh !
J'imagine que c'est plutôt affreux,
alors allons-y.
Plutôt affreux ? Plutôt affreux ?
C'est un chef d'oeuvre d'affrosité.
C'est génial ŕ quel point c'est mauvais.
J'aimerais que vous puissiez voir ça.
Ouais, enfin bref.
C'est dans l'acte deux
que j'ai vraiment atteint mon apogée.
Alerte au spoiler :
le robot tombe amoureux.
Que dis-tu de ça, Barney ?
Et si on restait
pour regarder
le reste de ton spectacle ?
C'est votre enterrement.
Cinq, six, un, deux.
Donc on est restés pour laisser Barney
nous torturer une autre heure et demie,
parce que c'est ce que font
les amis, apparemment.
Hey.
Oů étais-tu ?
Je t'ai appelée tout ŕ l'heure.
J'ai donné mes chiens
ŕ ma tante.
Tu quoi ?
Ouais. Juste pour quelques mois
pour un essai, mais...
je crois que c'est pour le mieux.
Wow.
Oh, bon sang.
On peut entrer ?
Non. Allons au bar.
Pourquoi ?
Qu'y a-t-il ŕ l'intérieur ?
- Les sols sont partis.
- Quoi ?
Ouais, je les ai sortis
pour les faire... réparer.
C'est un terrible mensonge.
Je vais me sauver.
Je ne savais pas que tu allais
te débarrasser des chiens !
Tu as dit
que tu avais tout jeté !
Les enfants, ce fut la pire engueulade
que Robin et moi ayons jamais eue.
C'était une de ces engueulades
qui dure des heures
et oů on commence ŕ avoir des vertiges
en oubliant pourquoi on s'engueulait.
On s'est engueulés si longtemps qu'on a vu
les saisons changer par la fenętre.
Les pages du calendrier
ont tourné. C'était dingue.
Mais enfin, je ne pourrais pas vous dire
comment męme si ma vie en dépendait,
mais on en est arrivés lŕ.
On va vraiment le faire ?
Ouais.
- On emménage ensemble !
- On emménage ensemble !
Le robot a trouvé l'amour
Grillant mes circuits
Mon software a été hacké

Tu es fait pour moi
Deux, trois, quatre.

C'est formidable.
Je n'en reviens pas
que ce moment arrive enfin.
Encore un mile,
et mon petit gars passera à 200 000.
Ton bébé Fiero s'est développé
dans un très vieil homme Fiero.
Et exactement comme un vieil homme,
il perd du fluide, il sent le rance,
il fait des bruits bizarres à l'arrière.
Ouais, c'est vrai.
Allume ces cigares
dans la boîte à gants.
C'est des vrais Cubains.
Je les ai pris à Chinatown l'an dernier
pour ce moment précis.
Marshall, ce n'est pas pour dire
que tu étais complètement déchiré,
mais c'est des baguettes emballées
dans des serviettes.
- De quoi tu parles ?
- Whoa, nid de poule.
Quoi ? Non. Oh. Non.
Non, non, non.
Non, il ne reste que 8 miles.
Allez, mon pote.
Mon pote !
C'est cool si je les allume quand même ?

Les enfants, la vie nous force parfois à
être quelqu'un qu'on n'a pas voulu être.
Quand ça arrive, on essaye souvent de se
raccrocher à un petit bout de ce qu'on était.
Ça peut être un tatouage.
Ou un bijou.
Un minuscule souvenir qui nous rappelle :
"C'est qui je suis vraiment".
Le souvenir de Marshall
était moins minuscule,
mais plus il s'estimait poussé
vers le monde corporatif
et éloigné de son rêve
de sauvegarder l'environnement,
plus fort il s'accrochait à cette Fiero.
Hey.
Une bonne chose : on est dispensés
de la fête du pliage aujourd'hui.
Hey. C'est très important
aussi bien pour Lily que pour moi
qu'il y ait une grue en origami faite
main dans chacun de nos... de mariage...
Je n'y arrive même pas.
Dieu merci.
Ça va bien se passer pour ta voiture.
C'est le meilleur garage des alentours.
Regarde cette attestation.
L'un des mécaniciens
a fini un steak de 64 onces.
Surprise.
Ça nous faisait de la peine
que vous ratiez
la fête de pliage d'origami
super marrante, alors...
on a suggéré de l'apporter ici.
On a insisté.
Fantastique.
Comment va la Fiero ?
Elle est toujours au triage.
Elle ?
Je pensais que c'était ton petit gars.
Oh, ça va et ça vient.
C'est une sorte de voiture transexuelle.
Ça fait combien de temps que tu...
la... / le possède ?
Mes frères me l'ont transmise
quand j'avais 16 ans.
Comme c'est gentil à eux.
Pas vraiment.
Félicitations.
La Fiero est à toi.
Si tu passes le test final.
Allez !
J'ai déjà rasé mes jambes
et avalé 5 dollars en quarters.
Il n'est ressorti que 4.50 dollars.
Va juste au drive-in de Weinerburger
et prends-nous 12 tasses de café.
- C'est tout ?
- Oh, ouais.
Mais on décide de ce que tu portes.
D'accord.
Complètement d'accord.
Vous êtes nu.
Je suis au courant.
Vous avez 50 centimes ?
Non...
Puis-je juste avoir mes cafés,
s'il vous plaît ?
Désolé, nous sommes en panne
de plateaux et de couvercles.
Deux grands types sont passés il y a
quelques minutes et les ont tous achetés.
Et voilà l'origine de la règle
démente de Marshall
"ni nourriture ni boissons dans la Fiero,
pas même de l'épicerie".
Ce n'est pas dément.
Barney. C'est au moins le troisième
d'affilée que tu fiches en l'air.
Bah, j'essaye, mais c'est...
Tu plies deux fois au milieu, tu plies
dans les deux sens, tu tires les extrémités,
tu retournes, tu ouvres les ailerons,
tu plies les bords, tu plies à la moitié,
tu plies les ailes vers le bas, tu enfonces
les coins et tu plies les ailes en arrière.
Ou préférerais-tu que l'un de mes élèves
de maternelle te montre ?
Attends, attends, attends.
Attends, je pense que j'ai compris.
Non.
Laisse tomber, le papier est trop cher.
Tu es viré.
Oh, mince.
La règle sur la nourriture est démente.
On a failli mourir à cause d'elle.
- Tu te souviens du fiasco des 100 000 ?
- Ah, le Fiero-asco.
Mon pote, je t'ai dit que ça ne marchait pas.
C'est le fiasco des 100 000.
- C'est quoi le fiasco des 100 000 ?
- Le Fiero-asco ?
C'était juste avant les vacances d'hiver
de notre première année de fac.
Marshall et moi étions colocataires,
mais on n'était pas encore vraiment amis.
Je trouvais Ted un peu prétentieux.
Et Marshall était un vrai porc.
Hey.
Je ramène ma Fiero pour les vacances.
Je sais qu'on se voit
suffisamment comme ça,
mais si tu veux un brin de conduite, je ne
cracherais pas sur l'argent de l'essence.
Tu habites en Ohio, pas vrai ? Je pourrais
faire un détour et passer te prendre.
D'accord, tout d'abord,
mes parents habitent en Ohio.
Je vis au jour le jour.
En plus, on ne s'est pas vus
depuis Thanksgiving, Karen et moi.
On s'investit vraiment pour que ce truc
longue distance fonctionne, alors...
D'accord, appelle-moi si tu changes d'avis.
Mon compteur va atteindre 100 000.
Elle serait si déprimée
si je partais plus tôt.
C'était complètement réciproque.
Je veux dire, Karen en a parlé
la première, mais je...
c'était...
c'était complètement réciproque.
Je comprends.
Alors, quoi de neuf avec toi et Lily ?
Quelque chose de sérieux ?
Ouais.
Mon pote, on est en première année de fac.
Je ne vais pas me laisser enchaîner
par la première poulette que je me fais.
Lily est sympa, mais c'est pas le genre
d'oiseau qu'on enchaîne, tu sais ?
Les heures suivantes de notre périple
se déroulèrent de manière classique.
Donc... cette chanson.
Oh, c'est la meilleure chanson du monde.
C'est la seule chanson que j'aime.
Je déconne.
La cassette est coincée dans le lecteur
depuis genre deux ans.
C'est mieux que rien.
Peut-être.
J'en ai tellement... marre...
de cette chanson.
Ne t'en fais pas.
Ça va revenir.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
# Just to be the man who walks 1,000 miles #
# And falls down at your door... #
Ouais, on a vachement assuré sur le final.
C'était probablement notre meilleur.
Hey, tu veux jouer à Gratte le Chien ?
- Quoi ?
- C'est un jeu de voiture.
Chaque fois que tu vois un chien, tu dois
être le premier à dire : "Gratte le chien".
- Je suis plutôt bon, alors...
- Gratte le chien.
Non, je ne savais pas qu'on avait...
qu'on avait commencé, mais...
Okay, c'est cool.
Tu as le premier point.
- Gratte le chien.
- Gratte le chien. Merde !
On joue toujours ? Parce que je n'étais pas...
Je n'étais pas vraiment...
12 à rien.
Marshall.
- Marshall.
- Gratte le chien, cabriolet bleu.
Merde !
18 à rien.
Alors Marshall, qui était si occupé
à tricher à Gratte le chien,
nous a complètement perdus.
Où on est, bordel ?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Attends.
Je pense que tu as sauté quelque chose.
Vraiment ? Ça semble impossible.
Hey, on a le temps.
Que dirais-tu de sortir de l'autoroute,
de prendre une route moins fréquentée ?
Robert Frost.
Ça ne semble pas une bonne idée.
Trop tard.
Je prends cette sortie.
Qui ne s'éclate pas assez maintenant,
Karen ?
Ensuite on s'est perdus.
Où on est, bordel ?!
- Je vais me garer.
- Non, continue de conduire.
On n'a presque plus d'essence et
on n'est peut-être même plus sur une route.
Il fait moins de zéro dehors. Si on se gare,
on pourrait être enneigés pendant des jours.
En plus, je n'ai que six barres Granola
et trois bouteilles d'eau.
- Nah, je les ai jetées.
- Quoi ?!
Ni nourriture ni boisson dans la Fiero.
Ni nourriture ni boisson dans la F... ?
Tu n'as pas lavé tes draps depuis l'orientation !
Ainsi commença la plus longue nuit
de notre vie.
Je suis sûr que mon pied est
complètement gelé.
Marshall...
il y a vraiment de grandes chances
qu'on soit enneigés pendant des jours.
Si je meurs en premier, fais tout
ce qu'il faut pour survivre.
Mange ma chair.
Ouvre-moi comme un tauntaun,
n'importe quoi.
Merci, Ted.
Tu es vraiment un ami.
Et si je meurs en premier,
laisse juste mon corps tranquille.
Quoi ?
Je viens de dire que tu pourrais
m'ouvrir et ramper en moi.
Ouais, ne me fais pas ce genre de trucs.
Ça me dégoûte.
Mais... mais tu es mort et je vais mourir
si je ne le fais pas.
C'était pas une décision facile.
Tout ça à cause de ta règle démente
de pas de nourriture.
C'est parfaitement rationnel.
Hey ! Mes lunettes !
Hey.
Je sais qu'on a peu d'essence,
mais on peut allumer le chauffage
juste une minute ?
Okay.
Mon pote...
je déteste dire ça...
mais il fait si froid...
il n'y a qu'une seule manière
de réussir à passer cette nuit.
- On aurait dû continuer à rouler.
- Allez, Marshall.
Non. Non. On pourrait mourir maintenant.
Je peux ne jamais revoir Lily.
Je ne l'ai jamais dit à personne, mais...
Ça fait longtemps que je sais
que je vais épouser cette fille.
Si on survit, un jour je l'épouserai.
Je suis désolé pour tes lunettes.
C'est rien.
Elles étaient décoratives.
Hey, Marshall.
Ouais ?
Tu penses encore à Lily ?
Ouais.
Arrête, s'il te plaît.
Et donc, Marshall et moi pensions qu'on
allait mourir là, au milieu de nulle part.
Mais, détail amusant...
Hey. Vous feriez mieux de continuer
à rouler, les amoureux.
- Gratte le chien !
- Merde !
Ça fait si longtemps que tu disais
que tu allais m'épouser ?
C'est si mignon.
C'est lors de ce voyage que Marshall
et moi sommes devenus meilleurs amis.
Avec privilèges,
d'après ce que j'ai compris.
Eriksen.
Wow.
On dirait qu'il a vraiment
besoin d'un câlin.
Ted.
Il a dit qu'il faudrait au moins 3 000$
pour la remettre en état.
Et même ensuite,
il n'y a aucune garantie.
C'est une vieille voiture.
Ouais. Tu peux prolonger sa vie,
mais ce n'est presque plus
qu'une machine à ce moment-là.
Je sais que c'est beaucoup d'argent,
mais c'est ma Fiero, vous savez ?
Je suis sur le point d'être diplômé et
de prendre un boulot juridique quelconque,
et sans cette Fiero,
je ne suis qu'un autre type en costume.
- Comment oses-tu...
- Hey.
J'en ai tellement vécu dans cette voiture.
Le chat suicidaire.
Waldo l'auto-stoppeur.
Le SDF qui est entré par la vitre
et a vomi partout sur le siège arrière.
Lily, non.
Sois forte. Ne me la joue pas
"prisonnière d'un dilemme".
La voiture est sur son lit de mort, Robin.
Je dois libérer ma conscience.
De quoi vous parlez les filles ?
Peu de temps après avoir rencontré Robin,
on a eu très envie de nourriture Thai
de ce fameux endroit.
Une heure et demie pour la livraison.
On ne peut pas attendre si longtemps.
J'aimerais qu'on puisse prendre la Fiero,
mais Marshall a cette règle démente
de pas de nourriture.
Mais nourriture Thai, Lily.
Pad Yum Mao.
Tom Kai Gah.
Thai See Ran.
Oh ! Tu dis juste des syllabes au hasard
et ça semble quand même délicieux.
Okay. Voilà ce qu'on va faire.
On y va, on les prend,
on les met dans un double sac,
on conduit très prudemment pour les
rapporter avec les fenêtres ouvertes,
et il ne le saura jamais.
Wow, ces freins sont vraiment sensibles.
Oh, Marshall va me tuer !
Ça et la différence entre "affecter" et
"effectuer" sont les deux seules choses
pour lesquelles il est vraiment sérieux.
- Lily, ça va aller.
- Non, pas du tout.
Marshall va paniquer. Oh, mon dieu,
oh mon dieu. Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ?
- Oh, mon dieu, oh... !
- Tais-toi !
Maintenant, écoute-moi.
L'heure tourne.
Okay, tout d'abord, on vire tous
ces petits morceaux de tofu et de chou.
Ensuite, on va s'occuper des bouts
vraiment dégoûtants...
les flaques qui se sont formées.
On doit absorber cette soupe.
Enfin, il y a l'odeur.
On doit couvrir ce Tom Kah Gai.
Tu as parlé de cigares.
Il y en a deux dans la boîte à gants,
mais il les conserve.
Donne-moi ces baguettes.
Hey, pourquoi pas de la musique ?
Oh, super chanson.
Ces cigares n'aident pas du tout.
Ouais. C'était une idée désastreuse.
Maintenant ça sent comme si un SDF
avait vomi là-dedans.
La vitre cassée ?
Il fallait que ça ait l'air réel.
Pourquoi en avez-vous cassé deux ?
Ça semblait marrant quand elle l'a fait.
Alors j'ai voulu essayer.
Je n'en reviens pas que pendant
tout ce temps c'était vous.
J'en voulais vraiment à ce type bronzé
en justaucorps de danse.
Marshall, je suis vraiment désolée,
mais d'avoir partagé ce secret...
nous a fait devenir meilleures amies,
Robin et moi.
Wow. Quelle voiture spéciale.
Alors, je peux la réduire en petit cube ?
Je ne sais pas. Je ne sais pas.
Je ne sais pas.
Allez, Marshall.
C'est ta Fiero.
Tu sais ce qu'il faut faire.
Wow, Barney, pourquoi aimes-tu autant
cette voiture ?
L'aimer ?
Attendez une seconde.
L'aimer ?
Je la déteste !
Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi ? Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi ?!
- Pourquoi ?!
- Laisse-moi le dire.
C'était l'an dernier pendant
la grève des transports.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Marshall est dans le coin ?
J'ai un massage dans le Queens dans
une demi-heure. J'ai besoin qu'on m'emmène.
Non, il est à la bibliothèque
toute la journée. Prends les clés.
Hey ! Pourquoi ne m'emmènes-tu pas ?
Ça ferait une super balade.
Dans le Queens ?
Ouais, on prendra... on prendra
du boeuf séché, des Triscuits.
Heu... en fait j'ai beaucoup de boulot.
Okay. Eh bien ça ne fait rien,
je vais annuler.
- A plus.
- Attends !
Tu sais conduire, hein ?
Quoi, bien sûr que je sais conduire.
J'adore conduire.
Tracer la route.
Décontracté dans les allées.
Et freiner.
Klaxonner. J'adore ça.
A part pour les femmes au volant.
Ne me lance pas sur les femmes au volant.
- Quelle pédale l'accélérateur ?
- Question piège.
- Non, pas du tout.
- Si.
- Non, pas du tout.
- Milieu, gauche, droite ?
Je n'ai jamais appris à conduire !
J'ai grandi en ville.
Je n'en ai jamais eu l'occasion.
Eh bien, devine quoi ?
Tu as ta chance.
Parce que je vais t'apprendre.
Barney Stinson, mets ta ceinture.
Ce n'est pas bien.
Dieu n'a jamais voulu qu'on voyage
à de telles vitesses casse-cou.
Détends-toi.
Tu te débrouilles bien.
Ignore la vieille dame sur le talus ;
ce n'est pas une course.
Mon pote, un chien.
Gratte le chien. Oups. Ou rien.
Qu'est-ce que je fais ?
Dis-moi quoi faire, Ted.
Appuie sur le frein. A un moment donné
au cours des prochaines 20 minutes.
Laquelle ?
C'est laquelle les freins, déjà ?
- La gauche.
- La gauche. Oh, la vache, la gauche.
- J'ai tout oublié.
- Fais les L. (left = gauche)
Oh, on ne va pas y arriver.
Pourquoi as-tu allumé la radio ?
Je ne sais pas pourquoi
j'ai allumé la radio !
On va mourir.
Dis-moi quoi faire, Ted.
Détends-toi. T'es dingue.
- Aide-moi, Ted ! Je suis sérieux.
- Arrête, jette-toi à terre et roule.
Crier c'est drôle !
Crier c'est drôle !
Je ne peux pas bouger.
Je ne peux pas... je ne sens pas mes...
Attends.
Attends.
On va bien.
- On va bien.
- On va bien.
C'est un miracle, Ted !
Wow. On dirait que tu as eu
un accident dans cette voiture.
En fait, il a eu deux accidents,
si tu ajoutes le fait qu'il...
Hummina-hummina-hummina-hummina.
Je ne devrais même pas être là,
grâce à cette situation périlleuse.
Mais le destin...
le destin m'a donné une seconde chance.
Et m'a aidé à réaliser
que notre temps sur cette planète
était trop court pour le gaspiller.
Alors j'ai décidé, à partir de ce moment,
de croquer la vie à pleines dents.
Tu as donc décidé de changer de vie
en ne changeant pas de vie du tout.
Histoire vraie.
Les amis.
Cette Fiero représente beaucoup
pour nous tous.
Des amitiés se sont crées.
Des aventures ont eu lieu.
On a affronté des horreurs.
C'est pourquoi on doit s'en débarrasser.
- Oui !
- Quoi ?
Elle a eu une belle vie et a mérité
de mourir avec dignité.
Mais 200 000...
Mais c'est la vie.
Tu sais ?
On ne finit jamais par être
ce qu'on pensait vouloir être.
Je n'aide pas l'environnement.
Ted n'est pas philosophe.
Lily n'est pas une artiste
mondialement célèbre.
Barney n'a jamais dépassé
les 10 miles à l'heure.
Robin a aussi éprouvé des déceptions
dans sa vie, j'en suis sûr.
Peut-être ?
Et ma Fiero n'est pas une Fiero
qui a atteint les 200 000 miles.
C'est rien. Vous savez ?
Ce sont des vieux rêves.
On aura une nouvelle voiture et
on la remplira de nouveaux souvenirs.
Et ça sera la voiture qu'on a eue
quand on était jeunes mariés.
Quand on a eu notre première maison.
Peut-être même la première voiture
dont nos quatre enfants se souviendront.
C'est si mignon.
La première voiture dont
nos deux enfants se souviendront.
J'aimerais dire au revoir.
Tu sais quoi ?
Cette Fiero a effectué
nos vies à tous.
- Affecté.
- C'est ce que j'ai dit.
Je préfère m'en assurer.
Elle nous a emmenés à beaucoup d'endroits.
Peut-être qu'il est temps
qu'on lui rende la pareille.
Cette Fiero devrait arriver à 200 000.
Alors on va passer cette porte.
Et on va la pousser sur le dernier 0.7 mile.
Elle aurait fait la même chose pour nous.
Hey, les génies.
Les roues arrière sont sur les blocs.
Cette voiture n'ira nulle part.
- Presque !
- Presque !
Et alors Marshall a dit au revoir
à sa Fiero.
Et en guise de cadeau final
de la part de la voiture,
l'argent récupéré des pièces détachées a payé
nos tournées pour les deux soirées suivantes.
Arrivederci, Fiero !
Tu étais l'Arbre Généreux des voitures.
Puisses-tu rouiller en paix.
Rôtit en enfer, destrier diabolique.
Et quel meilleur ami y a t'il que ça ?
Frérot.
Tu as entendu cette nouvelle chanson ?
Je viens d'avoir le cassingle.
Mets-là.
Je n'en aurai jamais marre
de cette chanson.
Jamais, jamais, jamais, jamais, jamais.
Ouais !

Les enfants, au printemps 2007,
tout allait très bien entre Robin et moi.
Nous avons donc décidé
d'améliorer encore tout ça.
Nous avons décidé
d'emménager ensemble.
Je peux faire venir le camion
de déménagement pour 8h00.
Ça convient à tout le monde ?
Au fait, qu'allez-vous faire
de la chambre de Ted ?
Parce que si vous avez besoin d'aide
pour le loyer, je la prends.
Pourquoi voudrais-tu
vivre avec nous ?
Ce que vous faites,
je n'appelle pas ça "vivre".
Voilà le truc : ils me faut
une chambre plus proche du bar.
Il me faut exactement 23 minutes
pour emmener une fille
du bar à mon appartement.
Beaucoup de choses
peuvent mal tourner en 23 minutes.
Ça va vraiment être excitant.
C'est elle qui paie.
Je te jure
que s'il ne me rappelle pas,
je vais aller jusqu'au bout.
Dépêchez-vous, monsieur.
Je veux faire
des trucs cochons avec toi.
Des trucs
que je ne le laisse pas faire.
Chaque feu rouge grillé
vous fera gagner 20$ supplémentaires.
Bébé ?
Oh, non, non, non, non.
Tout était de ma faute.
Je suis vraiment bourrée.
Quand je suis aussi bourrée,
je deviens dingue !
J'en suis sûr.
Regarde ça.
Quoi de neuf,
messieurs les policiers ?
On était si près.
Vous voyez ? Si j'avais une chambre ici,
je n'aurais qu'à monter avec elles.
Allez ! Ce serait génial !
On viendra
après que vous soyez couchés
et je serai reparti
avant que vous ne vous réveilliez.
Donc tu peux faire l'amour, et nous,
on est obligés de réveiller une pouffiasse
pour la mettre dehors ?
Mon Dieu, Lily.
Un type vient de lui dire qu'il l'aime
avant d'aller à la salle de bains
pour ne jamais revenir, et tu ne peux
même pas lui offrir un café ?
Vraiment sympa.

Je t'ai mis toutes tes grosses vestes
dans ce carton marqué "hiver".
Et tous tes pulls colorés
dans ce carton marqué "Bill Cosby".
Moque-toi, mais l'Amérique
aimait ce type pour une raison.
Wow !
Presque fini.
Pas si vite.
Prends ton épée.
Wow.
- La fin d'une ère.
- Ouais
C'est embêtant de séparer l'ensemble,
mais tu vas avoir besoin de cette épée.
C'est vrai. Mon immeuble
est infesté de dragons.
On dirait que notre petit garçon
déménage enfin.
J'ai l'impression que ce n'était qu'hier
qu'il était ce mignon petit étudiant.
Découvrant le Reggae
et l'Ultimate Frisbee.
Il l'a fait plus tard que les autres
enfants, mais on ne l'a jamais poussé.
On savait qu'il y arriverait.
Tu n'as pas encore emménagé, si ?
Bien.
Vous devez répondre à ce quiz.
Je l'ai trouvé dans un magazine.
L'intitulé du quiz est :
"Êtes-vous prêts à emménager ensemble ?"
Si ça ressemble à ton quiz
"Portez-vous des culottes",
je ne marche pas.
Première question.
Ted, "Veux-tu emménager avec Robin ?"
Mmm. Oui.
Oh, première mauvaise réponse.
La réponse est "non, tu veux
secrètement rester célibataire
et traîner
avec ton génialissime ami Barney".
Deuxième question.
Robin, "Penses-tu pouvoir
te trouver un mec plus canon que Ted ?"
Correct. La réponse
était un silence embarrassé.
Troisième question. "Ai-je inventé
ce quiz pour prouver quelque chose ?"
Oui.
Tout à fait.
Vraiment ? Tu veux dire que
ça ne vient pas d'un vieux bloc jaune ?
Alors ? On est tous d'accord ?
On ramène les affaires de Ted ?
Mmm... non.
On emménage toujours ensemble.
Pourquoi ? C'est dingue.
Ted, tu fous ta vie en l'air.
Cette fille t'aveugle.
Avec ses cheveux luisants
et ses seins en forme de seins.
C'est aussi mauvais pour toi,
tu sais.
Comment te sentiras-tu
quand il te verra sans maquillage ?
Là, je ne suis pas maquillée.
Bon sang, tu es magnifique.
Très bien, comment te sentiras-tu
quand tu ne pourras pas fumer
ton occasionnelle cigarette ?
Oh arrête.
Robin ne fume pas.
Attends, tu fumes ?
Bien sûr que non. Pourquoi ?
Ne me dis pas
comment vivre ma vie !
Ted, je ne peux pas
te laisser faire ça.
Arrête. C'est en cours.
Au lieu de t'y opposer,
pourquoi ne pas aider ?
- Tu veux que je t'aide ?
- Ouais.
Okay, Ted.
Je vais t'aider.
J'arrive pas à croire qu'on ait réussi
à lui faire descendre un carton.
Peut-être qu'il se joint
enfin au mouvement.
Où est le camion ?
Où est Barney ?
Ça va venir.
J'y crois pas !
Tout ce que je possède se trouve dedans.
Sauf ce carton
de couvercles de pots.
Et l'épée.
Je vais le tuer.
Je jure que je vais le tuer !
Bien. Peut-être que je vais
tenir ça. Pour le moment.
Marshall, on vit seuls.
C'est vraiment génial !
On peut enfin faire tout ce qu'on a dit
qu'on ferait si on vivait seuls.
Oh, je sais par quoi
je veux commencer.
Nous y voilà, pas vrai ?
On est assis nus
dans l'appartement.
- Génial.
- Ouaip.
Ce n'est pas aussi génial
que ce que j'imaginais.
- Mes fesses me grattent.
- J'ai froid.
J'ai remarqué.
Ouais, tu peux parler, Pointue.
Barney, je ne sais pas
si tu as eu mes 47 autres messages,
mais si je ne récupère pas mes affaires
dans l'heure, j'appelle la police.
C'est la dernière fois
que je t'appelle.
Parce que mon chargeur
se trouve dans le camion.
Ne t'inquiète pas, c'est Barney.
Il va ramener tes affaires.
C'est juste que j'avais vraiment envie
de m'installer, tu sais ?
Peut-être installer ma télé.
Regarder un film au lit.
Quoi ?
On veut vraiment d'une télé
dans la chambre ?
Je pensais que oui.
Je n'en suis pas sûre.
Sinon, où pourrait-on
mettre ma télé ?
On pourrait la mettre
dans notre cave.
Mais ma télé
ne nous manquerait pas ?
- Tu crois ?
- Oui, je crois.
On a cette télé depuis longtemps
et on se sentirait plus chez nous
si on la mettait dans notre chambre.
- Il nous faut du vin, non ?
- Oui.
On va continuer ça
dans la chambre ?
Pourquoi ?
Ted ne vit plus ici.
On peut le faire où on veut.
Tu sais quoi encore ?
On n'a plus besoin
d'être silencieux.
On peut être aussi bruyants
qu'on veut.
Okay, je crois qu'il faut
qu'on établisse quelques règles.
Ce n'est pas parce qu'on peut être
bruyants qu'on est obligés de l'être.
Et ça t'excite peut-être,
mais crier "je suis le meilleur",
ça ne marche pas sur moi.
C'est bien mieux que de crier
"Ted n'est pas là" encore et encore.
Au moins ce que j'ai dit
est vrai.
C'était inutile.
Eh bien, puisque
je n'ai qu'un seul carton,
je me suis dit
que je pourrais le déballer.
Où crois-tu
qu'on devrait les mettre ?
À moins que tu n'aies une pièce pour
les couvercles, je pensais au placard.
Quoi ?
Le truc, c'est que ma cuisine
est plutôt petite.
Et j'ai déjà
un tas de couvercles de pots,
et j'ai les pots
qui vont avec, donc...
Tu dis qu'il n'est pas possible de faire
de la place pour le seul carton
que j'essaie de déballer chez nous ?
Pourquoi tu ne
le descendrais pas à la...
Ne dis pas "cave".
J'allais dire "poubelle".
Bon sang, Robin, c'est tout
ce qu'il me reste au monde...
huit couvercles de pots
et une épée.
Ouais, à propos de l'épée...
Allô ?
Mettez le costume, M. Mosby.
Barney, je sais que c'est toi.
Où sont mes affaires ?
Ce n'est pas moi.
Si tu veux revoir
tes précieux biens,
mets le costume.
Quel costume ?
Ding-dong. Oh, c'est quoi ça ?
La sonnette.
Voilà le costume dont je parle.
Je ne suis pas encore
arrivé à la porte.
Okay,
dis-moi quand tu y es.
Okay, j'ai ouvert.
Et il y a un costume.
Voilà le costume dont je parle.
- Barney....
- Ce n'est pas Barney.
Mais j'ai entendu dire
que ce type est génial.
Très bien.
Écoute-moi attentivement.
Tu récupèreras tes affaires si tu arrives
à exécuter une suite de défis.
Tout d'abord, mets le costume.
Ensuite, retrouve-moi
chez McClaren's dans une heure.
Comment vais-je te reconnaître
puisqu'on ne s'est jamais vus ?
Je ressemble à Barney.
Oh, salut, Ted.
Costume et baskets.
Ça fait un peu Ellen DeGeneres
mais t'as réussi.
Je n'ai pas d'autres chaussures
parce que tu les as volées
avec tout ce que
je possède d'autre au monde.
Où est le camion, Barney ?
Barney.
Les personnes dont je ne retiens pas
le camion en otage m'appellent Barney.
Je crois que tu devrais
m'appeler Le Commodore.
- Je ne vais pas t'appeler...
- Tu ne vas pas récupérer tes affaires.
Je pourrais
récupérer mes affaires...
Le Commodore ?
Non.
Voilà le marché.
Ted, tu es mon pote.
Et tu es sur le point de devenir
un homme dominé et rabaissé.
Ce soir, on va passer
une dernière soirée entre potes. (bros)
Une fête de potes-revoir.
Une potes-casion spéciale.
Une amis-festation pour l'avortement.
Potes-time at the Apollo.
Oh, potes-moi.
Alors, qu'est-ce que
je dois faire ?
Non, ce n'est pas ce que tu dois faire,
c'est ce que tu veux faire,
et tu veux passer un bon moment
avant de sortir à l'arrière
avec Ted le Marrant pour l'abattre.
Alors... première chose
sur l'agenda...
- Ramène-moi le numéro de cette fille.
- Hors de question.
Mmm. Quel dommage.
Eh, question hypothétique :
si j'étais toutes tes affaires,
je serais plutôt au fond
de l'East River ou de l'Hudson River ?
Regarde, il y a le championnat
de l'homme le plus fort du monde.
Ooh, c'est celui
où Lou Ferrigno tire le bus
de la famille Partridge
avec ses dents.
C'est le meilleur.
Eh, Ted, viens...
- On vit seuls.
- Yay.
Je gagne.
Vous devez donner votre numéro
de téléphone à mon ami.
Wow, je ne pensais vraiment pas
que Lou Ferrigno pourrait tirer ce bus.
Vous êtes sûr que c'est du direct ?
Ça m'a l'air bien vieux.
Oui, c'est parce que
c'est une vieille télé.
Alors, je vous appelle demain ?
Ouais. Pas trop tôt.
Je vais à l'église.
Tu étais impressionnant, mon pote.
Beau boulot.
Bon, prochain défi.
Non, pas de prochain défi.
C'est ma première soirée chez Robin.
Elle est probablement furieuse
que je la passe avec toi.
Il se pourrait que ce soit
notre dernier hourra, ma petite amie.
Marshall, je vais te préparer
le meilleur dîner de ta vie.
Que dirais-tu d'un...
d'un oeuf au plat avec du ketchup
et pellicule ?
Je suppose que c'est Ted
qui a fait les courses.
Ooh, regarde,
une pizza pour micro-ondes !
Je suppose que le micro-ondes
était aussi à Ted.
Ouais.
Comme toutes les serviettes.
Il s'avère que tout ce qui était utile
dans cet appartement était à Ted.
Tout ce qui était un poster de Foghat
acheté ironiquement à la fac était à moi.
Marshall.
Ouais, bébé ?
Ted me manque.
Il est trop tôt pour l'appeler ?
Non, on ne devrait pas.
Je ne veux pas interrompre
sa première soirée chez Robin.
Ha, joli tir.
Si on gagne, on aura des rondelles d'oignons
gratuites au Intergalactic Snack Shack.
Quelle affaire.
On avait juste à payer
20$ par partie.
Admets que tu t'amuses.
Peut-être.
C'était marrant quand cette petite fille
est tombée par-dessus ce tonneau spatial.
Super... on gagne.
Oh, vous pouvez avoir honte,
les nuls au jeu... Quoi de neuf ?
Okay. Encore un autre.
- Je sais pas.
- Tu sais que tu en as envie.
D'accord, allons-y.
Je vais juste appeler Robin vite fait.
C'est comme ça que ça va être
à partir de maintenant ?
Non. Okay, okay. Appelle ta vieille femme
et demande la permission de t'amuser.
Moi, je serai au Snack Shack
pour manger nos rondelles d'oignons
de la victoire en Han Style.
Solo.
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey, chérie, écoute,
je suis vraiment désolé, mais je vais
rentrer tard, donc ne m'attends pas.
Oh, aucun problème.
Fais ce que tu as à faire.
Merci. T'es la meilleure.
Je t'aime.
Je t'aime aussi. Bye.
Hey, désolée pour ça.
Merci d'avoir patienté.
Si vous pouviez annuler
mon abonnement à Armes et Munitions,
ce serait génial.
Non, c'est un magazine génial.
Vraiment génial.
Ils ont publié
trois de mes lettres.
C'est juste que
mon copain emménage
et il n'approuve pas
tout ce qui touche aux armes.
Un téléphone gratuit
en forme de grenade ?
Vous savez quoi ? Laissez-moi
vous donner mon adresse au travail.
Je l'ai fait, bébé !
J'ai de la bière. J'ai à manger.
On n'a plus besoin de Ted.
Je suis le fournisseur
de cet appartement maintenant,
et j'ai fourni !
"Fourné" ? Fourni !
Bref, je nous ai pris
tout ce qu'il fallait.
Super. Pourrais-tu me passer
le papier toilette ?
Je reviens tout de suite, bébé.
Patiente.
Eh, je dois admettre... je ne pensais pas
que ce serait le cas, mais...
j'ai vraiment passé
un bon moment ce soir.
T'es un super ami, Barney.
Eh, mec, dis-moi donc...
dis-moi donc
où se trouve mon camion.
Non, je ne pense pas.
Où est mon camion ?!
Sais-tu pourquoi je ne t'ai
encore rendu aucun de tes biens ?
Parce que tu es l'Amiral Connard
de la Douche Royale britannique ?
Parce que tu ne veux pas
les récupérer.
Tu aurais pu partir à n'importe
quel moment, mais tu es resté, Ted.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que je ne voulais pas retourner
chez Robin sans mes affaires.
Faux. Tu sais ce que je pense ?
Je pense que tu as passé une journée
avec elle et que c'était déjà nul.
Je pense que tu n'as pas aimé être là-bas,
qu'elle n'a pas aimé que tu sois là,
et que vous avez réalisé
que vous aviez fait une grosse erreur.
Et c'est pour ça que tu as passé
ta première soirée chez Robin
à jouer au laser tag avec moi.
Et c'est pour ça
qu'il y a trois secondes
tu n'as pas parlé de rentrer
"chez moi", "chez nous" ou "à la maison",
tu as parlé de rentrer
"chez Robin".
Tu sais quoi ?
Tu peux garder mes affaires.
- Hey.
- Hey, t'as récupéré le camion ?
Non.
Pourquoi pas ?
Que s'est-il passé ?
Oh, il m'a tellement énervé
que je suis parti.
Bref, je voulais juste revenir ici,
me détendre et regarder un film.
Tu as quelque chose
qui n'ait pas été réalisé par John Woo ?
Pourquoi ? Toi ?
Oublions le film.
Je veux juste m'asseoir.
Quoi ?
C'est juste que
je mange à cette table.
Bien, je vais enlever
mes chaussures.
Pourquoi ne pas
me descendre à la cave
où tu as de la place
pour moi ?
- Ted, arrête.
- Non, toi arrête.
Toute la soirée, j'ai dû faire
tout ce que voulait Barney,
puis il m'a fallu une heure pour rentrer
parce que cet appart est si éloigné du bar.
- Oh mon Dieu.
- Quoi ?
Je sais où Barney
a mis mon camion.
Allons chez moi.
Je parie que j'habite plus près.
On y est.
Tu vis sur le quai de chargement
derrière le bar ?
Je ne vis pas ici, bébé.
C'est juste mon moyen de transport.
Non, non, non, non.
Je ne monte dans aucun fourgon.
J'ai vu le Silence des Agneaux.
Oh mon Dieu. On boit du champagne
à l'arrière d'un camion de déménagement.
Eh oui, Sara. Eh oui.
Ces autres Rockettes
qui te trouvaient lente sont folles.
Oh mon Dieu. Je le savais.
Tu me kidnappes.
- À l'aide ! À l'aide !
- Non, non, non, non.
Je peux tout expliquer.
Allô ?
Tu profites du voyage ?
Ted ? Ted, laisse-nous descendre !
Tout de suite !
Ce n'est pas Ted.
Mais j'ai entendu dire
que ce type était génial.
J'ai raccompagné Sara chez elle
et j'ai accompagné Barney
dans un bar près de son appart.
Apparemment, ça ne lui était
jamais venu à l'esprit.
Cette pauvre fille
devait être perdue.
Ouais.
Au moins Barney
a appris une bonne leçon.
Il vaut mieux éviter de se prendre un coup
de ciseaux dans l'aine par une Rochette.
Je suppose qu'on devrait aller
déballer tes affaires.
Ouais.
Ouais, je suppose qu'on devrait.
Lily... au fin fond
de la forêt tropicale amazonienne
il y a une sorte d'arbre qui pousse
uniquement autour un arbre déjà existant.
Il ne peut pas survivre
sans cet arbre.
Il est soutenu...
par cet arbre.
Lily, on est cet arbre.
- L'arbre intérieur ou extérieur ?
- L'arbre extérieur.
- Il ne devrait pas y avoir trois arbres ?
- Toi et moi sommes un seul arbre.
Lily, le truc,
c'est qu'on a grandi autour de Ted
et que sans lui,
on meurt doucement.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Je crois qu'on peut se marier.
Mais on doit aussi
épouser Ted.
Je te dis tout de suite que mon père
ne paiera pas pour ce mariage.
Ted !
Que fais-tu ici ?
En fin de compte, Robin et moi
n'allons pas emménager ensemble.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Je croyais qu'on avait décidé
qu'on était prêts ?
Je sais.
Comment en est-on arrivés là
encore ?
Je ne me souviens plus.
On se disputait ?
- C'est tellement flou.
- Ouais.
Le sexe du "emménageons ensemble"
était plutôt génial.
Je sais.
J'ai fait ce truc sans mains alors
qu'habituellement, il me faut les deux.
Tu sais, je suis vraiment
heureux avec toi.
Je suis vraiment heureuse avec toi
tels qu'on est maintenant.
Peut-être qu'on ne devrait pas
risquer ça.
Je sais qu'on ne devrait pas.
Eh... j'ai entendu dire que le sexe du
"n'emménageons pas ensemble" est super.
Retournons chez moi.
- Ooh, merci.
- De rien.
- Non, merci.
- Tu vas vraiment être heureuse.
Je sais que vous étiez très excités
d'avoir l'appart pour vous.
Jusqu'après le mariage...
si ce n'est pas trop dérangeant...
Mon Dieu, ça me paraît si normal.
Ne nous quitte plus jamais.
Robin est dans le camion
et il y a beaucoup de cartons,
alors peut-être qu'on devrait...
On a le temps pour ça ?
Mesdames et messieurs, j'ai en main
la liste du Top Dix de ce soir.
La catégorie : les dix noms
que j'aurais donné à mon camion...
Ça n'a jamais été ton camion.
...si Ted n'avait pas été un salaud
et ne l'avait pas rendu.
C'était une location.
Numéro dix :
"La Bango Gagnante".
Numéro neuf :
"Le camion qui emballe".
Numéro huit :
"La Ford Exploratrice".
Numéro sept :
"Le camion hurleur".
Hurleur.
Numéro six :
"Sentiments sur roues". Hello !
Numéro cinq :
"Le camion Monteur.".
Numéro quatre :
"La 18 Bruyante".
Numéro trois :
"L'Esca-Lade".
Numéro deux :
"La Slam-Boney".
et... le premier nom
que j'aurais donné à mon camion
si Ted n'avait pas été un salaud
et ne l'avait pas rendu.
"La Chevy 69".
Désolé.
Il m'a fallu un moment
pour m'en rendre compte,
mais voici la clef pour comprendre
votre oncle Barney.
Quand les temps sont durs,
il est impossible de le faire rester.
Comme quand votre tante Lily
et oncle Marshall avaient rompu.
Hey. De quoi vous parlez ?
- Lily.
- Il faut que j'y aille.
Mais quand les temps sont bons,
il est impossible de s'en débarrasser.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
On vient de finir les plans pour
l'enterrement de vie de garçon de Marshall.
Bien, vous n'avez pas encore commencé.
Parlons logistique.
Vous avez établi des rčgles
de base avec Lily ?
Oů tu es autorisé ŕ toucher
ou ŕ ętre touché ?
Montre-moi sur Ted.
En fait, on pense laisser
tomber les stripteaseuses.
Vous... vous voulez une fęte
sans stripteaseuses.
C'était la pire chose
que j'aurais pu dire.
Oncle Barney adorait concocter
des fętes d'enterrement de vie de garçon.
Et c'était toujours la męme recette.
Vous commencez par une suite d'hôtel
un peu exiguë.
Disposez les chaises en cercle...
Remplissez-les de vos amis
les plus proches.
Montez la température
jusqu'ŕ environ 32°.
Pompez une tonne métrique
de fumée de cigare.
Et puis au beau milieu de la pičce,
balancez une fille.
Mais pas une jolie fille...
non, si cette fille avait jamais
été jolie, c'était deux enfants,
trois tatouages et un agaçant problčme
d'abus de substances avant.
Lequel d'entre vous est Stuart ?
S'il vous plaît,
je ne veux vraiment pas faire ça.
La ferme, mets ton protčge-bouche.
Puis, elle fait des choses
qui humilient le marié,
elle-męme et toute la race humaine.
Dégoűtant.
Ah, effroyable.
- Classique.
- Oh, s'il vous plaît, non, non.
Je ne veux pas qu'il m'arrive
ce genre de chose.
Stuart n'arrive toujours pas
ŕ oublier cette soirée.
C'est mon enterrement de vie de garçon.
On ne prend pas de stripteaseuses.
Oh, il pense qu'il a son mot ŕ dire.
Donc, c'est parti
pour les stripteaseuses !
Bon, dis-moi oů ça va se passer,
que je passe quelques coups de fils.
Je pense pouvoir avoir
la quatričme gratuite.
Petite question.
Prothčse du bras. Ça tombe ŕ l'eau ?
- Barney, voilŕ...
- Avant que tu dises non, elle a des liens.

Ecoute, je sais que tu as prévu
des trucs pour la fęte de Marshall,
- mais il ne veut pas de stripteaseuses.
- Mais si.
- Il m'a dit que non.
- Il m'a dit que oui.
- Quand ?
- Chaque minute de chaque jour,
quand l'animal qui est en lui se débat
contre la cage de son éducation puritaine.
Ou bien vous n'aimez pas
les filles nues.
On aime les filles nues.
C'est l'une des meilleures choses
qui existent.
Ça donne... filles nues, démocratie,
la scčne oů le singe donne le doigt
ŕ un type dans Doux, Dur et Dingue.
- C'est tes filles nues qu'on n'aime pas.
- Quoi, mes filles ne sont pas assez canon ?
D'accord, la stripteaseuse de l'enterrement
de vie de garçon de Stuart avait 15.
- Elle avait 15 ans ?
- Non, un 15. Comme au blackjack.
Comme dans,
pas sűr que tu te la taperais ?
- Exactement.
- Charmant.
C'est important pour Marshall. Alors
promets-moi, pas de stripteaseuses.
D'accord, je promets.
- Je suis sérieux.
- Moi aussi. Pas de stripteaseuses.
Maintenant, dis-le sans clin d'śil.
Pas de stripteaseuses.
- Tu viens de cligner de l'śil.
- Non, pas du tout.
Quand le jour est arrivé, on a tous grimpé
dans l'Escalade de location et on est partis.
Tout enterrement de vie de garçon se compose
de la męme brochette de personnages.
Vous avez le futur marié...
le témoin...
- le type qui ne parle qu'en clichés...
- L'homme mort est en marche !
le type qui disparaît
en début de soirée
et qu'on ne revoit pas avant la fin.
Bon, qui est partant pour un petit
blackjack avant de commencer ?
- Non, non, non.
- Pas pour moi.
On se retrouve dans la chambre, alors.
Et, bien entendu... Barney.
Chaque enterrement de vie
de garçon a un Barney.
Oh, qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Cette voiture a un lecteur de DVD ?
Vous voulez dire
qu'on pourrait regarder
ces pornos tout du long ?
- Ouais.
- Celui-ci est en HD.
Celui-ci est en H-double-D.
Oh !
Ce męme soir, tante Lily avait
un enterrement de vie de jeune fille.
Et Robin est arrivée, cadeau en main.
Histoire drôle
ŕ propos de ce cadeau.
Hey, Barney, regarde ce que j'ai pris
ŕ Lily pour sa fęte.
C'est un peu osé.
Tu penses pouvoir le supporter ?
Je suis allé ŕ une partie ŕ 10.
Alors, ouais.
- C'est transparent.
- Whoa, ho ho !
Tu ne plaisantais pas !
Tu sais quand tu devrais lui donner ça ?
En 1850.
Robin, c'est son enterrement
de vie de jeune fille !
Toutes ses amies vont ętre lŕ,
elles vont boire.
Tu dois lui prendre quelque chose
d'audacieux, d'exorbitant.
Que penses-tu que je doive lui prendre ?
Il y a un magasin sur la 8čme Avenue
spécialisée dans...
comment amener ça délicatement...
faux pénis récréatifs
pour adultes ŕ piles.
Et tante Robin est allée
au magasin sur la 8čme Avenue,
et un objet récréatif ŕ piles...
Bref, quelque chose d'incorrect.
Et on y retourne.
Robin !
Je suis si contente que tu sois lŕ.
Entre, je veux te présenter
ŕ tout le monde.
Robin, voici ma grand-mčre Lois
et ma tante Florence.
Oh, enchantée de vous rencontrer,
ma chčre.
Elles ont organisé toute cette fęte.
C'est différent de ce ŕ quoi
je m'attendais, mais charmant.
Charmant.
Et oh, regardez,
il y a des petits enfants !
Ouais, mes cousines.
Ecoute, je... j'ai oublié quelque chose
quelque part alors je vais aller...
Robin, voici ma mčre, Janice.
Oh, chérie. Je suis contente
de faire enfin votre connaissance.
Moi de męme.
J'ai tellement entendu parler de vous.
Moi aussi. Oh, tenez.
Laissez-moi prendre votre cadeau.
Je peux deviner ce que c'est ?
C'est un... mixeur ?
- Non.
- Non ? Oh.
Oh, donnez-moi un indice.
De quelle couleur est-il ?
Noir.
J'imagine que je n'ai plus
qu'ŕ attendre de voir !
- Oh, super.
- Robin...
- voici ma cousine Margaret.
- Oh, enfin quelqu'un de notre âge !
Attends, je dois te présenter comme
"Cousine" ou "Sśur" Margaret ?
Je ne suis pas officiellement confirmée
en tant que nonne avant le mois prochain
et je ne veux pas fâcher le Grand Type,
alors restons-en ŕ "Cousine" pour le moment.
Dieu regarde.
Excellent !
Ils ont dépensé beaucoup d'argent
pour ce porno.
Whoa... Morgan Freeman ?
La vache, ce type est partout.
Merde, j'ai pris le mauvais
Deep Impact !
Non, laisse-le, c'est un bon film.
- Mais, mec, il n'y a pas de sexe dedans.
- Ouais, comme le mariage. Pas vrai ?
Oh, oh, hey, regardez ça !
Ne demandez pas comment,
mais je nous ai dégotté cinq loco-bueno,
Cubains, roulés main,
complčtement illégaux.
Sérieusement, vous pourriez aller
en prison pour avoir fumé ces trucs.
Le mariage c'est comme la prison !
Pas vrai, les amis ?!
Mais au moins en prison,
tu peux baiser !
Mais on n'allume pas ces bébés
avant d'ętre ŕ A.C.
A.C. ?
Atlantic City.
Essaye de suivre, Brad.
On ne va pas ŕ Atlantic City.
Une seconde, Brad.
- Salut.
- Salut.
On va toujours ŕ Atlantic City, exact ?
Oh, je ne te l'ai pas dit ? Ouais,
on a changé. On va ŕ Foxwoods.
Foxwoods ?
Mais j'ai une teaseusetripay
qui attend ŕ Tlantycay Itycay.
Qu'y a t'il ŕ Foxwoods ?!
On a cinq sičges au troisičme rang
pour la revanche Popinski-Salazar.
Ils nous ont gardé
notre propre table de craps,
et j'ai réservé une salle
privée au Connelly,
oů on va se partager
un steak de 3 kilos,
d'une vache que j'ai sélectionnée
sur Internet.
- Ouais.
- Super. La soirée est foutue.
Désolé, Barney.
C'était une erreur de bonne foi.
Ça va ętre génial !
Viande, violence,
jeter l'argent par les fenętres.
Amérique... un ;
tous les autres pays... zéro.
- Merci les mecs.
- Ouais.
- Ça va, Barney ?
- Que puis-je dire, Ted ? Tu as gagné.
Salut.
Toi... triste loser pathétique.
Les mecs, dites bonjour ŕ Trésor.
Salut, Trésor.
- Je n'en reviens pas que tu aies fait ça.
- J'ai dű le faire.
- Je suis ton témoin.
- Ted est mon témoin.
Tu dois encore prendre une décision
et c'est trčs bien.
Mais en tant que futur témoin, c'est
mon boulot de m'assurer qu'ŕ ta fęte
tu voies une femme retirer ses vętements en
dansant sur "Here I Go Again" de Whitesnake.
D'accord, trčs bien, mais...
faisons ça vite, d'accord.
Le combat commence dans une heure
on ne veut pas le rater.
C'est une fille qui retire ses vętements.
Combien de temps ça peut prendre ?
C'est un peu plus compliqué que ça.
J'ai besoin de deux prises de terre,
un grand pot stérile plein d'eau chaude
et vous devez tous
signer ces décharges.
Un batteur ŕ oeufs !
Merci, tante Sylvia !
J'aime qu'il soit sans fil.
Au moins j'ai bon de ce côté-lŕ.
Tous ces cadeaux sont si délicats.
Lily ?
Tu dois me regarder maintenant
et lire dans mon esprit.
- Oh, mon dieu ! Tu m'entends !
- Ouais !
Désolée que cette fęte soit
si ennuyeuse. Qu'y a t'il ?
N'ouvre pas mon cadeau.
Tu vois ce que je fais, lŕ ?
Je regarde le cadeau,
puis je reviens sur toi,
et je secoue la tęte, "non".
Cadeau. Toi. Non.
- Tu as compris ça ?
- Complčtement.
Tenez.
Lily a dit que c'était votre période.
De rien.
Que faites-vous ?
Oh, je... réarrange les cadeaux.
La pile semblait un peu précaire. Alors...
Oh, ne vous en faites pas.
Je vais garder un oeil dessus.
Super. Faites ça.
Vous allez faire une damnée bonne nonne.
Chaque fois que Robin a eu l'occasion de
raconter cette histoire au fil des ans,
elle n'a jamais vraiment pu expliquer
la logique du geste qui a suivi.
C'est un striptease
ou un concert de Kiss ?
Chut ! Elle commence.
S'il vous plaît, éteignez vos portables,
bipeurs et sens de la honte.
Bon, les mecs. Etendez-vous, mettez-vous
ŕ l'aise et profitez du spectacle.
Bien sűr, pas moyen que
je vous parle de son spectacle.
- Donc, allons un peu plus loin.
- Aie !
Oh mon dieu, vous allez bien ?
Non, je ne vais pas bien, idiot.
Ma cheville est cassée !
- Emmenez-moi ŕ l'hôpital !
- En fait, on a des billets.
Tu sais quoi ?
Merci beaucoup, Barney.
Elle t'a dit au début du spectacle
de ne pas utiliser la machine ŕ fumer
quand elle est sur le ballon sauteur.
Maintenant, je vais passer
le reste de ma fęte ŕ l'hôpital.
Hey, peut-ętre qu'on pourra
voir ses rayons X.
Le striptease ultime.
- Rayons X. Plutôt triple rayons X.
- Arręte.
C'est quelle sortie pour l'hôpital ?
Et si elle n'arrive pas
jusqu'ŕ l'hôpital ?
Barney, calme-toi, s'il te plaît.
Peut-ętre qu'on devrait
l'emmener dans le désert,
l'enterrer et nous laver
les mains de tout ça !
Mon pote, c'est quoi ton problčme ?
J'essaye juste de clarifier
pour Marshall ce que son témoin...
- Tu n'es pas mon témoin.
- En tant que son témoin,
je l'aiderais ŕ enterrer
une putain dans le désert.
- Je ne suis pas une putain.
- Et tu n'es pas mon témoin.
Tu as gâché mon enterrement
de vie de garçon.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi tu ne m'as pas écouté
quand j'ai dit que je ne voulais pas de ça.
Le combat a commencé il y a dix minutes.
Peut-ętre qu'on pourrait écouter.
Oh, Docteur, quel combat !
On parlera de ce KO
pendant des années !
Quiconque a eu assez de chance
pour ętre dans l'arčne ce soir
vient d'ętre témoin d'un évčnement
qui marquera l'histoire de la boxe !
Merci beaucoup, Margaret. Je n'en reviens
pas que tu aies gravé ce crucifix toi-męme.
Tant de talent.
Je ne pense pas que tu pourrais graver.
Pour toi.
Oh. Et celui-ci est de...
- Grand-mčre Lois.
- Oh. Non, attends, chérie.
Avant que tu l'ouvres, je...
je veux dire quelques mots.
Okay, voilŕ ce que vous devez savoir.
Grand-mčre Lois pensait offrir ŕ sa
petite-fille une machine ŕ coudre antique.
Et on y retourne.
Chérie, ce pratique petit appareil est
dans notre famille depuis des générations.
Je m'en suis servie, ton arričre
grand-mčre s'en est servie.
Ta mčre ne s'est pas servie de celle-ci,
mais elle avait exactement la męme.
Bien entendu, ŕ l'époque,
elles étaient faites en bois.
Et... j'imagine qu'avant,
on devait juste le faire ŕ la main.
- Voudriez-vous passer le vin s'il vous plaît ?
- Non.
Hey, Marshall,
pendant qu'on y est, tu peux aussi
bien descendre ŕ la morgue et
sauter dans un tiroir, parce que
c'est comme ça qu'est le mariage.
Je peux avoir un amen ?
- Tout va bien ŕ la maison, Stuart ?
- Non.
Elle est cassée.
Oh, merde, c'est nul.
Je ne peux pas perdre ce boulot.
Mes filles vont commencer l'école,
et mon fiancé...
depuis qu'il est revenu d'Irak,
tout ce qu'il fait c'est boire.
Je pense ŕ le quitter, mais...
je ne veux pas que mes filles
grandissent sans pčre, comme moi.
Je ne veux pas qu'elles sachent
ce que c'est.
- Alors, c'est l'heure du show ?
- C'est quoi ton problčme ?
Sa cheville est cassée.
Je sais avec certitude que la seconde
moitié de son spectacle
se passe en grande partie
en position assise ou allongée.
Oh, c'est vrai.
Trésor, s'il vous plaît,
ne vous en faites pas pour le spectacle.
On le vivrait mal.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Non. On veut juste dire,
vous n'ętes pas obligée.
Vous n'avez pas ŕ le faire.
Je n'ai pas ŕ le faire ?
Eh bien devinez quoi ?
Je sais que je n'ai pas ŕ le faire.
Je le fais parce que je suis douée.
Ecoutez, je n'ai pas besoin
de votre pitié.
Tout ce que je veux, c'est vous donner un super
spectacle parce que vous allez vous marier !
C'est trop demander ?
Ça pose un problčme majeur ?!
Oh, c'est mal.
Oh, c'est vraiment mal.
Le docteur a dit qu'elle devait
la garder en hauteur.
Quand j'étais jeune, ma mčre nous a appris
ŕ nous en servir, ŕ moi et ŕ ma sśur.
On faisait des concours,
pour voir qui finirait plus vite.
C'était si excitant. Toute la famille
se réunissait pour regarder.
Et quand j'étais jeune mariée,
c'est ce qui m'occupait
toutes ces longues nuits quand
ton grand-pčre était en Corée.
Et en parlant de ton grand-pčre,
bien que je ne pense pas qu'il le reconnaisse
devant ses potes de l'armée, mais...
il la prenait de temps ŕ autre.
Et ça lui plaisait.
Oh, ouvre-le, ma chérie.
Puisse t'elle te procurer autant
de joie qu'elle m'en a apporté.
Grand-mčre...
Wow.
Sors-lŕ, chérie.
Je veux te montrer comment ça marche.
Okay, non, non !
Ne la sors pas.
Lily, ce n'est pas le cadeau
de ta grand-mčre, c'est le mien.
J'ai paniqué, et j'ai échangé les cartes
parce que j'étais embarrassée.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Il est comme celui que Miranda a offert
ŕ Charlotte dans "Sex and the City".
Oh, j'adore cette série.
Je la regarde toujours sur TBS.
Oh, c'est clair.
Tu es tellement Samantha !
Oh, je suis Carrie !
C'est toi Samantha !
Et puis la soirée est devenue gęnante
d'une toute autre maničre.
- Alors, oů puis-je en avoir un ?
- Maman !
La vache, quel spectacle, hein ?
Elle a fait des trucs dégoűtants.
Ça te marque vraiment.
J'ai fini de manger.
Moi aussi.
Je veux dire pour toujours.
Moi aussi.
Ma femme me manque.
Hey, faisons un tour de table
et disons ce qu'on a préféré.
Moi c'était ce truc
avec la machine ŕ écrire.
Elle a fait des fautes d'orthographe,
mais quand męme.
Ooh, et vous faisiez genre :
"Barney, éteins le cigare !
c'est une chambre non-fumeurs !" Et j'ai fait
"Bon sang non, c'est un Cubain" !
Naturellement, par la suite,
je l'ai éteint.
Je l'ai éteint ?
Je l'ai éteint.
Je l'ai éteint ?
Je l'ai éteint.
Je l'ai éteint ?
C'était un petit feu, pas assez gros
pour faire évacuer l'hôtel,
mais définitivement assez gros
pour nous faire virer,
et finir prématurément l'enterrement
de la vie de garçon de Marshall.
Est-ce... ?
C'est.
Hey, les mecs.
Comment était le combat ?
Hey, qu'est-ce que vous faites lŕ ?
Qu'est-il arrivé ŕ la fęte ?
On a raté le combat,
le dîner était foutu,
on a passé la moitié de la nuit ŕ l'hôpital,
et on s'est fait virer de l'hôtel.
- Que penses-tu qu'il soit arrivé ?
- Barney. - Barney.
Hey, j'ai juste essayé
d'ętre un bon témoin.
Tu sais ce que fait un témoin, Barney ?
Il fait ce que le marié veut.
Mais tu ne penses jamais qu'ŕ ce que
tu veux, ce qui est le meilleur pour toi.
Témoin ?
Je ne sais męme pas si je vais t'inviter
au mariage au point oů on en est.
Tu ne le penses pas.
Pourquoi t'inviterais-je ?
Tu ne veux męme pas qu'on se marie.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Lily, non.
Quoi ?
Je suis désolée, Barney.
C'est arrivé l'été dernier
quand on a rompu.
Hey, de quoi vous parlez ?
- Lily.
- Ah, il faut que j'y aille.
Aéroport de Newark,
s'il vous plaît.
Ouais, ouais, ouais.
Barney, qu'est-ce que tu fais lŕ ?
Je ne peux pas croire que ça soit
vraiment toi. Entre, prends un sičge.
Tu veux du thé ?
Je sais que l'appartement est petit,
mais je n'ai pas besoin de beaucoup d'espace.
Laisse-moi te montrer mes peintures.
Je pense que certaines sont
mon meilleur travail. Arręte.
Lily, tu dois rentrer ŕ la maison.
Toi et Marshall vous appartenez.
Tous les deux,
vous avez quelque chose que beaucoup cherchent
toute leur vie sans jamais le trouver.
Je sais que tu l'aimes, et si tu savais
ce qu'il traverse en ce moment,
tu ne resterais pas lŕ
une seconde de plus.
Je t'ai pris un billet de retour.
Marshall est l'une des meilleures
personnes que je connaisse,
et ça ne prendra pas longtemps
avant que quelqu'un d'autre le réalise,
et tu le perdras pour toujours.
Je ne peux pas supporter
l'idée que ça se produise,
et je ne peux pas lui piquer
les nénettes pour toujours.
Ne dis jamais ŕ quiconque que j'étais
lŕ. Je le nierai bec et ongles.
Ce voyage ne s'est jamais produit.
Hey, si tu avais trois heures ŕ tuer
avant ton vol, que ferais-tu...
Alcatraz ou le Quai du Pęcheur ?
Tu as vraiment fait ça ?
Marshall, je pense que Barney
est ton témoin.
Ouais.
Oui, il l'est.
Tu vois, Lily ?
C'est pour ça que je...
- Vraiment ?
- Vraiment.
Vrai...
Dans ta tronche, loser !
Du calme, d'accord.
Ted reste mon témoin aussi.
Vous ętes co-témoins.
C'est ça.
Oui, on est tous les deux témoins.
Non... sérieusement.
Vous ętes co-témoins.
Bien entendu.
Je n'en reviens pas
que tu m'aies pris ça.
Oh, je l'ai fait pour blaguer.
Je peux le rendre si tu veux.
Oh, non, c'est rien. Tu n'as pas
ŕ retourner jusque lŕ-bas.
- Je vais juste le jeter.
- Eh bien...
si tu allais le jeter,
peut-ętre que je vais le prendre
au cas oů je serais invitée ŕ un autre
enterrement de vie de jeune fille.
- C'est un super cadeau-blague.
- Ouais, c'est vraiment drôle.
Tu sais qui s'éclaterait avec ça ?
Marshall.
Alors peut-ętre que je vais le garder.
Ça me gęnerait que Marshall
découvre que je te l'ai acheté,
- alors je ferais mieux de le prendre.
- Robin, lâche-le.

<i>... le mariage, de drôle
de choses ont commencé à arriver.</i>
Pourquoi est-ce que
j'ai mal au ventre ?
Désolé bébé, j'ai mangé
de la glace tout à l'heure.
Oh ! Bébé, tu sais
qu'on est intolérant au lactose.
Attendez ! Attendez !
Vous êtes en train de dire que

Oh ! Mon Dieu !
Vous êtes co-dépendants !
- Pas du tout.
- Vraiment ?
Et l'autre jour, alors ?
Faut que j'aille
chercher des oeufs.
Je viens avec toi.
Le fait d'aimer
passer du temps ensemble
ne signifie pas
qu'on est co-dépendant.
Vraiment ?
Alors qu'est-il arrivé au projet
de passer les 2 semaines
avant le mariage à dormir séparément ?
On a décidé de ne pas le faire,
à cause de...
La logistique.
La logistique du mariage.
Sacrée logistique,
ça fout tout en l'air.
Vous l'avez pas fait
parce que vous pouviez pas le faire.
J'suis sûr qu'on peut.
Alors pourquoi ne pas le faire.
Tu peux venir chez moi.
Ça rendrait notre nuit
de mariage plus spéciale.
OK, faisons-le.
- Entendu.
- Je vais chercher une bière.
Je viens avec toi.
Non, je vais rester.

OK, je sais. Il faut que j'y aille.
Salut.
Ma mère me rend dingue.
Vous êtes couverts de sauce.
On verra ça après, moi d'abord.
Ma mère me rend dingue
avec la musique du mariage.
Elle se fait une croisière en Jamaïque
et tout à coup, je cite :
"Pas de fête sans Steel Drums".
Personne ne sait qu'on n'est pas censé
stresser la mariée avant le mariage ?
OK, la sauce, allez-y.
C'est une longue histoire,
je vous raconterai plus tard.
C'est une histoire cochonne, hein ?
Vous êtes sortis dîner,
l'avez fait dans la cuisine,
et vous êtes fait prendre. Scherbastky
pue la nana qui aime se faire prendre.
Bon, maintenant
j'ai deux raisons d'aller me laver.
C'est ça.
Alors, Lily et toi pensez vraiment que
vous pouvez passer 2 semaines séparés.
Tu sais, Barney, Lily et moi, on est
bien moins chochotte que tu le crois.
Marshall, n'oublie pas
de me donner ma K7 de bonne nuit.
Une K7 de bonne nuit ?
Tu lui as fait une K7
où tu lui dis bonne nuit ?
- Non.
- Il ne le dit pas, il le chante.
C'est trop mignon.
Et si vous vous embrassiez ?
J'adore voir deux nanas s'embrasser.
Merde, personne ne nous a encore
acheté un truc sympa dans notre liste.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a dedans ?
- Beaucoup de choses.
Un robot mixeur art design.
Prix de vente 319,99$.
Quoi d'autre ?
L'aspirateur traîneau Dyson DC17.
549,99.
Un peu gourmand, je trouve.
Tu as mémorisé notre liste ?
Non, je m'entraîne.
Tu t'entraînes ?
Pour quoi ?
Je suis content que tu demandes.
Ted ! Robin !
Venez par là !
Vous savez comme il est dur
d'être mon ami tellement je suis génial.
Oui, c'est difficile d'être ton ami.
Continue.
Ceci ne va pas
vous simplifier la tâche.
Je vais passer au...
"Juste Prix".
Dans quelques jours, Rich Field va
dire mon nom et je vais descendre.
C'est trop génial.
Barney, je ne savais pas
que tu étais un tel fan du Juste Prix.
Tu plaisantes ?
Le Juste Prix n'est pas juste
une indescriptible
heure de divertissement télévisé.
C'est un microcosme de notre système
économique tout entier.
C'est une utopie capitaliste.
Où les consommateurs
sont récompensés de leur ténacité,
de leur sagacité mercantile,
et de leur esprit audacieux.
Je contemple la gloire du Juste Prix
et je vois le visage de l'Amérique.
Et c'est divin.
En plus, il y a des canons
sur les voitures de sport.
<i>Puis, Lily est allée chez Robin,
pour sa première nuit loin de Marshall.</i>
Prête !
Lily, tu es magnifique.
Je sais, je suis magnifique.
Je suis une princesse
de conte de fée.
Je suis trop maigre
pour ma robe !
<i>Pendant ce temps, je testais
mon discours de témoin sur Marshall.</i>
Le voilà.
Bonjour tout le monde, je suis
Ted Mosby, le témoin de Marshall.
Jusqu'ici, c'est bon.
Quand Marshall aura son diplôme
ce printemps, il sera avocat.
Mais saviez-vous que Marshall
avait un casier judiciaire ?
C'est vrai.
Pendant un voyage vers Cape Cod,
Marshall s'est fait arrêter
pour avoir conduit seul
sur une voie de covoiturage.
Oh, merde !
Oh, merde !
T'es fou ?
Tu peux pas raconter
cette histoire à mon mariage.
Toute ma famille sera là.
Mes petits cousins,
ma mère, ma grand-mère,
mon grand-père, le pasteur.
Ce grand-père est mort,
il y a trois ans.
Son petit-fils préféré se marie,
Ted, je pense qu'il peut
ne pas hanter la grange pendant
une journée pour faire une apparition.
Alors laquelle, A ou B ?
C'était quoi, ça ?
Je dois décider comment me
rendre au pupitre des candidats
quand ils diront
"Barney Stinson, descendez !"
J'avais pas compris que c'était ça.
Tu peux les refaire ?
Très drôle.
Rien que pour ça,
quand j'aurai tout gagné,
tout ce que vous aurez c'est
les céréales et de l'huile de tortue.
C'est 300$ juste pour
rajuster le buste ?
S'il vous plait, il faut
être sympa avec moi.
Je me marie samedi prochain et
je suis trop maigre pour ma robe.
J'ai perdu tout ce poids
sans même essayer.
Allo ?
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Elle m'a traitée de salope
et a raccroché.
Je sais pas quoi faire, je suppose
que je vais devoir payer les 300$.
Payer les 300$ ?
Lily, tu es folle ?
Ceci n'est pas un problème,
c'est un permis de manger.
Ecoute, qu'as-tu toujours eu envie
de manger sans jamais le faire
parce que c'était trop
ridiculeusement décadent ?
Un soufflé au chocolat et aux noix,
avec une sauce framboise-brandy,
nappé de bananes caramélisées
et noisettes.
J'ai pas mieux qu'un
demi sachet de chips.
Ça marche.
OK, je pense que
mon nouveau speech va te plaire.
Il n'y a rien de sexuel,
c'est juste l'histoire d'un moment
important dans votre relation.
Je suis tout ouïe.
Bonjour tout le monde, je suis
Ted Mosby, le témoin de Marshall.
Bien.
Continue.
En première année de fac,
Marshall et Lily n'étaient
ensemble que depuis quelques semaines,
il était 4h du matin,
et je ne vous mentirai pas,
nous étions un peu défoncés.
Nous étions affamés,
alors je suis sorti
nous chercher à manger.
Et quand je suis revenu,
Je t'aime.
Je t'aime aussi.
Je sais que c'est bête à dire mais
je suis si contente que tu l'aies fait.
Alors voilà de quoi tu veux parler
devant toute ma famille :
boire,
ramener une fille dans ma chambre,
manger des cochonneries...
T'as presque 30 ans, ta mère se fâchera
parce que tu manges des cochonneries ?
Bien sûr Ted, parce que la diététique,
ce n'est pas important...
Et Lily n'a jamais
entendu cette histoire,
comment va-t-elle réagir en apprenant
que la 1ère fois que j'ai dit je t'aime
je te parlais en fait à toi,
et à un sac d'oignons frits ?
Peu importe, tu l'aimais réellement,
et c'est toujours le cas.
Et tu ne ressens plus rien pour les
oignons frits, alors pas de problème.
- Coucou.
- Salut.
"Salut" ? C'est tout ?
Comment ça ?
Vous avez passé ces dernières nuits
séparément,
je m'attendais à des gloussements, des
pleurs, des sauts dans tous les sens,
et puis aussi tout ce
que Lily pourrait faire.
<i>Une chose dont je me souviens à propos
du menu du McLaren's.</i>
<i>c'est qu'il y avait pas moins
de 11 sortes d'amuse-gueules frits.</i>
<i>Ce soir là, Tante Lily
les a tous commandés.</i>
Regardez.
Imaginez...
Imaginez si vous voulez bien
que ceci soit la case "1$"
sur la roue du Juste Prix.
Prêts ?
C'était pas loin.
Pas loin ?
Pas loin ?
Ca s'appelle "Le JUSTE prix",
pas "Le prix pas loin" !
Ho, mec, ça craint.
Si je peux pas faire tourner la roue
j'arriverai pas jusqu'à la vitrine
et c'est fichu, tout est fichu !!
Qu'est-ce qui est fichu ?
Pourquoi c'est si important ?
OK, les gars.
Asseyez-vous, je dois
vous dire quelque chose.
La raison pour laquelle... je vais
au Juste Prix, c'est que j'ai décidé
qu'il est temps pour moi
de rencontrer mon vrai père.
- Ton père ?
- C'est ça.
Mon père...
est Bob Barker.
- Bob Barker ?
- Absolument.
Bob Barker,
le présentateur du Juste Prix...
C'est papa.
- Barney ?
- Oui, Robin ?
Qu'est-ce qui peut bien te faire penser
que Bob Barker est ton père ?
Ma mère me l'a dit.
Voilà quoi.
Maman, qui est mon papa ?
Tous les autres enfants à l'école
savent qui est leur père.
Qui est le mien ?
Oh, je sais pas.
Ce type.
Regarde papa.
Je n'ai eu que des 10/10.
Hé papa. Devine en quoi
je me déguise pour Halloween.
Tu veux jouer à la balle ?
Alors maintenant
je vais aller à L.A.,
être dans l'émission,
gagner la vitrine,
le rendre fier de moi.
Puis je lui dirai qui je suis.
Tu vas dire à Bob Barker que
tu es son fils pendant l'émission ?
Pourquoi est-ce si dur
à croire pour vous ?
Pas touche.
Lily doit prendre 2.5 kg
en une semaine et demie
et c'est mon boulot de l'aider.
C'est le meilleur régime de mariage
de tous les temps.
J'ai perdu 500g.
C'est impossible,
Ça fait 3 jours que
tu ne manges que du Mac Do.
Je savais bien que le gars de
"Super Size Me" racontait des conneries.
Ça doit être le stress du mariage.
Il faut qu'on augmente les doses.
Lily Aldren, assieds-toi et
donne-moi 20 bouchées de caramel mou.
Ne grignote pas, attaque-les.
Allez, Lily,
tu peux faire mieux que ça.
Mange plus vite, avant que ton corps
se rende compte qu'il est plein.
Quoi ? Tu vas pleurer ?
Tu vas pleurer ?
Ma maigrichonne va pleurer ?
Mange, bordel ! Mange !
D'accord !
Bon, je crois avoir trouvé
la façon appropriée de faire ton speech.
Enfin.
Bonsoir, je suis Ted Mosby,
le témoin de Marshall.
- Ça le fait, hein ?
- Super.
J'aimerais vous narrer
l'histoire de la soirée capitale
de l'automne dernier.
Quand Marshall et Lily se sont remis
ensemble.
Après ça, on est resté
debout jusqu'à 22h,
en buvant des petits verres
de chocolat.
Maintenant, je vais m'alimenter.
Le calcium,
c'est bon pour les dents et les os.
Merci, Marshall,
de nous apprendre qu'on a pas besoin
d'alcool pour s'amuser.
Ne me remercie pas.
Remercie mes parents de m'avoir
inculqué de bonnes valeurs.
Je n'étais pas censé entendre
ce qui suit,
mais Marshall s'est penché
vers Lily et a murmuré.
Tu sais
ce que j'aimerais te faire, là ?
J'aimerais te tenir la main.
J'aimerais te tenir la main
si fort que
tu ne pourras plus serrer de mains
pendant une semaine.
Tu ne vas que parler de
me tenir la main,
ou tu vas la tenir pour de bon ?
<i>Ensuite, un peu plus tard,</i>
<i>Robin les a surpris...</i>
<i>se tenant la main.</i>
C'était une soirée
charmante et responsable.
A Marshall et Lily.
C'est le pire toast que j'ai entendu,
c'est carrément ennuyeux.
Exactement.
C'est impossible d'écrire un bon toast
avec tes censures, mec.
Je laisse tomber.
Je lirai juste ce truc sur Jésus et
les empreintes de pas.
Je laisse tomber aussi.
Je me fous que ma robe ne m'aille pas,
je ne peux plus rien avaler.
J'ai l'impression que
mon estomac va exploser.
Je sais.
<i>Et donc Lily et moi étions
sur le point d'abandonner.</i>
2 SEMAINES PLUS TARD
Mais comme vous pouvez le voir,
Lily est superbe dans cette robe.
Et me voici,
en train de porter un toast.
Vous savez, tout ce temps
je me suis creusé la tête à essayer
de choisir le moment parfait pour
représenter le couple Marshall et Lily.
Puis j'ai réalisé que
le moment parfait n'était pas
une aiguille dans une botte de foin
au milieu de leurs 10 années ensemble.
Le moment parfait de Lily et Marshall
s'est passé il y a deux soirs de ça.
Marshall, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
J'allais aux toilettes.
Dans le couloir ?
Du somnambulisme.
Tu es on ne peut plus réveillé.
- Je nous cambriolais...
- Mec...
Il se trouve que toute la semaine
il se rendait à un hôtel entre
la 70ème et la 2ème.
Pour voir Lily.
Dieu que tu m'as manquée.
J'arrive pas à dormir sans toi.
Hé, bébé,
tu veux bien être la base
de la cuillère, un moment ?
Bien sûr, chéri.
Comment se passe la prise de poids ?
Horrible.
Je suis trop stressée sans toi
à mes côtés.
Je suis là maintenant.
Lily et Marshall ont donc échoué
dans l'expérience d'être séparés.
Mais ils ont réussi à faire
rentrer Lily dans sa robe.
Il y a bien 1 million de choses que
je peux vous dire à leur sujet.
Mais vraiment, la seule chose que
vous avez besoin de savoir c'est...
que malgré dix ans de relation,
ils ne peuvent toujours pas
passer une nuit l'un sans l'autre.
Qu'ils n'aient jamais à le faire.
A Lily et Marshall.
A Lily et Marshall.
<i>Les enfants, l'histoire du mariage
de Lily et Marshall est bonne.</i>
<i>Peu importe
que vous ayez parfaitement...</i>
<i>Vous savez quoi ? Attendez.</i>
<i>J'y reviendrai. D'abord faut que je
vous raconte ce qui est arrivé à Barney.</i>
Rich, quel est le nom de
notre prochain candidat ?
Bob, c'est Barney Stinson.
Descendez !
Vous êtes le prochain
candidat du Juste Prix !
Il se fraye un chemin,
on tape des mains par ci par là,
une folle embrassade.
Mon Dieu !
Ouais, je sais, la caméra m'aime.
Bienvenue dans ce jeu, Barney.
Joli costume.
- Merci, Pap... Bob.
- Voici le prochain article à estimer.
Bob, les principales caractéristiques
de ces élégantes montres sont :
un cadran biseauté en or 18 carats
et un bracelet en acier inoxydable.
Barney, quelle est
votre estimation ?
Faux.
Faux.
Le prix de vente est de 1349,99$.
Comme vous arrondissez,
je dirais 1350$.
1350$ pour Barney.
Alors, c'est 1350$ ?
Je sais pas.
- A ton avis ?
- Mon Dieu !
Joyeux mariage.
Barney, vous avez gagné
ce caméscope en une seconde.
C'est impressionnant.
Vraiment impressionnant.
Merci, Bob.
Maintenant,
pour gagner l'ordinateur
vous allez devoir encore estimer,
et je dirai plus ou moins.
Montrons au public
le prix de l'ordinateur,
et s'il vous plaît,
n'essayez pas de nous aider.
Et le chrono démarrera avec
votre première estimation.
Un milliard de dollars.
Moins.
J'ai ramené des photos que
j'ai pensé que vous aimeriez voir.
- C'est moi à mon premier anniversaire.
- Oui, Barney.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je passe un bon moment
avec mon père.
C'est très joli, mais regardez.
Le chrono tourne,
il ne vous reste plus
qu'environ 16 secondes.
Continuez à estimer.
Non, je veux vous montrer ça.
C'est ma remise de diplômes.
Je sais, les cheveux...
C'est bien...
Il ne vous reste plus que
- 5...
- C'est vrai.
4... 3... 2... 1...
999.
Barney, vous êtes tombé pile dessus.
- Encore joyeux mariage.
- Mon dieu !
A vrai dire, la grande roue est
mon seul point faible dans le jeu.
Je suis sûr que
vous vous en sortirez bien, fiston.
Vous venez de... ?
- Je suis prêt, Bob.
- Tournez-la, allez-y.
Et c'est parti. Il cherche
à atteindre le Dollar.
<i>Et ça tourne...</i>
- Tu l'as tournée trop fort.
- Non, pas assez.
Nous y voilà, Barney.
Vous l'avez.
Barney, c'est pas fini.
Pour 1000$ vous gagnez
une place pour la vitrine.
Vous vous débrouillez remarquablement
bien jusqu'à maintenant.
Merci. Diriez-vous
que vous êtes fier de moi ?
Bien sûr.
C'était assez bizarre.
Hello, Barney. Vous avez vu
la première vitrine,
voulez-vous faire une offre,
ou passer la main ?
Je vous en prie... pas de voiture
et un spa hors-sol, je passe.
Nelly, il vous a passé la main,
quel prix estimez-vous ?
17 640.
17 640$.
Surestimé.
Maintenant,
voyons la deuxième vitrine.
Barney, votre vitrine
commence par un mystère.
J'adore.
J'en reviens pas d'être aussi excitée.
Barney, vous avez vu votre vitrine,
à combien l'estimez-vous ?
S'il vous plaît.
S'il vous plaît, laissez moi faire.
18 421.
Je sais même pas ce qu'on va faire
du Doom Buggy mais je le veux.
Le prix de vente
de votre vitrine est de :
- 14 628.
- 14 628$.
Nelly, vous êtes éliminée.
Dommage.
Barney, vous avez estimé
votre vitrine à 18 421$.
Et en fait, le prix de vente
de la vitrine de Barney est de :
18 421$.
Exactement.
Vous gagnez les deux vitrines, Barney.
Bob Barker vous rappelle,
participez au contrôle des...
Bob, je voulais vous dire un truc
avant que l'émission se termine.
Félicitations pour les 35 merveilleuses
années de présentation du Juste Prix.
Eh bien, merci, Barney, merci.
Stérilisez vos animaux,
au revoir tout le monde.
Pourquoi tu ne lui as rien dit ?
C'est juste que...
si tu as vécu toute ta vie
en croyant à un truc
ce serait assez dévastateur de découvrir
qu'en fait ce n'était pas vrai.
Je ne pense pas que...
Bob l'aurait supporté.
Ouais, c'est dur.
Bref, d'un autre côté...
- Mon Dieu !
- ...encore joyeux mariage.
<i>Et voilà comment oncle Barney a offert</i>
<i>une Doom Buggy à Lily et Marshall
pour leur mariage.</i>
Salut, Lily.
Je me suis dit que comme on allait être
séparés pendant 2 semaines entières,
je pourrais te chanter
ta chanson de bonne nuit.
#Bonne nuit Lily#
#Bonne nuit Lily#
#C'est l'heure d'aller au lit,
oh ma petite Lily,#
#temps de reposer ta tête#
#Sha la la#
#Sha la la#
Allez, Ted.
C'est bizarre.
T'as promis.

<i>En mai 2007, tante Lily
et oncle Marshall se sont mariťs</i>
<i>dans l'historique maison Van Smoot
au nord de New York.</i>
C'est magnifique, Lily.
Oui. C'est exactement
comme je me le suis toujours imaginť.
<i>«a, c'ťtait des conneries.</i>
<i>Vous voyez, les enfants, quand on
se marie on apprend une vraie leÁon.</i>
<i>Le mariage qu'on veut n'est presque
jamais le mariage qu'on a.</i>
Donc, nous avons choisi
un petit mariage en plein air,
juste la famille et les amis proches.
Pas plus de 25 personnes,
dans un magnifique jardin
quelque part,
peut-Ítre avec une guitare acoustique
pendant qu'on remontera l'allťe.
Et peut-Ítre connais-tu dťjŗ quelqu'un
qui serait allť au tribunal
se faire enregistrer comme officiant,
pour qu'il ou elle... il...
puisse prťsider la cťrťmonie.
Mais tu dťtestes le mariage.
Pourquoi voudrais-tu officier ?
Parce que Áa
distille subtilement
dans l'esprit
des femmes prťsentes
que quand je pose une question,
on rťpond "je le veux".
<i>Plus on s'approche du grand jour,
plus on fait de concessions.</i>
Super. Maintenant ma mŤre
m'oblige ŗ inviter les Lessners.
Ceci nous fait passer ŗ un nombre
ŗ 3 chiffres.
Je crois que parfois,
Lessner est plus...ieurs.
Tu sais, comme parfois
le moins devient plus ?
Oui, c'est un de
ces moments, chťrie.
Tu sais quoi ? Ce n'est rien. Ce sera
un mariage en plein air, un peu grand.
Ce ne sera plus
un mariage en plein air.
Le pŤre de Marshall est convaincu
que si on fait un mariage dehors ŗ NY
il va se faire agresser.
Donc Áa va Ítre ŗ l'intťrieur.
«a va Ítre gťnial. On aura quand mÍme
notre guitare acoustique.
Donc maintenant, ŗ la
place de la guitare acoustique,
on a une harpiste.
Mon pŤre est redevable ŗ un type,
et ce type a une fille harpiste.
Elle est sexy ? J'adorerais
barrer une harpiste de ma liste.
Elle est longue comment,
cette liste ?
Mec, je ne vais pas compter
le nombre de pages de cette liste.
Je ne suis pas un salaud.
«a n'a pas d'importance,
de toute faÁon. Elle est enceinte.
Cool, je pourrais
barrer deux choses.

<i>Et arriva donc le jour du trŤs grand
mariage en salle de Lily et Marshall...</i>
<i>avec une harpe.</i>
Salut Lily.
Andrea.
Tu es vraiment enceinte.
Ouais.
Comment joues-tu de la harpe
avec le ventre si... ?
Pas vraiment. Je n'arrive
ŗ atteindre que la moitiť des cordes.
- Tu ne joues que d'une demie harpe ?
- Oui.
Oh non.
OK, Lily, je m'en charge.
Je m'occuperai de l'autre moitiť.
Est-ce difficile ŗ apprendre ?
J'ťtudie la harpe
depuis 12 ans.
Ouais, mais j'apprends vite.
Dťjŗ entendu parler de "Guitar Hero" ?
J'ai appris Áa en un jour.
- Existe-t-il un "Harpe Hero" ?
- Robin, c'est bon.
- Donc, c'est pour quand ?
- Mardi.
- C'est bientŰt.
- Euh, mardi dernier.
Bordel de merde,
on doit la virer.
Elle va parachuter un nain
en plein milieu de ta cťrťmonie.
Robin, je ne vais pas
me mettre ŗ paniquer.
Je dťteste
ces femmes qui disent :
"Oh, mon mariage doit Ítre parfait."
Les choses dťraillent,
Parfois le DJ
ruine ta playlist,
parfois on glisse sur un placenta
ŗ la sortie de l'office.
- Puis-je avoir un scotch soda, SVP ?
- Non.
Je n'ai pas le droit de servir
quoi que ce soit avant la rťception.
Tu viens de perdre
un gros pourboire, mon pote.
Je n'ai pas le droit
d'accepter les pourboires, "mon pote".
Vous avez le droit
d'accepter les critiques ?
Vous Ítes, Monsieur, un con...
"mon pote".
Vous voulez savoir ce qui
ne marche pas avec une harpiste ?
"Hť bťbť,
tu veux que je te pince ?"
Vraiment, Áa n'a pas marchť ?
MÍme pas un peu.
- Qui est Bill ?
- Bill ?
Oui, ce mec est venu me parler,
au bar.
Puis-je vous
demander quelque chose ?
Quand, durant la cťrťmonie, demande-t-on
si personne n'a d'objection ?
Je ne crois pas qu'ils fassent
encore Áa de nos jours.
Alors quand pensez-vous que
quelqu'un devrait le faire ?
Juste attendre une pause ?
Ou quoi ?
Oh non ! Est-ce qu'il avait l'air
d'un gars ayant essayť
d'Ítre arbitre mais ayant ťchouť ?
Un peu, effectivement.
C'est Scooter.
Scooter, ton petit copain
du lycťe ?
Son vrai nom est Bill.
Ma mŤre a dŻ l'inviter.
Pourquoi ferait-elle Áa ?
Nos familles sont
trŤs proches.
Mais mon ex ?...
Allons, maman !
J'ai pas invitť ce joueur de squash
avec qui papa t'as surprise !
- J'ai besoin d'un verre de vin.
- Je m'en occupe.
- Merci. Comment va Marshall ?
- Bien.
Il va se faire couper les cheveux.
J'ai peur que ma cousine
ne les coupe trop court.
Moi aussi.
Je n'en ai pas dormi de la nuit.
- Salut Lily.
- Salut.
Salut Barney.
Scooter,
qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Ce n'est plus "Scooter",
dťsormais.
C'est Bill.
Beaucoup de choses
ont changť, Lily.
Mais une pas.
Je t'aime toujours.
Et je suis venu
pour te reconquťrir.
C'est mignon.
Oh, non. Vraiment ?
Lily, je sais que c'est dingue.
Mais je t'aime.
Et si tu peux
me regarder dans les yeux,
et me dire que
tu veux ťpouser Marshall,
je partirai d'ici immťdiatement
et sortirai de ta vie pour toujours.
Je veux...
Je...
Je veux...
J'ai besoin d'un verre de vin.
Et j'ai besoin que
vous disparaissiez de ma vue.
- C'est pour la mariťe.
- Blanc ou rouge ?
Blanc.
Et... Elle aimerait aussi
un whisky-soda.
- Vous l'avez.
- Et aussi un bol d'amandes grillťes.
Je n'en ai pas. Mais je devrais pouvoir
en trouver au coin de la rue.
C'est juste le jour le plus
important de sa vie, alors...
Que le jeu commence.
Voilŗ. J'peux pas rester.
Je dois essayer un truc.
Peut-Ítre que mes mots
ne te feront pas changer d'avis,
mais peut-Ítre
que ceux d'un poŤte, si.
Tirť de "November Rain",
de W. Axl Rose.
C'est une bonne chanson.
Barney m'a dit que t'avais besoin
que je vire un certain Scooter ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a, Bill ?
- C'est Scooter.
Je m'en occupe.
- Je peux avoir votre numťro ?
- Non.
C'est pour la mariťe.
Attendez, je vais
prendre un crayon.
La mariťe veut que
vous marchiez plus lentement.
Mon maquillage est parfait, et je vais
me mettre ŗ pleurer. Fais quelque chose.
J'ai des tťtons poilus.
- Vraiment ?
- Non ! Mais Áa a marchť, non ?
DrŰle d'histoire ! J'ai plaquť ce mec
que je pensais Ítre Scooter,
il s'est avťrť
Ítre le photographe.
Ne vous inquiťtez pas, j'ai ce joli
photo-phone, donc on est couvert.
C'est notre photographe ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
OK, je dois juste appeler...
ArrÍte. C'est bon.
Je ne laisserai rien
m'atteindre, aujourd'hui.
J'ai eu un appel du fleuriste,
les fleurs n'arriveront pas avant
la moitiť de la cťrťmonie.
«a va.
Dťsolť de vous dťranger, je crois que
j'ai trouvť votre voile sur le parking.
Je vais bien.
Juste pour info j'ai perdu les eaux,
mais je vais probablement pouvoir...
... faire avec.
Vraiment cool.
Lily, je crois que j'ai oubliť
ta culotte de mariťe.
Je croyais l'avoir,
je suis vraiment dťsolťe.
«a va, je vais porter
celle que j'ai sur moi.
Tu es sŻre ?
J'ťpouse Marshall aujourd'hui,
donc Áa n'a pas d'importance
que je descende l'allťe sans mon voile,
dans une piŤce sans fleurs,
avec comme musique, une femme en plein
labeur qui joue d'une demie harpe,
pendant que mon petit ami du lycťe
lit des paroles de Guns N' Roses.
Mais Áa va,
parce qu'il n'y a pas de photographe
pour prendre des photos de tout Áa.
Lily, est-ce que Áa va ?
Qu'est-ce que tu crois ?
Bien sŻr que Áa ne va pas !
Tout ce qui pourrait mal se passer
ŗ mon mariage se produit.
C'est foutu !
Qu'est-il arrivť au
"Je ne veux pas d'un mariage parfait" ?
Grandis un peu, Robin, bien sŻr
que je veux un mariage parfait.
Je voulais ne pas
me soucier du mariage,
mais je m'en fais.
Je devrais me sentir
comme une princesse, aujourd'hui.
Et Áa arrivera.
«a va aller, ma puce.
Si on allait dehors,
j'ai un truc
qui te fera te sentir mieux.
Qu'est-ce que tu as
qui pourrait me faire me sentir mieux ?
Mon Dieu, j'espŤre que Marshall
passe une meilleure journťe que moi.
Mon Dieu !
Quoi ?
Eh bien,
ce n'est pas trop court.
Mes cheveux !
Regardez mes cheveux !
Elle a bousillť mes cheveux.
Je ressemble ŗ
un Backstreet Boy.
Absolument.
Et mÍme pas ŗ un bon Backstreet Boys,
mais les Backstreet Boys
en plus vieux,
avec des moves boiteux,
dans une tournťe de come-back.
Les "bons" Backstreet Boys ?
Les mecs,
qu'est-ce que je vais faire ?
Mais qu'est-ce
qui t'est arrivť ?
La cousine de Lily
fait une ťcole d'esthťticienne,
et Lily ne voulait pas
qu'elle la coiffe elle,
alors elle a dit qu'elle pouvait
s'occuper de moi.
Pas trop court, OK ?
On n'a mÍme pas
besoin de les couper.
Juste leur donner du style.
OK, c'est bien.
Parce que..
Quand ils sont trop courts
Áa fait bizarre,
et je ne veux pas
paraÓtre bizarre.
Je pourrais te donner
des conseils pour Ítre un mec cool.
Je crois pas avoir besoin de conseils
sur comment Ítre cool, mais vas-y.
Je ne peux pas me marier comme Áa.
Il n'y a pas moyen !
Voyons ce que je peux faire.
Quoi ? Qu'est-ce que
tu peux faire ?
J'ai un super pouvoir.
Lily va me tuer.
Regarde-moi, elle ne voudra
pas m'ťpouser avec cette tÍte !
- C'est fou, bien sŻr qu'elle voudra.
- Tu m'ťpouserais ?
Non, mais pas ŗ cause des cheveux.
C'est parce que j'ai une rŤgle.
Ne jamais ťpouser quelqu'un
avec qui tu as fait un concours de pet.
Super ! Maintenant tu dis que Lily
et moi ne devrions pas nous marier ?
Puis-je avoir votre attention,
s'il vous plaÓt ?
C'est pour la mariťe.
Petit 1, la mariťe voudrait voir
partir cette tension dans mes ťpaules.
Et elle aimerait que... vous, dans
cette robe trop courte, les massiez.
Petit 2.
C'ťtait quoi le petit 2 ?
OK, on a un petit souci.
Ne paniquons pas.
Trouvons simplement une solution.
Tu t'es rasť la tÍte !
Ouais, mais c'est bien.
Je vais la raser entiŤrement,
c'est une super solution.
Je vais me faire chauve,
parce que c'est cool, hein ?
Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan,
Britney Spears.
Mon Dieu !
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Comment t'as pu
me laisser faire Áa ?
Quoi ?
T'es le pire tťmoin au monde,
je te dťteste !
Je ne sortirai pas !
Je pars et je ne reviendrai jamais,
je vais trouver ce fric
sous le rocher prŤs de l'arbre et vivre
avec ces gars sur la plage ŗ Zihautanejo.
- Ces types sont des criminels.
- Juste Red, Andy a ťtť accusť ŗ tort.
Ted, t'es mon tťmoin,
tu dois faire quelque chose.
D'accord, viens-lŗ, respire,
t'inquiŤte pas.
T'inquiŤte pas.
J'emmŤne Áa.
Salut !
Oncle Ben, c'est Áa ?
Nous avons un lťger
problŤme derriŤre.
Je me demandais
si vous pouviez nous aider.
Marshall s'est accidentellement
rasť une partie de la tÍte.
Ouais, donc voilŗ
ce ŗ quoi j'ai pensť.
Et si je trouvais quelque chose
pour couvrir la zone rasťe.
«a marcherait certainement,
mais avec quoi ?
C'est pas facile.
Peut-Ítre une moumoute,
ou une perruque.
Quelque chose qui irait
avec sa couleur de cheveux.
Qui est similaire ŗ celle
de vos cheveux du dessus.
Quelqu'un ici porte une perruque ?
«a devrait pas Ítre difficile ŗ
trouver, la plupart sont plutŰt nulles.
C'est bien vrai.
Il faut juste qu'on trouve
quelqu'un qui porte une perruque,
de la mÍme couleur
que vos cheveux et ceux de Marshall.
C'est une t‚che bien difficile.
Vraiment ?
Vous ne voyez pas d'endroit
dans le coin oý je pourrais trouver
le genre de perruque dont on parle ?
Non, j'ai beau me gratter la tÍ..
Je ne trouve pas.
Changeons d'angle,
j'ai 50$ dans la poche...
La mariťe en a besoin.
13 MINUTES AVANT LE MARIAGE
Finalement, Áa le fait.
Tout ŗ fait.
Barney.
HonnÍtement, je suis...
Je suis jaloux de ne pas la porter.
ProblŤme rťsolu, la crise est terminťe.
Allons me marier.
C'est horrible, n'est-ce pas ?
«a ressemble un peu
ŗ de la fourrure
qui te donne l'apparence
d'un BigFoot propre.
- Oh, vous savez...
- Dans le mauvais sens.
Sympa tes cheveux !
Oý est ta chemise ?
J'ai fait une t‚che
quand j'ai taclť le traiteur.
- Tu vas remettre une autre chemise ?
- Non, c'est bon.
Vous avez vu Scooter ?
Quoi ?
Quoi ? Scooter est lŗ ?
Ce type est ŗ mon mariage ?
Pas pour longtemps.
Pas pour longtemps...
J'ai besoin d'air frais,
on devrait aller faire un tour.
- D'accord.
- OK ?
«a couvrirait le problŤme.
C'est un vestige,
et sa cťlŤbre l'hťritage
de cette formidable nation.
A moins que tu en aies
dans ta voiture,
arrÍte de parler de plumes d'indien.
Mon Dieu !
- Marshall !
- Lily, tu n'es pas censťe me voir.
Oh merde, je crois que
personne n'est censť te voir.
Que s'est-il passť ?
C'est Emy qui t'as fait Áa ?
Juste les mŤches dťcolorťes,
j'ai fait le reste.
Dťsolť, mon coeur,
j'ai ruinť tout le mariage, non ?
Non, tu ne l'as pas ruinť,
il l'ťtait dťjŗ.
Il n'y a pas de fleurs,
pas de photographe
et au fait, Scooter est ici.
J'ai appris Áa.
Mon voile a ťtť piťtinť,
la joueuse d'harpe a commencť
le travail,
et je ne porte pas
ma culotte de mariťe.
Quoi ?!
Pas de "propriťtť
de Marshall sur les fesses" ?
Comment les gens
sauront ŗ qui est ce cul ?
Que s'est-il passť ?
Tu te souviens
du mariage qu'on voulait,
la petite cťrťmonie en plein air ?
J'aimerais qu'on ait ce mariage.
Faites-le.
Quoi ?
Mariez-vous, maintenant.
Ici mÍme.
Regardez, c'est en plein air
comme vous l'avez toujours voulu,
intime,
avec des amis proches,
il n'y a pas de guitare mais
c'est assez proche.
Barney peut officier.
Je peux le faire.
Excusez-moi, vous avez
tous laissez un truc tomber...
vos m‚choires.
Parce que Barney Stinson est sur le
point d'Ítre le complice d'un mariage.
On peut faire Áa ?
Et tout ces gens lŗ-bas ?
Faites-le aussi,
et si un truc ne va pas,
ce ne sera pas grave car
vous aurez eu le vrai mariage ici.
Qu'en penses-tu, mon coeur ?
J'adore !
Moi aussi.
Faisons-le.
Marions-nous avant de nous marier.
Gťnial.
Attends un peu.
Excusez-moi, Monsieur.
Pourrait-on vous emprunter
votre chapeau ?
Merci.
Un chapeau...
on a pensť ŗ des plumes d'indien
avant de penser ŗ un chapeau.
Merci ŗ tous d'Ítre lŗ.
Pour ceux qui ne me connaissent pas,
je ne suis pas le plus grand partisan
du mariage.
Mais...
vous deux, vous Ítes si bien ensemble.
C'est comme si vous ťtiez faits
l'un pour l'autre.
- Il va pleurer.
- Non, je vais pas pleurer.
Non, non, je vais pas pleurer.
Lily et Marshall,
quand on vous voit, on...
voit le vrai amour.
C'est le meilleur amour que...
On pourrait juste...
passer aux alliances ou ŗ autre chose ?
- J'ai pas mes voeux.
- Moi non plus.
Vous n'en avez pas besoin,
dites juste pourquoi vous vous aimez.
OK, je me lance en premier.
Lily,
il y a un million de raisons
qui font que je t'aime.
Tu me fais rire,
et tu prends soin de moi
quand je suis malade...
tu es charmante et attentionnťe,
t'as mÍme crťť
un plat aux oeufs ŗ mon nom,
elle farcit les oeufs brouillťs
ŗ l'italienne,
Áa s'appelle "les oeufs ŗ la Marshall"
et c'est gťnial.
Mais la raison principale
qui fait que je t'aime,
c'est que tu es ma meilleure amie,
Lily.
Tu es la meilleure amie que
j'ai jamais eue.
- Dťsolť, mon pote.
- Pas de problŤme.
Tout va bien.
A moi.
Merci.
Marshall,
je t'aime parce que tu es... drŰle,
et tu me fais sentir
que je suis aimťe,
et tu me rassures,
et pour notre anniversaire,
tu m'as offert un sweat qui disait :
"Lily et Marshall,
Áa le fait depuis 1996."
J'aimerais le porter maintenant,
parce qu'il a ton odeur.
Mais la raison principale pour laquelle
je t'aime, Marshall Erikson
c'est que tu me rends heureuse.
Tu me rends heureuse tout le temps.
J'ai trouvť ta culotte.
C'est bon.
Marshall, veux-tu de Lily
jusqu'ŗ ce que la mort vous sťpare ?
- Ralenti.
- Je peux pas.
Jusqu'ŗ ce que la mort vous sťpare.
Lily, promets-tu de
prendre soin de Marshall...
TrŤs bien, alors...
par les pouvoirs qui me sont confťrťs
par ce vieux pakistanais aigri
qui bosse en bas de la rue Lafayette,
je vous dťclare mari et femme.
Tu peux embrasser la mariťe.
Tu fumes ?
Premier mensonge aprŤs le mariage,
Áa a ťtť rapide.
<i>AprŤs Áa, on est tous retournť ŗ
l'intťrieur pour le deuxiŤme mariage.</i>
<i>Et un tas de trucs n'allaient pas,
mais Áa importait peu.</i>
<i>Parce qu'en on repense tous ŗ ce jour,</i>
<i>ce dont on se souvient,
c'est le premier mariage.</i>
<i>La cťrťmonie intime en plein air,</i>
<i>avec les amis proches</i>
<i>et une guitare sŤche.</i>
Comment te sens-tu ?
Fatiguťe. Je me suis mariťe
deux fois aujourd'hui.
Comment veux-tu le faire pour
la premiŤre fois en couple mariť ?
Dans une jolie chambre d'hŰtel ou
dans les toilettes de la rťception ?
Qu'en penses-tu ?
Les toilettes, bien sŻr.
S'il vous plaÓt, ne le faites pas lŗ.
- Dťsolť, Ted.
- Dťsolťe, Ted.
Mesdames et Messieurs,
pour la toute première fois,
M. et Mme
Marshall Eriksen et Lily Aldrin
Ça ne te rend pas
un peu triste
qu'on n'ait pas
le même nom de famille ?
Tu sais, d'une manière très évoluée,
très 21ème siècle...
- oui, un peu.
- Tu sais ce qu'on devrait faire ?
Trouver un nouveau nom.
Oh, ça c'est facile !
Lily et Marshall Skywalker.
Lily et Marshall Hasselhoff.
- Je sais ! Tu es prête ?
- Oui.
Lily et Marshall Géniaux.
Tu connais les Géniaux  ?
Marshall, Lily, leur fils Totalement
et leur fille Terriblement ?
- Je t'aime, Monsieur Génial.
- Je t'aime, Madame Géniale.
- Bon...
- Bon...
- Le mariage est passé.
- Oui, en effet.
Je suppose qu'à partir de demain,
nous pourrons le dire à tout le monde.
Dire quoi ?
- Salut Barney !
- Dire quoi ?
- La nourriture a l'air délicieuse.
- Dire quoi ?
- Rien
- Oh d'accord... Dire quoi ?
- Peut-on en parler plus tard ?
- Absolument. Dire quoi ?
Tu connais Barney ?
Barney Stinson.
Jolie robe.
Je sais,
moi aussi j'en ai marre,
c'est toujours pareil ces mariages,
tu as raison.
Tu veux danser ?
J'arrive.
Dire quoi ?
C'est juste quelque chose dont on
préfère ne pas parler maintenant, OK ?
- C'était chaud !
- Il a vraiment lâché l'affaire ?
Dire quoi ? Dire quoi ? Dire quoi ?
Dire quoi ? Dire q...
Il y a une Nissan noire sur le parking
qui a ses feux allumés.
Dire quoi ? Dire quoi ?

The Legen... dary Team
http://nosvospersos.blogspot.com
De l'eau, s'il vous plaît.
Merci.
- Dire quoi ?
- Oh mon Dieu ! OK !
On a une... nouvelle.
Mais on veut pas détourner l'attention
du grand jour de Lily et Marshall.
Alors oublie ça jusqu'à ce
qu'ils partent en lune de miel.
D'accord.
- C'est une grande nouvelle, quand même.
- Oh mon dieu ! Dites-moi !
- Aidez-nous !
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
On meurt de faim ! On a organisé
ce fantastique menu avec le traiteur
et on a pas eu droit
à une bouchée.
Chaque fois
qu'on s'approche de la bouffe,
on est bloqué par un abruti d'invité.
On n'a rien mangé de la journée.
- Très bien, occupons-nous de ça.
- On va vous ramener à votre table.
Vous voilà !
- Chérie, tu es si belle.
- Merci mamie, mais il faut vraiment
Et toi... Tu ressembles à
une star de ciné des années 40.
Et vous avez l'air
d'un agneau rôti en gelée.
Très bien, ramenons
ces deux-là à leur table.
On vous verra
sur la piste pour la chenille.
<i>La réponse à cette question avait été
déterminée des semaines plus tôt.</i>
- La chenille.
- Oui, absolument.
Pourquoi pas un diaporama
de vous au fil des années
effeuillant vos jours heureux
et se terminant par des photos
de vous bébés, côte à côte.
C'est super.
Je le mets sur la liste.
- Quelle liste ?
- D'horribles clichés de mariage,
On ne touchera pas
la barre du Limbo à 3m de haut.
Comme les premiers Corinthiens,
dans ce verset de la bible ?
- Ils font ça à tous les mariages.
- Il dit quoi ?
<i>L'Amour prend patience,
il est plein de bonté ;</i>
<i>l'amour n'est point envieux ;</i>
<i>l'amour ne se vante point,
n'est pas irrespectueux,</i>
<i>il ne cherche point son intérêt,</i>
<i>il ne s'irrite point,
il ne soupçonne point le mal.</i>
<i>L'amour pardonne tout,</i>
<i>il croit tout,</i>
<i>il espère tout,</i>
<i>il supporte tout.</i>
- Naze.
- Sur la liste.
On l'a fait.
Un mariage sans aucun cliché.
Le faire dans les toilettes de la
réception n'est pas un peu cliché ?
D'accord, un cliché.
Techniquement parlant, deux.
Ils ont encore retiré nos assiettes !
Agneau rôti,
où es-tu passé ?!
C'est ma nuit de noces,
j'étais censé vous consommer.
Tu m'as toujours, moi.
Les amis, on est au milieu d'un truc,
là, alors si vous pouviez aller
la cuisiner ou partager des silences
sexuellement intenses ailleurs, merci.
Non Barney, c'est mon mariage et
je resterai où bon me semblera.
Ce sont des mini quiches ?
Racontez ce secret.
C'était notre anniversaire.
On est allé dans ce restaurant,
Carmichael's,
où nous étions allés
pour notre premier rendez-vous.
Tu te souviens de l'endroit où
j'ai volé le cor bleu pour Robin ?
Ha oui, c'était toi !
Je savais que
c'était quelqu'un que je connais.
Quoi ? Tu étais là !
C'était comme un grand moment
iconique dans nos vies.
Peut-être dans ta vie.
J'ai plein de truc en cours.
Donc, on est assis là, et le serveur
arrive...
Champagne ?
On n'a pas commandé de champagne.
Offert par la maison.
Merci.
Et là,
au fond de mon verre de champagne,
Des mini quiches, t'es un beau salaud !
Ah, c'est vrai ! Ils ont emmené
cette table dans la cuisine,
car c'est là qu'ils créent
une fontaine de chocolat surprise.
Oh non, je l'ai révélé.
Alors, qu'est-ce qu'il y avait
dans le verre ?
Alors, le serveur arrive,
avec 2 flûtes, il dit "champagne".
"On n'a pas commandé de champagne".
"Offert par la maison".
Vous l'avez déjà dit !
Alors, Robin baisse les yeux, et là,
au fond de son verre,
se trouve une bague de fiançailles.
Quelque chose
à dire aux mariés ?
Ne vous mariez pas.
Et si je repassais ?
Une bague de fiançailles !
Non ! Ted,
tu ne peux pas me faire ça.
C'est ce qu'elle a dit.
Non.
Non, Ted ,
tu ne peux pas me faire ça.
Non, non ,non !
- De quoi tu parles ?
- De ça !
C'est de ça dont je parle. Qu'est-ce
que ça fait dans mon champagne ?
Oh mon Dieu !
Ecoute, faut que je sorte.
Ce n'est pas à moi.
Quoi ?
Ce n'est pas à moi.
Alors, à qui est-ce ?
C'est la mienne.
Jana,
veux-tu m'épouser ?
Oui.
C'était... Hilarant.
J'étais... genre... quoi !
Bref.
Qu'est-ce que c'était, ça ?
Qu'est ce c'était quoi ?
Cette réaction.
J'ai cru que
tu me demandais en mariage.
Vraiment ? Car on aurait pu croire
que j'essayais de te mettre le feu.
Ted, tu sais
ce que je pense du mariage.
Maintenant, plus que jamais.
Désolée, mais tu comptais
me demander en mariage ce soir ?
Alors en quoi c'est un problème ?
Même si tu ne veux pas te marier,
J'aime à penser que le fait
d'être ensemble depuis un an,
qu'on s'aime, m'apporte
une réaction plus douce que : non,
Ted, tu ne peux pas
me faire ça, non !
OK, d'accord. J'ai paniqué.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi.
Désolée.
Est-ce que tu peux
passer à autre chose ?
Stinson !
Ne mens jamais à un homme
sur une fontaine de chocolat.
Vous avez trouvé
quelque chose à manger ?
J'ai eu 4 fraises.
Est-ce qu'il y avait une flûte de
champagne avec chaque fraise ?
Oui.
Lily, tu aurais pu roter,
ou dire le mot "oui",
mais le fait que tu aies fais les deux
c'est exactement
ce pourquoi je t'ai épousée.
Regarde ! Encore des fraises !
Alors, qu'est-ce qui arrive ensuite ?
- Ted, ne fais pas ça.
- Non, sérieusement,
où est-ce que tu te vois dans 5 ans ?
Où est-ce que tu te vois, toi ?
Honnêtement, dans 5 ans,
j'aimerais sûrement être marié.
Et j'aimerais
sûrement être en Argentine.
Argentine ?
Ou Tokyo, ou Paris.
Ecoute, Ted,
je ne sais pas où je serai dans 5 ans.
Et je ne veux pas savoir,
je veux que ma vie soit une aventure.
On a une date
d'expiration, n'est-ce pas ?
Oh mon Dieu !
Vous avez rompu.
Vous avez rompu,
je ne peux pas y croire.
Barney,
L'histoire n'est pas finie.
On peut ne pas parler de ça ici ?
On peut rentrer ?
Oui, bien sûr.
- Excusez-moi, désolé, en fait on...
- Oh mon Dieu, c'est vous.
Quoi ?
Vous êtes le fils de pute
qui avez volé notre cor bleu.
Cours !
Cours ?
Ta stratégie c'était de courir ?
C'était une idée parfaite,
ils n'avaient d'info de carte bleue,
ils ne nous connaissaient pas du tout.
Je m'y tiens.
Et comment ça s'est fini pour toi ?
Je ne vois pas pourquoi ils ont gardé
ma carte bleue et mon permis,
jusqu'à ce qu'on ramène le cor.
Allez, Ted.
Tu peux les en blâmer ?
Ecoutez, je suis désolé pour le cor.
Je veux arranger ça.
Donc, ce qu'on va faire, maintenant,
c'est qu'on va courir !
Alors, l'Argentine ?
L'Argentine.
Pourquoi j'en n'ai jamais
entendu parler ?
Parce que l'école américaine
est nulle en géographie ?
Quel intérêt j'aurais eu à te dire
que je veux aller en Argentine ?
Tu ne veux pas y vivre.
- Je pourrais vouloir y vivre.
- Non.
Ta vie et ta carrière sont ici.
Je suis journaliste, ma carrière
peut me mener n'importe où
et j'espère que ce sera le cas.
Je peux aussi être
architecte n'importe où.
Il y a des buildings en Argentine.
Tout comme à Paris et même à Tokyo.
Je ne sais pas si tu as vu Godzilla,
mais il ne détruit pas des tentes.
Tu dis vouloir partir en Argentine ?
Eh bien,
j'ai toujours regretté de ne pas avoir
pris une année pour vivre à l'étranger.
Je viens de finir
un gros projet au boulot,
j'ai de l'argent de côté,
s'il y avait un moment pour le faire,
ce serait maintenant.
Partons en Argentine.
Oh, arrête.
Tu as peur que je ne plaisante pas.
C'est pas le cas ?
A toi de décider, Scherbatski.
Faisons-le, on part en Argentine.
No es posible.
Personne ne déménage en Argentine.
Le peso argentin
a baissé de 2/3 en 5 ans,
le gouvernement est opposé
aux réformes libérales,
et les chemins de fer
sont un désastre
depuis la désagrégation
des Ferrocarriles Argentinos.
J'ai couché avec une étudiante
argentine dans des toilettes
derrière le Yankee Stadium.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle était bavarde !
Super, hein ?
T'as attrapé le bouquet !
Barney.
L'histoire n'est pas encore finie.
- Attends.
- Quoi ?
- Je sais pas si je peux te faire ça.
- Me faire quoi ?
Tu dis vouloir partir
en Argentine, mais...
tu veux avoir des enfants.
Ah, oui,
et il n'y a pas d'enfants là-bas.
Sur la carte du Père Noël,
il y a un gros X sur l'Argentine.
- Tu sais ce que je veux dire.
- Non, je ne sais pas.
Disons qu'on ait des enfants.
Ils n'auraient pas
à grandir en banlieue.
Ils grandiraient sur la route,
ils auraient des aventures avec nous.
Pense aux T-Shirts Hard Rock Café
qu'ils pourraient collectionner.
Ted, tu sais que les enfants n'ont
jamais fait partie de mon projet.
Mais si je devais
avoir les enfants de quelqu'un...
ce serait les tiens.
C'est là qu'il faut courir.
Dis-moi que tu as couru, Ted.
Attends, je ne veux pas commencer
à avoir des enfants, là.
- Tu as des... ?
- Non, j'en ai pas.
On ne devrait pas.
- On prend le risque ?
- On prend le risque.
D'accord, mesdames et messieurs,
si vous voulez bien vous rassembler,
Lily et Marshall vont couper le gâteau.
Robin, tu n'es pas... ?
Dis que l'histoire n'est pas finie.
- Allez, ils coupent le gâteau.
- Dis que l'histoire n'est pas finie.
C'est la 12ème pire inquiétude que
j'ai eue sur la grossesse de quelqu’un.
Lily, j'ai très faim, donc
vise juste ma bouche, OK.
En plus, les taches gâteau,
c'est assez cliché...
Ça va être trop drôle.
Lily, donne-moi le gâteau.
S'il te plaît, bébé, j'ai trop faim.
Et elle va bien.
Il est l'heure de la lune de miel.
Les amis, merci beaucoup.
On vous aime.
Se marier,
avoir des enfants, que des erreurs,
d'horribles erreurs.
Ce type ne me donne rien de bon.
Bon, amusez-vous en Ecosse.
Si tu vois le monstre du Loch Ness,
passe-lui le bonjour de Ted Mosby.
Allons, Ted, Ness est une fille.
Salut, gamin.
Tu vas manquer
un max de trucs super.
Tu seras à la maison avec le gosse
pendant que moi
je me "génialerai" partout.
Et tu vas grossir.
L'histoire n'est pas finie, Barney.
Il est temps de ramener
le cor au bistro.
Ted, je ne sais pas si je peux
le refaire, ça m'a crevé.
C'est pas un euphémisme.
D'accord.
Laisse-moi me changer et on part.
Tu vas te changer et pas moi ?
Solidaire, ma soeur.
C'est fou.
J'ai des affaires de rechange
et pas toi. Faut t'y faire.
Si on avait emménagé ensemble,
toutes mes affaires seraient là.
Mais on l'a pas fait, donc...
On ne fait qu'envisager, hein ?
On ne fait pas ça, hein ?
Je ne veux pas avoir d'enfants
en Argentine.
Et je veux pas avoir d'enfants
en Argentine.
Alors, on en est où ?
On pourrait rester ensemble et
faire comme si
ça n'avait pas d'importance.
Ou...
on pourrait rendre le cor bleu.
Tu avais volé ce cor bleu pour moi.
Je volerais tout un orchestre pour toi.
Vous vous êtes séparés.
Tu n'es pas enceinte ?
Et Marshall et Lily ne le savent pas ?
Après en avoir discuté
on est passé pour vous le dire.
Mais Lily était assez stressée donc...
On a décidé de ne pas en parler
jusqu'à la fin du mariage.
Vous allez bien ?
Ça n'a pas été les deux semaines
les plus faciles de nos vies, mais...
On va bien.
L'open bar aide bien.
Pardon, Mademoiselle.
M'accordez-vous cette danse ?
On savait que
ce jour finirait par arriver.
Prends soin d'elle, petit homme.
Jusque là, je ne t'ai jamais vu
aussi ivre !
Chauffeur ?
Ranjit !
On peut faire un arrêt
avant de retourner à l'hôtel ?
Vous n'êtes pas obligés
de vous arrêter.
Vous pouvez être ensemble
en tant que mari et femme
à l'arrière de la limousine.
Et puisqu'on est ami...
je ne regarderai pas.
En fait, on a autre chose en tête.
Bienvenue à WeinerBurger.
Bonjour.
On pourrait avoir un numéro 1
sans cornichon ?
Et un numéro 4 sans oignon.
Laissez-moi deviner,
le bal du lycée Jefferson ?
Mais merci.
En fait, on vient de se marier.
- Félicitations.
- Merci.
Ça fera 7.80$.
Hé, mec,
je sais pas comment te dire ça
mais ta femme vient de vomir dans
la poubelle.
Ma femme...
<i>Marshall et Lily étaient mariés</i>
<i>et Robin et moi nous séparions.</i>
<i>Et aussi dur que c'était
à ce moment là,</i>
<i>au final, on a tous les deux
eu ce qu'on voulait.</i>
<i>En fin de compte,
elle a vécu en Argentine...</i>
<i>et au Maroc...</i>
<i>En Grèce, en Russie,</i>
<i>même au Japon, pendant un moment.</i>
<i>Et moi,</i>
<i> j'ai rencontré votre mère.</i>
<i>Je pense que pour l'essentiel</i>
<i>si vous êtes honnêtes envers vous-même
sur vos projets dans la vie,</i>
<i>la vie vous le donne.</i>
<i>Bien sûr, à ce moment</i>
<i>tout ce que je voulais,
c'était un scotch soda</i>
<i>et un cigare.</i>
Je suis vraiment navré
pour toi et Robin.
Je sais que je plaisantais tout
le temps sur votre séparation mais
vous alliez très bien ensemble.
On allait bien ensemble...
C'était pas la bonne, tu vois ?
La bonne... ?
Non, Ted !
Ne me dis pas que tu vas recommencer
à chercher la bonne.
je veux bien t'entendre dire "la bonne"
si ça veut dire qu'elle est bonne.
J'ai besoin de faire une pause.
Je veux juste sortir et
- m'éclater pendant un moment.
- Vraiment ?
Parce que...
tu sais...
ça fait un an que tu es en couple,
tu vas être...
un peu rouillé.
Je dis juste que...
Tu vas avoir besoin d'un peu d'aide.
Ça se pourrait.
- Ted ?
- Oui, Barney.
Tu crois que...
Tu crois que tu pourrais...
avoir encore besoin d'un coéquipier ?
Oui.
Nous revoilà !
Nous revoilà !
Et Ted, mon garçon,
ça va être légend... attends...
Merci à
The Legen... dary Team
<i>Les enfants, il y a plus d'une histoire
sur ma rencontre avec votre mère.</i>
<i>Vous connaissez la version courte,
celle avec le parapluie jaune.</i>
<i>Mais, il y en a une plus grande.</i>
<i>Celle du comment je suis devenu
ce qu'il fallait avant de la rencontrer.</i>
<i>Cette histoire commence... là.</i>
... daire.
Légendaire.
Je suis trop content
que tu sois de nouveau célibataire.
On va conquérir New York City.
J'ai déjà une collègue
sur la liste pour toi.
Son sein droit
est plus gros que le gauche.
Certains voient
le côté à moitié vide du soutif,
moi, je vois le côté à moitié plein.
Je sais pas.
Robin et moi avons rompu
il y a 2 semaines.
Je suis pas prêt.
Quand le seras-tu ?
<i>C'était une bonne question.
Après une rupture,</i>
<i>on a besoin de temps pour se reprendre.</i>
<i>Robin est partie en Argentine,</i>
j'ai retrouvé ma routine.</i>
<i>J'ai laissé pousser ma barbe de rupture.</i>
Ted Mosby, en costume !
Il y a le concours Miss Nassau,
on se fera passer pour des juges,
et, oui, nos ventes sont à vendre.
Pas prêt.
<i>J'ai repeint l'appartement.</i>
La ligne d'arrivée
d'un 10 kilomètres féminin !
Des filles en sueur, les endorphines
au plafond, ne rêvant que de s'allonger.
Pas prêt.
<i>En vérité, j'allais vraiment bien.</i>
Des acrobates femmes, de Montréal
hyper souples.
On va au cirque "Pine d'air".
Et ouais !
Allez, on en a déjà parlé.
Je suis pas...
Je suis rentrée d'hier soir.
- Voici Gael.
- Hola.
D'accord, je suis prêt.
The Legen... dary Team
http://nosvospersos.blogspot.com
J'arrive pas à le croire.
On s'est séparés de façon très amicale.
Tout va bien,
et elle revient de vacances
avec ce type...
Vous savez ce qu'elle fait ?
Gagner la rupture.
Comment ça, gagner la rupture ?
Vieil inventeur du passé.
Ce que notre 21e président,
Chester A. Arthur essaie de dire,
c'est qu'il y a toujours un gagnant
et un perdant dans une rupture.
C'est pas une compétition.
Votre course en ballon en 80 jours,
ça, c'était une compétition.
C'est ma femme.
Bien sûr que c'est une compétition.
Sinon, comment expliquer...
c'est quoi son nom ?
Gael.
Pardon, Gaïl ?
Gael.
Kyle ?
Gael.
Girl ?
Ça se prononce Ga-i-el.
Ça veut dire "joie".
C'est pour ça que je vis ma vie
en amenant joie, bonne énergie,
et bonheur aux autres.
Particulièrement à ceux
qui sont moins chanceux que moi.
Pardon, donc c'est Gayle ?
Quel nul !
Je vais pas ton pays débile
pour séduire des femmes
avec mon accent sexy.
Bien dit,
propriétaire de boîte de nuit persan.
Et, il est masseur...
Avec un massage,
tout est relié.
Je peux toucher vos pieds,
ça nettoie vos reins.
Je peux toucher vos lobes,
ça ralentit votre rythme cardiaque.
J'ai déjà utilisé de l'eau
chaude pour faire pisser un type.
Bien sûr, j'en ai pas fait une carrière.
Une carrière, c'est tellement
américain comme idée.
Ma carrière, c'est vivre,
faire du surf,
faire l'amour.
Parfois en même temps.
Comment ce serait possible ?
Sérieux, ne glousse pas, dis-moi.
C'est impossible.
On peut pas coucher
sur une planche de surf.
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Content que tu demandes.
J'ai créé une liste
de tous les véhicules :
terriens, aquatiques et aériens
sur/dans lesquels
il est possible de coucher.
et sur ces 33 véhicules,
j'ai couché sur/dans 31.
La planche de surf
n'est pas sur la liste. Impossible.
P.-S : pour atteindre les 33,
il faut juste un bobsleigh
et la navette Appollo 11.
Pour obtenir cette dernière, faudrait
cambrioler le Smithsonian.
Cette conversation
n'a jamais eu lieu.
T'es en costume, je suis sans barbe,
- sortons gagner ce truc.
- Ouais !
Vous, amusez-vous à votre rencart à 4.
Pour la centième fois,
je suis désolée, il y avait un silence.
Puis, on s'est endormis
sur la plage en comptant les étoiles.
Vous voulez dîner avec moi... nous ?
Il n'y a pas eu de silence.
- Tu le trouves incroyablement canon.
- Pas du tout.
Pas incroyablement.
C'est difficile d'être aussi canon.
Mais, c'est pas sérieux entre eux.
Les filles n'épousent
jamais les canons.
Toi si.
Je fais partie des quelques chanceuses.
Lily.
Ted est notre meilleur ami,
soyons carrés.
Les Gael ne sont pas canons.
Et il n'est pas notre ami.
Ne le regarde même pas.
Pas de regard direct.
<i>Ce soir, tandis que Lily et Marshall
faisaient de leur mieux pour haïr Gael,</i>
Salut Robin !
Gael !
<i>Robin m'a pris à part
pour s'assurer d'un truc.</i>
<i>Elle voulait certes faire pour le mieux,</i>
<i>mais elle dit... le pire.</i>
Je veux juste
m'assurer que c'est OK pour toi.
Je veux juste
m'assurer que c'est OK pour toi.
Merde, je supporte pas
que ce soit elle qui dit ça.
Elle gagne, hein ?
Pas pour longtemps.
Discours d'encouragement, pause.
Ted, ce soir, on va te montrer
quelqu'un de bien plus canon que Robin.
Bon, Robin est un 10.
On te trouvera un 12.
Ou... tu sais, deux 6.
En cas d'échec, quatre 3.
Et "briser la glace en cas d'urgence".
On va à Staten Island,
je t'aurais douze 1.
Ted, mon garçon,
je vais te réapprendre...
- Amy.
- Ted.
Barney.
Ted, on est de retour !
Là-haut !
Là-haut.
Tope-la façon tope-la !
- Je suis désolée, c'est trop bizarre.
- Bizarre ?
Pourquoi ? Parce que
tu sortais avec notre meilleur ami ?
Ou parce que ma femme trouve ton nouveau
copain incroyablement canon ?
C'est pas vrai !
Tais-toi ! Oh, mon Dieu !
J'espère que Ted va bien.
Je déteste te voir si tendue.
Notre rupture s'est vraiment
bien passée, vous savez ?
On a vraiment agi en adultes,
donc la dernière chose...
Oh, mon Dieu !
Gael, es-tu un masseur
dûment accrédité ?
Quoi ?
Es-tu légalement certifié par une
quelconque entité gouvernementale ?
Je me suis entraîné 3 ans
dans un institut à Buenos Aires.
J'ai une carte. Je peux te montrer.
Une carte stratifiée ?
- Comment ça "stratifiée" ?
- Couverte,
plastifiée.
- Oh, oui.
- Merde.
Il gère...
- Ted !
- Quoi !
Cassons-nous, c'est mort ici.
Ouais, t'as raison.
On s'emmerde, tous les deux.
Exactement.
Et, on a un planing serré.
J'ai entièrement planifié
la soirée. Alerte spoiler :
Notre dernier arrêt est un after,
tellement after que c'est dans 3 jours.
T'es aveugle ?
je suis en train de me faire un 12.
- Je suis en train de gagner.
- Mais, j'ai pas aidé !
Donc, tu veux
que je jette une fille super sexy
car tu m'as pas aidé à l'avoir ?
Excuses acceptées. Allons-y.
- C'est qui le costard ?
- C'est Barney. Barney, Amy.
Je ne vais pas me souvenir de ça.
Excuse-moi, "rencontre fortuite
de début de soirée",
c'est ainsi qu'on parlera de toi,
Ted et moi avons un plan à suivre.
Tu peux cocher : 20 h 54, s'habiller en
pauvre type, et ennuyer les gens cools.
Casse-toi, l'intello !
Beau travail, Tommy Lee.
Ce que tu ne comprends pas,
c'est que je suis le copilote de Ted.
C'est un lien sacré, plus fort
que tout... Ils le font encore !
Masseur...
Tu sais quoi, "Gayle" ?
Ton poulet me paraît un peu tendu.
Est-ce que ça fait du bien, M. Poulet ?
Eh bien, devine.
Je ne me suis pas lavé les mains.
Je l'ai eu !
Lily !
On porte tellement d'anciennes
émotions dans notre cou et nos épaules.
Des choses qui auraient
dû disparaître il y a des années.
Je te pardonne, maman.
Lily, on est les meilleurs amis de Ted,
notre boulot est de haïr ce gars.
Oh, ouais, C'est ce que je faisais.
Je le flattais juste un peu,
pour pouvoir mieux
le rabaisser deux minutes plus tard.
Tu ne portais pas un soutien-gorge ?
<i>La nuit se passait bien,
Amy était cool et dangereuse.</i>
<i>Elle avait trouvé
une copine à Barney.</i>
<i>Elle a même payé à boire.</i>
<i>En quelque sorte...</i>
On est connus ici,
on va avoir des ennuis.
Dis-moi quelque chose. Tu demandes
à ton tailleur de laisser de la place
dans l'entrejambe
pour ton énorme vagin ?
Tu...
C'est toi le vagin...
- Ted, cette fille est folle. On y va.
- Bonne idée.
Allons tous chez moi.
Chez toi ? Merci, mais non merci,
Courtney Love de 1994.
J'ai un spa.
OK, en fait c'est plutôt sympa.
C'est joli ça...
Merci, tu peux jouer avec si tu veux.
ils sont 100% vrais.
Non, pas ça...
... tes tatouages !
Merci.
- Tu devrais t'en faire un.
- Faux.
Ted a un look classique,
propre sur lui,
qui n'est jamais démodé,
saison après saison.
Grillée !
Je pense qu'il serait
sexy avec un peu d'encre.
- Non, pas du tout.
- Si !
Non, il ne le serait pas !
À propos, je suis prête à faire
tout ce que tu veux, vraiment tout.
Maintenant.
Ted, tu vas choisir
quel camp pour le tatouage ?
Je pense que je serais bien
plus sexy avec un peu d'encre.
Oh mon Dieu ! Tyler ?
Maman ! Papa ! Elle est de retour !
Merde, ils étaient
censés être dans les Hamptons.
Courez !
Désolée, j'étais nourrice
chez ces idiots
avant qu'ils me virent. Trop injuste.
Injuste ? Je te laisserais pas
garder les enfants que j'invente
pour sortir
avec des mères célibataires.
C'est bon, Ted. On rentre.
Ted, ça va ?
Salut, Ted.
Robin et moi
allons faire une fantastique
partie de jambes
en l'air sur cette planche.
Et je veux juste m'assurer
que c'est OK pour toi.
Comment on va faire ?
Je pense que tu dois lever ta jambe,
Et si je....
- Non...
- Ça va.
En fait, voilà comment ça va.
Je vais me faire tatouer.
Tu ne vas pas te faire tatouer,
ce n'est pas toi, Ted !
Ted, tu es en train
d'emprunter un mauvais chemin.
C'est la route que je prends...
Mais tu as besoin
d'un programme, d'un copilote !
Je vais en parler sur mon blog !
Tu veux baiser ?
Et dessous,
il devrait y avoir marqué "j'ai gagné".
Et, il devrait y avoir
des flammes remontant vers l'épaule.
Feu ! On devrait faire un feu.
Après ça, peut-être.
Oh, ça va devenir légen...
attends...
<i>Et c'est tout ce dont je me souviens.</i>
<i>Le lendemain matin,
je me suis réveillé seul, chez moi.</i>
Salut, comment s'est passée ta nuit ?
C'était super.
J'ai rencontré cette incroyable nana,
j'ai failli me faire tatouer.
Ne vous inquiétez pas,
je l'ai pas fait, mais c'était...
C'était sensas !
Je pense qu'on peut dire que
j'ai gagné cette rupture.
Regarde !
Oh mon Dieu !
- Quoi ?
- Rien.
Le catalogue de La Redoute.
Qui emmène
deux Goden Retrievers dans un canoë ?
- Faut qu'on appelle Barney.
- Je suis déjà dessus.
Salut.
Qu'y a-t-il de si urgent ?
Soyez-m?en témoins,
je ne reparlerai plus à Ted.
Vraiment ?
Jamais ?
Même si, admettons,
les papillons décollent de son cul ?
Ted,
peux-tu me passer le plat à fondue ?
Il n'en sait rien.
On se remet de ses émotions,
et on y retourne.
Merci.
Quoi ?!
Ted...
je suis passé ce matin parce que...
je voulais m'excuser.
Excuses acceptées, Barney.
Comme tu peux le constater,
je me suis amusé tout seul,
j'ai pas besoin de baby-sitter.
Tout ce temps,
je pensais que t'avais besoin
d'un copilote pour voler, mais en fait,
tu as tes propres ailes à présent.
Depuis que tu as rompu avec Robin,
tu as grandi.
Tu t'es développé dans ton cocon.
Et hier soir, tu es sorti de ce cocon
comme un majestueux....
Zut ! Qu'est-ce qui sort d'un cocon ?
J'ai toujours été nul en Biologie.
Il va le dire.
Un papillon ?
- Quoi ?
- Rien, mon pote.
Mince, ça fait mal !
Oh mon Dieu !
J'ai un tatouage.
C'est pas un tatouage.
Ça, très cher, c'est un tatou-pouffe
Un tatou-pouffe.
Tu sais un "Par ici",
un "Attrape mon cul"
une plaque d'immatriculation
de Panama City.
<i>Et soudainement,
je me suis souvenu de tout.</i>
...daire !
Légendaire !
C'est moi
le grand gagnant de cette rupture.
Je viens de casser
avec mon copain, Steeve.
Il était super chiant.
Du genre : "C'est Toi, marions-nous".
Quelle fiotte !
Tu crois que des ex peuvent être amis ?
Bien sûr, on est toujours amis,
hein, Steeve ?
Tu t'appelles Steeve
et son ex s'appelait Steeve.
C'est marrant, non ?
Attends.
Ouais, ça qui va l'enlever.
Essaie avec du soda.
Mince, ça fait vraiment mal.
Il me faut de la pommade.
C'est quoi, ça ?
Huile de massage espagnole.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé, hier soir ?
Hier soir, c'était étrange.
Sens les émotions s'évanouir.
Je me remets pas
d'avoir été gradouble en 4e.
T'es superbe.
Je suis superbe.
Apprends à ressentir ta nourriture.
Essaie la mangue.
OK, ça suffit pour la nourriture.
On est désolés,
Ted, ça n'arrivera plus.
Ça ne signifiait rien pour nous.
C'était juste vraiment très agréable.
Je peux plus vous regarder.
Il a un tatou-pouffe.
Tout d'abord,
je suis pas là pour que
tu reviennes avec moi.
Il n'y aura pas
de surprenantes déclarations d'amour.
Pas de douce chanson rock  juste quand
on va s'embrasser, rien de tout ça.
Bien.
Bon, voilà le truc.
Ça craint que tu sois revenu d'Argentine
avec un gars aussi cool que Gael.
Et je sais que
j'ai pas à être fâché contre toi,
on a cassé, la vie continue, basta.
Tu sais quoi ?
On a jamais fait ça.
On a eu une rupture polie
sans cris irrationnels
et c'est pas normal.
Donc, je vais crier irrationnellement
pendant un moment
et tu vas devoir rester là
à le supporter, d'accord ?
Si tu en ressens le besoin.
Je crois que oui.
Vraiment !
Donc, là, je crie !
- Tu t'es rasé ?
- Oui !
- J'aimais bien.
- Moi aussi,
mais ça commençait à chauffer !
Peut-être que je la laisserais
repousser en hiver.
Voilà, j'ai fini.
Je savais que c'était bizarre
de me venir avec Gael.
Je suis désolée.
Écoute,
notre rupture était une bonne chose.
Mais c'est pas facile de t'oublier,
j'essaie encore.
- T'as dépassé ça dès le décollage.
- "Dépassé ça" ?
Mes 3 premiers jours en Argentine,
j'ai pleuré comme une madeleine.
Tu m'as tellement manqué.
Je voulais y aller
pour prouver que j'étais aventurière.
Mais à vrai dire...
c'était très solitaire.
C'est pour ça
que Gael est arrivé.
T'essayais pas de
gagner la rupture ?
J'essayais d'y survivre.
Écoute, ça a l'air bien
et on continuera à être amis
et à aller de l'avant, mais...
fallait vraiment
qu'il soit si canon ?
- C'est un adonis.
- C'est pas un adonis.
C'est la Cadillac des remises en selle.
Marshall a le béguin pour lui.
- Il est parfait.
- Non.
Allez, il est sexy,
il fait de la planche à voile,
des massages.
Cite un truc où
je suis meilleur que lui.
T'es plus grand.
Ne sois pas condescendante.
Il est même plus grand que moi.
Ted,
tu es "plus grand".
J'ai gagné !
<i>Je ne me rappelle pas exactement</i>
<i>ce qui m'a aidé à surmonter
la phase "Gael et Robin".</i>
<i>Je suis sûr que c'était un truc
de profond et significatif</i>
<i>et pas du tout macho et insignifiant.</i>
<i>Mais, après ça j'étais remis sur pieds.</i>
<i>Et la suite fut
une nouvelle ère dans ma vie.</i>
<i>Une folie sans précédent.</i>
<i>C'est drôle de se remémorer
cette époque,</i>
<i>sachant maintenant
vers quoi j'allais.</i>
<i>Et ce qui allait vers moi.</i>
Ici, Barney.
Salut mec, c'est Marshall.
Regarde tes mails.
Je t'ai envoyé un truc.
- C'est quoi ?
- Un nouveau site Web.
Ledécomptebaffe.com
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Kids, there's more than one
story of I met your mother.
You know the short version,
the thing with your mom's
yellow umbrella.
But there's a bigger story.
The story of how I became
who I had to become
before I could meet her.
And that story begins here.
...dary!
Legendary!
Dude, I am so excited
that you're single again.
We are going to conquer
New York City.
I already have a girl
from work lined up for you.
Right boob bigger
than the left boob,
which some choose to look
at as bra half empty,
I choose to look
at as bra half full.
I don't know.
Robin and I broke up
two weeks ago.
I'm... I'm not ready.
When will you be ready?
It was a good question.
After a big relationship ends,
you need some time
to recuperate.
Robin took a trip to Argentina,
and I went through
my usual routine.
I grew my breakup beard.
Ted Mosby, suit up,
'cause here's the plan.
There's a Miss Nassau
County pageant.
We'll pretend to be judges
and, yes, our votes
are for sale.
I'm not ready.
I repainted the apartment.
Finish Line of a women's 10K.
Salty girls on
an endorphin high
who just want to lie down.
Yeah.
I'm not ready.
And the truth is,
I was doing really good.
Female acrobats
from Montreal.
Hmm.
Super flexible.
We are going to get
Cirque de So-Laid.
What up?
Barney, come on,
we've covered this.
Robin!
Hey, guys.
I just got in last night.
Um, uh, this is Gael.
Hola.
Okay, I'm ready.
Subsfactory presents:
How I Met Your Mother
Season 3 Episode 1
"Wait For It"
Synch by: redman
I just can't believe her.
We have this totally
amicable split,
everything's cool.
And she comes back
from vacation withthatguy?
You know what she's doing?
She's trying to win the breakup.
What do you mean "win the
breakup," old-timey inventor?
What our 21st president,
Chester A. Arthur,
is trying to say is that
in every breakup there are
winners and a losers.
It's not a
competition.
Now, your 80-day
balloon race around the world,
that was a competion.
That's my wife.
Of course it's
a competition, Lil.
How else do you explain...
what's his name?
Gael.
I'm sorry, Gayle?
Gael.
Kyle?
Gael.
Girl?
It's pronounced "guy-el. "
It means "joyful. "
That is why I live
my life by bringing joy,
good energy
and happiness to others.
Especially those
less fortunate that I.
I'm sorry, so it's Gayle?
What a jerk.
I don't go
to your stupid country
and try to seduce women
with my sexy accent.
That's a great point,
Persian nightclub owner.
Oh, and he's a masseuse.
With a massage,
everything is connected.
I can touch your foot,
cleanse your kidney.
I can touch
your earlobe,
and slow your heartbeat.
One time, I used warm water
to make a guy pee.
Of course, I didn't
make a career out of it.
Career?
Such an American idea.
My career is living.
Windsurfing.
Making love.
Sometimes at the same time.
How?
How would one do that exactly?
Seriously, don't giggle.
Tell me.
Not possible.
You cannot have sex
on a windsurfing board.
How do you know?
Glad you asked, Lily.
I have crafted a list
of every vehicle...
land-based, aquatic
and airborne...
in which/on which it's
possible to have sex.
And of those 33 vehicles,
I have had sex in/on 31.
Windsurfing board,
not on the list, not possible.
Oh, P.S., in order
to hit 33, all I need is
bobsled and the Apollo 11
space capsule.
To get that last one, you'd have
to break into the Smithsonian.
This conversation
never happened.
All right, you're suited up,
I'm bearded down.
Let's get out there
and win this thing.
Yes!
You guys, have fun
on your double date.
Oh, for the hundredth time,
I'm sorry, there was a lull.
And then we fell asleep
on the beach
while counting the stars.
Do you want to have
dinner with me? Uh, us?
There was no lull.
You just think
he's incredibly hot.
No, I don't!
Not incredibly.
It's a little hard to believe
how hot he is.
But, I mean,
she's serious
about him.
The girl never marries
the hot guy.
Well, you did.
I'm one of the lucky few.
Lily, Ted is our best friend,
so let's get something straight:
Male Gayle is not hot.
He's not our friend.
Don't even look at him.
Just... no eye contact.
So that night,
as Lily and Marshall
did their best to hate Gael...
Hey, Robin. Gael.
...Robin pulled me aside
to check in.
Now, I'm sure
she meant the best,
but she said the worst.
I just want to make sure
you're okay with this.
"I just want to make sure
you're okay with this"?
Damn it! I can't
believe she's the one
that gets to say that.
She's winning, isn't she?
Not for long.
Okay, pep talk.
Take a knee.
Ted, tonight we're going to get
you someone way hotter
than Robin.
Okay, Robin's a ten.
Fine, we'll get you a 12.
Or, you know...
two sixes.
Failing that, four threes.
And break glass
in case of emergency,
we'll go to Staten Island,
I'll get you 12 ones.
Ted, my boy,
I am going to re-teach you...
Amy.
Ted.
Barney.
Ted, we are back!
Up here.
Up high.
Fivin' it up
five-style!
I'm sorry this is
all so weird.
Weird, why would it be weird?
Because you used
to date our best friend
or because my wife thinks
your new boyfriend
is incredibly hot?
I do not! Shut up!
Oh, my God!
I just hope Ted's okay.
Hmm.
I hate to see you so tense.
I mean, we had a really
clean break up, you know?
We really acted like adults,
so the last thing... oh!
Gael, are you a properly
licensed massage therapist?
What?
Are you legally
certified by some type
of governing entity?
I train for three years at
an institute in Buenos Aires.
I have a card.
I can show you.
Is the card laminated?
What do you mean "laminated"?
Covered in protective plastic.
Oh, yes.
Damn it.
He checks out.
Ted. Ted.
What?!
Let's bail, this
place is dead.
Yeah, you're right.
We're both totally striking out.
Exactly, plus,
we're on a tight schedule.
I've got this entire evening
perfectly planned
out... spoiler alert:
our last stop is
an after hours club
so after hours, it's
three days from now.
What up.
Are you blind?
I'm making out with a 12.
I am winning.
Yeah, but I didn't get to help.
So you're saying
you want me to throw away
a super hot girl just because
you didn't help me get her?
Apology accepted.
Let's go.
Who's the suit?
This is Barney.
Barney, Amy.
I'm not gonna remember that.
Now, if you'll
excuse me,
random chick from
earlier tonight,
as you shall
henceforth be known,
Ted and I have a
schedule to keep.
Oh, well, you can check off
8:54, dress up like a dork
and bother the cool kids.
Beat it, nerd.
Wow. Wow.
Great stuff, Tommy Lee.
See, what you don't
understand is
I'm Ted's wingman.
It's a sacred bond,
much stronger than any...
They're making out again.
Massage therapist.
And you know what, "Gayle"?
Your piece of chicken
looks a little tense to me.
Oh, oh, does that
feel good, Mr. Chicken?
Well, guess what?
I didn't wash my hands.
Got him.
Lily!
We carry so much
ancient emotion
in our neck
and shoulders.
Things we should have
let go of years ago.
I forgive you, Mom.
Lily, we are Ted's
best friends.
Our job is to hate that guy.
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was doing.
I was just building him up
so a few minutes later,
I could totally cut him down.
Weren't you wearing a bra?
The night was going great.
Amy was cool and dangerous.
She found a friend for Barney.
She even paid for drinks...
sort of.
They know us here.
You're gonna get
us in trouble.
Tell me something.
Do you ask your tailor
to leave extra room
in the crotch
for your huge vagina?
You... your vagina...
Ted, this chick is crazy.
We're leaving.
Good idea.
Let's all go back
to my place.
Your place?
Thanks but no thanks,
1994 Courtney Love.
I have a hot tub.
Okay, this is
actually pretty nice.
I like your tatts.
Thanks, you can play
with them if you want.
They're a hundred
percent real.
No, your tatts... toos,
your tattoos.
Thanks.
You should get one.
Wrong. Ted has a classic,
clean-cut look
that never goes out of style
season after season, burn.
Yeah? Well, I think he
would look hot with some ink.
No, he wouldn't.
Yes, he would.
No, he wouldn't.
Yuh-huh.
Nuh-uh.
I'm ready to do anything
you want by the way.
Anything. Right now.
Ted, who are you gonna side
with on this tattoo thing?
I think I'd look
way hot with some ink.
Yeah, you would.
Yeah.
Oh, my God!
Tyler?
Mommy! Daddy!
She's back!
Damn it, they're supposed
to be in the Hamptons. Run!
Sorry. I used to nanny
for those jerks
before they fired me.
So unfair.
Unfair?
I wouldn't let you take care
of the imaginary kids
I make up to score
with single moms.
That's it, Ted.
We're going home.
Ted?
Ted, you okay?
Hello, Ted.
Robin and I are about to make
fantastic aquatic sex
on this windsurfing board.
And I just want to make sure
you're okay with this.
Okay, how do we do this?
I think your leg
goes up, up...
Okay, how about if I, um...
No, mine...
I'm okay.
In fact, here's
how okay I am.
I'm getting a tattoo.
You're not getting
a tattoo, it's not you.
Ted, you are heading
down a dark path.
That dark path
is my driveway.
But you need a plan
and you need a wingman!
This is so going
in my blog!
Want to have sex?
Okay.
And underneath,
it should
say, "I win. "
And then it should have
flames coming out the bottom.
Fire!
We should start a fire.
After this maybe.
Oh, man, this is
going to be legend.
Wait for it.
And that's all I rember.
The next morning,
I woke up alone back home.
Hey, buddy, how
was your night?
You know,
it was great.
I met this crazy girl,
I almost got a tattoo.
Don't worry.
I didn't, but it was...
It was amazing.
I think it's safe to say,
I am winning this breakup.
Look.
Oh, my God.
What?
Nothing.
This J. Crew catalog.
Who brings two Golden
Retrievers in a canoe?
We got to
call Barney.
Way ahead of you.
Hey, guys, what's
the big emergency?
Oh, and B the W:
I am never speaking
to Ted again.
Mm.
Really? Never?
Not even if, say,
butterflies flew out of his ass?
What?
Ted?
Could you grab me
the fondue pot?
He has no idea.
And up we go.
Thank you.
What?
Ted?
Mm?
I came here
this morning because...
I want to apologize.
Apology accepted, Barney.
As you can see, I do
just fine on my own.
I don't need a baby-sitter.
See, all this time,
I thought you need
a wingman to fly,
but the truth is, you...
you've got your
own wings now.
Mm.
Since you and Robin split,
you've been gestating.
Growing in your coon.
And last night...
...you burst out of
that cocoon like a...
like a majestic, uh...
Gosh, what is it that
comes out of a cocoon?
I was always
bad at science.
He's going to say it!
A butterfly?
What?
Nothing, buddy.
Ow! Why did that hurt so...?
Oh, my God!
I have a tattoo!
Oh, that's not a tattoo.
That, dear boy,
is a tramp stamp.
A tramp stamp.
You know, a ho tag.
Ass antlers.
A Panama City license plate.
And suddenly,
it all came back to me.
...dary!
Legendary!
Man, I am so winning
this breakup.
Mm. I just broke up
with my boyfriend Steve.
He was totally annoying.
He was, like,
"I think you're the one,
I want to marry you. "
What a wuss.
Do you think
exes can be friends?
Yeah, sure.
I mean, we're still friends,
right, Steve?
Hey, your
name is Steve.
And her
ex-boyfriend's name is Steve.
What are the odds of that...?
Wait.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Give me this.
Oh, yeah, that'll
get it out.
Maybe you should
try club soda.
Ow. Damn it, it really hurts.
I need, like,
some ointment
or something.
What's this?
Spanish massage oil.
Spanish massage oil?
What happened here last night?
Last night got weird.
Feel the emotions release.
Think I just got over
being chunky in the ninth grade.
You're beautiful.
I am beautiful.
Experience your food.
Try the mango.
Okay, that's enough
of the fruit.
We're sorry, Ted.
It'll never happen again.
It meant
nothing to us.
It just felt really,
really, really good.
Oh! I can't even look
at you two right now.
Ted...
He got a tramp stamp.
All right, first of all,
this isn't one of those,
"I came all the way over here
because I want you back" things.
There'll be no startling
confession of love,
no sweet indie rock
song that swells up
just as we're about to kiss,
none of that crap. Got it?
Okay.
Good.
Now, here's the thing.
It sucks that you came
back from Argentina
with someone as
awesome as Gael.
And I know I have no
right to be upset at you.
We're broken up, life
goes on, whatever.
But you know what?
We-We never did this.
We-We had this
polite breakup
with no irrational
yelling, and...
and that's just wrong!
So, I'm going to yell
irrationally for a little while,
and you're just going
to have to stand there
and deal with it, okay?
If you feel like
you need to do that, then...
I think I do!
I really think I do!
So now I'm yelling!
You shaved.
I did!
I liked the beard.
I liked it, too, but it
was getting kind of hot!
Maybe in the winter,
I'll grow it back out!
Okay, I'm done.
I know it was weird
showing up with Gael.
I'm sorry.
Look, us breaking up...
it was the right thing.
But it took some time to
get over you, you know?
I- I'm still
getting over you.
But you? You were over it
the minute they started
the in-flight movie.
Over it?!
My first three days
in Argentina,
I cried my eyes out.
I missed you
so much.
I wanted to go
and prove how adventurous I am,
but the truth is...
it was really lonely.
And that's why Gael happened.
You weren't trying
to win the breakup?
I was trying to survive it.
Okay.
No.
See, look, that
all sounds good, and
we'll still be friends
and move on, but...
did he have to be so hot?
The guy's
an Adonis.
He's not an Adonis.
He's the Cadillac
of rebound guys.
Marshall has a
crush on him!
The guy's perfect.
He's not perfect.
Oh, come on.
He's hot, he wind surfs,
he massages things.
Name one way I'm
better than that guy.
You're bigger.
Don't patronize
me. If anything,
he may even be a
little bit taller.
No. Ted... you're bigger.
I win!
Kids, I can't remember exactly
what helped me get through
the whole Robin-Gael incident.
I'm sure that it was something
profound and meaningful,
and not at all macho and petty,
but after that,
I was back on my feet.
And what followed was a new era
in my life,a crazy time
unlike anything
that came before.
It's funny looking back
at those days,
knowing now exactly
what I was heading towards.
And what was heading
towards me.
Go for Barney.
Hey, man, it's Marshall.
Check your e-mail.
Sent you something.
What is it?
Just a new Web site.
Slapcountdown. com.
What does this mean?
M- Marshall?
Ma...
No.
}; before I could meet her.
And that story begins here.
Host: www.CsSubs.org - Thanks Guys
Alors, être marié,
ça change, ou pas ?
Quasiment pas. Sauf que je crois avoir
attrapé le syndrome du canal carpien.
J'ai une crampe qui part pas.
Je croyais que l'intérêt de se marier
était de ne plus avoir à faire ça.
Non, c'est à force d'écrire
toutes ces lettres de remerciements.
Surtout.
Ouais, tu écris constamment.
On a des formulaires à signer,
nos dossiers post-mortem,
des mots de remerciements.
C'est quoi les dossiers post-mortem ?
C'est un truc qu'il faut faire au cas
où un conjoint mourrait subitement.
Toutes les infos
dont le conjoint peut avoir besoin.
Tout au même endroit. Pratique.
Informations bancaires,
adresses importantes,
une lettre à l'autre personne.
Ce genre de choses.
Je vais prendre la prochaine tournée.
Je suis vraiment un idiot.
Ouais.
Attends. Pourquoi ?
Je ne savais pas que
j'étais censé écrire une lettre.
Tout ce que Lily va trouver,
c'est un tas de relevés bancaires
et des choses drôles
à faire de mes cendres.
- Un brownie au Marshall ?
- Numéro 6.
Mon Dieu, je suis un mauvais mari.
Non, je vais l'écrire ce soir.
- Tout ira bien.
- C'est vrai.
À moins que tu meures avant.
- Allez, ça n'arrivera pas.
- Non.
S'il y a une chose
qu'on peut affirmer avec certitude,
c'est que Marshall Eriksen ne va pas
mourir avant d'écrire cette lettre.
Pas moyen.
En fait, je défie Dieu
de châtier ce bien portant...
J'ai compris. Vous savez
que je suis un peu superstitieux,
et vous essayer de me foutre les jetons.
Devinez quoi ? Ça ne marche pas.
Vous n'êtes que des abrutis !

<i>Après notre rupture, Robin eut besoin
de s'éloigner quelque temps.<i>
<i>Loin de chez elle,<i>
<i>de sa vie, et en fin de compte,
d'elle-même.<i>
J'étais tellement
coincée à New York, vous voyez ?
Je veux dire,
ici tout le monde partage tout.
C'est comme si on était tous une grosse
balle chatoyante d'énergie positive.
Je me demande
si quelqu'un a déjà pensé ça avant.
Mange !
Si on manque de poissons,
j'irais en pécher avec mes mains.
Des percussions ! C'est différent
à chaque fois, allons voir !
Me voilà avec les percussions.
Tu es seins nus ?
- Ted, regarde ça !
- Déjà vu.
- On dirait que c'était un super voyage.
- Ça l'était.
J'ai l'impression
que la Robin qui est partie
n'est pas la Robin qui est revenue.
Il y a un tas de gens nus.
Tu n'as pas changé, Scherbatsky.
Tu es une sophistiquée, descendeuse
de whisky, fumeuse de cigares,
mangeuse de viande rouge,
fana d'armes, new-yorkaise.
Juste des chaussures et une chemise.
Sacré look !
Ce que tu n'es pas, c'est une masseuse,
planchiste, joueuse de bongo,
sobre, végétarienne, pacifiste, hippie,
comme ton futur ex Gael.
Soutiens-moi, Ted.
Le bonheur de Robin me ravit.
Merci.
C'est comme un "où est Charlie ?"
de l'appareil génital.
À part que c'est facile
de trouver Charlie.
J'ai évolué.
J'apprécie de vivre un peu plus comme
Gael et moi le faisions en Argentine.
Les histoires d'amour
de vacances ont une date d'expiration.
Gael a un autocollant
"encore meilleur baisé".
Une fois
que ta romance commence à puer,
tu le jetteras aux égoûts
comme du lait aigre
et redeviendras la Robin non évoluée.
Celle qu'on aime.
Soutiens-moi, Ted.
Le bonheur de Robin me ravit.
- Je te le dis, dans moins de 3 jours...
- Le voilà, parle avec des grands mots.
Dans 3 périodes solaires,
tu reconnaîtras ton manque
de compatibilité avec ton bien-aimé
et mettras un terme
à cette association.
Mon voyage était métamorphosant.
Et je réaffirme mon engagement
envers le susnommé bien-aimé
et la philosophie qu'il a épousée.
De quoi on parle ?
Base-ball ?
Tu réceptionneras tout ça
dans ton arrière-train.
Soutiens mon hypothèse, Ted.
La jubilation de mon ancienne bien-aimée
me fait jubiler.
<i>Ce soir-là, Marshall écrivit la lettre
qu'il souhaitait que Lily ne lise jamais</i>
<i>Ma chère et adorable Lily pad.</i>
<i>Que cette lettre soit un petit phare,</i>
<i>une petite luciole,</i>
<i>pour te guider
dans les années à venir.</i>
<i>Mon amour pour toi perdure,</i>
<i>plus haut que l'Himalaya,</i>
<i>plus profond qu'un lac écossais.</i>
<i>Si je meurs
dans des circonstances douteuses,</i>
<i>alors, fais attention.</i>
<i>Ne fais confiance à personne.</i>
<i>Pas même à Ted.</i>
<i>Surtout pas à Ted.</i>
<i>Sache que je serai
toujours là dans ton coeur,</i>
<i>quand tu auras besoin de moi. <i>
<i>Mon amour
pour toi ne s'éteindra jamais. <i>
<i>Tendrement,<i>
<i>ton Marshmallow.<i>

Ma planche à voile...
elle s'éloignait au large.
Et le requin...
se rapprochait.
On dit qu'il faut frapper
le requin dans le nez pour s'en sortir.
Mais j'ai dit : requin, mon frère,
on est tous les deux
des enfants de la Terre notre Mère.
Et c'est tout ce dont
je me souviens jusqu'à l'hôpital.
- Ce mec !
- Ouais !
Ce mec !
Regarde comme il est à l'aise.
Toi et moi, on doit se mettre
à l'envers pour avoir une femme...
Pour la mettre à l'envers.
Mais ce mec...
Chaque femme du bar est pendue
à ses moindres mots mal prononcés.
Et pourquoi ?
Il est plus beau que nous
Parce qu'il est étranger.
Un accent et un sourire innocent,
et t'as rien à faire.
Et puis, sortie automatique :
tu pars dans quelques jours...
J'aimerais qu'on soit touristes.
En fait...
tu sais
ce que j'ai toujours voulu visiter ?
On vient du sud de la France.
Notre avion part dimanche matin.
Salut, mesdemoiselles.
Désolés de vous déranger,
on est un peu perdus.
Savez-vous dans quelle rue
est la statue de la Liberté ?
En fait, elle est sur son île.
C'est vrai.
Merci beaucoup.
Mon nom est Ignatius Peabody Nobel,
de East Westerton, Missouri.
Et voici mon ami... Ted.
- Salut, je suis Colleen.
- Salut, Colleen.
- Elle, c'est Lindsay.
- Salut, Lindsay.
Vous avez été
incroyablement sympas avec nous.
- Que diriez-vous de... laisse tomber.
- Non, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Bien, on part dimanche matin.
Ç'aurait été sympa
que de vrais New-Yorkais nous guident.
On est prises, ce soir.
Mais, peut-être demain après-midi.
- Après manger ?
- Un hot-dog.
On se retrouve ici ?
En face du McLaren's Pub ?
C'est un bar un peu nul, mais d'accord.
Vraiment ?
Il m'a pas l'air si nul.
- Il est plutôt nul.
- Je le trouve cool.
À demain.
Ça a l'air d'un bar
où un tas de gens cool passe du temps.
C'est bon.
Alors, Gael ?
Ça marche toujours aussi fort ?
Oui, c'est super.
- Incroyable, fantastique, magnifique.
- C'est un de trop.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Maintenant que je suis rentrée,
ce que j'aimais, en vacances, m'agace.
Goûte.
Ressens ta nourriture.
Tellement bon.
Goûte.
Ressens ta nourriture.
Le canapé...
On est seuls, maintenant.
Je te veux.
Je te veux.
Portable, portable, portable !
Et tu sais quoi ?
Je trouve encore du sable, partout.
On n'est pas allés à la plage
depuis l'Argentine. D'où ça vient ?
Peut-être que tu redeviens
celle que tu étais avant ton voyage.
Mais, je ne veux pas.
J'étais si heureuse, là-bas.
Non, tu sais quoi ?
J'arrête de me plaindre.
J'évolue.
Je vais suivre le mouvement.
Gael, tu es en train d'uriner
pendant que je suis sous la douche.
L'ancienne Robin aurait dit :
"Eh mec, <i>ocupado</i>".
Mais maintenant,
ça ne me dérange pas. Fais pipi.
En fait, quand t'auras fini,
pourquoi ne pas venir me rejoindre ?
Ça ne te dérange pas, amour ?
Gael, y a un drôle de type...
- Bonjour.
- Bonne nouvelle.
J'ai fait de nouveaux amis et
ils restent avec nous, comment on dit...
indéfiniment.
Veux-tu signer
cette note de remerciements ?
Des deux côtés.
Tu as écrit des deux côtés de la carte
de remerciement pour mon 3e cousin.
Pour un mixeur
que t'as pas encore sorti de la boîte.
Il est super.
Si t'aimes tellement ce mixeur,
pourquoi tu l'épouses pas ?
Je ne peux pas, je t'ai épousé, toi.
C'est comme ça qu'on a eu le mixeur.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Rien, rien du tout.
Qu'est-ce qui pourrait ne pas aller ?
Sauf que quand tu vas mourir,
tes paroles réconfortantes seront :
"Annule l'abonnement à Vogue".
Comment as-tu pu ouvrir ma lettre ?
C'était pas une lettre.
C'était à peine un texto.
La prochaine fois que tu fais si court,
aie la gentillesse de le faire rimer.
Marshall, attends.
C'est notre première dispute
en tant que couple marié.
Oh, bébé.
<i>Les enfants,
quand on visite New York,</i>
<i>il y a d'innombrables choses amusantes
à voir et faire.</i>
<i>Pourtant, Colleen et Lindsay
nous ont emmenés à "Tater skinz".</i>
C'est notre restaurant préféré.
Oui, je suis sûr
que c'est le meilleur des 57...
établissements les plus sproutaculaires
de la côte Est.
- Je vais aller aux toilettes.
- Moi aussi.
C'est le rencard le plus facile
de tous les temps.
Tu sais ce que je vais essayer ?
Une blague "Toc-toc, qui est là ?"
On a dégoté les deux new-yorkaises
les plus nulles de tous les temps.
Mec, je te regarde, quoi?
Reste avec moi.
On est à la limite
de passer du statut d'étrangers
à celui d'immigrés dans leurs culottes.
D'accord, Ignatius, encore une heure.
Sympa.
Nos amis viennent de nous inviter
à une soirée. Vous voulez venir ?
Toc-toc ?
- Qui est là ?
- Oui, on veut.
Une annonce rapide :
je suis ravie que vous soyez là,
amis voyageurs.
Quelques règles, néanmoins.
Pas vraiment des règles,
appelons-les plutôt :
"consignes pour une vie harmonieuse".
"consigne
pour une vie harmonieuse" nº 1 :
l'évier, c'est pour les assiettes.
Pour le pipi, ce sont les toilettes.
C.P.V.H. nº 2 :
le cannabis est illégal aux États-Unis.
Même cuisiné dans un muffin au cassis
que quelqu'un pourrait manger,
par erreur, au petit déjeuner,
juste avant de partir pour leur boulot
de commentatrice télé.
Ceci car :
"Regardez ma main...
"quelle main bizarre..."
n'est pas une chose à dire en direct.
et nº 3...
et nº 3 : veuillez limiter le bruit
au maximum.
Je dois faire une sieste.
Je suis encore un peu pétée...
Tout est si lumineux.
Même pendant la nuit.
Je comprends
pourquoi cette ville ne dort jamais.
Si on va au Nord,
pourquoi on traverse le FDR,
on aurait dû prendre Hudson ?
Voilà qu'il connaît toutes les rues.
Quelqu'un a regardé
trop de rediffusions de Steinfeld.
Et on va où, en fait ?
Au coin de la 148
et de Brooke Avenue.
La cent... dans le sud du Bronx ?
À cette heure ?
On va se faire tuer.
Ted, je pense que ces new-yorkaises
connaissent mieux la ville que nous,
donc détends-toi.
On est entre des mains très compétentes.
Ils étaient trois.
Au moins deux revolvers.
Ils ont pris notre argent.
Enfin, juste nos chèques de voyage.
Salut, bébé.
J'ai repensé à notre dispute.
Je suis vraiment, vraiment...
surpris que tu ne te sois pas
encore excusée.
Tu veux vraiment ouvrir ce débat.
J'avais oublié,
tu ouvres toujours tout, même si
t'es pas censé le faire avant ma mort.
Tu sais que c'est important,
pourquoi t'écris pas la lettre ?
Parce que je ne supporte pas
l'idée de ne pas être avec toi.
Même pas le temps
de t'écrire une lettre idiote.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui, vraiment.
En plus, dès que je l'aurai écrite,
tu l'ouvriras pour la lire.
Je ne le ferai pas, promis.
Je t'écrirai une lettre
pour mon dossier post-mortem.
Ça te dérangerait pas d'y glisser
des trucs cochons, aussi ?
Écoute bien,
et si j'y mettais que des trucs cochons
et que j'y glissais des trucs cleans.
C'est toi la meilleure.
Et peut-être des Polaroïds ?
Allez, partons,
cette soirée est un désastre.
Quoi !
Ça n'aurait pas pu être mieux.
On a survécu à l'agression,
tu sais ce que ça signifie ?
- Le sexe "Dieu merci, on est vivants".
- Le sexe "Dieu merci, on est vivants".
Mieux que le sexe "j'en reviens pas
que tu veuilles m'épouser",
que je n'ai eu que 3 ou 4 fois.
Ted, s'il te plaît, on touche au but.
Ça marche. J'ai jamais autant
trimé pour quelque chose de ma vie.
Je pense qu'on a tous besoin
de rentrer chez nous pour récupérer.
Je veux fêter
le fait qu'on ait survécu.
Moi aussi, donc...
- vous habitez où ?
- Dans le West Village ?
Presque, à West Orange.
West Orange dans le New Jersey ?
Vous vivez dans le New Jersey,
pas à New York ?
Theodore.
- New Jersey ?
- Teddy.
Ne vous en faites pas,
c'est plus ou moins New York.
Le New Jersey n'est pas
plus ou moins New York.
Vous n'êtes pas plus ou moins
des new-yorkaises.
- Et t'en sais quoi ?
- Je vis ici !
Eh oui, je vis ici.
On vous a bobardées.
On s'est fait passer pour des touristes
pour coucher avec vous.
Mais vous savez ce qu'il y a de pire ?
Se prétendre New-Yorkais
quand on ne l'est pas.
C'est la meilleure ville au monde,
vous devez mériter le droit
de vous faire appeler New-Yorkaises.
Alors, pourquoi n'iriez-vous pas
ramper dans les évacuations
que vous appelez Holland Tunnel,
pour retourner comme des merdes
à "plus ou moins New York" ?
Parce que j'irais loin
pour pouvoir baiser,
mais je n'irai pas
dans le New Jersey !
Tu n'es pas du Missouri ?
Eh bien, je suis sur le c...
- D'accord.
- Vous pouvez nous ramener ?
Monsieur,
vous pourriez nous ramener aussi ?
Né et élevé à Newark.
Tu pourrais arrêter de faire du bruit ?
Que t'est-il arrivé, ma fille ?
T'as dit que tu changerais pas,
mais regarde-toi.
Plus de bronzage,
plus de petites tresses,
plus de forêts luxuriantes de poils
sous les aisselles et sur les jambes.
Tu t'es remis au boulot.
Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive ?
Il faut bien travailler.
"Il faut bien travailler".
C'est si américain.
Je suis canadienne, tu le sais bien.
Et les choses importantes, comme :
faire tes propres bijoux,
être étendue sur la plage
en pensant à la paix.
Mon Dieu, ça te fait rien
de ne pas penser à la paix ?
Eh bien,
je viens de réaliser un truc...
Que tu t'es égarée.
Que tu crains vraiment.
Tu es chiante, et nulle.
Et tu fous du sable partout.
Sérieux, d'où vient tout ce sable ?
Tu n'es pas la vraie moi.
Tu n'es que moi en vacances
essayant de fuir une rupture.
Tu te souviens pas de l'Argentine ?
Tu veux pas y retourner ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Laisse faire les choses.
OK, tout le monde dehors !
J'ai dit : tout le monde dehors !
On s'en va, OK !
Michael Moore disait vrai
sur les Américains.
Je suis canadienne !
Robin, ça va ?
Non, pas du tout.
Écoute, Gael,
il faut que je te parle.
<i>Après leur rupture,
Robin est redevenue Robin.</i>
Bienvenue à la maison, Scherbatsky.
C'est bon de revenir.
Mais c'est bizarre,
la Robin des vacances m'est encore
apparue en rêve, hier soir.
- J'écoute.
- Cette fois, on est allées au bout.
En tout cas,
elle est peut-être pleine de sable,
mais cette fille sait ce que j'aime.
J'ai fini.
Mais je veux vraiment pas
que tu la lises avant...
que quelque chose arrive.
- Tu me jures que tu l'ouvriras pas ?
- Je te le jure.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle dit ?
Marshall, je suis sérieuse.
Promis, je l'ouvrirai pas
avant ta mort.
<i>Après 22 merveilleuses années
de mariage, Marshall tint sa promesse.</i>
<i>Jusqu'au 1er novembre de
l'année dernière...</i>
<i>quand, malheureusement....</i>
<i>T'es fait !
Je savais que tu la lirais !</i>
<i>T'es nul, Marshall !
T'es trop nul !</i>
C'est tout ?
Je suis nul ?
- Lily...
- Oui, t'es nul.
T'as dit que tu la lirais pas,
et tu l'as lue.
T'as pas tenu ta promesse non plus,
je vois pas de photos coquines, là.
D'accord,
je vais faire les photos coquines.
Pas maintenant.
Et ça veut dire quoi, ça ?
Quoi ?
Rien, tu es magnifique.
J'aimerais les photos. Je t'ai déjà dit
combien tu étais belle !
different, not different?
married--
it's the same. mostly.
except i think i might
be getting carpal tunnel.
my hand keeps
cramping up.
i thought the whole point
of getting married was
that you didn't have
to do that anymore.
no, it's from writing
all the thank you notes.
mostly.
yeah.
you're writing
constantly.
there's forms we
have to sign,
our death folders,
thank you notes.
whoa, whoa.
what are death folders?
it's this thing they
recommend you do
in case one spouse
dies unexpectedly.
it's all
the information
your spouse might need
all in one convenient
location.
lily:
yeah.
account info,
important addresses,
a letter to the
other person.
all that stuff.
i'll get the next round.
thanks.
i am such a jerk.
yeah.
wait, why?
i didn't know that i was
supposed to write a letter.
all lily's gonna find
in that folder are a bunch
of bank statements
and a funny list of things to do
with my ashes.
marshall brownies.
number six.
yeah.
oh, god, i am a bad husband.
no, uh, no, i'll just write,
i'll write lily a letter
tonight, everything'll be fine.
that's right.
unless...
you die between
now and then.
ooh.
but...
come on, that's never
gonna happen.
yes!
if there's one thing
we can state
with absolute certainty
it's that marshall eriksen
is not going to die
before writing
that letter.
barney:
no way at all.
in fact, i dare god
to smite down this
perfectly healthy...
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
i get it.
okay, you guys know
i'm a little superstitious,
and you guys are trying
to freak me out.
well, guess what?
it didn't work.
so, there.
you guys are jerks!

<i>ted:
kids, after robin
and i broke up,</i>
<i>she needed some time away.</i>
<i>away from her normal home,
her normal life,</i>
<i>and it turns out,
her normal self.</i>
i was just so uptight
in new york, you know?
i mean down here everybody
shares everything.
it's like we're all one big
shimmering ball
of positive energy.
i wonder if anyone's ever
thought that before.
here.
eat.
if we run out of fish,
i will catch more
with my hands.
(drums playing)
a drum circle!
they're different
every time.
let's go watch!
and here i am
at the drum circle.
whoa, are you topless?
ted, check this out.
seen 'em.
wow, it seems
like a great trip.
oh, it was.
i feel like
the robin who left
is not the same robin
who came back, you know.
wow, there's a lot
of nude people in here.
you haven't changed,
scherbatsky.
you're a sophisticated,
scotch-swilling,
cigar-smoking,
red-meat-eating,
gun-toting new yorker.
just shoes
and a shirt.
that's a look.
what you are not is
a massage-giving,
windsurfing,
bongo-playing,
teetotaling, vegan,
peacenik, hippy
like you soon to be
ex-boyfriend, gael.
back me up here, ted.
i'm just happy
robin's happy.
thank you.
lily:
man,
this is like a
"where's waldo"
of exposed genitalia.
except that it's really
easy to find waldo.
i'm evolved...
and i'm enjoying
living my life
a little bit closer
to the way gael
and i did
in argentina.
please.
vacation romances have
an expiration date.
gael's got a "best if
banged by" sticker on him.
once your romance
starts to stink,
you'll dump his ass
down the drain
like sour milk
and go back to being
"unevolved robin,"
the one we actually like.
back me up here, ted.
i'm just happy
robin's happy.
i'm telling you,
within three days...
ooh, here he comes.
switched to big words.
within a triad
of solar periods,
you'll recognize your dearth
of compatibility
with your paramour
and conclude your association.
my journey
was transformative.
and i reassert
my commitment
to both
the aforementioned paramour
and the philosophies
he espouses.
what are we
talking of?
baseball?
this is all gonna return to
masticate you in the gluteals.
support my hypothesis, ted.
i'm just jubilant my former
paramour's jubilant.
to write the letter
<i>he hoped lily would never have
to read.</i>
"my dearest,
sweetest, lily pad.
"let this letter
be a small beacon,
"a tiny firefly
to help light your way
"through the years ahead.
"my love for you persists
"higher than
the himalayas.

"if i died under suspicious
circumstances,
"then beware.
"trust no one.
not even ted."
"especially not ted."
"know that i'll always
be there in your heart
"whenever you need me,
"and that my love for you

my windsurfing board...
it had floated away.
and the shark...
he was getting closer.
they say to escape
you punch a shark
in the nose.
but i said,
"brother shark,
we are both children
from the same
earth mother."
(sighs)
and that's all i remember
until the hospital.
that guy.
yeah.
that guy.
look at how easy
he has it.
you and me, we have
to bend over backwards
to get a woman to, well,
bend over backwards.
but that guy...
every woman in the bar
is hanging
on his every slightly
mispronounced word.
and why?
he's better
looking than us.
no.
because he's from
out of town.
mmm.
with and accent
and an innocent smile,
you don't even
have to try.
yeah.
plus automatic out,
you're leaving in
a couple of days.
god, i wish we
were tourists.
yeah.
actually...
you know where i've been
meaning to visit?
(camera shutter clicking)
okay, okay, we're
from a small town
in the south
of france.
our plane leaves
sunday morning.
(with southern accent):
uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies.
hate to bother you.
we seem to be
a little bit lost.
would you happen to know
which street
the statue
of liberty's on?
actually,
it's on its own island.
oh!
oh, it's right...
ah.
thank you very...
uh, my name is, uh,
ignatius peabody nobel.
from east westerton,
missouri.
and this is
my friend, ted.
hi, um, i'm colleen.
hi, colleen.
this is lindsay.
hi, lindsay.
so, hey,
you-you-you ladies,
been awful nice to us.
what do you say...
ah, never mind.
no...
no, what is it?
well...
it's just we're leaving
sunday morning.
it sure would be nice to
have some real new yorkers
show us around.
yeah.
well, we're busy
tonight, but...
maybe tomorrow
afternoon?
after lunch?
well, hotdog!
should we...
you want to just
meet here
in front of mac...
maclaren's pub?
it's kind of a
lame bar, but sure.
really? it doesn't
seem that lame to me.
it's pretty lame.
i think it's cool.
we'll see you
tomorrow.
barney:
all right.
i'm just saying it seems like
a kind of bar
a lot of cool people
would ng out at.
okay, all right.
so, gael, huh?
mmm.
still going strong?
yeah, it's great.
amazing, fantastic, awesome.
ooh, that's one too many.
what's going on?
well, now that i'm home,
i'm finding myself
getting annoyed
at things that i loved
on vacation.
here, taste.
experience your food.
oh.
so good.
here, taste.
experience your food.
ooh, sofa,
ooh, sofa.
sofa, sofa, oh.
(grunts)
ooh.
we're alone now.
i must have you.
(laughs)
(moans)
ooh.
i must have you.
laptop, laptop, laptop!
(sighs)
and you know
what else?
i'm still finding sand
everywhere.
i mean, we haven't been
to the beach since argentina.
where is all coming from?
well, maybe you're just
going back
to the person you were
before the trip.
but i don't want to.
i was so happy down there.
no, you know what?
i'm done complaining.
i'm evolving.
just gonna
go with the flow.
wow.
gael, you're peeing
while i'm in the shower.
okay.
<i>okay, old robin would have been
like, dude, ocupado.</i>
but now, you know what,
i'm cool with it.
pee it up.
in fact,
when you're done, why don't you
come in here and join me?
don't mind if i do, love.
(screams)
gael, there's some weird du...
hello.
hey!
good news!
i made some new traveling
friends today,
and they'll be staying with us,
how do you say...
indefinitely!
all:
g'day!
bp
ooh, here.
will you sign
this thank you note?
wow.
both sides.
you wrote on
both sides of a thank you note
to my third cousin
for a blender that you haven't
even taken out of the box.
wow, that's...
it's a really nice blender.
well, if you love
that blender so much,
why don't you just marry it.
i can't.
i married you.
that's how we go the blender.
what's wrong?
nothing.
nothing's wrong.
what could be wrong?
except that when you die
i'm gonna find out
that your parting words
to comfort me for all eternity
<i>were "cancel vogue."</i>
how can you
open my letter?
that was not a letter.
it was barely even
a text message.
next time you
write something
that short, at least have
the courtesy to make it rhyme.
marshall, wait.
this was our first fight
as a married couple.
oh, baby.
oh...
oh.
<i>kids, there are a thousand
amazing places you can find</i>
<i>only in new york city.</i>
<i>instead of any of those,</i>
<i>colleen and lindsay
took us here.</i>
<i>colleen:
this is our favorite restaurant</i>
in the city.
yes, i'm sure
this is the best
of their 57 "spudtacular"
east coast locations.
i'm going to run
to the restroom.
i'm gonna go, too.
(growls)
(ted groans, barney laughs)
this is the easiest date ever.
you know
what i'm gonna try next?
a knock, knock joke.
easiest?
somehow we have managed
to find the two lamest
new yorkers of all time.
ted, ted, ted.
dude,
i am looking at you.
what?
right.
stay with me.
we are on the cusp of moving
from out-of-towners
to in-their-pantsers.
ay-o.
all right,
ignatius,
one more hour.
nice.
nice. hey, nice.
hey...
hey, our friends
invited us to a party.
you guys want
to come along?
knock, knock.
who's there?
yes, we do.
(all laughing)
(cheering on television)
quick announcement.
i am
so glad that you're here,
fellow travelers.
a couple rules--
not even rules.
let's call them guidelines
for harmonious living.
guideline
for harmonious living
number one--
the kitchen sink is for dishes,
the toilet is for pee-pee.
g.f.h.l.
number two--
marijuana is illegal
in the united states,
even when baked
into a blueberry muffin
that someone might mistakenly
eat for breakfast
right before they leave for
their job as a tv newscaster.
"this just in:
look at my hand,
how weird is my hand?"
is not an appropriate thing
to say on the air.
and number three, i...
(all cheering)
and number three is please keep
the noise to a minimum.
i have to take a nap.
i'm still pretty baked.
(gasps)
everything's so bright,
even at night.
no wonder
the city never sleeps.
(barney and women laughing)
hey, if we're
going north,
why did we cross over the fdr?
we should have taken the hudson.
(scoffing):
now he knows
all the streets.
<i>someone's been watching
too many steinfeld reruns.</i>
(women laughing)
(laughs sarcastically)
where are we even going anyway?
148th and
brook avenue.
a hundred-- in the south bronx
at this time of night?
we're going to get killed.
ted, i think
these local new yorkers
know more about the city
than we do, so relax.
we're in very capable hands.
(siren wails)
there were three of them,
at least two guns--
they took all
oumoney.
well, i only had
traveler's checks.
hey, babe.
i've been thinking
about our fight.
yes?
i'm really, really...
surprised that you haven't
apologized to me yet.
wow, you really want
to open this up again.
oh, i forgot,
you open everything up,
even if you're not supposed to
until i'm dead.
you know that this
is important to me.
why won't you just
write the letter?
because i can't bear the
thought of not being with you,
not even for long enough
to write you a stupid letter.
really?
yes, really.
plus, i know
as soon as i write it,
you're just going to open
it up and read it again.
lily, i won't,
i promise.
okay.
i'll write you a letter
for my death folder.
do you mind, um,
maybe slipping
in a little bit of
dirty stuff, too?
i tell you what.
how about i make it
all dirty stuff
and slip in
a little clean stuff?
you're the best.
and maybe a
couple polaroids?
come on,
let's get out of here.
this night's a disaster.
what?!
this night couldn't
have gone any better.
we just survived
a mugging.
you know what
that means.
"thank god we're alive" sex.
"thank god we're
alive" sex.
it's even better
than "i can't believe you
just proposed to me" sex,
which i've only had,
like, four or five times.
ted, please, we
are so close.
all right, i'm in.
i've never worked this hard
for anything in my life.
whew!
wow, i think
we all need
to go back to our place
and recover.
yeah.
i just want
to celebrate
the fact that
we survived.
you know?
mm-hmm.
me, too.
so where do
you live?
what, west village?
close.
west orange.
west orange,
new jersey?
yeah.
you guys live in new jersey,
not new york?
theodore.
yep.
new jersey?
teddy.
yeah, but don't worry,
it's pretty much new york.
ted:
oh.
no.
oh, no.
oh, no.
new jersey is not
"pretty much new york."
you are not
"pretty much new yorkers."
and how would
you know?
because i live here.
that's right,
i live here.
yes, we're full of crap.
yes, we pretended
to be from out of town
so we could sleep with you
and leave in the morning.
but you know what's
even worse than that?
saying you're a new yorker
when you're not.
because this is the
greatest city in the world
and you have to earn the right
to call yourself a new yorker.
so why don't
you girls crawl
into the open sewer pipe
you call the holland tunnel
and flush yourselves back
to "pretty much new york"?
because i
will do a lot
to get laid,
but i am not going
to new jersey!
(huffs)
(in accent):
you're not from missouri?
well, i will be
a monkey's unc...
ew.
right.
can we get
a ride?
hey, um, sir,
can we get
a ride, too?
newark, born and raised.
(drumming)
(sighs)
can you please keep it down?
(sighs)
what happened to you, man?
you said you wouldn't
change, but look at you.
no more tan,
no more beaded braids,
no more lush,
untamed forest
of leg and armpit hair.
you're back
at work.
what gives?
well, i have
to have a job.
"i have to have a job."
god, that's so american.
i'm canadian.
you know that.
what about the important things
like making your own jewelry
and lying
on the beach
and thinking about peace?
god, don't
you care
about thinking about peace?
wow.
i just realized something.
that you've
lost your way.
no,
that you really suck.
you're boring and me
and you're getting sand
everywhere.
seriously, where is
all the sand coming from?
you're not the real me.
all you are is me on vacation
trying to get away
from a break-up.
don't you remember argentina?
don't you want
to go back?
what are you doing?
shh...
let this happen.
(robin gasps, drumming)
all right, everyone out.
i said everyone out!
(frustrated growl)
(drumming stops,
panicked shouting)
all right, we're leaving,
we're leaving, okay.
michael moore was so right
about americans.
i'm canadian!
robin,
you okay?
no, i'm not.
listen, gael,
i need to talk to you
about something.
<i>after they broke up,
robin went back to being robin.</i>
(sighs)
welcome home, scherbatsky.
oh, good to be back.
although it's weird.
vacation robin popped into
my dream again last night.
listening.
this time we went all the way.
tell you
one thing.
->1
wńw?
okay, i'm done..
but i really don't want you
reading this unless...
you know, something happens.
can you swear to me
you won't open it?
totally. what does it say?
marshall, i'm serious.
okay.
i promise i won't, i won't
open that until you're dead.
(quietly):
okay.
<i>and through 22 wonderful years
of marriage,</i>
<i>marshall kept his promise</i>
<i>until november 1 of last year
when, sadly...</i>
"busted! i knew
you'd read this.
you suck, marshall,
you totally suck."
that's it?
i suck?
lily.
yes, you suck.
you said you wouldn't read it
and you did.
well, you didn't keep
your promise either.
i don't see any dirty pictures
in here.
oh, fine,
i'll take the dirty pictures.
i don't want 'em now.
what is that supposed to mean?
what?!
nothing.
nothing.
you're beautiful.
i would love
the photos.
have i told you how
beautiful you look?

<i>Je sais que vous pensez avoir tout
entendu de l'époque d'avant votre mère.</i>
<i>Mais, il y a des histoires qu'on raconte,</i>
<i>et d'autres non.</i>
Oh mon Dieu ! Barney...
- Oh mon Dieu !
- Utilise des mots, Ted.
Barney, je suis sur le point
de tenter la ceinture.
- La ceinture ?
- Oui.
C'est impossible. T'étais ici
il y a moins d'une heure.
Ouais. Avantage Eriksen.
Te la pète pas.
Wimbledon dure une quinzaine.
Une quinzaine.
Les mots anglais sont trop cool.
Et leurs avocats portent des perruques.
Si je fais ça au boulot,
je passe pour un taré.
Bon, je suis prêt, allons-y.
- On peut pas. Tournoi.
- On était d'accord, je me suis habillé.
Trop de temps à te préparer.
De quoi tu parles ? Je me suis juste
coiffé façon sorti du lit.
Une heure et demie de gel, de tirage,
de mise en forme.
Et après, il se coiffe.
Ace !
Bon, on y va ou pas ?
- Vas-y, on arrive dans 5 min.
- Vraiment ?
Oui !
Je vais au bar, je commande
3 bières, vous avez 5 minutes.
Trois bières. Cinq minutes.
Merci de me prêter ces bottes.
Tu les as eues où ?
Un magasin dans le village
faisait une vente de folie.
Une vraie frénésie chaussuresque !
Je les ai vues d'abord !
T'es sur ma liste, salope !
Tant de questions !
D'abord : qu'arriverait-il à un type
qui viendrait en costume de botte ?
Tu es fantastique avec, Robin.
Elles sont pas
un peu hautes pour cette robe ?
C'est l'intérêt. Ça cache le fait
que j'ai pas rasé mes jambes.
Je suis une règle de pas-de-rasage
pour les trois premiers rendez-vous.
Il s'agit de self-control,
si je ne me rase pas,
je dois me tenir.
Pour info, ça n'a pas d'importance.
Les mecs veulent juste aller au but,
ils se fichent des herbes hautes.
- Stinson.
- Bon, les bières sont là.
<i>Ouais, on va pas venir.</i>
Allez, on était d'accord...
- Marshall a enlevé son pantalon ?
- Oui, pantalon retiré.
C'est Wimbledon,
j'ai besoin de la liberté et mobilité
que seuls les sous-vêtements offrent.
Bye-bye.
J'ai pas besoin d'amis.
Je vous ai, vous.
Vous êtes mes amis.
Des amis rafraîchissants.
Je parle à des bières.
Trudy.
Oh mon Dieu !
Je t'ai pas vu depuis...
Que j'ai couché avec toi
puis filé par la sortie de secours ?
C'était toi ?
Je plaisante.
J'étais complètement bourré...
ce soir-là.
Tout n'est pas pour moi.
J'allais t'appeler,
mais j'étais tellement gêné.
Tu étais gêné ?
Moi, je me disais : "j'aime bien ce type
et je file pas sa fenêtre !?"
Et j'ai oublié mes sous-vêtements.
C'était les tiens.
Je me disais bien que j'étais serré.
Je plaisante.
Je porte pas de sous-vêtements.
Des sous-vêtements féminins... souvent.
Non, je plaisante encore.
Je suis si contente de t'avoir retrouvé.
- Ouais, tu veux...
- Trudy ?
Impossible !
Oh mon Dieu ! Rachel, comment tu vas ?
Ted, voici Rachel.
Kappa Epsilon Gamma !
Heu, vous vous êtes
rencontrées en prison, hein ?
On était soeurs de confrérie.
Et meilleures amies pour la vie.
Pendant toute la 2e année.
Quand on se jetait pas
à la gorge de l'autre.
On était compétitives.
Mais, c'est derrière nous, tout ça.
Hé monsieur ! Hé monsieur !
Lâche la grappe de ma soeur !
On a tant de choses à rattraper.
- Tu vas au mariage de Stacy ?
- C'est annulé.
- Apparemment, il préfère les mecs.
- Non, encore !
Chères bières, que voulez-vous faire ?
Restez ici, ou allez
dans cet endroit : mon bidon !
Trudy et moi avons pris une table.
C'est bon
 j'allais partir de toute façon.
J'aimerais que tu restes.
Marre des couches-tôt,
je suis bien éveillé !
Je crois.
Sois cool.

Épisode 3 - Saison 3

T'es vaincu, mon vieux.
C'est parce que tu me perturbes.
Popol pendouille
depuis le troisième set !
Stinson.
J'ai un petit "problème".
Trudy est là.
Tu sais, celle de l'ananas.
Celle qui a mis de la craie
sur ta queue de billard
puis a filé
par la sortie de secours ? Respect !
Bref, tout se passait bien,
puis une amie s'est pointée.
Elles sont du genre compétitives.
Je crois que la nouvelle m'aime bien.
T'en as deux sur ta ligne de mire ?
- Je sais pas vers qui me tourner.
- <i>Prends la nouvelle.</i>
Faut toujours
se tourner vers le Dr Strangelove.
Quelle nouvelle ?
Deux filles semblent se battre pour Ted,
je crois...
Tu ne sais pas
de quoi tu parles, donne !
Elles sont amies ?
Oui. Non, j'en sais rien. Elles sont
de la même confrérie de fac.
C'est des Betas ?
Toutes des salopes !
Tu peux leur dire que je voulais
même pas entrer dans leur confrérie.
Ce sont des Kappas
et je crois que je peux en avoir une.
Je sais pas laquelle.
Si je me plante, je perds les deux.
D'accord, t'inquiète pas.
Je descends et je t'aide à voir ça.
Je croyais qu'on sortait pas ?
Je croyais que c'était le cas
pour ta saucisse-patates,
mais je crois
qu'on se plante tous les deux !
Règle un différend.
C'est voler si on sort avec le copain
d'une autre après leur rupture ?
- C'est très compliqué.
- Tu vois.
Il est d'accord avec moi.
Quelle voleuse d'homme !
Voleuse d'homme
de voleuse d'homme.
Quelqu'un devrait vous boucler !
T'es tellement drôle.
Je trouve que Ted est drôle.
Tu sais quoi,
je trouve que Ted est hilarant.
Je ne porterai plus jamais de costume.
- Allo.
- Je suis au bar. Ne regarde pas.
- Appelle-moi maman.
- Salut, maman.
Comment va le... colon de papa ?
N'importe quoi !
Bref, tu plais aux deux, fais ton choix.
T'es sûre ?
Bien sûr. Elles jouent
avec leur cheveux, touchent leurs bras.
Feu vert classique.
T'es catégorique ?
C'est tellement fascinant.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Après 18 heures
d'intervention, j'ai refermé.
Les deux filles viennent juste
de fêter leur deux ans.
Séparer des soeurs siamoises !
Ça doit procurer
un sentiment incroyable.
Exact. Mais les parents ne savent quoi
faire de leurs combinaisons à 4 jambes.
Tu es tellement drôle.
Catégorique !
Elles te veulent toutes les deux.
C'est une vente Clearence
et tu es les bottes, bébé.
- C'est Robin ! Bonne chance.
- Salut, maman.
C'est ma mère.
- Allo ?
- Amène-moi un rasoir !
Et la règle du pas-de-rasage ?
Qu'est-il arrivé à tes convictions ?
Retirées chirurgicalement
par le Dr Génial.
Je ne le ferai pas.
Le but du pas-de-rasage était...
S'il te plaît, il est vraiment mignon,
je l'aime bien,
et il a un accent britannique.
J'arrive.
Alors, ce copain de fac, qui l'a gagné ?
Aucune de nous. Il est parti.
Un an à l'étranger.
C'est vraiment dommage.
Il y avait...
ce truc qu'on voulait faire.
On allait le faire.
- On l'a jamais fait.
- Pourquoi ?
Qu'est-ce que vous n'avez jamais fait ?
- C'est trop gênant, dis-le.
- Dis-le, toi.
- Je m'en fiche si toi aussi.
- Je m'en fiche.
Tout le monde s'en fiche, dites-le !
Et si on lui disait ensemble ?
À trois...
Un...
Il a raison, c'est un doublé.
Deux...
Aucune ne laisse sa place. Impossible
de dire qui est la troisième roue.
Trois...
C'est un tricycle !
- Pas possible !
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- C'est un tricycle.
- Pas possible !
C'est un tricycle.
Autant le dire tout de suite. Les filles
des confréries sont des salopes.
Mets-le sur haut-parleur.
T'es en train de nous dire
que tu peux tenter la ceinture ?
Quelle ceinture ?
Barney et moi avons fait le pari
que le premier qui le fait
gagne la ceinture du championnat.
Donc, c'est une ceinture métaphorique,
c'est ça ?
Voici...
T'as acheté une ceinture ?
C'est vrai.
Elle est resplendissante.
Mais, on disait ça comme ça.
- On plaisantait.
- Je ne plaisante jamais.
Tu disais
que si je couchais avec la nana
de Days Of Our Lives, je serais le roi.
Eh bien !
Pourquoi on m'en a pas parlé ?
J'aurais pu concourir.
Si Lily meurt avant moi,
je pourrais enfourcher un tricycle.
Si je meurs,
je reviendrais hanter ton pénis.
Allez, aidez-moi,
qu'est-ce que je fais ?
Bon, Ted,
si tu tentes la ceinture,
le règlement veut
que je te pose ces questions.
Un : le total des âges des participants
est-il inférieur à 83 ?
Oui.
2 : le total des poids des participants
est-il inférieur à 181 kg ?
Oui.
Theodore Mosby.
- Paies-tu ces femmes ?
- Quoi ? Non !
Ted ?
Je dois y aller. Elles vont croire
que j'ai hérité du problème fictif
de mon père avec les WC.
Vous partez ?
Il se fait tard.
C'est vrai. Ce fut...
On pourrait peut-être aller écouter
ce CD de Wilco dont tu nous as parlé.
Super !
Je l'ai là-haut. Il est dans
mon appart, là-haut. Allons là-haut.
Pardon, où se trouve ton appart ?
C'est drôle. J'adore.
Tu devrais continuer à dire
des blagues dans mon appart, là-haut.
Scénario nº 12.
On a un terrible accident de voiture.
Tu meurs, je suis paralysé.
Deux infirmières sexy,
avec un pack de bières légères,
entrent dans ma chambre.
J'essaie de faire du morse
avec mes paupières.
S'il vous plaît, non.
J'aime feue ma femme.
Mais ce sont des professionnelles
et je me dis :
elles me sauvent peut-être la vie.
Bien, couche avec tes infirmières.
Ce soir, c'est monocycle pour toi.
Je l'ai déjà fait ce matin.
Je me suis enfilé
trois cappuccinos en t'attendant.
J'aurais bientôt
plus besoin de me raser,
les poils vont tomber par vibration.
Désolée, je peux pas partir.
Il peut pas voir mes jambes comme ça,
j'ai l'air d'une Turque lesbienne.
Il y a une pharmacie en face.
- Pour 20 $, vous m'achetez un rasoir ?
- Non, mais pour 50, c'est bon.
Attendez.
Ted m'envoie un texto.
On mente.
"On mente",
qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Ça veut dire qu'ils montent.
Où est mon pantalon ?
Je les ai.
Sympa, l'appart.
Ce sont tes colocs ?
Oui, mais ils ne sont pas là.
Ils sont ailleurs.
On est en toute intimité.
L'intimité, c'est essentiel quand on...
écoute de la musique.
Tu sais ce qu'il y d'essentiel
quand on écoute de la musique ?
La musique.
C'est hilarant. Tu es hilarante.
Je vais le chercher dans ma chambre.
Le CD est dans ma chambre.
Ma chambre.
On va essayer de rester sages.
Bien sûr, on ne peut rien promettre.
Ça va être génial.
- Qu'est-ce que vous faites là ? J'ai...
- On sait.
On sait. Bien joué.
C'est très impressionnant.
- Tope !
- Ouais, tope !
Ne sois pas grossier.
Vous devez sortir,
prenez la sortie de secours.
Non. L'autre jour, j'ai vu un pigeon
chier dessus et tout le truc...
s'est répandu.
Tu peux prendre notre chambre.
Tout ce dont j'ai besoin
pour classer l'affaire, c'est le CD.
Je ne peux pas permettre
à Ted de faire ça.
- Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
- Parce que la ceinture me revient.
Tu peux pas l'avoir avant moi.
Ce serait comme si
Jimmy Olsen capturait Lex Luthor
tandis que Superman regarde,
impuissant, depuis sa chambre.
Barney, t'as fait des trucs
bien plus crados que Ted.
T'es dégoûtant.
J'ai jamais chevauché un tricycle.
J'étais sur le point,
l'année dernière, j'étais si près.
Alors, mesdemoiselles.
Si on rendait cette fête
un peu plus horizontale.
Oh mon Dieu !
Mon nouveau tapis.
Quel désastre ! Prends le détachant,
je prends une serviette.
- OK.
- Je prends la caméra.
- Dehors !
- D'accord.
Laisse-moi résumer.
Tu veux me tri-bloquer ?
C'est tellement petit.
Comme si tu étais...
- Tom Petty.
- T'es Tom Petty.
Où est Lily ?
Je cherche encore le CD, donc...
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Je le savais. J'avais un pressentiment
sur cette fille, et j'avais raison.
Je les ai vues la première !
Tu viens d'entrer
dans ma liste, salope !
Je ne peux pas laisser
ma chambre à une voleuse de bottes.
Elle devrait être punie,
pas récompensée.
J'essaierais de lui donner
des fessées. Fais-le pour moi.
- Jamais.
- Et si je te rembourse les bottes ?
- Tarif plein.
- Fais comme chez toi.
Super. Prends-le.
Souhaitez-moi bonne chance.
- Oh mon Dieu !
- Quelle fille tu fais !
- Où est la mousse à raser ?
- Vous n'en aviez pas demandé.
C'était implicite. Qui achète
un rasoir sans mousse à raser ?
Qui ne s'épile pas pour un rencard ?
Qui n'aura pas de pourboire
à cause de son attitude ?
Voilà un conseil pour vous :
Rasez-vous les jambes
avant de sortir, Demis Roussos.
Le voiturier a ramené la voiture.
On pourrait aller chez moi.
- Tu veux un dernier verre ?
- Absolument.
Je dois juste aller aux toilettes.
J'ai une P.V.
Petite Vessie.
Je te retrouve devant.
Mon Dieu.
C'est pas possible.
Excusez-moi.
Mon Dieu !
J'ai du mal à retrouver le CD.
Ça fait rien.
On a pas besoin de musique.
- Amusons-nous.
- Exactement.
Tu aimes t'amuser ?
N'est-ce pas, Ted ?
Il se fait tard,
je vous ramène vos vestes.
Je vous ramène vos vestes ?
Je sais pas pourquoi j'ai dit ça.
Je voulais tout le contraire.
Je voulais leur enlever
des vêtements, pas en rajouter.
Tu gâches tout pour tout le monde.
Laissez-le tranquille.
Parfois, même le meilleur guerrier
se tire une balle dans le pied.
De quoi tu parles ?
Pour info,
c'est pas un mauvais usage de l'alcool
qui m'a empêché
de conduire le tricycle ce soir-là.
Alors, Barney,
si on rendait cette fête un peu plus...
horizontale.
Oh non ! La soirée est foutue !
Mais non, chéri.
Si, les promesses de cette soirée
sont à l'eau. Où est ma veste ?
Pourquoi te ferais-tu ça ?
Parce que tu te réveilles
dans la tête, mec.
Tu penses :
"je peux pas le faire",
ça fait 2 femmes, c'est 2 fois plus
de choses, 4 pour certaines choses.
Rien que la logistique peut faire
flipper un pro de ma trempe.
Si un dégénéré complet
comme Barney a flippé,
quelles sont mes chances ?
La meilleure chance au monde.
La peur m'a pris la ceinture,
la peur a conduit le tricycle,
ce soir-là, mes amis.
Mais la peur ne gagnera pas,
cette fois-ci.
- Elle gagnera pas ?
- Non.
Car je réalise maintenant que mon destin
n'est pas de gagner la ceinture,
mon destin est...
d'aider mon ami à la gagner.
Ted est destiné à y passer en premier.
C'est notre Neil Armstrong.
En combinaison, Ted,
car tu vas sur la Lune.
Première étape.
Mesdemoiselles,
j'ai pas trouvé vos vestes,
mais j'ai trouvé...
de la tequila.
Attends. Une télécommande
pour la cheminée ? On en a pas.
C'est vrai, c'est chez moi, ça.
Le peignoir est à moi, aussi.
Merde, ça devrait être moi !
Bref, continuons.
Je suis tellement crevée.
Très crevée.
Attends. Pourquoi les épuiser ?
C'est ton excuse menant au prétexte
pour le contact physique Nº 1.
Tu fais le meilleur...
massage des pieds.
C'est parce que j'en faisais
souvent à ma grand-mère.
Pourquoi est-ce que je dirais ça ?
C'est mignon, tu es attentionné.
Ne jamais omettre
les valeurs familiales.
Étape 3.
Ted, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Je pense à ce documentaire
que j'ai vu une fois.
Une histoire de super volcan.
Mais c'est quoi ça ?
Attends...
Ça peut arriver n'importe quand.
Éradiquer la vie sur Terre.
C'est pourquoi je vis
selon cette simple philosophie :
Ne pas reporter le plaisir.
Oh mon Dieu.
C'est tellement vrai.
L'approche de la mort.
C'est pas mal.
- Je peux le faire.
- Bien sûr.
J'en reviens pas de le dire,
mais je suis vraiment émue.
Venez là.
OK.
On se voit de l'autre côté.
Alors, et après ? Tu l'as fait ?
Je crois pas
que ce soit bien d'en parler.
Quoi ?
Non ! Dis-moi.
Ne me le dis pas, ça sert à rien
parce que tu l'as pas fait.
Tu l'as pas fait.
Tu l'as fait.
Tu l'as fait, non ? Hein ?
Tu l'as pas fait. Si, tu l'as fait.
Tu l'as fait. Non, tu...
Dis-le-moi !
Y a des histoires qu'on raconte,
et d'autres non.
Parce que tu l'as pas fait.
Il l'a pas fait.
Tu l'as fait...
Dis-moi !
Ted, la ceinture...
Alors, oui ou non ?
Tu l'as fait ?
S'il te plaît, dis-le-moi.
Pourriez-vous voir
si mon amie va bien ?
Pas de problème.
Il n'y a personne, mais...
la fenêtre est ouverte.
J'imagine
que je devrais pas être si surpris,
elle a agi étrangement
toute la soirée, non ?
Vous savez...
et si je vous payais un verre ?
J'ai cru entendre
que vous étiez chirurgien, non ?
Je plaide coupable.
Vous êtes si drôle.
Je suis là, je vais bien.
Ma tête saigne.
Encore dans les vapes.
kids I know you think you have ever heard of a story
<i>from back before I met your mother,</i>
 but there are some stories you tell
<i>|| and some stories you don't.</i>
(breathless): Oh, my God!...
(s||aking gibberish) Oh, my God...
Use your words, Ted.
Okay. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.
||The||belt?
||The belt.
||But that's impossib||.
You were up here less than half a||hour ago.
(grunts)
||runts)
(groans) Yes! Advantage-- Ericksen.
Don't get cocky. Wimbledon ||sts a fortnight.
|| "Fortnight."
|| British words are so cool.
|| ||Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs?
I wear a wig to work, I'm a jackass.
|| TED: ||l right.
I'm We can't go. Tournament.
|||| What? We agreed. I suited up...
|| You take too long to get r||dy.
|| What are you talking about?
||I got the low maintenance, just-rolled-||t-of-bed look.
Yeah, which takes an h||r and a half
of waxing, tugging and teas||g to achieve.
|||||| And then he starts on his hair.
Ac|| ||(feigned laughter)
|| Look, are we ||going or not?
Just go without us. We'll be there in five minutes.
Really?
Yes! Yes!
|| All right, I'm going down to the bar.
|| I'm ordering three beers||
||I'll see you guys in five mi||tes.
Three beers, five minutes.
|| Wii AN||UNCER: Love-30! (door closes)
Thanks for lending me these boots.
|| Where'd you get them from?
This sto|| in the Village had one of those crazy sales.
It was a footwear ||feeding frenzy.
|||| (shrieking and shouting)
|| I saw it f||st!
|| (screams)||
You just made the list, bitch!
So many questions.||
Firstly, w||t do you think would happen
if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?
|| You look fantastic in them, Robin.
But don't you think they're a little high for that dress?
|| Well, that's the po||t: it's to hide that||act
|| that I h||en't shaved my legs.
|| I've begun a strict no-shave policy
|||| ||for the first three dates.
It's all about self-control.
If I don't shave, I mu|| behave.
|| FYI: It doesn't matter, baby.
Guys just want to get ||on the green.
They don|'t mind going through the rough.
|| Shh-clackey! (phone ringing)
Stinson.
All right, the beers are here.
|| BARNEY:||Yeah, we're not go to make it.
Oh, come on! We agreed...
|| Did Marshall take his pants off?
Yeah, pants are off.
This is Wimble||n, Ted.
|| I need the freedom and mobility that only underwear can provide.
|||||||| Cheerio!
|| Fine.
I don't need friends.
|| I got you guys.
|||| You guys are my friends,
mI'm talking to beer.iends.||||||
Ted? Trudy.
<i>|||| Trudy.</i>
Oh, my God. I haven't seen you since...
|||| (moaning ecstatically)
|| I slept with||ou and then climbed down the fire es||pe.
That was you?
I'm kidding. I was super-wasted.
|||||| These are not all for me.
|| No, I was going to call you, but I was so embarrassed.
|| You were embarrassed?
I was like, "I really like this guy,
"and now I'm ||imbing out his window,
|| ||and I forgot my underwear..."
|| God, I thought they felt kind of tight.
I'm ki||ing. I don't wear underwear.||
|| Ladies' underwear.
|||| Often.
Ah! Again, I'm ||dding.
|| I'm so glad I ran into you.
I know. Do you want to...? Trudy?!
|| No way!
|| ||Oh, my God! Rachel, how ||e you?
|| (both shrieking and laughi||)
|| Ted, this is Rachel.
Hi!||
Kappa Epsilon Gamma! Kappa Epsilon Gamma!
|||| Whoo! Whoo!
Wait, let me guess. You guys met in ||ison.
|| (laughing)
No! We were ||rority sisters.
And best friends forever all sophomore year.
|||| When we weren't at each other's throats.
We could be so competitive.
||Uh, but that's all behind us now.
|| (chanting): Hey, m||ta! Hey, mista!
|||| Stay away from m||sista! Stay away from my sista!
|| Whoo! Whoo!
|| We have so||uch catching up to do.
Okay. Are you going to Stacey's wedding?||
Oh, it's off. Apparently, he's into dudes.
Nah! Again|| That's like her third one.
TRUDY: I kn||!
|| Well, beers, what do you want to do?
We could stay here...
|||| or I know this o||er place called "My Belly."
|||| So, Trudy and I got a table.
Oh, that'||s cool. I was going to get out of here anyway.
|||| I'm really t||ed.
I want you to stay.
|||| Tired of people who fold early, 'cause I am wide awake!
|||||||| (giggl||)
|| Okay, gu||... be cool.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
||You've been vanquished, old bean.
That's 'cause you distracted me.
You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.
(phone rings)
||... Stinson.
I've got a situation.
Trudy is here-- you know, from the pineapple inc||ent?
||Oh, you mean the girl that chalked your pool cue
and then snuck down ||e fire escape?
Respect.
||So, we're hitting it off and then her f||end shows up
and they're kind of compet||ive.||
I think the new girl's kind of into me.
<i>So you now have two on the line?</i>
And I don't know which one to go for.
Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove.
New girl? Wh|| new girl?
Two girls are allegedly vying
for Ted's affections, and I think...
Oh, you don'||kn|| what you'|| talking about.
Give it to me.
||Are they friends?
Yeah. Uh, no-- I-I d||'t know. ||They're old sorority sisters.
||Are they Betas?
BecI didn't want to beuts, andin their sorority anyway.now||
||||They're Kappas, and...
||||||I think I can score ||th one of them.
||don't know which one,
||and if I chose wrong, I lose them both.
||Okay, well, don't worry.
I'll-I'll come down and help you figure it out.
||I thought we were in ||for the evening?
That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there,
but I guess we're both wrong, guv'na.
||Hey. Oh||Ted. Okay...||
Settle an argument. Mm-hmm.
Is it stealing if you go out with someone's boyfriend
<i>after they've broken up?</i>
Well, that's very complicated...
||||See?! || agrees wi|| me.
||||||u're||uch a li||le man||hief.
||||Oh, somebody should lock you girls up.|||
||||(giggling)
You're so funny.
I think Ted || funny.
<i>||Really? I think Ted is hilarious.</i>
||||||(phone rings) I am never not wearing a suit again.
||||||Hello?
It's me. I'm at t|| bar.
Don'||t lo||. Just call me "Mom."
Uh, hey, Mom. How's Dad's... colon?
||||||What? What's the matter with you?
Anyway, both of these girls are into you; take your pick.
||They are? Are you ||re|| Yes, of course.
|||||| They're playing with their hair and touching your arm.
|| Classic green light.
Are you positive?
<i>||Oh, that is so fascinating.</i>
|||| So what happened?
Well, after 18 hours of surgery,
|| I closed, and, thankfully,
|| both girls just celebrated their second birthday.
Wow. Gosh, separating conjoined twins,
|||| that must be the most amazing feeling.
|||| True, but now the parents don't ||ow what to do
|| with their huge supply of four-legged overalls.
<i>|| (laugh...||That is so funny.</i>
|| You're so funny.
|| LILY|| Positive. They both want you bad.||
|| It's a clearance sale ||and you're the boots, ba||.
|||| Oh, it's Robi|| Good luck.
|| Bye, Mom.
|| ||That'||my mom.
Hello?
||Bring me a razor.|| What about the no-shave ||le?
What happened to your conv||tions?
|| They've been surgically removed||by Dr.
||||No, I'm not doing it.
The whole point to not shaving was to...
Lily, please! He's really cute,

I'm on my way.
So this college boyfriend, ||who won h

Why? Wai|| what were you guys going to do but never did?
|| No, it'||s too embarrassing.
You tell him. No, you tell him.
No, I don't care if y|| don't care.

Nobody cares! Just say it.

|| It's a tricycle.
|||||| Well, I'll just say it right now.
|| All ||rority girls are sluts.
|||| Put him on speaker.
||So what you're saying to us right now
is that you have a ||ot at the belt?
|| Wait-wait-wa||. What belt?
Well, Barney and I have
this running joke that the first gu||to actually pull this off
would "win" the championship belt.
|| Oh, so it's a me||phorical belt, right?
*******
|||| You actually bought a belt....||||
That's right. It'||resplendent.
Come on, it was just a thing we said.
|| We were kidding ar||nd.
|| I never kid.
Remember you said if I e||r slept with that girl
<i>from Days of Our Lives, I'd be the king?</i>
Well...
|| Why wasn't I told about the ||lt?
I could go for the belt.
(Barney, Lily, Ted laugh)
|||| If Lily would've died before me, then I could ride the tricycle.
|||| Guys, come on! Help me out.e back aWhat do I do? penis.||||
All right, Ted, if you're going to go for the belt,
|| then t|| bylaws require me to ask the following questions:
One: Is the aggregate age of all participants under 83?
|||| Yes.
Two: Is the aggregate weight of all participants
|| under 400 pounds?
|||| Yes.
Theodore Mosby...

Lily, I have pounded three cappuc||nos waiting for you.
Pretty soon, I won't have to shave--
the hair is going to vibrate off my legs.
I'm sorry, I can't leave now.
Lily, he can'||t see my legs like t||s.
|| I look like a Turkish lesbian.
|| There's, um, a pharmacy across||he street.
|||||||| Would 20 b||ks buy me a razor?
No, but 50 will.

|| Ooh! Nice ||||e.
Hey, are these your roommates?
Yes. Uh, yes, but they are not here.

I'll go get it in my bedr||m.

The other day I saw ||a pigeon take a ap on it
and the whole thing shifted.
Oh, you can use our bedroom.
Okay, all I need to seal the deal
is the Wilco CD, Barney.
|| (gasping)
|| What are you doing?!
|| I cannot allow Ted to do this.
|||| Wh-what? Why?
Because the belt is my birthright!
||You cannot claim it before I do.
|| That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luth||

But, B||ney, you|'ve done||||way dirtier

I've never ridden the tricycle.

Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me!
|| No, never.
Wh|| if I reimburse you for the boot|| full retail?
|||| Please enjoy||ur bedroom. Great.
Just take it.
Okay, wish me luck.
|||||||||| Oh, my God. It looks fine.
You're such a girl.
Where's the shaving cream?
||ll, you didn't ask me for shaving cream.
|||| Well, it w|| implied.
Who bu|| a razor without buying||having cream?
Well, who doesn't shave their legs for a date?
||Well, who's not ge||ing a tip because of her attitude?
Well, here's a little tip for you:
shave ||ur legs before you leave the house, Sasquatch.
|||||||| Hey, Robin, um, the valet's brought the car ||ound.
|||| I thought we'd go to my place,
if you're in the mood for a nightcap.
Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies' room.

|| I'll meet you out front.
Yeah.

|||||||||||||||||||||||||| So, I'm having a little ||trouble finding the CD.

|||||||| It|'s getting late. I'll get your coats.
|||||| "I'll get your coats"?!
|| I don't know why I said that|| Why'd I say that?
|| It's the opposite of what I meant.
|| I wanna take clothes off them, not put more on.
Ted, you're ruining this for ever||ne.
|| Leave him alone!
|| Sometimes even
the greatest warriors shoot them||lves in the foot.
|||| What are you talking about?
If you must know, it wasn't a freak beverage malfunction

||So, Barney, why don't we

|||||||| (heart pounding)
|||||||||| Oh, no, the night's ruined!
|||||| No, baby, it's not.
Ye|| it is! Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined.
||||Where's my coat?
|| Why would you do that to yourself?
Because you get up in your head, man.
Yo||start thinking,
"I can't do this. It's two women."
|| That's two of everything, four of some things.
The ||gistics alon||are enough to cripple even a pro like me.
Se|| if a complete degenerate like Barney choked,
what chance do I have?
|| The best chance in the world.
|||||||||||| ||Fear took the belt from me.
|||||||| Fear rode th||tricycle that night, my friends.
|||||| ||But fear will not get a second turn.
|| It won't? No.

Step||ne.

Wait, wait, wait, a remote control fireplace?
We don't ha|| a remote control fireplace.
Right, that's my apartment.

Damn, this should be me.
Anyway, continuing...
(music playing)

||I am so exha||ted.
So exhausted.
Wait, why would I want to tire them out?
|| That's your excuse to unleash pretext
for physical contact #1.
Oh, you give the mo|| a||zing foot massage.
|||||| That's 'cause I used to practice
all the time on my grandmother.

<i>C'ťtait samedi soir ŗ New York,</i>
<i>et les jeunes
mťtropolitains ťtaient de sortie,</i>
<i>vivant un mode de vie
propre ŗ Big Apple.</i>
97.
98.
99.
100 ! On n'en avait eu que
82 pendant notre lune de miel.
Robin, je t'ai trouvť un mec.
Il est mignon, drŰle, intelligent.
- C'est quoi son "mais" ?
- Comment Áa ?
Quand quelqu'un essaie de te caser,
il commence par ses qualitťs,
mais il oublie son plus gros dťfaut.
Elle est vraiment sexy,
et vraiment drŰle.
<i>Mais elle a une dent morte.</i>
Elle est super sexy,
et tellement brillante.
<i>Mais elle a un chien
qu'elle trimballe en poussette.</i>
Elle est si mignonne, si intelligente.
<i>Mais son dernier copain a dŻ obtenir
une ordonnace contre elle.</i>
<i>puis son chat
et son nouvel aspirateur ont disparu.</i>
Arrange-moi Áa.
Je suis toujours convaincu
qu'elle a tuť ma tortue.
Vous savez quoi ? Tous
les coups arrangťs n'ont pas de "mais".
Par exemple, Jamie,
cette fille que Lily t'a prťsentťe ?
- Elle ťtait gentille.
- De mťmoire, elle avait un gros "mais".
Son gros cul.
«a, c'est dit !
Il n'y a rien qui cloche chez lui.
Il est vraiment bien.
- Et vraiment mignon.
- Mais ?
D'accord.
Mais, il a un enfant.
On y est ! Robin ne sortira
jamais avec un gars qui a un gosse.
Mais ce type est vraiment bien,
et son fils est adorable.
- Il est dans ma classe.
- Peu importe, Robin dťteste les gosses.
Je dťteste pas les gosses !
Tu m'as dit que mÍme enfant,
tu dťtestais les enfants.
Robin, tu veux regarder
les dessins animťs avec moi ?
Je vais ŗ l'ťcole toute la semaine.
Je peux pas avoir
juste 5 minutes pour moi ?
Lire "Highlights" et boire mon jus ?
D'accord, les enfant ne sont pas
ce que je prťfŤre au monde,
mais je les aime bien.
Mais tu veux pas en avoir.
J'aime les voitures de sport, je veux pas
voir une ferrari sortir de mon vagin !
Bien vu.
Tu ne peux pas nous en vouloir de
penser que l'enfant sera un problŤme.
Si on ťtait pote avec Garfield,
on lui filerait pas de rencard un lundi.
Marrant !
L'enfant n'est pas un problŤme.
- Je veux rencontrer ce mec.
- OK, c'est gťnial.
Quel est mon "mais" ?
Vous savez,
je suis vraiment sympa, mais...
<i>Mais elle a peur de s'engager.</i>
<i>Mais elle est fana des armes.</i>
<i>Mais elle est canadienne.</i>
<i>Mais elle a pas aimť
"Jusqu'au bout du rÍve".</i>
- Je ne trouve pas...
- Tu n'as pas de "mais".

Je les ai. Tiens.
Mets ce bandeau.
- Pourquoi ?
- L'ultime briseur de glace !
Un tas de cobras
se sont perdus dans Central park.
Toi et moi, on fait du jogging.
On s'entraÓne pour
le marathon du Death Valley Iron Man.
Rien de mťchant,
on le fait tous les ans.
Soudain,
on voit ces enfoirťs de serpents,
rampant vers un petit bťbť.
Pas sous notre surveillance !
Tu t'empares du gosse,
j'ťtrangle 6 cobras ŗ mains nues.
Femmes de New York,
une ŗ la fois, s'il vous plaÓt.
Et c'est pour quoi le bandeau ?
On s'est fait mordre.
L'oeil ?
Oui.
Tous les deux ?
Ce sont deux yeux diffťrents.
Je ne vois pas pourquoi Áa te gÍne.
En bandeau !
<i>Robin est allťe
ŗ son rencard avec George.</i>
<i>Le mec avec le gosse.</i>
<i>Et ensuite...</i>
Voilŗ le truc.
George est un mec super,
le rencard ťtait merveilleux.
Mais ?
Super.
Je suis impatiente de le rencontrer.
Impatiente de le rencontrer ?
Pourquoi j'ai dit Áa ?
Je ne veux pas rencontrer ce gosse.
Tu le rencontreras tŰt ou tard.
J'espťrais plus tard.
Genre dans 20 ans.
Quand je serai une panthŤre,
et lui sera aussi beau que son pŤre.
C'est quoi le problŤme? C'est juste
un enfant. Il ne va pas te mordre.
En fait, il pourrait mordre.
On travaille dessus.
Pourquoi il a son fils ?
Il devrait pas Ítre avec sa mŤre?
Quel genre d'avocat il a ? Il doit
s'occuper du gamin tout le temps.
- Un bon, il a obtenu la garde complŤte.
- Il a obtenu?
Obtenu ?
Oh mon dieu. Obetenir la garde
c'est gagner, c'est Áa?
Ne dis ŗ personne que j'ai dit Áa.
Je sors acheter des bandeaux.
Tu fais quoi pour qu'on
se tape des nanas ?
Les gens avec un vrai jeu
n'ont pas besoin de bandeaux.
Theodore.
Non, non, non.
Tu ne peux pas ťpeler "Jeu" sans je.
Et JE dťtiens le meilleur jeu.
Oui, j'ai tellement de jeu
que je suis le roi du jeu.
Ah ? Et moi, je suis le commissaire
au jeu de New York.
Moi, je suis le "Jeu interdit",
celui de Renť Clťment
avec Brigitte Fossey.
Vous Ítes lŗ.
Et pas dans les toilettes.
Oui et alors?
J'ai peut-Ítre fait
des commentaires ťrotiques ŗ un homme
portant les mÍmes chaussures que toi.
- Marshall ?
- Oui.
Lequel de nous deux a le plus de jeu?
Aucun de vous n'a du jeu.
Sans quoi vous seriez mariťs.
Comme moi.
Quoi ?
Si les rencards sont le jeu, alors
le mariage, c'est la victoire.
Oui, si tu joues dans le ligue fťminine.
Tu rigoles !
J'ai un jeu de dingue, poto.
De un : on ťtait d'accord
de ne plus jamais dire poto.
C'ťtait un bonne semaine. On s'est
bien amusť, mais c'est fini.
Deux : Áa fait onze ans que
tu es avec Lilly.
Ton idťe d'un bon jeu, c'est...
mettre une claque au Dr Seuss
et obtenir deux tickets
pour un concert des Spin doctors.
Dťsolť de le dire,
mais tu es hors concours.
Je ne suis pas hors concours.
Je connais des tonnes de choses.
Je peux vous aider les gars.
Et je ne veux pas
Ítre laissť de cotť.
Ted, tu n'as pas plus de jeu que moi.
Rien que dans les chiffres, je gagne.
- Tu as vu ma liste.
- Vous voulez une de mes rťpliques ?
J'avais jamais demandť
ŗ voir cette liste.
et j'en suis toujours horrifiť.
Et le vrai jeu
concerne la qualitť et non la quantitť.
Une fille de qualitť me choisirait, moi.
Es-tu mannequin?
Elle est bonne celle-lŗ. C'est flatteur.
Ted, je te mets au dťfi.
dans une olympiade
de ramassage de filles.
26 ťvťnements sur 11 semaines,
on ira dans un ville neutre
oý un panel de jury international...
Si on choisissaitt une fille
pour voir qui gagne ?
C'est bien aussi.
Pourquoi pas elle ?
Pari tenu.
Avant de commencer,
notons quelques rŤgles de base.
Nį 1: pas de bandeau,
cannes, ou tout autre...
Une fois, j'ťtais avec cette fille,
j'ai tentť la rťplique du mannequin,
j'ai eu droit ŗ caresser
ses seins au dessus du pull.
dans le public d'un show tťlť.
ArrÍte ! Tu dťprimes tout le monde.
Nį2 :
ce pari est d'un million de dollars.
- J'ai gagnť.
- Comment ?
Oh, j'ai couchť avec elle.
Il y a un an environ. J'avais oubliť.
«a ne compte pas.
Le pari a commencť
au moment oý on a topť.
Je ne peux pas recoucher avec elle.
Elle me dťteste.
Intťressant. Regardez qui vient de
prendre la tÍte de la course.
T'es hors de course, je peux
prendre mon temps.
Elle s'en va.
Hors de mon chemin.
D'aprŤs ces chaussures,
voilŗ ton copain des toilettes.
Regarde qui a du jeu.
Tu aimes les enfants, alors?
La plus grande fan.
Je pense
que les enfant sont vraiment gťniaux.
En particulier, les petits...
tu sais les...
rondelets, ne sachant pas
tenir debout, sans dents.
- Tu veux dire les bťbťs.
- Oui, j'aime bien ceux-lŗ.
Doug a presque 6 ans...
6 ans, c'est super.
Tu vas adorer.
ņ 6 ans, ils commencent vraiment ŗ...
Je dťteste les enfants.
- Pardon ?
- Enfin, je les dťteste pas.
Je suis pas fana, c'est tout.
Ils sont mignons
avec leur petites chaussures,
mais ŗ part Áa, quel intťrÍt ?
Tu dois me prendre pour une folle.
Non, t'aimes pas les enfants, et alors ?
Je ne cherche pas une mŤre pour Doug.
Attendons avant que tu ne le rencontres.
Ouais.
Allons lentement.
<i>Et c'est exactement ce qu'elle a fait.</i>
<i>Puis un tout autre jour,
pas du tout le lendemain,</i>
<i>tante Robin dŻ faire face
ŗ sa pire crainte.</i>
- Salut, quoi de neuf ?
- C'est lŗ, Lily.
«a me regarde.
- Un gosse, je fais quoi ?
- Parle-lui, tu peux le faire.
T'es qui ?
- Je suis Robin.
- C'est un nom d'oiseau.
Non, c'est une sorte d'oiseau.
Mon copain Patrick a un perroquet
qui s'appelle Robin, na !
- T'es celui qui parle en morse ?
- Je lis mon journal, lŗ.
- Alors...
- Bip...
J'ai faim. Tu me fais des cťrťales ?
Bien sŻr.
Faut mettre le lait en premier !
Non, d'abord les cťrťales pour savoir
combien il faut mettre de lait.
C'est meilleur avec le lait en premier.
«a a le mÍme goŻt une fois dans le bol.
Tu portes le pantalon de mon pŤre ?
Va pour le lait en premier !
Qu'est-ce que tu lis ?
La page affaire.
Les fťdťraux vont encore baisser
les taux  pour renflouer les sub-primes.
Quels idiots !
Mme Aldrin dit qu'il faut pas
appeler les gens comme Áa.
S'ils ťtaient pas si idiots,
on les appellerait pas comme Áa.
C'est ce que j'ai dit.
Tu es plutŰt sympa.
Toi aussi.
<i>Pendant ce temps,
Stacy et moi sortions ensemble.</i>
<i>Stacy, c'ťtait la fille du bar.</i>
<i>Bref, j'ťtais censť gagner le pari,
mais un truc inattendu est arrivť.</i>
<i>Je commenÁais ŗ vraiment l'apprťcier.</i>
Amuse-toi bien au Yoga.
Elle renforce son coeur.
«a va Ítre bien.
Ouais, d'accord.
ņ plus, la puce !
Tu vois Áa.
La tÍte du jeu.
C'est Áa, Ted.
Et, elle joue de la basse
dans un groupe de reggae.
Ils ont un spectacle vendredi.
C'est pas cool ?
Tu connais cette chanson ?
Comment elle s'appelle ?
Ah oui, Áa s'appelle :
toutes les chansons de reggae.
- Je ne suis pas hors propos.
- Quoi ?
J'ai fait les calculs.
Si Lily et moi couchons ensemble
deux fois par semaine.
Ce qui, soyons honnÍtes,
est assez classique.
Et ťtant ensemble depuis dix ans.
Avec 17 fois de plus en lune de miel.
Moins les 2 semaines de disette
quand j'ai dit
que ce pigiste me rappelait Lily, jeune.
Donc, nous avons couchť ensemble...
- attendez...
- Bien.
1 053 fois et demi.
Ma mŤre a appelť, une fois.
Mais c'est plus que Barney,
et selon ton argument, Ted,
Lily est une fille de qualitť.
Je gagne !
Et voilŗ l'avocat !
«a compte pas.
- Si, Áa compte.
- T'as raison, Áa compte.
«a compte pour une fois.
T'as couchť une fois. C'ťtait bien ?
«a compte quand mÍme.
Bien, Ted.
Gagne ce pari.
Tu as ma bťnťdiction,
c'est une fille merveilleuse.
J'en sais quelque chose.
Je te vois venir.
On a jamais partagť une fille, hein ?
N'est-ce pas marrant ?
Tu es avec elle maintenant.
C'ťtait moi il y a un an.
J'imagine que pour elle,
c'ťtait il y a 200 douches.
Pose-toi cette question, Ted.
200, c'est assez ?
Tu sais quoi ?
Je m'en fiche.
Bien sŻr que tu t'en fiches.
Tout comme le 2e homme qui a escaladť
l'Everest se fichait d'arriver en haut
pour ne trouver que le porte drapeau
de Sir Edmund Hillary,
enfoncť comme un piton dťsossť.
SŻr que quand tu seras avec elle,
tu seras loin de penser ŗ moi.
Embrassant ce que j'ai dťjŗ embrassť.
Te blotissant oý je me suis blotti.
Faisant...
lŗ oý j'ai dťjŗ...
Barney,
j'ai pas peur d'attraper tes maladies.
Vraiment ?
Ted n'ayant pas peur des maladies ?
Dans ce cas, tu ne vois pas de problŤme
- ŗ boire dans mon verre.
- Aucun.
«a, je ne l'ai touchť
qu'avec mon petit doigt.
Devine qui adore Robin ?
Les gosses ! Les gosses adorent Robin.
Doug me trouve plutŰt sympa.
Vraiment ? C'est gťnial.
George et toi, gr‚ce ŗ moi.
Ouais, je vais devoir rompre avec lui.
- Quoi ?
- C'est juste que...
Áa devient un peu trop sťrieux
avec le gosse.
C'est pas ce que je recherche.
Il vaut mieux que je rompe maintenant
avant qu'il ne s'attache trop.
Quoi ?
Je suis dťsolťe de te dire Áa, mais...
il est trop tard.
Il a dessinť Áa, aujourd'hui.
Merde.
C'est pas possible que ce soit moi.
Cette femme a de grandes boucles
d'oreille et j'en n'ai mÍme pas.
J'en ai une paire, en or.
«a, c'est des Fruit Loops.
Tu es dans le dťni.
Et tu fais ce que tu fais
toujours dans tes relations.
DŤs que tu deviens plus proche
d'un gars, tu veux fuir.
D'accord, il a 6 ans,
mais Áa reste valable.
Demandons aux garÁons.
Ils te diront que c'est pas moi.
C'est toi.
Tu es fou !
Qui a dessinť Robin ?
- C'est pas moi.
- Tu plaisantes, hein ?
- C'est pas moi !
- "Ma nouvelle maman."
T'as de jolies boucles, dessus.
Maintenant que t'es maman,
tu vas porter ces super jeans
qui remontent jusqu'aux seins ?
Vous croyez vraiment que c'est moi ?
Chťrie, c'est toi.
Et si tu comptes rompre avec George,
tu devras le faire avec son fils, aussi.
Vraiment ?
Tu ne peux pas l'abandonner,
tu dois lui parler.
Allez, Robin,
tu sais que c'est ce qu'il faut faire.
Mince...
Doug avait raison,
vous Ítes casse-couilles.
J'ai passť un super moment, ce soir.
Pareil pour moi.
Hť, Ted !
Fais ce que tu veux,
mais j'ai ťtť lŗ le premier.
D'ici, j'ai aussi lancť une expťdition
jusqu'ŗ ces deux grandes montagnes, lŗ.
«a va ?
- Salut, Doug.
- T'es lŗ pour mon pŤre ?
Il est sous la douche.
En fait,
c'est toi que je suis venue voir.
J'ai ťcrit un poŤme,
tu veux l'entendre ?
Oui, pourquoi pas.
"ņ ma nouvelle maman."
"Tu es belle,
"tu es gentille,
"et tu sens comme la marguerite."
C'est si mignon.
MÍme si Áa ne rime pas...
…coute... Doug.
C'est dur ŗ dire...
<i>Tante Robin ne sut pas quoi dire.</i>
<i>Cet enfant n'avait jamais ťtť larguť,
avant.</i>
<i>Alors, elle rťalisa</i>
<i>qu'il n'avait jamais ťtť larguť, avant.</i>
<i>Elle pouvait se servir
de tous les clichťs.</i>
Il faut qu'on parle.
Je pense qu'on devrait prendre
un peu de distance.
C'est pas ŗ cause de toi,
c'est ma faute.
«a fait de la peine,
mais tu mťrites quelqu'un de mieux.
En ce moment, j'essaie
de me concentrer sur mon boulot.
Tu vois ?
J'espŤre qu'on pourra rester amis.
Bonjour.
Je suis Brooke.
J'avais rendez-vous avec George.
Vous devez Ítre la baby-sitter.
J'ai bu trop de cafť,
je dois aller aux toilettes
Salut, Dougy.
C'ťtait quoi, Áa ?
C'ťtait ma nouvelle maman.
Alors... ce dessin...
c'ťtait pas moi ?
Pourquoi je te dessinerais ?
Qu..
Combien a-t-elle eu
de rencards avec ton pŤre ?
Deux.
J'en ai eu cinq environ,
et tu l'aimes plus que moi ?
On s'est bien entendus.
Et moi, alors ?
Tu crois que je suis lŗ
ŗ verser des cťrťales
pour tous les garÁons de la ville ?
Pourquoi tu te f‚ches, Roberta ?
Robin !
Je m'appelle Robin.
Comme l'oiseau, tu te souviens ?
Ouais, si tu veux...
Alors, c'est fini, hein ?
…coute, t'es super, mais...
Il y a toujours un "mais".
J'ai pas pu, j'ai rompu avec elle.
Merci beaucoup, au fait.
Un superbe petit canon
et je n'ai pensť qu'au fait
que tu sois passť avant.
T'ťtais coincť dans ma tÍte
comme une chanson de Chumbawamba.
Laquelle ?
Quel intťressant
retournement de situation.
On dirait que je vais gagner.
Attends, tu peux mÍme plus lui parler.
T'as essayť, tu t'es pris une gifle.
C'est ce que tu crois.
OK, rŤgle Nį1 :
pas de bandeau,
pas d'accessoire...
Mon ami s'est fait larguer,
il est un peu timide.
Il aimerait t'offrir un verre,
Il pense qu'il ne t'interessera pas.
Pourrais-tu me gifler pour qu'il voie
que t'aimes pas les baratineurs ?
- Pour mon ami.
- T'es si gentil.
Donc, quoi que Ted fasse pour elle,
dans son esprit
je suis le type
encore plus gentil que lui.
- T'as jamais couchť avec ?
- Pas le moins du monde.
- C'est fort.
- Et c'est pas fini.
Tu te rappelles la discussion de Ted ?
Amuse-toi au Yoga.
- Dťsolťe.
- Dťsolť.
Stacy, c'est Áa ?
Tu es l'ami de Ted, du bar, hein ?
- Me dis pas que tu vas aussi au Yoga.
- Si.
Elle joue de la basse
dans un groupe de reggae.
Ensuite, je vais ŗ un concert de reggae,
- Le reggae, c'est ma vie.
- Mince alors !
- Je joue dans un groupe de reggae.
- Sťrieux ?
Pourquoi Ted me l'a pas dit ?
Je suis un fan absolu de reggae.
Je dois y aller.
ņ plus, la puce.
- ņ plus, alligat...
- ņ plus, alligat...
Des grands esprits !
Prends soin de toi.
<i>Namaste</i>
T'es un sociopathe.
C'ťtait mon ‚me-yoga-soeur.
Ted ťtant hors jeu,
je vais m'introduire,
et gagner le tout.
Pourquoi ?
Traduction :
Parce que j'ai le jeu, les salopes.
«a ne prouve rien parce que...
Une minute.
Salut, Stace.
Qu'est-il arrivť ?
Il a pas fait Áa !
Ne bouge pas, j'arrive de suite.
J'aurais dŻ porter ce foutu bandeau.
Dire que tu t'es fait larguer
par un gamin de 6 ans.
«a fait rien, c'ťtait une tÍte de lard.
Fini les enfants.
<i>Bien sŻr, au final, Robin
s'est rťconciliťe avec les enfants.</i>
<i>Comme vous le savez,
elle a eu sa place de grandes oeuvres...</i>
<i>les vŰtres.</i>
J'apprťcie que tu n'aies pas brusquť
les choses entre nous.
Depuis Ted, je...
je veux pas que Áa devienne
physique trop vite.
C'est ce qui te rend si spťciale, bťbť.
Bref, je suis si excitťe
de jouer Sunsplash, demain.
On passe entre 23 h et 6 h.
Sois lŗ avant 21 h,
histoire d'Ítre sŻr.
«a va Ítre trash.
it was saturday night in new york city,
and the young metropolitan set
was out on the town,
living the kind of crazy lifestyle
you can only find in the big apple.
a hundred
we only got 82 on our honeymoon.
so, robin
mm? i've got a guy for you.
oh?
he's cute.
he's funny. he's smart.
what's his "but"? what do you mean?
when someone wants to set you up,
they always tell you their good qualities first, but
but then they leave out their huge flaw.
she's totally hot and really fun.
but she has a dead tooth.
she's super-hot, and she's so successful.
but she has a pug
that she pushes around in a stroller.
she's so cute, and she's so smart.
but her last boyfriend had
get a restraining order against her,
and then his cat and new vacuum cleaner both went missing.
wow set her up
i'm still convinced
she killed my turtle.
hey you know what? not every setup has a "but."
what about, um, jamie, that girl
that lily set you up with? yeah.
she was really nice. if memory
serves me, she had a huge "but.
her huge butt.
nailed it!
yeah.
well, there's nothing wrong with this guy.
he's really nice, and he's really cute...
but
fine.
but he has a kid.
aha! there it is!
robin's not going out with a guy with a kid.
but the guy is really great, and his kid's sweet.
he's in my class.
it doesn't matter robin hates kids.
i don't hate kids.
you told me
even when you were a kid, you hated kids.
robin,will you watch
cartool with me?
i go to school all week.
can't i just have
five minutes to myself
to read highlights and drink my juice?
okay, yes, kids are not my favorite thing
in the world,but i like them
well, you don't want to have them.
i like sports cars, but it doesn't mean
i want to push a ferrari through my vagina.
shotgun.
you can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem.
i mean, if we were friends with garfield,
we wouldn't set him up on a date with mondays.
nice.
you know what the kid is not a problem i want to meet this guy.
okay. that's awesome! yeah.
hey, what's my "but"?
u know i'm a... i am really nice  but...
but she's afraid of commitments.
but she's a gun nut.
but she'scanadian.
but she didn't like field of dreams.
i can't think of...
you don't have a but.
i've got it. here. put on this eye patch.
why?
the ultimate ice-breaker.
a bunch of cobras got loose in central park.
you and i are jogging..
training for the death valley iron man.
no big deal. we do it every year.
mm-hmm suddenly,
we see these snake bastards
sneaking towards a little baby.
not on our watch.
you grab the kid
i strangle six cobras
with my bare hands.
women of new york, one at a time, please.
so what the the eye patches for?
i got bit.
on the eye?
yes.
both of us?
they're different eyes.
i don't know see why this bumps you!
patch up!
so robin went on a date with george,
the guy with the kid, and afterwards...
okay here's the thing.
george is
a great guy.
we had a wonderful date. but....
great i can't wait to meet him.
"can't wait to meet him"?
why did i say that?
i don't want to meet his kid. well, you knew
you'd meet him sooner or later.
oh. i was just hoping for later,
like in 20 years
when i'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad.
robin, what's the big deal?
he's just a kid
he's not going to bite.
he may bite.
we're working on biting.
why is this kid around anyway?
shouldn't he be with his mom?
i mean, what kind of lawyer does this guy have
if he has to take care of the kid all the time
a good one.
he won full custody.
he won?! he won?
oh god, getting the kid is winning, isn't it?
don't tell anyone i said that.
mm. no.
i'm going out buying eye patches.
what are you doing to help score chicks?
okay, i'm going to let you in on a little secret.
people with real game don't need eye patches.
oh. theodore.
no no no
you can't spell "game" without me,
and me has the best game.
yeah, well,
i got so much game, i'm cornish game hen.
oh, yeah? i'm the new york state gaming commissioner.
well, i'm the game.
well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller
starring michael douglas and sean pen
wow.
wow. you're here
and not in stall two.
yeah. so
i may have made some
wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments
to a gentleman wearing your shoes.
okay, marshall? yes.
which one of us has more game?
neither of you guys has any game, right?
or else you'd be married like me.
what?
if dating is the game,
then marriage is winning the game.
yeah. if you're playing in the women's league.
you're joking.
i have mad game, brah.
okay one
we agreed not ever to say " brah"  any more
it was a good week, we had a lot of fun,
but it's over.
two
you've been with lily for 11 years.
your idea of good game
is slapping on a dr. seuce's hat
and flashing two tickets to a spin doctors concert.
yeah, i hate to say it, buddy,
-but, uh, you're kind of irrelevant
-what? i am not irrelevant.
i know tons of stuff.
i can help you guy
i don't want to be left out.
ted you do not have more game than me.
by sheer numbers
along i win.
come on, dude. you've seen my list.
you guys want to hear one of my lines?
first of all, i did not ask to see that list,
and i am still horrified.
and true game
is about quality, not quantity,
and a quality girl would pick me over you any day.
are you a model?
that one's good because it's flattering.
to the girl.
ted
i challenge you to a picking up girls olympiad.
fine there will be 26 events
spread out over 11 weeks.
we will travel to a neutral city
where a panel of internationa
or we could just choose a girl at first to seal the deal who wins
and that's good, too.mm-hmm.
how about her?
you're on.
before we start,
why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?
okay, great. rule #1: no eye patches
or props of any...
one time
i was with this girl, and i tried that model line,
and i totally got some over-the-shirt boob action
in the "just say no" assembly.
man, just stop.
you're bumming everybody out.
rule number two
the bet is for one million dollars.
i win.
how?
oh, i slept with her.
about a year ago.
i just forgot.
oh, well, that doesn't count.
the bet started the moment we shook.
but i can't sleep with her again,she hates me.
oh interesting.
look who just took a commanding lead.
-now with you out of the picture
i can take -ted, she's leaving.
get out of my way.
by the look
of those shoes here comes
your bathroom buddy.
look who's got game.
so, you're a big kids person, huh?
only the biggest ever
i think kids are so great,
especially uh the ones, you know, uh... pudgy,
can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.
you mean babies?
yeah, i like that kind.
well, doug's almost six,
oh, six is great.
oh, you are going to love six.
six is when they, uh, they really start to, um...
i hate kids.
excuse me. what?
i mean, i don't hate kids.
i'm-i'm just not a kid person.
i mean, yeah, it's cute that their shoes are real little,
but beyond that, what's the drawl?
you must think i'm nuts.
what? no, no, no. i...
so you don't like kids, so what?
and i'm not looking
for a mother for doug.
uh, why don't we just hold off on you meeting him?
yeah.
let's take things slow.
and kids, that's exactly what she did.
then, on a totally different date
that was definitely not the next morning,
aunt robin had to face her worst fear.
hey, what's up?
it's here, lily.
it's looking at me.
what?
the kid. what do i do?
just talk to him. you can do this, robin.
who are you?
um, i'm robin.
that's a bird's name.
ah, no, it's not
it's actually a type of bird.
my friend patrick has a parakeet named robin, so there.
do you want to talk in morse code?
dude, i'm-i'm just reading my paper, so...
i'm starving. will you make me cereal?
sure.
what are you doing? you're supposed
to pour the milk first.
what?! no, you pour the cereal first
so you know how much milk you need.
it tastes better milk first!
it all tastes the same once it's in the bowl.
why are you wearing my dad's pants?
milk first it is.
what are you reading?
the business section.
the fed's going to lower rates again
to bail out these sub-prime lenders.
bunch of idiots.
ms. aldrin says it's not nice to call people names.
well, maybe if they weren't such idiots,
i wouldn't have to call them that.
that's what i said.
you're pretty cool.
you too.
meanwhile stacey and i had start
oh, stacey was the girl from the bar.
anyway, i was close to winning the bet
when something unexpected happened.
i started to really like her.
well, have fun in yoga.
she's strengthening her core.
i think that's going to be good.
yeah? all right.
after a while, crocodile.
you see this?
game face.
whatever, ted get this.
she play bass
in a reggae band.
they're having a show this friday.
how cool is that?
oh, does she know that one song?
what's that song called?
oh, right. it's called every reggae song.
i am not irrelevant. what?
i ran the numbers.
if lily and i have sex twice a week,
which let's be honest, we all know is being conservative,
and we've been together
for ten years,
plus 17 more times on the honeymoon,
minus the two-week drought when i said the checker
at the grocery store might have met me and the young lily
then we have had sex a total of
-wait for it -nice.
1,053-1/2 times.
my mom called once.
but that's more times than barney
has ever had sex, and to your point, ted
lily is a quality girl.
i win.
lawyered.
doesn't count.
it totally counts.
you're right. it does count.
it counts as one.
you've had sex once.
how was it?
i still matter.
okay ted go win the bet.
you have my blessing she's a wonderful girl.
i should know.
oh, okay.
okay i see what you're doing.
we've never shared a woman, have we ted?
isn't that funny?
you're with her now.
i was with her a year ago
you figure, for her, that's like 200 showers ago.
you've got to ask yourself ted
"is 200 enough?"
you know what?
i don't mind.
no, of course you don't mind.
just lik the second guy to climb
mount everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top
only to find sir edmund hillary flat pole
thrust into its supple peak.
no, i'm sure when you're with her,
i'll be the furthest thing from your mind
kissing what i've already kissed,
nuzzling what i've already nuzzled,
going...
on what i've already gone  on.
barney, i'm not afraid
of catching your cooties, 'kay?
really? ted's not afraid of cooties?
no okay well then i guess you'd have no problem
having a sip of my g.d tonic.
fine
and i only stirred that with my pinky
guess who loves robin.
kids. kids love ted.
doug thinks i'm pretty cool.
really, that's great!
you and george, all thanks to me.
ah'i'm gonna have to break up with him.
what?
well, it's just.
it's getting a little bit too serious with the kid.
you know, it's just not
what i'm looking for.
better i break it off now
before he gets too attached.
what?
i hate to tell you this, but..
too late.
he drew it in class today.
there is no way  that's a picture of me.
that woman has on hoop earrings.
i don't even own hoop earrings.
i have one pair and they're gold.
those are fruit loops.
you are so in denial right now
and you're doing what you always do in relationships:
the second you get close to a guy, you want to bail.
okay, granted, he's six,
but the point stands.
well, we'll ask the guys.
they'll tell you that's not me.
that's totally you.
what... you guys are crazy.
hey, who drew the picture of robin?
it's not me.
you're joking right?
-it's not me! -"my new mommy."
kind of has a nice ring to it.
hey, now that you're a mom are you going to start wearing
those totally awesome jeans
that go right up to your boobs?
do you guys really think this is me?
honey, it's you.
and if you're going to break up with george,
you have to break up with his kid, too.
really?
yeah, you can't just abandon him.
you have to talk to him.
come on,  you know
it's the right thing to do.
oh, man.
doug was right you are a pa
so i had a really nice time tonight.
me, too.
yeah?
hey, ted, pucker up all you want,
but i was here first
from this spot, i also launched
an expedition those two large ridges
down there.
ted?
something wrong?
hey, doug.
are you here to see my dad?
he's taking a shower.
actually, i came to see you.
i wrote a poem.
do you want to hear it
sure. why not?
"to my new mommy"
"you are pretty"
"you are nice"
"and you smell like daisies"
aw, that is so sweet.
even though it doesn't right
look, uh, doug.
there's no good way to say this
aunt robin didn't know to what to say.
this kid has never been dumped before.
but then she realized...
this kid had never been dumped before.
she could use every cliche in the book.
we need to talk.
i just think, hum
we both could use some space right now.
it's not you. it's me.
i know this hurts, but you deserts someone better
i'm just really trying to focus on my career right now.
you know?
i just hope we can still be friends.
hi, i'm brooke.
i'm here for my date with george.
you must be
the babysitter.
i had so much coffee earlier.
i need to run to the loo, but hey, dougie.
what the hell was that?
that was my new mom.
so... this picture is not of me?
why would i draw a picture of you?
wha...?
how many dates has she been on with your dad?
two.
i've been on five
and you like her better?
we just really connected.
and what about me?
you think i just go around pouring cereal
for every boy in town?
why are you getting so upset, roberta?
robin my name is robin.
like the bird, remember?
whatever.
so that's it, huh?
look, you're great, but...
yeah. there's always a "but."
well, i couldn't do it.
i broke up with her.
thanks a lot, by the way.
a beautiful, sexy girl
and all i could think about you being there first.
you were stuck in my head like chumbawamba song.
which chumbawamba song?
well, what an interesting turn of events
it looks like i'm going to win.
what do you mean "win"? you couldn't even talk to her.
you tried and you got slapped. mm-hmm
that's what you think happened.
okay, great, rule no.1:
no eye patch or props of any...
here's the deal:  my friend just got dumped, so he's a little shy,
but i'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you.
the problem is, she this a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him.
so would you slap me across the face so he can see
you're not into guys who'd feed you lines?
what do you say? for my friend?
you are so sweet.
so now, whatever nice things
ted does for her, in her mind,
i'm the guy who's even nicer than him.
so you never slept with her?
not even at all.
wow, that's good.
it gets better.
remember ted's phone conversation?
we have fun in yoga.
well..
i am... sorry.
stacey, right?
yeah... oh, you're ted's friend fro||the bar, right?
yeah. wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here, too.
i do.
she plays bass in a reggae band.
and then i'm going to head out to a reggae concert.
i'm a huge an of reggae.
oh my gosh!
i play in a reggae band.
no way.
i wonder why ted didn't tell me about that.
like i said, i'm a huge reggae fan.
well... i should go inside.
after a while, crocodile.
see you later, allig... see you later, allig..
we are two ears.
wow, well, take care.
um, namaste.
you are a sociopath.
and that was my yoga mat.
so now with ted out of the picture,
i'm going to swoop in and win the whole thing.
why? parce que j'ai le jeu, mes  iennes.
translation:
"cause i got game, bitches"
no no this doen't prove anything because...
hold on a second.
it's stace .
hey, stace?
what happened?
he did not!
stay there.
i'll be right over.
i should've just rn that stupid eye patch.
oh, i can't believe you got dumped by a six years old.
whatever he's a stupid-head.
i'm just... i'm done with kids.
of course, ted eventually made her peace with kids.
and as you guy know she went on to appear
in some very important works of art: yours.
US And Aunt Robin
US and Aunt Robin At THE ZOO
US AND AUNT ROBIN AT THE BEACH
one month later
hey
you know, i really appreciate
how cool you've been
about us taking things slow.
since ted, you know, i...
i don't really want to get physical too fast.
that's what makes you so special, baby.
anyway, i am so psyched
to be playing sunsplash tomorrow.
we go on sometime
between 11:00 and 6:00,
so you probably want to get there
before 9:00 just to be safe.
oh, and it's gonna be muddy.
<i>Ŕ l'automne 2007, je sortais
avec cette fille qui s'appelait...</i>
<i>Mon Dieu, comment s'appelait-elle ?</i>
<i>Ça fait 23 ans,
je me souviens plus de tout ça.</i>
<i>Pour le bien de l'histoire,
appelons-la...</i>
Voici Blahblah.
Appelez-moi Bla.
Comment vous ętes-vous rencontrés ?
Je prenais
ce cours de cuisine ŕ la française
et tout le monde était déjŕ en binôme
donc j'ai cherché,
et de l'autre côté d'une pičce bondée,
j'ai vu Ted.
- C'était magique.
- C'était tellement...
magique.
<i>Ŕ part que non.</i>
Elle va raconter
de fausses histoires sur notre cours
car ça la gęne
qu'on se soit rencontrés sur le net.
Quoi !
Ce n'est plus la honte.
C'est la honte,
c'est pour ça que les gens disent
"Ce n'est plus la honte".
Alors, elle est sexy ?
- Magnifique.
- Alors, elle est folle.
Non.
Ted, les seuls canons
qui trollent sur internet pour des mecs
sont des folles,
des putes ou des mecs.
Elle n'est pas folle, c'est pas une pute
et c'est pas un mec.
Ce type que je croise
tous les jours, il est les 3 ŕ la fois.
Ça me file les jetons.
Impossible qu'elle soit au-dessus
de la ligne de l'échelle sexy/folle.
Elle n'est męme pas
dans cette échelle, elle est juste sexy.
- Attends, l'échelle sexy/folle ?
- Je vais te faire un dessin.
Une fille peut ętre folle
si elle est tout autant sexy.
Si elle a ce niveau de folie,
elle doit ętre aussi sexy.
Avec ce niveau de folie,
il faut qu'elle soit plus sexy.
Nous voulons que la fille soit
au-dessus de cette ligne,
connue sous le nom
de diagonale Vickie Mendoza.
C'est une fille qui jouait
ŕ la corde ŕ sauter avec cette ligne.
Elle s'est rasé la tęte
et a ensuite perdu 5 Kg.
Elle m'a poignardé avec une fourchette,
aprčs, s'est fait mettre des implants.
Je devrais la rappeler.
The Legen... dary Team
http://nosvospersos.blogspot.com
S'il vous plaît, jouez le jeu avec
sa fausse anecdote du cours de cuisine.
Je sais pas, Ted.
J'aurais du mal ŕ marcher dans
l'histoire bidon de ta folle de copine.
Maintenant,
si tu avais dit faux seins...
Elle n'est pas folle.
On verra bien.
Pour résumer,
Dieu merci, j'étais pičtre cuisiničre
sinon j'aurais jamais rencontré Ted.
C'est fou.
Comme c'est charmant, c'est fou !
Tu sais qui a une charmante
histoire de rencontre ?
Marshall et Lily, racontez-la-nous.
OK, mais je vous préviens,
ça finit avec tout le monde disant :
Ça commence comme ça, aussi.
<i>Quand vous ętes en couple
depuis autant de temps,</i>
<i>raconter la rencontre devient
une vraie chorégraphie.</i>
C'était fin aoűt 1996.
On était des premičres années
emménageant...
en résidence universitaire.
Et elle avait besoin d'aide
pour régler sa chaîne.
Pour une raison inconnue,
je me sentais attirée
par la chambre 110.
Comme si elle savait que quelqu'un
de spécial était derričre cette porte.
Et comme écrit dans la pierre,
ce quelqu'un
était Marshall.
Ça a été le coup de foudre.
Je sais, hein ?
<i>Ŕ force de raconter cette histoire,
ils l'ont perfectionnée.</i>
<i>La 1re fois
que Marshall me l'a racontée,</i>
<i>c'était un peu différent.</i>
La petite gothique est passée,
aujourd'hui.
Je me la ferais bien.
Vous avez trop de chance.
Quand on cuisinait et que nos mains
se sont touchées pour la 1re fois,
je savais qu'aprčs les cours,
il m'emmčnerait sur le toit
m'embrasserait et m'offrirait une rose.
Ce qu'il a fait !
Dites "Ah" !
Je sais, hein ?
La prochaine tournée est pour moi.
N'importe qui serait stressé
de rencontrer de nouvelles tętes.
Elle n'est pas folle.
Follement généreuse peut-ętre,
ŕ nous payer ŕ boire.
La ferme.
On sait comment Marshall et Lily
se sont rencontrés,
Robin, comment
vous vous ętes connus avec Barney ?
On est pas ensemble.
Vraiment ? Seize "non" ?
Vraiment ?
- Donc, tu es célibataire ?
- Oui.
Donc jolie, célibataire et amie de Ted.
Génial.
Tu sais qui d'autre est l'ami de Ted ?
Marshall.
Notre rencontre est aussi
une bonne anecdote, je me lance.
C'était le premier jour de fac.
<i>Pour comprendre cette histoire,</i>
<i>vous devez savoir qu'oncle Marshall</i>
<i>faisait comme beaucoup, ŕ la fac.</i>
<i>Comment dire ça ?</i>
<i>Il était...</i>
<i>Disons qu'il mangeait un sandwich.</i>
Il paraît que le doyen arrive,
éteins ton sandwich.
Bonjour, Monsieur.
Je suis Marshall Eriksen, Monsieur.
Je t'en prie, appelle-moi Ted.
Doyen Ted.
Quelqu'un a mangé un sandwich.
Quoi ? Non !
Ah bon ? Je sais pas.
Je connais męme pas l'odeur du sandwich.
Mes parents vont donner
beaucoup d'argent ŕ cette école.
Donc, tu dors en bas ?
Cool.
Je voulais le lit du haut,
de toute façon.
Comment ça ?
Je suis ton nouveau coloc.
C'est trop injuste !
J'ai compris que plus tard
dans la soirée qu'il était pas le doyen.
T'es pas le doyen !
La fac, de grands souvenirs.
J'ai pigé.
Ted t'as dit que j'étais pas allée
ŕ la fac alors tu m'envoies un pique.
Nous y voilŕ.
Pendant que t'étais occupée
ŕ te pouponner,
je démarrais ma ligne de sac ŕ main.
Une ligne de sac ŕ main,
c'est fou !
Ils sont vendus au Japon.
Robin,
t'as déjŕ vendu un truc au Japon ?
Mais j'aimerais en acheter un si...
Oů puis-je en trouver ?
J'ai pas de distributeur ici.
Merci de remuer le couteau.
Pourquoi t'essaies
de me rabaisser devant Ted ?
Écoute, il n'y a rien entre Ted et moi.
C'est sorti de nulle part.
Je veux dire que t'as pas ŕ t'inquiéter.
Je l'étais pas, je devrais l'ętre ?
- Non, au contraire.
- Bien, parce que je le suis pas.
Robin, tu peux laisser tomber ?
Tu mets tout le monde mal ŕ l'aise.
Encore une bonne histoire ?
Ma rencontre avec Barney.
Barney, raconte, tout de suite.
S'il te plaît.
C'est une histoire de fou,
tu vas l'adorer.
C'est la premičre fois
que je sors avec mon frčre sourd
depuis la mort de notre mčre.
- J'en suis navré.
- Non, ça va.
Je dois m'occuper de lui, maintenant.
Bien sűr...
je dois mettre mes ręves
de côté pour faire ça.
Mais je suis heureux, aussi.
C'est mon frčre et je l'aime.
Désolé, c'est encore si récent.
Eh bien... je suis désolé.
T'as gobé ça ?
Quoi ?
J'ai inventé ça pendant que je pissais.
Si ça marche sur toi, ça va le faire
sur la blonde au comptoir.
Ŕ moins que tu sois un débile profond.
Comment tu t'appelles ?
- Ted.
- T'es complčtement stupide ?
Je discute encore avec toi, donc...
Bien joué !
Je t'aime bien, Ted.
Je vais t'apprendre ŕ vivre.
Barney. On s'est rencontrés ŕ l'urinoir.
- Oh, c'est vrai, salut.
- Leçon N° 1 :
rase ton bouc,
ça va pas avec ton costume.
- Je porte pas de costume.
- Leçon N° 2 : mets-en un.
Les costumes, c'est cool, clinquant.
Leçon N° 3 : ne pense pas
au mariage avant tes 30 ans.
Et leçon N° 4 : pas un mot durant
les 5 prochaines minutes.
Hé, Audrey.
Voici mon frčre sourd, Edward.
Edward !
Voici Audrey !
Tu sais, je connais un peu
la langue des signes.
Bonjour, je m'appelle Audrey.
Ravie de te rencontrer.
Il ne signe pas.
Il est complexé par ses mains.
Elles sont minuscules et féminines.
Je m'appelle Edward.
Enchanté, également.
Quoi ?! Tu...
Tu as surpassé ton complexe des mains.
Enfin.
Mon frčre est un super type.
Tu devrais lui donner ton numéro.
Tiens, appelle-moi.
Męme si elle m'a filé un faux numéro,
je savais qu'avec Ted on serait
des copilotes ŕ jamais.
Barney, il est temps que tu saches...
Cette histoire s'est passée
un peu différemment, en fait.
Il te ment.
File-lui un numéro bidon.
Super, trčs amusant.
Avec un copilote comme Ted,
je pourrais avoir besoin
d'une rencontre désespérée
de façon nulle.
Genre par internet.
Par internet.
En ligne.
Mon Dieu, tu leur as raconté ?
Oui, mais c'est pas grave.
Beaucoup de personnes
se rencontrent par internet.
Ce truc de voir des gens dans une pičce
bondée, ça n'arrive que dans les films.
Ça n'arrive jamais.
Ŕ part avec Robin et toi,
c'était comme ça, non ?
Attendez, vous ętes sortis ensemble ?
- Combien de temps.
- Un an.
Mais ne t'en fais pas,
ça n'allait pas si bien que ça.
Vers la fin, c'était surtout sexuel.
Qui n'était pas si bien que ça.
Mais j'étais le problčme,
je ne faisais rien.
Ted est trčs bien, je suis sűre qu'il...
t'amčneras oů tu devras aller.
Je peux acheter tes sacs sur le net ?
Je comprends ce qu?il se passe, Ted.
Je suis juste lŕ pour rendre
Robin jalouse,
et aprčs qu'elle t'ait repris,
tu te souviendras plus de mon nom.
Allez, Blahblah,
c'est pas ce que tu crois.
Nous voici proche de la moitié.
Voyons ce que donne Blahblah
dans l'échelle sexy/folle.
Elle a commencé la soirée ici.
Mais, au cours de la soirée,
elle est devenue plus folle
mais pas plus sexy.
La faisant dériver de l'autre côté,
traversant la diagonale Mendoza
et se rapprochant dangereusement
de la zone Shelly Gillespie.
Une autre fille que j'ai connue,
elle a pris 10 Kg
et a essayé de me tuer avec une brique.
Je suis désolé de ne t'avoir rien dit,
mais il n'y a rien entre Robin et moi.
Alors pourquoi m'a-t-elle rabaissée
toute la soirée ?
Regarde-la ! Elle me rit au nez, lŕ !
Je suis désolée, c'est juste que...
l'histoire de Lily
et Marshall est si romantique,
j'aimerais qu'on vive la męme chose.
L'histoire n'est pas
si magique qu'elle en a l'air.
Comment ça ?
Non, je ne peux pas. C'est un secret.
Et si je te disais un secret
sur ce que tu pourrais faire ce soir ?
Il y a eu une fęte
le soir précédant leur rencontre.
Salut, t'es une premičre année ? Je dis
jamais UN premičre année, c'est sexiste.
Oui, premičre année.
Je suis au 220.
Non ! Je suis au 110 !
Tu devrais passer.
J'irais peut-ętre au 110.
Fume ! Fume !
Regarde ces ivrognes.
Ne bois pas leur bičre ŕ deux balles.
C'est du <i>pinot noir</i>... d'Europe.
C'est fruité.
Je l'ai coupé avec de la canneberge,
c'était fort.
Alors... t'as une copine ?
Ouais.
Enfin, je suis pas trop sűr
du truc ŕ distance.
Comme disait Descartes :
pour déterminer si on peut croire
en quelque chose de façon certaine,
il faut d'abord douter
de tout ce qu'on sait.
Tu vois ?
Aussi bourrée qu'elle était,
ŕ son réveil le lendemain,
elle se souvenait de la chambre 110,
c'est pourquoi elle a frappé ŕ la porte.
Elle me cherchait.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Durant toutes ces années,
on en a jamais reparlé. Donc...
- bouche cousue, d'accord ?
- Tu dois le dire ŕ Marshall.
S'il l'apprenait, ça le détruirait.
Si tu lui dis pas,
je le ferai.
Allons, tu ferais pas ça.
Lily, comment as-tu rencontré Ted ?
- La vraie histoire !
- Personne ne veut de cette histoire.
Ne sois pas gęné, Ted.
C'était il y a longtemps.
J'ai fait une grosse erreur hier soir.
Mais comme disait Descartes,
pour déterminer si on peut croire
en quelque chose de façon certaine,
il faut d'abord douter
de tout ce qu'on sait.
Et je suis sűr de t'aimer, Karen.
Bon, rappelle-moi
quand tu auras le message.
Je vais aller au centre informatique
pour t'envoyer un courrier électronique.
Voici Lily.
Désolé, mais j'aime Karen.
Voilŕ la version longue
de notre rencontre.
Comme c'est gęnant.
Qui veut un verre ?
C'est pas ça, Ted, dis-leur.
- Nous dire quoi ?
- Lily, tu m'aides pour les verres ?
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Elle sait pour nous.
Comment on s'est vraiment rencontrés.
Oui, je viens de lui dire.
La vraie histoire.
De quoi tu parles ?
Allons.
Allons, quoi ?
Allons.
Je sais vraiment pas de quoi tu parles.
Allons.
Je sais que t'es sortie avec Ted le soir
avant ta rencontre avec Marshall.
Quoi ?
On n'est jamais sortis ensemble.
Si.
Je ne suis sortie qu'avec un type
en fac, avant de rencontrer Marshall.
C'était un inconnu,
je me souviens męme plus de son nom.
Je l'appelle La Léchouille.
Quoi ? La Léchouille ?
Ça m'étonne pas,
venant de Bouche mi-close !
C'était pas moi.
Si, ŕ la soirée d'accueil
des premičres années.
N'est-ce pas génial ?
L'évocation de ta rencontre avec moi ?
Robin, je t'ai raconté
comment j'ai rencontré Marshall ?
- Oui, cinq ou six fois.
- C'était juste lŕ.
Ton problčme,
c'est que t'as couché qu'avec une nana.
Ce genre de stat
est acceptable ŕ onze ans.
Mais, ce soir, on va te trouver
une nouvelle nana.
Car, Marshall Eriksen,
ŕ partir de maintenant,
je prends toutes les décisions pour toi.
Excuse-moi. Qui es-tu déjŕ ?
C'est Barney,
je l'ai rencontré l'autre jour.
- C'est un abruti.
- J'apprends ŕ vivre ŕ Ted.
Une chance pour toi, j'ai de la place
pour un étudiant de plus.
Imagine que je suis Yoda.
Sauf qu'au lieu d'ętre petit et vert,
j'ai un costume et je suis génial.
Je suis ton pote.
Je suis Potyoda.
Ce soir, tu vas utiliser la force
pour mettre
la plus belle nana du bar au lit.
Il va user de la force ?
C'est mal, Potyoda.
La Force,
c'est une référence ŕ Star Wars.
Il faut faire plein de références ŕ
Star Wars devant les filles, c'est ça ?
Je ne vais pas tromper ma copine.
Si, avec le canon qui vient d'arriver.
Regardez-la.
Elle est pas plus canon que ta copine ?
C'est sans comparaison.
T'en penses quoi, Ted ? J'y vais.
Fais pas ça, pense ŕ Lily.
Et puis, je m'en fous.
Ça fait trop longtemps que je suis avec
la męme fille, j'ai besoin d'inconnu.
Oui ! Discours d'encouragement !
Tu peux le faire.
Mais, pour ętre plus précis,
tu ne peux sűrement pas.
Tu manques d'entraînement
et elle est trop canon pour toi.
Souviens-toi.
Ce soir, il ne s'agit pas de gagner.
Il s'agit de croire
que tu peux le faire.
Męme si tu ne peux sűrement pas.
Vas-y !
Il va se crasher en plein vol.
Cet homme est un dieu.
Pendant une semaine, il m'a suivi,
ŕ me demander de lui apprendre ŕ vivre.
Il a męme fait ma lessive, une fois.
Je croyais
que c'était un truc de M. Miyagi.
Marshall, il faut que je te parle,
on peut s'isoler un instant ?
- Bien sűr. Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Lily et Ted sont sortis ensemble.
T'en dis quoi, Robin ?
De quoi tu parles ?
Tu sais, ce type avec qui je suis sortie
ŕ la soirée d'accueil des 1res années.
La Léchouille, oui.
Et cette fille avec qui je suis sorti
ŕ la soirée d'accueil des 1res années.
Bouche mi-close, oui.
- Je suis La Léchouille.
- Et je suis Bouche mi-close.
Les pires de tous les supers héros.
Bébé, je suis tellement navrée.
Ne le sois pas. J'étais ŕ cette fęte.
C'était sombre et bondé.
J'y ai mangé quelques sandwichs.
Je suis sűr ŕ 100 % que Bouche mi-close
était Alexa Leskeys, pas Lily.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui, certain.
Et La Léchouille,
c'était Colin O'Reilly.
T'es sűr ?
Sinon, j'ai pissé
dans le mauvais shampoing.
T'y crois pas vraiment, hein ?
Tu as juré que c'était Lily.
J'ai dű faire une erreur.
Ça devait ętre Alexa.
Une autre fille, Ted ?
Avec qui t'es pas sorti ?
J'ai pas besoin de ça.
Je dessine des sacs ŕ main,
j'écris un essai, je suis
une super star, c'est mon année !
un jour le nom Blahblah
sera en haut de l'affiche.
La prochaine fois
que t'es sur World of Warcraft,
n'essaie męme pas de me parler.
World of Warcraft !
Le jeu de rôle en ligne !
C'est comme ça que vous
vous ętes rencontrés sur le net ?
<i>On devrait se prendre un café un jour.<.i>
<i>Oui, on devrait.</i>
<i>Comment tu t'appelles ?</i>
<i>Ted, et toi ?</i>
C'est un super jeu.
<i>Inutile de préciser que Blahblah
n'est pas devenue votre mčre.</i>
<i>Quant ŕ la fille de la soirée,</i>
<i>je n'avais pas le moindre doute.</i>
<i>C'était votre tante Lily.</i>
<i>Vous savez, cette histoire si magique
ŕ propos de leur rencontre,</i>
<i>ça valait le coup de la préserver.
Alors, je me suis tu.</i>
J'ai dű faire une erreur.
Ça devait ętre Alexa.
<i>Jusqu'ŕ notre 20e réunion des anciens,
quand j'ai retrouvé...</i>
<i>Alexa Leskeys.</i>
Alors, Ted. Tu te souviens
de la derničre fois qu'on était ici ?
Toi et moi ? Aucune idée.
Ted, allons.
La fęte d'accueil.
On était tous les deux bourrés.
C'était toi ?
- On n'est jamais sortis ensemble.
- Je sais.
Donc, je ne suis pas La Léchouille.
En fait...
Regardez
ce que j'ai confisqué ŕ des gamins.
- Un sandwich.
- Eh oui !
Mâche.
Avale.
- C'est bon, chérie.
- Les sandwichs sont forts de nos jours.
J'arrive pas ŕ croire que je me faisais
un sandwich ŕ moi tout seul.
Maintenant,
en deux bouchées, je suis cuit.
Bébé, on peut faire pousser
des sandwichs derričre le garage ?
Mec, on a 42 ans.
Oů est ma femme ?
kids,back to the forwards 2007
i was dating the girl named...
oh, god, what was her name?
you know, it's been 23 years,i can't remember all the staff
for the sake of the story,let's call her...
everyone, this is blahblah.
please, call me blah.
so, blah, how did you two meet?
well, i was taking this cooking class,
french fusion, and everyone already had a partner,
but then i looked up and across a crowded room,
i saw ted.it was magical.
it was so magical.
except it wasn't.
she's gonna tell story about the cooking class,
because she's embarrassed we met online.
what? there's no stigma anymore.
oh, there's a stigma.
there's why people always say,"there's no stigma anymore."
so, she's hot?
oh, she's gorgeous.
then she's crazy.
no, she's not.
ted, the only hot girls that troll the internet
for dudes are crazy,hookers, or dude
okay, she's not crazy.
she's not a hooker.
she's not a dude.
there's this guy i pass on my way to work every day
who's all three-- scares the crap out of me.
there is no way she is above the line
on the hot/crazy scale.
she's not even on the hot/crazy scale.
she's just hot.
wait. "hot/crazy scale"?
let me illustrate.
a girl is allowed to be crazy
as long as she is equally hot.
thus, if she's this crazy,
she has to be this hot.
if she's this crazy,
she has to be this hot.
you want a girl to be above this line,
also known as the vickie mendoza diagonal.
this girl i dated, she played jump rope with that line.
she'd shave her head,then lose ten pounds.
she'd stab me with a fork,then get a boob job.
i should give her a call.
okay, so please,
just play along with her fake story.
we met in a cooking class.
i don't know, ted.
i don't know if i can just play along
with your crazy girlfriend's fake story.
now, if you had said fake breasts...
she's not crazy.
okay. we'll see.
long story short, thank goodness i'm such a bad cook
or i never would have met ted.
oh, crazy.how cute that is.
it's crazy.
you know who else has a really cute story of how they met?
marshal and lily.
you guys should tell that story, right now.
all right.but spoiler alert.
it ends with everyone saying, "aw!"
aw.
starts with it, too.
when you've been a couple as long as marshal and lily,
telling the how-we-met story becomes a choreographed dance.
it was late august, 1996.
lily and i were both freshman moving into...
hewitt hall.
and she needed some help setting up her stereo.
for some unknown reason,
i felt drawn to room 110.
as if she knew
that someone very special was behind that door.
and as fate would have it that someone was marshall.
it was love at first sight.
aw...
i know, right?
now, they perfected that story over hundreds of tellings.
the first time marshall told it to me,
it was a little different.
dude, this black-haired goth chick stopped by today.
want to tap it.
you guys are so lucky.
you know, when ted and i were cooking
and our hands touched for the first time,
i knew right then that after class
he would take me up on the roof,kiss me and give me a rose.
which he did!
say, "aw."
aw.
i know, right?
i'll get the next round,okay, guys?
anybody would be stressed out meeting new people.
she's not crazy.
crazy-generous maybe,buying us drinks.
shut up.
so how marshall and lily met
robin, how did you and barney meet?
no...
no, no, no, no.
no, no, no, no.no, no, no.
no. no. barney and i are not together. no. no.
really? 16 no's?really?
so you're...
single?
yeah.
oh. so, pretty and single and friends with ted.
great.
you know who else is friends with ted?
marshall.
how did we meet?
it was a good story.
i'm going to tell it,right now.
uh, it was the first day of college.
kids, to understand this story,you need to know
that your uncle marshall was doing something
that lots of college kids do.
how do i say this?
he was, uh...let's say, eating a sandwich.
dude, i heard the dean is coming.
put out your sandwich.
good afternoon, sir.
i'm marshall erickson.
"sir"? no, please,just call me ted.
okay, dean ted.
someone's been eating a sandwich.
what? no. really?
i don't know 'cause i don't even know what sandwiches smell like.
my parents are going to donate a lot of money to this school.
so you're bottom bunk that's cool.
i wanted the top bunk anyway.
what do you mean?
i'm you're new roommate.
so unfair.
i didn't realize ted wasn't the dean
until later that night.
you're not the dean.
college-- good times.
oh, i get it. ted told you.i didn't go to college,
so now you're giving me a cute, little backhanded slap.
oh, here we go.
well, while you were busy majoring
in being freakin' beautiful,
i was starting
my own line of handbags.
your own line of handbags?
that's crazy.
these have sold in japan.
robin, have you ever sold anything in japan?
uh, no. but i would love to buy one of them, if...
where can i get one?
i don't have a distributor here yet,
but thanks for rubbing that in.
why are you trying to undermine me in front of ted?
look, there's nothing going on between me and ted.
wow, that just.came out of nowhere.
no, i'm just saying that you have nothing to worry about.
i wasn't worried.are you saying i should be?
no, i'm saying that you shouldn't be.
oh, good, 'cause i'm not.
now, robin,can you just let it go?
you're making all of us really uncomfortable.
you know what else is a good story?
how barney and i met.
barney, tell that story,right now, please.
okay, ted.this is a crazy story.
you're going to love it.
tonight's the first time
i'm taking my deaf brother out
since our mom died.
oh, i'm sorry about that.
no, that's okay.
i have to take care of him now.
of course, i have had to put my dreams on hold
in order to do it,but...
i'm happy to.
he's my brother and i love him.
i'm sorry,it's all still so fresh.
well, man, i'm, uh...i'm really sorry.
wow, you bought that?
what?
i just made that up in mid-pee.
if it worked on you,it's definitely going to work
on the blonde chick at the end of the bar.
unless you're a total idiot.
what's your name?
ted.
are you a total idiot, ted?
well, i'm still having this conversation, so...
well played.
i like you, ted.
ted, i'm going to teach you how to live.
barney.we met at the urinal.
oh, right. hi.
lesson one: lose the goatee;it doesn't go with your suit.
i'm not wearing a suit.
lesson two: get a suit.
suits are cool--exhibit a.
lesson three: don't even think about getting married
until you're 30.
and lesson four:
be totally silent for the next five minutes.
hey, audrey.
uh, this is my deaf brother, edward.
edward!
this is audrey!
you know, i actually know some sign language.


he doesn't sign.
he's embarrassed by his hands.
they're tiny...and lady-like.


what? you...are over your hand issues.
it's about time.


here. call me.
and even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number,
i knew that ted and i would be each others wingmen forever.
barney, it's time you knew.
um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.


great. funny.
god, with a wingman like ted,i might need to resort
to meeting someone in a super,desperate and lame way,
like online.
online.
online.
oh, my god!you told them?!
okay, yes, i told them.
but it's not a big deal.
lots of people meet on the internet.
that whole scene, a stranger across a crowded room thing--
that only happens in the movies.
yeah, that never happens.oh, wait, except you and robin.
that's how you guys met, right?

wait, you guys dated?
for how long?
a year.
but don't worry.
the relationship wasn't that good.
by the end, it was mostly about sex.
which was not that good.
but i was the problem.
i'd just lie there.
ted is, uh,very good.
i'm sure he will get you where you need to go.
can i buy your bags online?
oh, oh, i see what's going on here, ted.
i'm just some random girl to make robin jealous,
and after she takes you back,
you probably won't even remember my name.
come on, blahblah,it's not like that.
well, we're closing in the half.
let's see how blahblah is doing on the crazy/hot scale.
she started the night here,but as the night's progressed,
she's gotten crazier but no hotter,
which has caused her to drift across the mendoza diagonal
and dangerously close to the shelly gilespie zone.
another girl i dated--
she gained 20 pounds and tried to kill me with a brick.
i'm sorry i didn't tell you, but seriously,
there's nothing going on with me and robin.
then why has she been trying to undermine me all night?
i mean, look at her.
she's laughing at me right now.
i'm sorry,it's just, you know,
lily and marshall's story is so romantic.
i just wish we had something like that.
well, their story's not as magical as it seems.
what do you mean?
no, i, i can't, it's,it's kind of a secret.
well, how about i tell you a little secret
about what you might get to do later tonight?
the night before lily met marshall...
...there was this party.

you a freshwoman?
i never use the word "freshman."
sexist.
yeah, i'm a first year.
i'm in hewitt 220.
no way. hewitt 110.
you should totally come by.
maybe i will, hewitt 110.
chug! chug! chug!
chug! chug! chug!
chug!chug! chug!
look at these drunk idiots.
hey, don't drink their two dollar beer.
this is a pinot noir.
from europe.
oh, it's fruity.
yeah, i cut it with some cranberry juice.
it was pretty strong.
do you have a girlfriend?
yeah.
not sure about the whole "long distance" thing, though.
it's like descartes says.
"in order to determine
"whether there is anything we can know with certainty,
we first have to doubt everything we know."
you know?
but as drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning,
she still remembered room 110.
that's why she knocked on the door.
she was looking for me.
oh, my god.
yeah, and in all these years,
lily and i have never even spoken about it,
so again, mum's thword, okay?
you have to tell marshall.
no, if, if he heard that, it would destroy him.
if you don't tell him...
...i will.
oh, come on, you wouldn't.
so, lily,how did you and ted meet?
come on, lily, the real story.
i don't think anyone wants to hear that story.
aw, don't be embarrassed, ted,it was a long time ago.
and i made a huge mistake last night,
but it's like descartes says.
"in order to determine whether there is anything
"we can know with certainty,
we first have to doubt everything we know."
and i now know for certain that i love you, karen.
anyway, call me back when you get this.
i'm also going down to the computer center
to send you an electronic mail.
ted.
this is lily.
no, no, i'm sorry,but i love karen.
yes, that is the unabridged story of how lily and i met.
how embarrassing.
-who wants another round? -that's not the story.
ted, tell 'em.
tell us what?um, lily,
will you help us get the next round?
ted, what's going on?
she knows about us,about how we really met.
yeah, i know,i just told her.
no, the real story.
ted, what are you talking about?
lily... come on.
come on, what?
lily... come on.
ted, i honestly don't know what you're talking about.
lily... come on.
i know that you and ted made out
the night before you met marshall.
what?
ted and i never made out.
yeah... we did.
i only made out with one other guy in college
before i met marshall, and it was just some random dude.
i, i don't even remember his name.
i just call him too much tongue guy.
what? too much tongue guy?
well, i'm not surprised to hear that
coming from unreasonably small mouth opening girl.
that wasn't me.
yes, it was, at the freshman orientation party.
no, no, no, no, no.
no, no.
no, no, no, no, no!
how much fun is this?
all of us reminiscing about how we met me?
robin, have i told you how i met marshall?
uh, yeah,like five or six times--
it was right over there.
here's your problem.
you've only slept with one woman.
those kind of stats are only okay if you're 11,
but tonight
we're getting you a new girl
because,marshall eriksen,
from this moment on, i make all your decisions for you.
i'm sorry,who, who are you again?
this is barney; i met him the other day.
he's kind of a jackass.
i'm teaching ted how to live,
and-- lucky you-- i have room for one more student.
think of me as yoda
as yoda, only instead of being little and green,
i wear suits and i'm awesome.
i'm your bro.
i'm bro-da.
and tonight,
you're going to use the force
to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.
he's going to use force?
cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.
no, the force.
it's a star wars reference.
so we should make lots of star wars references around girls.
that's what you're saying?
i'm not going to cheat on my girlfriend.
yes, you are, with the hottiest that just walked in.
look at her.
how much hotter is she
than your girlfriend?
there's no comparison.
what do you think, ted?
-no. -should i go for it?
don't do it, man.
i mean, think about lily.
you know what? i don't care.
i've been with one woman for too long.
i need me some strange.
pep talk.
you can do this,
but to be more accurate, you probably can't.
you're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you,
so remember, tonight isn't about scoring.
it's about believing that you can do it
even though you probably can't.
go get 'em, tiger.
poor guy's going to crash and burn.
that man is a god.
for like a week after,
barney followed me around
asking me to teach him how to live.
i even got him to do my laundry once.
i thought it was a mr.miyagi kind of thing.
marshall, i need to talk to you.
can we go somewhere in private?
yeah, of course. what's wrong?
lily and ted made out.
what do you think of that, robin?
what are you talking about?
you know that guy i made out with
at the freshman orientation party?
too much tongue guy, yeah.
and you know that girl i made out with
at the freshman orientation party?
unreasonably small mouth opening girl, yeah.
i'm too much tongue guy.
and i'm unreasonably small mouth opening girl.
worst superheroes ever.
oh, baby, i am so sorry.
i dot think you need to be.
i was at that party.
it was dark and, granted,
i had eaten quite a few sandwiches, but i'm 100% sure
that unreasonably small mouth opening girl
was alexa leskeys, not lily.
really?
yeah, i'm positive,
and too much tongue guy was colin o'reilly.
are you sure?
if it wasn't,
i peed in the wrong guy's shampoo, man.
you don't really believe that, do you?
you swore it was lily.
i guess i made a mistake.
must have been alexa.
another girl, ted?
who haven't you made out with?
you know what? i don't need this.
i design handbags, i'm writing a memoir,
i'm a superstar, this is totally my year.
someday the name blahblah will be up in lights.
and, ted, next time you're online
playing world of warcraft,
don't even think about chatting with me.
world of warcraft?
the online
role-playing game?
that's how you two
"met online"?




yeah, it's a really--it's a cool game.
so suffice it to say,
blahblah did not turn out to be your mother,
and as for the girl i made out with at the party,
there wasn't a doubt in my mind that was your aunt lily.
but, you know, that magical story
of how she and uncle marshall met,
it was worth preserving, so i kept my mouth shut.
i guess i made a mistake.
must have been alexa.
until our 20th college reunion
when i ran into alexa leskeys.
so, ted, remember the last time we were here?
you and me?
no idea.
ted... come on.
freshman year, we were both pretty drunk?
that was you?
lily, we never made out.
i know.
so i am not too much tongue guy.
actually...
look what i've confiscated from some kids.
that is a fat sandwich.
i know, right?
chew, chew, chew,chew, swallow.
oh, that's all right,honey.
sandwiches are strong these days.
i can't believe i used to be able to eat
a whole sandwich by myself.
now it's like two bites and i am done.
baby, can we grow sandwiches behind the garage?
dude, we're 42.
w-w-where's my wife?


<i>C'était un après-midi calme
de novembre 2007.</i>
<i>Je travaillais à la maison...
rien pour me distraire.</i>
- C'est incroyable !
- Mon Dieu, j'y crois pas !
- J'ai une grosse nouvelle !
- Mon Dieu !
La mienne est énorme, mais vas-y.
Je viens...
J'ai découvert
la star du porno en Ted Mosby.
De quoi tu parles ?
Je parle de...
"Bienvenue à bord de l'avion du sexe".
Regardez qui joue le rôle du pilote...
Ted Mosby !
Exactement
la même orthographe que mon nom.
C'est une coïncidence marrante,
Barney, enfin peu importe.
- J'ai eu au téléphone la...
- Oh mon Dieu !
Ça explique
l'attitude de mon médecin, l'autre jour.
Ouvrez en grand.
Vous êtes plus habitué
à le dire qu'à l'entendre, hein ?
Ted Mosby...
C'est qui, ce type ?
Pourquoi mon médecin
regarde des pornos ?
Faisons connaissance avec
ton nouveau sosie.
Ou devrais-je dire, ton nouveau zizi.
Je peux vous dire ma nouvelle ?
- C'est assez...
- C'est vraiment bizarre.
Le seul Mosby connu était général
confédéré durant la Guerre civile.
C'est sûrement pas lui.
J'ai eu la place au NRDC !
T'as eu le boulot !
<i>Le NRDC,</i>
<i>ou le Natural Ressources Defense Concil,</i>
<i>se battait pour préserver l'eau,
l'air et la nature des USA.</i>
<i>C'était le job rêvé de Marshall.</i>
- Félicitations !
- Merci.
C'est bizarre
de s'enlacer sur fond de porno.
C'est clair.
Un type entre dans le cockpit.
Serait-ce le pilote, Ted Mosby ?
Un pilote a 3 galons sur sa casquette.
Les capitaines en ont 4,
il est capitaine.
Je suis sûr que le respect des détails
était très important
pour les réalisateurs...
Crado et Dégueu, les frères Grossiers.
Bébé,
j'ai une super nouvelle.
J'espère que c'est pas
que tu as gagné un genre de course.
J'ai eu la place au NRDC.
J'ai un porno avec Ted Mosby.
Mon Dieu, c'est génial !
Je sais, hein ?
Félicitations, Marshall.
Félicitations à nous tous.
Fêtons ça.
Le fait que j'ai trouvé un porno
avec un type nommé Ted Mosby,
allons fêter ça !
C'est lui ?
Parce que ce Ted Mosby sait s'y prendre.
Non, c'est pas lui.
T'entends quoi par
"ce Ted Mosby sait s'y prendre" ?
Je voulais dire,
ce Ted Mosby sait s'y prendre,
comme tous les Ted Mosby !
NRDC, ça le fait !
Mais tu vas quand même
à ton entretien, aujourd'hui, hein ?
<i>L'entretien était pour la firme
Nicholson, Hewitt et West.</i>
<i>Ils représentaient...</i>
<i>à peu près tout ce que Marshall
attaquerait, une fois au NRDC.</i>
Je n'irai pas à l'entretien,
ces personnes sont démoniaques.
Ton père s'est donné beaucoup
de mal pour organiser ça.
Tu peux pas te défiler
à la dernière seconde.
Apparemment, il peut.
Le type, là ! 3 galons !
Mesdames et Messieurs, je vous
présente la star du porno, Ted Mosby.
Je sais quel avion c'est, c'est un...
Boeing !
Vous voyez, c'est bien mieux
que le stage de Marshall.
C'est un vrai boulot.
C'est qui, ce gars ?
On a un lien de parenté ?
Je lui ressemble ?
Difficile à dire. Fais comme ça.
Un tout petit peu, au niveau des yeux.
The Legen... dary Team
http://nosvospersos.blogspot.com
Voici ton eau, au cas où
tu serais déshydraté, Ted Mosby.
Très drôle, Wendy. Maintenant,
on sait que tu mates des pornos.
- Ce Ted Mosby doit être assez célèbre.
- Tu n'as pas tort.
D'après le site web
du meilleur des Ted Mosby,
ça fait 3 mois qu'il est dans
le business et il a fait 125 films.
Ça fait 42 films par mois.
C'est Jude Law ou quoi ?
Hein ?
Il fait plein de films.
Enfin, pas tant que ça
ces derniers temps,
mais il y a deux ans,
il était dans tous les films.
Regardez,
Ted Mosby a été interviewé
dans Adult Video Weekly.
Adult Video Weekly...
Je cherche à joindre Ted Mosby,
c'est Larry Ross de AVW.
Mon Dieu, AVW !
C'est Architecture Vision Weekly.
Depuis tout petit, je lis vos revues.
C'est super.
Bref, je voulais vous interviewer
sur vos derniers projets.
Je dirais pas que ce sont mes projets,
on travaille au moins à 3 dessus.
Une scène à plusieurs,
c'est toujours sympa.
Ouais, je suis très impatient.
Je sais
qu'ils vont pas me faire de cadeaux,
mais ce sont des types super.
Des types ?
Voilà un scoop.
Et ça a duré 20 min de plus.
"Ce projet était tellement exigeant
"que je ne peux vous dire
combien de nuits j'ai passées"
"penché au-dessus d'une table."
Alors, chéri, et ton entretien ?
Intéressant.
Je suis dans le bureau
de Jefferson Coatsworth,
et je me dis :
"je prendrai pas ce boulot."
"Autant dire à ces connards
ce que je pense."
Jefferson Coatsworth n'était pas
ce à quoi je m'attendais.
Marshall ?
Jeff Coatsworth.
Mec,
je suis trop content que tu sois là.
Tu veux une bière ?
<i>Marshall était déconcerté.</i>
<i>Ce type avait l'air sympa.</i>
<i>Bien sûr, c'était pas le cas.</i>
Allez au diable !
Je le referais !
Je suis innocent !
Pourquoi veux-tu travailler
chez Nicholson, Hewitt et West ?
Ouais, Jeff, j'ai beaucoup réfléchi...
Désolé,
je peux pas le faire avec l'air sérieux.
Tu ne veux pas travailler ici,
t'es là parce que ton père
est allé au lycée avec Joe Hewitt.
Le fait est...
que tu viens d'avoir une place au NRDC.
Et c'est génial.
J'aurais pu ne pas aller
vers la voie du profit.
mais je l'ai fait,
et ça me ronge de l'intérieur,
tous les jours.
Je me déteste.
Je me déteste.
C'est un bon.
Technique de séduction classique.
- C'est-à-dire ?
- Je m'en sers tout le temps.
D'abord, je lui paie,
et par "lui" je veux dire toi,
un verre.
Je suis le type
qui lui donne ce qu'elle veut.
Ensuite, je prétends
m'intéresser à ce qui lui tient à coeur.
Pour toi, ce serait l'environnement.
Là, je suis le type super
qui partage son intérêt.
Sans t'en apercevoir, tu te retrouves nu
dans mon appart à crier "Oh !"
Et par "toi", je veux dire "elle".
Il n'essaie pas de me séduire.
Il m'a même pas offert ce boulot.
Ça vient plus tard, au dîner.
Il t'a invité à dîner, n'est-ce pas ?
Laisse-moi t'inviter à dîner,
demain soir, pour te remercier.
Et tu me diras tout sur le NRDC
et on filera la note
à un de mes clients diaboliques.
Je crois pas que ce soit...
Tu connais le boeuf de Kobe ?
Le boeuf le plus cher au monde.
Là où je t'amène,
ils ont du homard de Kobe.
C'est du homard nourri au boeuf de Kobe.
Mon Dieu, il essaie de me séduire !
Pardon, tu vas dîner avec lui ?
Pas question,
j'ai donné ma parole au NRDC.
- Je suis pas ce genre d'avocat.
- Tu devrais y aller.
T'accepteras pas le boulot,
mais tu profiteras de ce super repas.
Ne l'attends pas.
Écoutez ça !
La bio de Ted Mosby
dit que sa ville natale
est ta ville, Shaker Heights, Ohio.
Quoi ?
Ça devient flippant, qui est ce type ?
Je dois le trouver.
C'est ton jour de chance,
il signera des autographes
demain soir à Manhattan,
dans un truc appelé : Adult Video Expo.
Attends, ça veut dire
qu'ils ont des congrès sur le porno ?
Affirmatif. Ou en d'autres termes :
"Que Dieu bénisse l'Amérique".
Ce homard a vraiment le goût de boeuf !
Exact.
Écoute...
On est là juste pour baiser mon client,
qui, pour être franc, le mérite,
mais faut que je dise à mes supérieurs
que je t'ai fait le speech.
Tout d'abord, le salaire de départ.
Nous y voilà.
C'est censé être le gros chiffre
qui va m'impressionner...
C'est...
un très gros chiffre !
Il y a aussi des plus avec...
voiture de société,
frais de représentation, blablabla.
Au fait, tourne-toi
et fais signe à Patrick Swayze.
Je vais essayer de rester cool...
Attends. Tu connais Patrick Swayze !
C'est un client.
Qui nous paie ce vin, à ton avis ?
Sacré Swayze !
À ta santé !
Jeff, tout ceci est très impressionnant,
- mais je...
- Je sais.
Tu vas pas te laisser tenter
par des gros chiffres et des avantages.
Tu vas faire le bon choix.
Prendre le boulot mal payé au NRDC,
vivre sur l'argent de ta famille.
L'argent de ma famille ?
Ta famille a de l'argent, non ?
Non, pas que je sache.
J'ai un oncle
qui a un magasin assez rentable.
NRDC.
Pas d'argent de famille...
Alors, tu ne veux pas d'enfants ?
En fait, je voulais 4 enfants.
Bon.
Les écoles publiques de NY
font peur aux parents
Mais les gamins qui s'en sortent...
Ils s'en sortent avec fierté.
<i>Ça devenait une décision difficile.</i>
<i>Face à une décision difficile,</i>
<i>Je fais une liste des pour
et contre sur un bloc-note jaune.</i>
<i>Marshall connaissait les contre.</i>
<i>Il y avait une chose qu'il ignorait.</i>
<i>À mettre absolument dans les pour.</i>
- Lily, t'es institutrice ?
- Oui.
<i>Robin allait
demander à Lily LA question.</i>
Et tu touches
un salaire d'instit, hein ?
Oui.
<i>Celle que Lily craignait
depuis des années.</i>
Comment tu peux
te payer ces fringues, si chères ?
J'achète pendant les soldes.
Elles étaient dans le placard
quand on a emménagé.
Je vole.
Je suis une criminelle.
J'ai tiré sur un homme
pour le voir mourir.
<i>C'est ainsi que Lily montra
sa boîte de la honte à Robin.</i>
Lily, c'est dingue !
- Combien as-tu de cartes de crédit ?
- Je sais pas.
Combien tu dois ?
Je sais pas.
J'arrive pas à croire
que tant de gens aiment autant le porno.
Y compris ce type qui bosse
aux ressources dans ma boîte. Salut !
Saluons-nous avec embarras.
Ça va aller.
Allez, trouvons
mon moi-bizarre et filons d'ici.
Oh, je comprends.
Ted Mosby, la non-star du porno,
trouve tout ceci vulgaire et dégoûtant.
Tu sais qui d'autre était vu
comme vulgaire et dégoûtant ?
Shakespeare.
Mais ses thèmes : amour, luxure,
désir interdit étaient universels.
C'est pourquoi
son oeuvre est intemporelle.
Comme le sera tout ceci.
Dans 400 ans,
Une classe de théâtre de lycée donnera
une représentation courageuse et
pleine d'esprit de "La Fête du Boeuf 7".
Oh, mon Dieu !
Lily, c'est une énorme dette.
Comment tu t'es mis
dans cette situation ?
Je ne sais pas.
Quand un truc me déprime,
je fais des achats.
- Madame, tout va bien ?
- Je viens de me disputer avec ma mère.
Elle ne me comprend pas du tout.
Je m'étais juré qu'enseigner
serait un moyen
de soutenir ma carrière de peintre.
Mais, je ne peins plus du tout.
Je viens d'avoir
une grosse facture de carte de crédit.
- Marshall est au courant ?
- Non.
Vous êtes le couple qui se dit tout !
Bon Dieu, Lily, tu lui envoies
des textos quand il est aux chiottes.
C'est pour qu'il sache que je l'attends.
Attends, je comprends maintenant.
Quand tu as dit :
Mais tu vas quand même
à ton entretien, aujourd'hui, hein ?
Puis :
Tu devrais. T'accepteras pas le boulot,
mais tu profiteras de ce super repas.
Tu le poussais
à prendre ce boulot bien payé.
Je sais.
Je suis terrible
d'essayer de lui faire faire ça.
Terrible.
Il doit le prendre.
Comment tu vas payer
toutes ces dettes, sinon ?
Lily, tu dois lui dire
avant qu'il refuse le boulot.
T'as raison. Je me sens si mal.
- Y a des soldes...
- On ne va pas faire les boutiques.
Le voilà. Allons-y.
Pourquoi je suis si nerveux
avec les célébrités ?
Salut, Ted Mosby !
Je suis Ted Mosby.
- Ted Mosby, c'est toi !
- On se connaît ?
C'est un honneur de vous rencontrer.
Starney Binson... Barney Stinson.
Merde.
On se connaît.
Mon vrai nom est Steve Bill.
J'étais en CM1 quand t'étais 3e.
Un jour, j'étais derrière l'école
et des 5es me cassaient la gueule.
Je me souviens. C'était toi ?
Oui, mais tu les en as empêchés.
Tu leur as dit de s'en prendre
à quelqu'un de leur taille.
J'ai fait le voeu, alors,
que quand je deviendrai quelqu'un,
je te rendrai honneur.
Alors, tu as pris mon nom
pour le premier rôle
de "Bienvenue au camion du sexe".
Écoute, Ted.
Tu peux arrêter d'utiliser mon nom ?
J'essaie de faire carrière
en tant qu'architecte.
Architecte !
Tu veux dire,
comme un architecte du sexe ?
Pardon ?
C'est pas mal,
ça ferait un super titre de film.
Ted Mosby, architecte du sexe.
En fait, je cherche un nouveau projet,
je tourne vendredi prochain.
Écoute, y a pas un autre moyen
de me rendre honneur ?
Sauf ton respect.
T'es pas en colère, hein ?
Je le savais.
Mon père m'avait dit :
"Plante un arbre en Israël."
Quel idiot !
Je pensais que ça te ferait plaisir.
C'est le cas, mais je me sens coupable.
C'est pas moi qui t'ai sauvé,
ce jour-là.
Celui qui t'a sauvé...
s'appelait...
Lance Defer.
Lance Defer.
Vraiment ?
Tu le sais peut-être pas, mais dans
ma branche, c'est un nom qui déchire.
J'imagine bien.
Je vois déjà l'affiche.
Lance Defer, architecte du sexe.
- Avec Ted Mosby.
- J'adore.
<i>Marshall et Jeff
sont restés tard au restaurant.</i>
<i>Si tard que Marshall
a dormi sur le canapé de Jeff.</i>
<i>Le lendemain, Marshall prit part à
la tradition aussi vieille que la ville.</i>
<i>La marche de la honte.</i>
<i>Un long voyage avec les regrets
de ce qu'on a fait la veille.</i>
Je prends le boulot.
C'était super hier.
Je te rappelle.
Il t'appellera pas.
- T'as eu mon message, j'ai dormi...
- Oui. Écoute.
J'ai quelque chose à te dire.
J'ai aussi quelque chose à te dire.
Moi, c'est assez énorme.
Vas-y d'abord.
J'ai pris le boulot.
Je suis désolé, j'étais bourré.
Et il y avait ce nuage
de fumée de cigare, et le whisky.
Et Swayze !
Et ils m'offrent quelque chose comme...
... comme beaucoup d'argent.
Combien ?
Tiens.
C'est parfaitement dégueulasse, je sais.
Je me suis vendu
pour un énorme paquet
d'argent dégoûtant.
Argent dégoûtant !
Ça pourrait aider notre future famille.
Avoir une sécurité financière,
payer l'école de droit.
L'école de droit !
Où je suis allé pour
aider à protéger l'environnement.
Pas pour aider à le détruire.
Et pour quoi ?
Pour un paquet d'argent.
Arrête de crier.
Marshall, tu sais ce que j'aime faire
dans de telles situations ?
Si tu me dis de faire une liste
de pour et de contre, je vais te gifler.
J'allais pas dire ça.
Deux bières.
Et Ted, voilà le bloc-note jaune.
Bloc-note jaune ?
J'ai commandé des frites.
Tu devrais peut-être l'utiliser
pour noter les commandes.
Les mecs, je ne sais pas quoi faire.
Prends l'argent.
L'argent, c'est bien.
L'argent, c'est le bonheur !
Si je bosse là-bas, je représenterais
la plus diabolique des sociétés.
Ça ressemble
à une liste de pour et de contre.
Lily, tu dois lui dire.
Tu peux l'aider à prendre sa décision.
Je trouve
qu'il se débrouille bien tout seul.
Très bien.
J'ai quelque chose à te dire qui
va t'aider à prendre ta décision.
Oh, bien sûr. Tu connais
mon coeur mieux que moi.
Tu sais ce qui est le mieux
pour moi et pour nous...
Je t'en prie, dis-moi quoi faire.
Je pense
que tu devrais prendre le job au NRDC.
Oui, bien sûr que je devrais !
Les mecs,
je vais sauver la planète Terre !
Je dois appeler Jeff.
- C'est quoi ton problème ?
- Je peux pas lui demander
de se rendre malheureux
pour une erreur que j'ai faite !
C'est mon problème, je le résoudrai.
C'est vraiment adorable.
- C'est des nouvelles boucles ?
- T'es ma mère ou quoi ?
Jeff, salut.
- C'est Marshall.
- <i>Salut, Marshall.</i>
J'ai quelque chose à te dire.
Ça me gêne
de faire ça au téléphone.
<i>Alors, ne le fais pas.</i>
Avant de dire quoi que ce soit,
viens faire un tour
dans cette super limousine, avec moi.
On va où ?
Au Tuckahoe Funland.
Désolé,
j'ai eu l'impression d'entendre :
Tuckahoe Funland. L'usine
magique où les rêves sont fabriqués.
Monte.
- Mec, j'adore cet endroit.
- Moi aussi, vieux.
Alors, que voulais-tu me dire ?
Je peux pas travailler pour vous.
Je sais, mec.
C'est bon.
Marshall Ericksen
veut préserver l'environnement.
Pour que nos enfants puissent
en profiter autant que nous. Compris.
Bien. Merci.
Je regarde en bas,
et je vois les enfants s'amuser ici.
Ouais, car quelqu'un
s'est battu pour préserver ça.
Si cet endroit devait fermer,
ce serait une tragédie.
La bonne nouvelle, c'est que...
ça n'arrivera jamais.
Tu ne le permettras pas.
Car, quand tu travailleras
pour nous, ton seul client...
... sera cet endroit.
Tuckahoe Funland.
Je prends le job.
Et le mieux, c'est que je vais pas
représenter une société diabolique.
Je vais représenter...
Tuckahoe Funland.
L'endroit le moins diabolique au monde.
<i>C'est ce que pensait Marshall.</i>
<i>Scandale de la sécurité chez Funland<i>
<i>3 morts chez Funland<i>
<i>Des bactéries
dans les saucisses de Funland.<i>
Je ferais bien de le surveiller.
<i>Bonne chance là-dedans,
mon bébé. Je crois en toi.<i>
Je l'ai.
Lance Defer,
architecte du sexe, avec Ted Mosby.
Formidable.
Vous remarquerez que
je suis dans les crédits.
J'ai fait de la prospection de location.
Voilà le plan pour le nouvel
immeuble international du sexe.
Ça ressemble vraiment
à notre appartement.
Ça l'est.
Faut que je te rende ça.
Oh, architecte du sexe,
tu l'as encore fait !
Allons célébrer ça sur le canapé.
it was a quiet november afternoon in 2007.
i was working from home,
because, you know, no distractions.
-this is incredible! -oh, my god!
i can't believe it!
-i have big news. -oh, my god!
okay, my thing's pretty huge.
-but fine, you can go first. -okay, i just
-found out... -i found a porno starring ted mosby!
what are you...
what are you, what you're talking about?
i'm talking about welcome to the sex plane,
and look who plays the navigator,
ted mosby.
it is the same exact spelling as my name.
okay, you know,
cute coincidence, barney.
whatever.
i just got off the phone with the nr...
oh, my god, this totally explains the thing
at my doctor's the other day.
open wide.
i guess you're more used to saying that
than hearing it, huh, ted mosby?
who is this guy?
and why's my doctor watching porn?
all right, let's meet your new doppelganger.
or should i say doppelbanger?
guys, guys, guys!
can i tell my news?
-it's pretty... -this is really bizarre.
the only other famous mosby i know
was a confederate general during the civil war.
probably not the same guy.
i got the job at the nrdc!
you got the job! oh! yeah.
the nrdc, or national resources defense council,
fought for clean water,
air and to preserve america's wilderness.
it was marshall's dream job.
-congrats, buddy! -thanks.
it's kind of weird hugging with porn on.
yeah, it really is.
hey, hey-o!
new guy entering the cockpit.
could it be the navigator, ted mosby?
uh... no.
no, navigators have three stripes on their hats.
captains have four.
that guy's a captain.
yeah, and i'm sure complete accuracy
in all those details was very important to the directors...
"dirt and skank, the raunch brothers."
baby, i have some exciting news!
i hope it's not that you just won some sort of race here.
i got the job at the nrdc!
and i found a porno starring ted mosby!
oh my god, that's amazing!
i know, right?
oh, congratulations, marshall!
congratulation to us all!
oh, let's go celebrate!
the fact that i found a porno starring a guy named ted mosby--
let's do it!
oh, is that him?
cause that ted mosby really knows what he's doing.
no, that's not him.
what do you mean,
"that" ted mosby really knows what he's doing.
oh, no.
no, i meant, that ted mosby,
he really knows what he's doing.
like all ted mosbys.
wow, nrdc!
way to go, marshall.
but you're
still gonna go to your job interview today, right, baby?
marshall had an interview
at a firm called nicholson, hewitt and west.
they represented
pretty much everybody marshall was going to sue
once he started at the nrdc.
i'm not doing that interview.
those people are evil.
marshall, your dad went through a lot of trouble to set this up.
you can't just pull out at the last second.
apparently you can.
ted, ted, ted, guy in the hat!
three stripes!
ladies and gentlemen, i give you ted mosby, porn star.
i know what kind of plane this is.
it's a "boing."
see.
this is way better than marshall's internship.
it's a real job.
who is this guy?
are we related?
do, do i look like him?
it's hard to tell.
go, go like this.
-oh, yeah, a little bit. -yeah.
more aroud the eyes. oh, i do see that.
and here's your water,
in case you're dehydrated, ted mosby.
very funny, wendy.
now we know you watch porn.
this ted mosby must be getting kind of famous.
mm. you're not wrong.
according to the web site,
of the far superior ted mosby...
...he's been in the business three months,
and he's made 125 movies.
that's 42 movies a month.
who is he, jude law?
right?
he makes a lot of movies.
i mean,
not so much lately,
but maybe, like, two years ago,
-you couldn't go to a movie without... -shh...
oh, hey, look, check it out.
ted mosby did an interview in adult video weekly.
adult video weekly?
oh, no.
hello?
hi, i'm looking for ted mosby.
it's leonard ross from avw.
oh, my god!
A.V.W?
it's architecture vision weekly!
wow, i have been reading your magazine
since i was a little kid.
well, that's a bummer.
anyway, i'm calling to interview you about your latest project.
well, i don't want to say it's my project.
i mean, i'll be working with at least three partners.
oh! group scene. always fun.
yeah, yeah, i'm really looking forward to it.
i mean, i know they're gonna ride me pretty hard
but they're great guys.
guys?
whoa, there's a scoop.
that interview went on for 20 more minutes.
"this project was so demanding,
"i can't tell you how many nights
i spent bent over a table."
oh, hey, baby, how'd the interview go?
um, interesting.
there i am in the office of jefferson coatsworth,
and i figure i'm not gonna take this job anyway,
i might as well give this old bastard a piece of my mind.
jefferson coatsworth
wasn't what i expected.
marshall,
jeff coatsworth.
hello.
dude, i am so, so psyched that you're here.
can i beer ya?
marshall was thrown.
this guy seemed nice.
of course, he wasn't.

go-go to hell!
i'd do it again!
i'm innocent.
i'm innocent.
marshall,
why do you want to work
at nicholson, hewitt & west?
right, um, okay, jeff,
i've actually given this a lot of thought...
i'm sorry. stop.
i can't do this with a straight face.
you don't want to work here.
you're only here 'cause your dad went to high school
with joe hewitt.
fact is,
you just got a sweet job at the nrdc.
and it's awesome.
man, i could
have gone the non-profit route.
i didn't.
and it eats me up inside every day.
i hate myself.
i hate myself.
oh, he's good.
classic seduction technique.
what do you mean?
oh, i use it all the time.
first i buy her-- and by her i mean you-- a drink.
now, i'm the guy who gets her
what she wants.
then i pretend to care
about whatever idiotic thing she cares about.
for you, that would be the environment.
now, i'm the great
guy who shares her interests.
and before you know it, you're naked in my apartment
shouting, "oh, oh, bar-r-r-ne-e-ey!"
and by you,
i mean her.
he is not trying to seduce me.
he didn't even offer me the job.
that comes later.
at dinner.
he did invite you to dinner, didn't he?
let me buy you dinner
tomorrow night
as a thank you, okay?
you'll tell me all about the nrdc,
and we'll charge it all to one of my evil clients.
i, you know, i don't know,
-i don't know if... -marshall,
you know what kobe beef is?
the most expensive beef in the world.
the place i'm taking you has kobe lobster.
that is lobster fed with kobe beef.
oh, my god, he's trying to seduce me.
so are you gonna go to dinner with him?
no. no way.
i promised myself to the nrdc.
i'm not that kind of lawyer.
oh, you should go.
i mean, you're not gonna take the job,
but you might as well
get a great meal out of the deal.
don't wait up.
guys, guys, guys, check this out.
ted mosby porn star's bio
says his hometown is your hometown.
shaker heights, ohio.
what?
okay, this is getting creepy.
who, who is this guy?
i gotta find him.
well, it's your lucky day.
he's gonna be signing
autographs tomorrow night in manhattan
at something called the adult video expo.
mm. wait.
are you telling me
that they actually have conventions for porn?
affirmative.
or to put it another way...
god bless america.
you can really taste the beef in that lobster.
right.
listen,
i know we're only here to screw over my client,
who quite frankly deserves it...
but i gotta be able to tell the guys upstairs
i gave you the spiel, okay?
so, first up,
starting salary.
okay.
here we go.
this is the big number that's supposed to impress me and--
that is a big number.
there's also a signing bonus,
uh, use of a company car,
expense account, blah blah blah.
hey, by the way, turn around and wave to patrick swayze.

i'm going to, uh, try to remain cool.
but you know patrick swayze?!
he's a client.
who do you think bought us this wine.
crazy swayze.
cheers, buddy.
okay. no.
jeff, this is all very impressive,
-but i just don't think that... -listen, i know,
i know.
you're gonna be tempted by big numbers and fancy perks.
you're gonna do the noble thing,
take the low-paying job at the nrdc,
live off your family money.
family money?
you do have family money, don't you?
no, um, not that i know of.
i do have an uncle who owns a, a pretty successful bait shop.
nrdc.
no family money.
so you don't plan on having kids?
actually, i, i want to have four kids.
new york public schools make a lot of parents nervous,
but the kids who walk out, walk out proud.
he was surely doing a tough decision
now, kids, when i'm faced with a tough decision
i like to make a list of pros and cons.
marshall knew all cons
but that is one thing he didn't konw
a big guy live in a pros con
lily, you're a kindergarten teacher.
-yeah. -cause robin
was about to ask lily the one question...
an-and you make a kindergarten teacher's salary, right?
yeah.
...that lily had been dreading for years.
well, how do you afford all of these expensivelothes?
i shop the sales.
they were in the closet when we moved in.
i steal.
i'm a criminal.
i once shot a man just to watch him die.
lily?
okay.
that's when lily showed robin her box of shame.
lily, this is nuts.
how many credit cards do you have?
i don't know.
well, how much do you owe?
i don't know!
i can't believe this many people love porn this much,
including that guy who works in human resources at my firm.
let's just wave at each other awkwardly.
that'll make it better.
dude, come on, let's just find bizarro me
and get out of here.
oh, i get it.
ted mosby, non-porn star,
thinks this is all crude and disgusting.
you know wholse was considered
crude and disgusting?
shakespeare.
hmm. but his themes--
love, lust, forbidden desire-- were universal,
which is why his work has stood the test of time.
and so will all this.
400 years from now, some high school drama class
will be doing a plucky, spirited production
of beef party vii.
oh, my god, lily, that is a lot of debt.
how did you get yourself into this situation?
i don't know what it is.
when i feel down about something, i shop.
ma'am, is everything okay? oh,
i just had a huge fight with my mother.
she doesn't understand me at all.
i swore that teaching would be a way
to support my painting career,
but i never paint anymore.
i just got a huge credit card bill.
does marshall know?
no.
but you guys are the couple
who tell each other everything.
and for god's sakes, lily,
you text him while he's on the can.
well, i just want him to know i'm rooting for him.
wait, okay, this all makes sense.
so when you said...
but you're still going to go
to your job interview today, right, baby?
and then...
oh, you should go.
i mean, you're not going to take the job,
but you might as well get a great meal out of the deal.
you were pushing him
into taking that high- paying corporate job.
i know.
it's terrible that i was trying to get him to do that.
terrible
he has to take it
i mean, how else are you going to pay off all that debt?
lily, you have
to tell him about this before he turns down that job.
you're right.
i feel awful.
-you know there is a sale...-we're not going to shopping
ooh, there he is. come on, let's go.
why do i get so nervous around celebrities?
hi, ted mosby.
i'm ted mosby.
ted mosby, it's you.
have we met?
mr. mosby, it is an honor to meet you, sir.
starney binson.
barney stinson.
damn it.
we have met.
my real name is steve biel.
when i was in fourth grade, you were in ninth,
one day i was behind the school
and a bunch of seventh graders
were just beating the crap out of me.
oh, yeah, i remember. that was you?
yeah, but you pulled them off me.
you told them to go pick on someone their own size.
i vowed right then that when i made something of myself,
i would honor you somehow.
so you took my name and starred
in welcometo the sex truck?
yeah.
um, yeah, listen, ted, you got to stop using my name.
i-i'm trying to make a career as an architect.
architect, huh?
you mean like a sex architect?
-what? -yeah, you know, you're on to something.
that would make a great title of a film.
ted mosby, sex architect.
you know, i'm actually looking for a new project
to shoot next friday afternoon.
yeah, listen, isn't, isn't there some other way
you could honor me?
with all due respect.
wait, you're not mad, are you?
oh, man, i knew it.
my father said, "just plant a tree in israel."
i'm such an idiot.
i guess i thought you'd be psyched.
i am.
i am; it's just
i feel a little guilty beuse i'm not
the one who saved you that day.
the guy who actually saved you was...
named... lance hardwood.
lance hardwood, yeah.
really? mm.
you know, you might not know this,
but in my business, that's kind of a killer name.
yeah, i guess, i guess it is.
i can see the poster now.
lance hardwood, sex architect.
starring...
ted mosby.
i love it.
marshall and jeff stayed pretty late at the restaurant.
they stayed so late
that marshall crashed on jeff's couch,
and the next day,
marshall took part in a sunday morning
tradition as old as the city itself
the walk of shame,
the long journey home after doing something you regret
the night before.
i'll take the job.
that's awesome!
great time last night.
i'll call you later.
he's not going to call you.
um, did you get my message?
i just, i crashed uptown. yeah, yeah.
listen, i have, uh, something to tell you.
uh, i have something i need to tell you also.
mine's pretty huge.
you go first.
-well... -i took
the job.
i'm sorry.
i'm so sorry.
i was drunk,
and it was a haze of cigars and scotch and swayze,
and they offered me, like,
like, like, like, a lot of money.
oh, marshall.
how much money?
here.
it's completely despicable.
i know, i know, i sold out
for a huge pile of disgusting money,
disgusting money that could help our future family
have some financial security
and could help pay for law school.
law school.
law school that i went to to help protect the environment,
not help destroy it.
and for what?
for, for... a lot of money.
okay, okay, you've got to stop screaming.
listen, marshall,
you know what i like to do in situations like this?
ted, if you say make a list of pros and cons,
i'm going to smack you.
i wasn't going to say that.
okay, two beers,
and ted, here's that yellow legal pad you asked for.
yellow legal pad?
i ordered fries.
maybe you should use this to write down people's orders.
guys, i, i don't know what to do.
take the money.
money is good, money is happiness.
if i work there,
i'll be representing the most evil corporations in the world.
kind of sounds like a pro and con list to me.
lily, you have to tell him.
you can help him make this decision.
oh, i think he's doing fine on his own.
@#$%^&*@#$%^&*
all right.
marshall,
i have something to say,
and it's going to help you make your decision.
oh, of course, you know my heart better than i do.
you know what's best for me and for us.
please, please tell me what to do.
i think you should take the job at the nrdc.
of course i should, of course i should.
guys,
i'm going to save the planet earth.
i got to go call jeff.
what is the matter with you?
i can't ask him to make himself miserable
because of a mistake i made.
it's my problem; i'll figure it out.
that's really sweet.
are those new earrings?
what are you, my mom?
jeff, hey, um, it's marshall.
hey, marshall.
i have something that i need to tell you.
i feel really weird about doing this over the phone.
then don't.
before you say anything,
come take a ride in this awesome limo with me.
where are we going?
tuckahoe funland.
i'm sorry.
it sounded like you said tuckahoe funland,
the magic factory where dreams are made.
get in.
man, i-i love this place.
me, too, buddy.
so what did you want to tell me?
i can't work for you.
i know, dude.
it's fine.
marshall eriksen wants to preserve the environment,
so that our children can enjoy it as we have.
i get it.
good. thank you.
i look down and see children enjoying this place.
yeah, because somebody fought to preserve it.
if they ever shut this place down, it would be a tragedy.
well, the good news is, that'll never happen.
you won't let it.
because when you work for us,
your only client will be this place--
tuckahoe funland.
i'm taking the job.
hey! all right.
and the best part is
i'm not even going to be representing
some sort of evil corporation.
i will be representing tuckahoe funland,
the least evil place in the world.
or so marshall thought.



oh, i'd better check on him.

lance hardwood,
sex architect starring ted mosby.
terrific.
you'll notice i'm in the credits.
i did some location scouting.
here are the plans for the new international sex building.
wow, that really looks like our apartment.
it is.
oh, i should return these.
sex architect, you've done it again.
let's go celebrate on the couch.


<i>Les enfants,
tout le monde commet des erreurs.</i>
<i>Cette fille, Meg, par exemple,</i>
<i>elle a commis une erreur.</i>
<i>Une erreur du nom de Barney.</i>
J'ai cru que j'allais épouser
mon dernier petit ami, mais...
ce type avait
des soucis avec l'engagement.
Toute notre relation,
c'est trois semaines de ma vie
qu'on ne me rendra jamais.
Moi, j'adore l'engagement.
J'aurais aimé épouser l'engagement.
- J'ai rencontré une fille.
- Ouais ?
Si joyeuse et pleine de vie,
pas fausse du tout.
- Tu parles de ses seins, hein ?
- Si. (C)
C'était pas de l'espagnol,
mais son bonnet.
Tape là.
Alors, ces seins...
- décris-les-moi.
- D'accord, Ted.
Imagine les têtes
de deux bébés irlandais.
Appelons-les :
et :
Pitié, arrête.
<i>Quand on se marie,
on commence à mûrir sur certains points.</i>
<i>Et pour Lily et Marshall,</i>
<i>ces certains points étaient,
pour la plupart...</i>
<i>moi.</i>
T'as pas entendu que je me rasais !
Je croyais que tu te rasais le visage.
Il est évident que non !
Paye ! Minette !
Hé !
Il est 3 h du matin.
Ça pue, là-dedans.
Ted a dit que c'était bon.
Hé, Marshall, encore debout ?
Tu vas bosser demain ?
<i>Ça commençait à bouillonner,</i>
<i>jusqu'au jour où...</i>
Combien de fois je devrai
te répéter de refermer
le pot de beurre de cacahuètes ?
C'est ce genre de connerie,
d'oubli immature
qui me donne l'impression
de vivre dans une <i>Real World House</i>.
Et pas les premiers où tout le monde
avait un boulot, une conscience sociale.
Je parle de Hawaï.
Et après, j'en peux plus !
Ted, Lily et moi sommes mariés,
maintenant,
il est temps !
On se prend un appart !
En fait...
c'est moi qui ai oublié le couvercle,
désolée.
<i>Il était quand même temps
d'aller de l'avant.</i>
<i>Ils décidèrent donc
de se chercher une location.</i>
En voilà un.
Ancien immeuble,
récemment rénové, parquet,
lumineux, deux chambres,
deux salles de bain.
Ouais, mais c'est à vendre pas à louer.
Exact...
<i>Votre oncle Marshall aime à dire
qu'il a commis trois énormes erreurs.</i>
<i>Voici la première...</i>
Saute ! Poule mouillée !
Saute ! Trouillard !
<i>Voici la 2e.</i>
<i>Et voici la 3e et la plus grosse.</i>
- On devrait s'acheter un appart.
- Hein ?
Chérie, l'immobilier est toujours
un bon investissement.
<i>C'est faux.</i>
Et le marché est très favorable,
en ce moment.
<i>Faux.</i>
Et grâce à mon nouveau job,
on est en mesure de se le permettre.
<i>Faux.</i>
<i>Car Lily avait un secret.</i>
Bonjour,
je m'appelle Lily et je suis
accro au shopping.
Bonjour, Lily.
Vous faites pas ça, ici ?
Désolée.
Poursuis.
J'achète des articles
de grands couturiers
que je ne peux me payer.
J'ai 15 cartes de crédit,
et elles sont toutes dépassées.
Et personne, hors de cette salle,
pas même mon mari, ne sait.
Et je me sens extrêmement mal
parce que tout ce que je désire, là,
c'est savoir
où tu as acheté ces chaussures.
Elles sont adorables.
On peut pas acheter, on est endettés.
Ouais, le prêt
pour mes études est assez conséquent.
Je te pardonne.
Quoi ?
Je dis juste qu'en tant qu'épouse,
c'est pas grave que t'aies dépensé
des milliers de dollars
dans la marque : "École de Droit",
car je sais que ça te fait du bien
et que ça te rend joli.
Jetons un oeil à cet appart.
C'est où ?
C'est dans un quartier appelé...
"Dowisetrepla".
Oh, je vois,
vous n'êtes pas de New York.
- Si, on vit dans l'Upper West Side.
- Ne soyez pas gênés.
Écoutez, ici à NY, on raccourcit
les noms de tous les quartiers.
Soho, Tribeca, Nolita.
Ah ouais !
"Dowisetrepla".
Je suis de NY, je connais ce quartier.
Je viens de la ville en D.
Personne n'appelle ça la ville en D.
Dowisetrepla est le quartier montant.
et je dois vous dire que dans cette
fourchette de prix vous ne trouverez...
Je vais vous arrêter tout de suite.
Ne vous embêtez à argumenter,
c'est beaucoup trop cher pour nous.
En plus, on cherche depuis peu.
<i>C'est ce que Marshall aurait dû dire.</i>
Je vais vous arrêter tout de suite.
Je l'adore, on signe !
The Legen... dary Team
http://nosvospersos.blogspot.com
Merci d'être venus si vite.
J'étais jamais venu dans ce coin.
Je croyais que
cette partie de la ville était de l'eau.
Non, mec.
C'est Dowisetrepla.
Dowisetrepla ?
C'est l'abréviation d'un truc ?
Il est de l'Ohio.
Dowisetrepla, c'est le quartier montant.
Ça pourrait être le point de départ
de notre famille.
Je m'y vois déjà.
Allez, faites monter, les gars.
C'est bon, ça.
Qui veut des pancakes au chocolat ?
Merci, maman.
Ça va être trop bien.
Mon Dieu, Lily, t'as vu cette cuisine ?
Je sais, elle est formidable, hein ?
- J'aime tellement...
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
C'est pas dans tes moyens, ta dette est
de la taille de mont Waddington.
Waddington ?
C'est la plus grande montagne au Canada,
environ 4 000 m de hauteur.
Des mètres ?
Ne laisse pas Marshall
tomber amoureux de cet appart.
Je sais, mais...
je lui dis quoi ?
Je sais pas. Dis-lui que t'as vu
un fantôme, que c'est hanté.
Tu connais vraiment mal Marshall.
Alors, où sont les propriétaires ?
Ils ont pris 2 semaines
de vacances en France.
Je vois. Entre vous et moi,
l'appart m'intéresse aussi.
Y aurait-il un moyen
pour que je revienne plus tard
le voir pendant que
vous leur montrez autre chose ?
Le code de l'entrée est 4021,
et voici ma carte.
T'es sérieux ?
T'essaies de doubler Marshall et Lily ?
Tu me crois dénué de morale ?
Je veux juste faire croire à une fille
que c'est mon appart.
Comme ça, je la culbute une fois
et on se reverra pas.
Je suis pas un monstre.
Écoutez,
sans vous mettre la pression,
il y a un autre couple
qui a montré beaucoup d'intérêt.
Je comprends votre manège.
"Un autre couple".
Je vous en prie.
Ce truc est à la 1re page
du guide de l'agent immobilier.
On gobe pas ça.
<i>C'est que Marshall aurait dû dire.</i>
Un autre couple ?
On le veut, vendez-le-nous,
on vous donnera un bon bonus !
Viens, Marshall, je peux te parler ?
Marshall, je sais pas si
c'est vraiment le bon moment d'acheter.
On le fait pas pour maintenant,
mais pour notre futur.
T'imagines : fonder une famille ici ?
Persephone, Daphne.
Ce seront de parfaites additions
pour notre show mère-filles au Met.
C'est superbe, les filles.
Qui veut des crêpes au chocolat ?
Alors, qu'en dites-vous ?
Je l'adore, mais Marshall...
j'aurais dû te dire ça,
il y a longtemps...
on ne peut se permettre
l'achat d'un appart parce que...
j'ai trop de dettes
avec mes cartes de crédit.
Je suis vraiment désolée.
<i>C'est ce qu'elle aurait dû dire.</i>
Je l'adore, signons !
On peut l'avoir à crédit ?
À Lily et Marshall et
à leur avancée vers l'ère adulte.
Et glou et glou et glou !
Buvez !
Bravo !
- Autre chose ?
- Oui.
Ça fait des années que je mate ce truc.
Wendy, amène-moi cette énorme
et risible bouteille de champagne
T'es sûr ? Ça n'a jamais été réfrigéré.
Je crois qu'un temps,
y a eu un poisson dedans.
Chérie, une fois que tu as vendu,
arrête de vendre.
D'accord, mais faut
que vous m'aidiez à la porter.
D'accord.
C'est parti.
Je sais à quoi tu penses :
je devrais dire la vérité à Marshall.
J'ai pensé à tout.
On fait la demande de prêt sous le nom
de Marshall, il n'en saura jamais rien.
Pendant ce temps, je travaille
doucement sur ma dette.
Juste après avoir meublé l'appart.
J'ai vu ce magnifique
canapé en cuir, aujourd'hui.
Tu devrais faire de la télé-réalité.
Bien. Bien.
Attends ! Ce bouchon
a la taille d'une balle de softball
et tu le pointes direct sur Wendy !
<i>C'est ce qu'il aurait dû dire.</i>
<i>Quand on pense acheter un appart,</i>
<i>il est toujours bon
de revoir les lieux la nuit.</i>
Bienvenue dans mon humble demeure.
C'est sympa.
Fais comme chez toi.
Je t'en prie, mets-toi à l'aise.
Si quelque chose te plaît, prends-le.
Qui sont ces gens ?
Mes parents.
Ils sont asiatiques.
C'est un couple chinois
qui voulait un bébé blanc,
ça marche dans les deux sens.
- C'est toi qui as fait ça ?
- Tu m'as eu.
Ma soeur m'a appris
à cuisiner et à écouter.
- Je me sens comme chez moi, ici.
- Je suis content.
Parfois, c'est pas mon cas.
Un tel endroit
aurait vraiment besoin d'une femme.
Je sais qu'il est trop tôt
pour penser à toi en tant...
Mon Dieu, je te fais peur.
C'est juste que...
je me sens en sécurité avec toi.
je voulais pas...
<i>Le lendemain, Lily et Marshall
allèrent voir courtier pour un prêt.</i>
On peut les avoir en petites coupures ?
Avant d'avoir l'appart, je veux mettre
ça dans une piscine et y nager nu.
- Elle est super.
- Merci.
Allez, on se remet au boulot.
D'accord, Mme Aldrin, j'ai besoin
de votre numéro de compte.
Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
Vous avez celui de Marshall.
Oui, mais puisque vous êtes mariés,
vous aurez un prêt commun.
On peut faire ça
sous le nom de mon mari ?
C'est lui le maître de maison.
Il ramène l'argent. Enfin, les femmes
peuvent avoir des propriétés ?
Allez, donne-lui ton numéro.
Mon numéro est le...
55940182.
Entendu.
Voyons quel taux je peux vous obtenir.
Moins de 6 %, s'il vous plaît.
Voilà.
Félicitations,
vous avez droit à un prêt à 18 %.
Impossible, c'est pas possible.
Vous avez de la chance d'y avoir droit.
Sortons de là, Marshall.
Je ne comprends pas.
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
Vous avez une sacrée dette.
Mon prêt étudiant.
Super.
Je croyais qu'on était amis.
Vous pouvez me pénaliser
pour tenter d'avoir
diplôme et carrière.
Mais, je vous laisserai pas
priver ma femme
de la maison de rêve juste parce que...
C'est à cause des dettes de votre femme.
Oh mon Dieu !
Marshall, je dois te dire quelque chose.
Et je veux que tu l'apprennes de moi.
Laisse-moi résumer.
T'as fait entrer cette fille
dans l'appart d'étrangers ?
Oui, on y a passé la nuit.
Hé, regarde-toi.
Je porte ton peignoir.
J'espère que ça gêne pas.
Tout ce qui manque
dans ce peignoir, c'est tes initiales.
Ma mère vient la semaine prochaine.
Elle peut rester avec nous ?
Seulement, si elle dort
dans le lit et moi dans le canapé.
Tu es trop gentil.
Je t'aime.
Voilà, je l'ai dit, je le retirerai pas.
Oh mon Dieu !
Je t'aime aussi et je ne suis pas
la première à le dire, enfin.
Si tu prenais ta douche,
et je prépare des gaufres.
Ça marche à chaque fois.
Attends, la fois
où tu as proposé de promener mes chiens
quand je suis allée chez mon père...
Oui.
C'est pour ça que mon york a tremblé
pendant une semaine après mon retour ?
Oui.
Ce petit a vu des trucs
dont je ne suis pas fier.
Quoi ?
Il y a eu une bagarre.
Comment ça ?
Quand Lily et Marshall se disputent,
ils laissent
des preuves dans tout l'appart.
Oh, Dieu, c'est parti.
Il était
dans un club détective étant petit.
Les petits Mosby
ont élucidé nombre d'affaires !
Les petits Mosby ?
C'est-à-dire ta soeur et toi.
On a résolu le mystère
des courses manquantes.
Laisse-moi deviner,
elles étaient dans la poubelle.
Pourquoi tu fais ça ?
Bref, c'est sérieux.
Je connais Lily et Marshall.
Tous les signes sont là.
Ceci.
- Une bouteille d'eau.
- Touche pas aux preuves.
Je te soutiens, partenaire.
C'est pas une simple bouteille d'eau.
Notez que l'étiquette est retirée.
Lily retire toujours les étiquettes
quand elle se sent coupable.
Celle-ci n'a pas seulement été retirée.
Elle a été déchirée.
Elle a dû faire quelque chose de mal.
Marshall a dû être très en colère,
et quand il est en colère...
il mange.
C'est ce que je pensais.
Cherry Garcia.
D'après la liquidité,
la dispute a eu lieu entre...
minuit et 1 h.
C'était par terre.
Si tu veux venir à bout de tout ça,
faudrait renforcer ton estomac, poupée.
Marshall se tenait là,
Manger, crier, crier, manger.
Lily se tenait là...
pleurant.
Marshall tente de partir, furieux.
Mais, Lily...
tente une action désespérée.
Ce qui signifierait...
T'en dis quoi ?
Sexe de réconciliation ?
Ce serait plus le bordel.
Aussi tenté qu'il fût,
Marhall était encore trop énervé.
Fallait qu'il sorte,
de n'importe quelle façon.
Il a choisi la porte,
l'a claquée derrière lui.
C'est pour ça que le tableau est penché.
Bien vu, bleusaille.
Je vais emmener ça au labo.
Il nous faut un mobile, maintenant.
La question à un million.
- Pourquoi se battaient-ils ?
- Je sais...
Il n'y a qu'une conclusion possible.
Lily et Marshall
se disputaient à propos...
du beurre de cacahuètes.
Lily n'a pas remis le bouchon.
Marshall a trouvé
que le bouchon était allé trop loin.
Ils se battaient pas
pour le beurre de cacahuètes.
J'apprécie ton aide.
Mais tu t'appelles bien Robin,
pas Batman.
Ils se battaient, car ils ont pas eu
le prêt par la faute de Lily.
Elle a des dettes
de la taille du mont...
Rushmore.
Bien tenté, Robin.
Puis, ce que Lily a fait ensuite...
c'est laisser le temps à Marshall de se
calmer à propos du beurre de cacahuètes.
Puis, elle l'a appelé pour s'excuser.
C'est pour ça
que le dernier numéro appelé...
est...
Greenstein et Lee, avocats en divorce.
C'est pas possible.
Ils peuvent pas divorcer.
Pas Lily et Marshall, impossible.
J'ai été ravie de vous connaître.
Comment ça ?
Marshall vous aura, vous.
Lily m'aura, moi.
C'est pas parce qu'ils se séparent
qu'on va pas se revoir.
On s'est séparés, on se voit toujours.
- C'est pas bizarre.
- C'est un peu bizarre.
Oui, c'est vrai.
C'est bizarre.
Le monde à besoin
de Marshall et Lily, ensemble !
Je pleure pas,
j'ai une poussière dans l'oeil.
Ils sont là.
On a une annonce à faire.
Je sais, c'est une mauvaise idée,
vous pouvez pas faire ça...
Regardez-moi !
J'ai rappelé le dernier numéro.
Un avocat en divorce ?
Laissez-moi vous expliquer.
- On s'est disputés.
- Oui.
Je sais.
- Marshall est parti, furieux.
- Je suis allé au bar.
Tu bois toujours ce truc ?
Je l'ai payé
et apparemment
le budget est serré, maintenant.
Écoute, j'ai réfléchi à tout ça
et je sais que je ne peux pas
défaire ce que j'ai fait.
Mais, j'ai pris rendez-vous
avec un avocat en divorce.
- Quoi ? Tu veux divorcer ?
- Non, non.
Seulement sur papier,
comme ça tu peux acheter l'appart
sans traîner mes dettes.
Lily, tu veux ma mort ?
Pardon, j'aurais pas dû
commencer par l'avocat.
Non, t'aurais pas dû.
Je t'aime Lily.
Je t'aime aussi,
et je veux qu'on puisse avoir
l'appart de nos rêves.
Je sais pas,
ça semble être une solution.
Alors...
Marshall Ericksen, veux-tu divorcer ?
C'est la demande de divorce
la plus belle que j'ai jamais entendue.
Alors, c'est oui ? Tu pourras pas
coucher avec d'autres femmes.
Non, on va pas divorcer,
même sur papier.
Quand je t'ai épousé,
j'ai aussi épousé tes problèmes.
Ceux que je connaissais, et les autres.
C'était le marché,
on va régler ça ensemble.
Vous voulez autre chose ?
Alors, vous n'allez pas divorcer ?
- Vous nous avez fait peur.
- Merci, mon Dieu.
Si vous l'aviez fait, j'aurais plus
de couple marié à charrier. Genre :
Marshall, t'as épousé madame Raison,
tu savais pas
que son prénom était Toujours.
C'est trop bon, ça.
Alors, c'était quoi votre annonce ?
Je viens d'avoir l'agent immobilier,
on lui a dit qu'à cause de nos finances,
on prend pas l'appart,
c'est pas le bon moment.
<i>C'est ce que Marshall aurait dû dire.</i>
Je viens d'avoir l'agent immobilier.
- On a l'appart !
- On a notre petit chez nous.
Vous avez perdu la tête ?
<i>C'est ce qu'on aurait dû dire.</i>
C'est excitant.
C'est là, notre nouveau chez nous.
On y va ?
Allons-y.
Quelle odeur !
- Ça pue.
- C'est la centrale.
Vous inquiétez pas,
ils ferment le week-end.
Quelle centrale, de quoi parlez-vous ?
Vous savez pas ?
Tout le quartier est dans le vent
de la centrale de traitement des égouts.
Vous avez dit quoi ?
J'ai dit : on est dans le vent
de la centrale de traitement des égouts.
kids,everybody make mistakes
Take this girl Meg for instance.
She made a mistake, a mistake named Barney.
Yeah I thought I was gonna get married to my last boyfriend
but, boy, did that guy have commitment issues.
That whole relaonship--
that's three weeks of my life I'll never get back.
Well, I love commitment.
I wish I could marry commitment.
I met a girl last night.
Really?
So perky and full of life and not at all fake.
You're talking about her boobs, right?
C?
And that wasn't Spanish, that was cup size.
What up?
So, these boobs... Hmm.
paint me a word picture.
All right, Ted.
Imagine the heads of two Irish babies. Mmm.
Let's call them...
and...
Please stop!
When you get married,
you start out growing certain parts of your life.
And for Lily and Marshall, those certain parts were,
for the most part, me
Why would you come in?
You hear me shaving!
I thought you were shaving your face!
Well, clearly I wasn't!
Oh! No, no!
Pay up! Ugh! pussy!
Guys,it's 3:00 in the morning
and it reeks in here.
Ted said it was okay.
Ah, hey, Marshall.
You're still up?
Aren't you taking the bar tomorrow?
Discontent was bubbling under this surface,
until one day...
Ted!
How many times have I asked you to put the lid
back on the peanut butter jar?
It's this sort of incoiderate,
immature jackassery
that makes me feel like I'm living in the Realworld house,
and not the early years when they all had jobs
and social consciences.
I'talking about Hawaii and after!
I can't take this anymore!
ted, Lily and I are married now!
It's time! we're getting our own place!
Actually, I left the lid open. Sorry, baby.
But still,it was time to move forward.
So, they set out to find a new apartment to rent.
Hey, here's one.
Prwar building, recently renovated,
hardwood floors, tons of light,
two bedroom, two bath.
Oh, yeah, but that one's not for rent.
It's for sale.
Oh, right.
Kids, Uncle Marshall always like to say
that he had made three big mistakes in his life.
This was the first.
Jump, you big chicken!
Jump! You afraidy cat!
Jump! Jump!
This was the second.
No!
And this was the third and biggest.
We should buy a place!
-What? -Baby,
real estate is always a good invesent.
It's not.
And the market is really hot rightnow.
It wasn't.
And because of my new job,
we are in such atrong place financially.
They weren't.
Because lily has a secret.
My name is Lily and I'm a shopaholic.
Hi, Lily.
Oh, you guys don't do that here?
Sorry.
Proceed.
I buy designer clothes and accessories that I can't afford.
I have 15 creditcards and they're all maxed out.
And no one outside of this room,
not even my husband, knows.
And I, I feel terrible
becaus all I want to do right now
is ask you where you got those shoes.
They're adorable.
we can't buy; we have debt.
Yeah, I know,
my student loans are pretty big.
I forgive you.
What?
Well...
I'm just saying as your wife,
you know I'm cool that you spent tens of thousands of dollar
on a brand name law school.
cause I know it make you feel good and pretty.
Let's just go take a look at this place.
Where is it?
Uh, it's in a neighborhood called..
Dowisetrepla?
Dowisetrepla?
Dowisetrepla
Dowisetrepla.
Oh, I see, you're not New Yorkers.
Oh, actually we live on the Upper West side, so...
No need to be emrrassed, listen,
here in New York we just shorten the names of all t ighborhos,
So, TriBeC Nolita--
oh, right.
Dowisetrepla
I'm, I'm from New York.
I know this nighborhood.
i am down in the D-town
Oh, well nobody calls it D-town.
Dowisetrepla
the up-and-coming neighborhood.
And I have to tell you, for the prices
you're not going to be able to find an other...
I'm, I'm gonna stop you right there.
Don't bother with the hard sell.
This place is, is way out of our price range,
and besides, we've only just started to looking.
Is what Marshall should he said.
I'm gonna stop you right there.
I love it!
Let's get it!
thank you gays, for coming down here so quickly.
I've never been to this neighborhood.
kind of thought this part of town was water.
No, dude.
This is Dowisetrepla.
Dowisetrepla? Yeah.
Is that abbreviation for something?
He'from Ohio.
Dowiatrepla is th up-a-coming neighborhood. Oh.
I think this right the place where Lily and I start a family
I can see it now
Two three,four.
All right, bring it home, boys.
Sounds great, boys.
Who wants chocolate pancakes?
Thanks, Mommy!
Man,
life is gonna be sweet!
oh, my God, Lily, have you seen this kitchen?
I know. It's... Isn't it amazing?
-I just love it so... -What the hell are you doin
You can't buy this place.
Lily you have a debt the size of Mount Waddington!
Waddington?
It's the tallest mountain in Canada.
It's like 4,000 meters high.
Meters?
Don't let Marshall fa in love with this apartmt.
I know, I know, I know, I know
but what do i tell him?
I-I don't know, tell him,
tell him you saw a ghost. Tell him it's haunted.
You really don'know Marshall at all.
So, uh, the owners,where are they? Oh.
-They're on vacation in France for two weeks. -I see.
Between you and me,
I'm also interested in the artment.
So is there any way I could come back later and check it out
while you're showing them other places?
The lockbox combination is 1421.
And heres my card.
Are you serious?
You're trying to sneak this apartment away from Marshall and Lily
Ted, do you think I have no morals whatsoever?
I simply want to fool a girl into thinking this is my apartment
so I can nail her once and never have to see her again.
I'm not a monster.
Now, listen I don't want to put a lot of pressure on you,
but there is one other couple that expressed very serious interest.
I see what you're doing here.
"Another couple."
Please
That crap is page one out of the Realtor's playbook.
And we're not buying it.
Is what Marshall should have said.
Another couple? No!
We want it. Sell it to us. We'll give you so much more money.
Oh Marshall, can I talk to you?
Marshall, I just...
I don't know if now is the right time to buy.
But we're not doing this for now,
we're doing this for our future.
Can't you imagine starting a family here?
Oh, Persephone!Oh Daphne!
These'll be perfect additions
to our upcoming mother-daughter exhibit at the Met.
Looks great, girls.
Who wants crapes of chocolate?
Merci, papa.
So... what do you guys think?
I love it, but Marshall,
I should have told you this long time ago.
We can't afford to buy an apartment.
because I have too much credit card debt.
I am so sorry.
Is what she should have said.
I love it. Let's get it.
Can we charge it?
To Lily and Marshall
and their momentous step forward into adulthood.
Cheers.
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Drink it!
Yes! Well done. Nice! Yeah!
Anything else?
Yes.
I've been staring at that thing for years.
Wendy
bring me the comically large bottle of champagne.
Really? Are you sure?
It's neve been refrigerated.
And I think at some point there was a fish in it.
Honey, once you've made the sale,stop selling.
All right, but you guys have to help me carry it.
All right, let's do it. Let'do this.
I know what you're thinking.
I should tell Marshall the truth
I've got the whole thing figure out.
We'll apply for the loan under Marshall's name,
and h'll never need to know.
And then in the meantime, I'll slowly work down debt.
Right after I furnish the apartment.
I saw this amazing leather sofa today.
You should be a reality show.
Nice! Nice.
Wait!
That cork is the size of a softball
and you're pointing it directly at Wendy the waitress's face.
Is what he should have said.
Now if you are thinking about buying an apartment,
it's always good to check the place out at night.
Welcome to my humble abode.
This place is so nice.
Ah, make yourself at home.
Please, get comfortable.
If you see something you like, just take it.
Who are these people?
Uh... that's my parents.
They're Asian.
Yeah.
They're a Chinese couple that wanted a white baby
It works both ways.
Cookie. Wow.
Did you make those?
You got me. My sisters taught me how to bake and how to listen.
I feel so at home here.
I'm glad.
Sometimes, I don't.
A place like this really needs a lady of the house.
I know it's early to be thinking of you as...
Oh, God I'm freaking you out, aren't I?
It's just  you make me feel so safe.
I didn't...
The next day
Lily and Marshall went to the mortgage broker to get a loan.
Hey, uh, can we get this in singles?
Before we get the apartment I want to put in a kiddie pool
and swim around in it naked.
Great, that is great
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay! all right, back to business.
All right, Mrs. Aldrin, I'm going to need your social as well.
What? Why?
I mean, you already have Marshall's.
Yes, but since you're a married couple,
you'll be applying for a joint loan, so.
Well, can we just go ahead an do it in my husband's name?
He is the head of the household.
He earns the big bucks.
I mean, can women even own property?
Go ahead, just give him your social.
Okay my... my social is, uh...
Got it.
Let's see what kind of rate I can get you two.
Under six percent Under six percent.
Under six percent,please.
There we go Congratulation
You ve been approved for a loan
18%
at 18%.
No, way. That-that can't be right.
You' lucky to be getting mortgage.
Let's get out of here, Marshall.
Hold it, I-I don't undersnd.
did we do mething wrong or...?
You have quite a bit of debt.
My student loans.Great.
I thought we were friends.
You know what, it's fine
to penalize me for trying
to get an education and bud a career,
but I will not let you deprive my beautiful wife
of her dream home just because I...
Okay, actually, it's because of youwife's credit card debt.
Oh my God.
Marshall, there's something I have to tell you,
and I want you to hear it from me first.
Okay,  let me get this straight.
You just snuck this girl into some stranger's apartment?
yeah, we spent the night.
Hey, look at you.
I'm wearing your bathrobe.
I hope you don't mind.
The only thing missing from that bathrobe
are your initials.
My mom's gonna be in town next week.
Is iokay if she stays with us?
Only if she sleeps in the bed
and I sleep on the couch.
You're so sweet.
I love you.
There, I said it and I'm not taking it back.
Oh, my God! I love you, too.
I'm finally not the first one to say it!
How about you get in the shower,
and I will make us some waffles.
Works every time.
Wait.
That time that you offered to walk my dogs
when I went to visit my dad in Vancouver...
Yup.
Is that why my Yorkie trembled
for like a week after I got back?
Yeah.
That little guy saw some stuff I'm not proud of.
-Wh.  -What?
There was a fight here.
What do you mean?
whenever Mshall anLily have a big argument, they always
leave a trail of evidence all over the apament.
Oh, god, here we go.
He had a detective club as a kid.
Uh, the Mosby Boys
cracked a lot of big cases
The Mosby Boys?
You mean you and your sister.
We solved the mystery of the missing retainer.
let me guess
it was in the garbage.
Why are you like this?
Anyway, this is serious.
I know Lily and Marshall.
All the tell tale signs are here.
Like this
-A water bott? -Don't touch the evidence
I got your back partner.
It's not stny water bottle.
Notice the label is peed off.
Lily always peels labels off
the bottle when she's feeling guilty.
This lab is not only peele off, but torn up
Oh, man, she must have done something bad.
Which means Marshall must have been really angry,
and when Marshall gets rely angry.
he eats.
Just as I suspected,
Cherry Garcia.
Given the liquid consistency,
I place the fight between... noon and 1.
Ew, that was on the floor.
If you want to get to the bottom of this,
you're gonna need a stronger stomach than that, doll-face.
Marshall stood here.
Eating and yelling, yelling and eating.
Lily stood here.
Crying.
Ew, Ted.
And thenarshall tried to
storm out...
but Lily went for the Hail Marpass.
Which would mean...
What do u think, makeup sex?
There'd be a bigger mess.
Tempted as he was, Marshall was still too upset.
He had to get out of here, any way he cld.
He chosehe doo
slamming it bend him.
Whh is why this picture is crooked.
Nice catch, robin.
I'll jus uh, take this down to the lab.
Now alwe need  a motive.
The milln-dollar question.
at were they fighting about?
I ow what they've been fighting...
Bup, bup, bu b, bup, bup.
There's only one possible conclusion.
Li and Marshall're fighting about
-peanut butter. -Ah.
Lily left the lid off...
and mashall blew heads
I know what they were fighting about,
and it wasn't peanut butter.
Robin, just... I appreciate your help,
but there's a reason you name is Robin, not Batman.
Just...
They were fighting because they didn't get the loan
and it's all Lily's fault.
Robin, just... What?
Yeah, she has a pile of debt the size of Mount...
Rushmore
Nice try, Robin.
So, the next thing Lily did
was give Marshall a few hours to cool off about
the peanut butter.
Then she called him
to apologize, which is why the last number dialed is...
Greenstein and Lee, Divorce Attorneys.
This can't be happening.
They can't... get divorced.
Not Lily and Marshall, no way.
Well, it's been nice knowing you guys.
What do you mean? Well..
Marshall's gonna get you guys, Lily's gonna get me.
even if they did break up, that doesn't mean
we can't all ill hangout.
I mean we broke up and we still hang out. It's not weird.
It's a little weird.
Yeah, it is. It's weird.
The world needs
Marshall and Lily... together.
I'm not crying, there's something in my eye.
They're back.
Hey, hey, guys.
We have annnouncement.
I know, it's a terrible idea.
You can't do it!
Just look at me.
I hit redial on the phone.
Divorce lawyers?
Oh, I should explain.
We got in a pretty big fight.
Yeah, I know.
Marshall stormed out.
I went, uh, to the bar.
still drinking that?
I paid for it.
And apparently money's tight now, so...
Listen, I've been thinking about this,
and I know there's no way to undo what I've done,
but, well, I made an appointment with a divorce lawyer.
What?! What?!
Oh no, no, no, no-no.
-What, you want a divorce now? -No.
I just mean on paper,
so that you can buy the apartment
-without my bad credit dragging us down. -Lily...
are you trying to kill me?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have led with the divorce lawyer part.
No, you shouldn't have
I love you, Lily.
I love you, too.
And I want us to have our dream home.
And, well, I don't know.
It seems like this is a way to do it.
So...
Marsllriksen,
will you divorce me?
That's the sweetest divorce proposal I've ever heard.
So is that a yes?
You can't sleep with other women though.
No, we're not getting divorced,
not even on paper.
When I married you, I married your problems, too.
The ones I knew about and the ones I didn't.
So, that was the deal.
We'll figure this out together.
Can I get you guys anything else?
you're not getting a divorce?
No. Wow, you guys
scared us. Oh, thank God.
Cause, I mean if you did,
then who'd be the lame married couple I get to make fun of?
Like, "Hey, Marshall, you married Miss Right.
You just didn't know her first name was Always."
That stuff is cold.
So, what's the announcement?
I just got off the phone with the Realtor.
We told her that, uh, because of our finances,
we're not getting the place.
It's just-- it's not the right time.
Is what Marshall should have said.
I just got off the phone with the Realtor.
We got the place!
We' re home on earth!
Are you insane?
Have you lost your mind?
Is what we should have said.
Yeah!
Aw! This is exciting!
Yeah. There it is!
Our new home.
Shall we?
We shall.
Oh! what a horrible smell.
It reeks.
Oh, that's just the plant.
Don't worry, they shut it down on the weekends.
Wh-What plant?
What are you talking about?
Don't you know?
Baby, this whole neighborhood is downwind
of the sewage treatment plant.
Wait... what did you just say?
I said, we're downwind of the sewage treatment plant.
<i>Les enfants, le début d'une romance
est une chose merveilleuse.</i>
<i>Vous faites connaissance,
vous tissez des liens.</i>
<i>Et cette personne devient
la perfection à l'état pur, à vos yeux.</i>
<i>Vous ne lui trouvez pas de défaut.</i>
<i>Et vous êtes impatients
de le dire au monde entier.</i>
Elle t'a convaincu de faire du jogging ?
T'as vraiment envie de la voir à poil.
Vous allez l'adorer.
Lily, elle est branchée sur l'art.
Marshall,
elle veut bien croire aux ovnis.
Barney, elle est canon.
Robin,
elle est moins canon que toi.
- Je l'aime déjà.
- Moins canon, à quel point ?
<i>Alors, on alla dîner.</i>
<i>J'étais impatient de voir
s'ils étaient aussi fous d'elle que moi.</i>
Alors, vous prenez quoi ?
Je sais pas quoi choisir.
C'est quoi le mieux,
poulet ou lasagnes ?
Les lasagnes ! Prends les lasagnes !
Vous avez un nouvel appart.
Combien de chambres ?
Deux ! Deux chambres !
J'écoute...
qu'y a-t-il avec Cathy ?
Tu plaisantes ?
Ted, elle...
- T'as pas remarqué ?
- Remarqué quoi ?
Oh, il ne voit pas.
Si on lui fait remarquer,
ça lui gâchera tout.
En tant qu'amis, on se taira.
Tu as raison.
Elle est géniale, mec.
Ouais, elle est à garder,
Garde-la ailleurs,
c'est tout.
The Legen... dary Team
Marshall,
c'est quoi le souci avec Cathy ?
C'est un vrai cauchemar.
On peut en parler plus tard ?
Je suis sur le point de savoir
si je suis avocat ou non.
<i>Pendant l'été, Marshall a passé
l'exam du barreau de New York.</i>
<i>Ses années de cours,
ses innombrables heures d'étude</i>
l'avaient mené à
cette exténuante épreuve sur deux jours.
Et... allez-y.
<i>La pression était énorme.</i>
<i>Chaque année, ceux qui passent l'exam
craquent, tout simplement.</i>
<i>Mais Marshall avait surmonté ça.</i>
Et... c'est fini.
- C'est fini.
- Ouais.
C'est fini !
- Monsieur.
- Je sais !
- C'est fini !
- Je sais !
Donnez-le-moi... !
<i>Maintenant, des mois après,
les résultats de l'examen</i>
<i>devaient être mis en ligne à 22 h.</i>
<i>Et il était 21 h 59.</i>
Merde, c'est pas encore posté.
T'inquiète pas, bébé,
je suis sûre que t'as assuré.
Combien de personnes échouent ?
La moitié.
Mon Dieu ! Seule une moitié réussit ?
Je veux dire, la moitié réussit,
c'est génial.
Allez, Marshall !
Faut que tu voies un truc génial.
Quoi ? Non !
Les résultats du barreau, mon futur !
Crois-moi, faut que tu voies ça.
Que peut-il y avoir d'aussi important ?
C'est une vidéo d'un chien
qui fait caca sur un bébé.
Qu'est-ce que ça peut me faire ?
Pourquoi je voudrais voir ça ?
En quoi assujettir
mes yeux et mon cerveau
à un truc aussi dégoûtant
peut enrichir ma vie ?
C'est un chien
qui fait caca sur un bébé !
Lâche mon PC.
Cherche sur Google : "caca épagneul".
- Ça y est, les résultats !
- Alors ?
Entrez le mot de passe.
Vas-y, tape-le !
Ils me l'ont donné à l'épreuve.
Ça doit être écrit là, quelque part.
Voilà !
Dragibus, chamallows, oursons, cookies.
C'est une liste de course.
Pour qui ? Pour une sorcière qui
bâtit une maison dans la forêt ?
Le sucre m'aide à me concentrer.
C'est le genre de course
que fait un gamin de 10 ans
quand il est laissé seul le week-end.
Quels parents feraient ça ?
Et ta maman était parfaite ?
Je le trouve pas !
Tu peux pas leur dire que tu l'as
perdu et ils te l'envoient par mail ?
Ils me laisseront pas faire !
Va falloir attendre
les résultats par courrier,
ça peut mettre des semaines.
Notre facteur me déteste
depuis que je lui ai demandé
la date de son accouchement.
Elle était pas enceinte ?
Non, il ne l'était pas...
C'est gênant,
mais les résultats finiront par arriver,
essaie de ne pas y penser.
Salut, Brad.
Félicitations, mec.
Je n'en suis pas encore sûr, j'ai...
perdu mon mot de passe.
C'est super, Cara.
Je sais pas encore,
j'ai perdu mon mot de passe.
Je ne sais pas comment je l'ai perdu !
Ça arrive, ce genre de truc !
Ça te va bien, Mlle Je-paume-tout !
Je suis désolé.
Je suis sûr que les infirmières
volent tes médicaments, mamie.
Je t'aime aussi.
Si je dois attendre 6 semaines,
je vais faire une attaque.
D'après la liste des courses,
vaudrait mieux se soucier du diabète.
Moque-toi autant que tu veux,
ce truc affecte tout mon futur.
OK ?
Je devrais pas te dire ça.
Vraiment, je devrais pas te le dire...
mais je peux t'aider
à résoudre ton problème.
Comment ?
Je connais un gars au boulot,
il a accès à des logiciels conçus
pour traverser les pare-feu,
et récupérer les mots de passe
contenus dans les serveurs.
Je peux craquer n'importe quel PC.
Alors, on fait quoi ?
On se donne rendez-vous dans
un parking sombre ?
On pourrait ?
- J'ai un imper.
- Mec, calme-toi.
Bon, je viens de parler avec Cathy.
Bon Dieu, vous aviez trop raison.
Je l'entends, maintenant.
Je le vois ?
Je le sens ?
C'est quoi ?
J'ai quitté la table 2 min.
Qu'a-t-elle pu faire
en si peu de temps ?
Était-ce ?
Je reviens de suite.
Une fois en première,
pour plaisanter,
j'ai raconté à tout le monde que
j'avais couché avec mon prof d'anglais.
Il est encore en prison.
Ou peut-être ?
Je reviens de suite.
Je me suis portée volontaire au chenil.
C'est tellement gentil.
T'imagines pas le plaisir qu'il y a
à tuer un chiot non désiré.
Je fais des bracelets
avec leurs colliers.
Ou ?
Je reviens de suite.
Je parie qu'il va à l'urinoir.
Je me rappelle quand j'avais un pénis.
C'est pas un truc qu'elle a fait
pendant que t'étais pas là.
C'est juste sa personnalité.
Je capte pas !
Si c'est si évident
et que vous le voyez tous,
pourquoi pas moi ?
On essaie pas de coucher avec elle.
Tu conduis le camion du je-veux-du-sexe
et il a un énorme angle mort.
C'est ridicule.
Vraiment ?
Ted, laisse-moi te raconter l'histoire
d'une fille avec
laquelle je voulais coucher, Lucilia.
Sur une plage de sable blanc à
Rio de Janeiro,
on a fait l'amour dix heures d'affilée.
Quand on eut fini,
elle m'applaudit
et me dit que j'étais bien,
bien meilleur
que le meilleur amant
qu'elle puisse imaginer.
Et, que j'avais restauré sa foi en Dieu.
Quel rapport avec Cathy ?
C'est qui Cathy ?
Dites-moi
ce qui va pas avec elle, à la fin !
- OK, tu veux savoir ?
- Oui.
Tu veux égratigner
cette jolie illusion que tu t'es créée ?
D'accord.
Cathy parle...
...beaucoup trop.
Allez.
C'est pas vrai.
Repense sérieusement
à ce dîner qu'on a eu ensemble.
<i>Et je l'ai fait.</i>
Alors, vous prenez quoi ?
J'arrive pas à me décider.
Je prends quoi,
poulet ou lasagnes ?
J'aime le poulet,
les lasagnes, les deux,
mais j'adore le porc.
Peu de gens mangent du porc,
peut-être à cause de ce film, Babe.
C'était drôle, un cochon qui parle,
et il faisait :
Imaginez une confrérie appelée
"Baa Ram Ewe", j'y courrais.
... et donc, je l'ai appelé Dr Seuss !
Clorox, c'est un drôle de mot.
Les lasagnes ! Prends les lasagnes !
Vous avez un nouvel appart.
Combien de chambres ?
J'adorerais avoir une chambre de plus,
j'y mettrais un stepper.
Mais vous devriez acheter un canapé-lit.
Ou un futon. C'est bien aussi.
Ou alors un lit Murphy ?
Qui a inventé ça ?
Un certain Murphy ?
Vous vous souvenez de cette série,
Murphy Brown ?
C'était super drôle, elle changeait
d'assistante à chaque épisode.
... et c'était 30 min
avant que je réalise
qu'il était plus au téléphone !
Incroyable, non ?
Deux ! Deux chambres !
Vous aimez les cannoli ?
Je connais un endroit dans le Bronx
et on croirait pas,
mais ils ont les meilleurs cannoli
de la ville.
<i>Et d'un seul coup,
l'illusion était rompue.</i>
Elle la ferme jamais, hein ?
Elle s'arrêtait même pas pour avaler.
J'avais peur pour elle,
je voulais pas qu'elle s'étrangle.
Au début.
<i>Cette fille que je fréquentais
était un moulin à paroles.</i>
<i>Vous imaginez l'horreur ?</i>
Quelqu'un doit rester, parce que
le truc quand on sort c'est de...
T'as pas de wok ?
Parce que c'est comme ça qu...
Tu trouves pas ça génial,
l'automne ?
Aujourd'hui, je suis habillée...
Oh, mon Dieu ! C'est super gentil !
...un super endroit où on
pourrait aller.
Ils ont des vêtements pour hommes
et femmes, on pourrait y aller ensemble.
Souvent les couples...
Attends, pourquoi tu cours si vite ?
Eh bien, merci.
Toi et tes petits amis,
vous étiez forcés de me le dire.
Obligés de succomber
à mes plaintes incessantes.
T'as dit vouloir savoir.
Je voulais pas savoir !
T'as dit que tu voulais savoir !
Mais je savais pas
que je voulais pas savoir !
Toi tu savais, et tu me connais.
Et t'aurais dû savoir
que je voulais pas savoir !
Tu sais ?
Désolé qu'on te l'ait dit.
Je suis surpris
qu'elle te l'ait pas dit elle-même,
Y a pas une infinité de combinaisons
de mots en anglais.
T'aurais pu me laisser l'apprécier
un peu plus longtemps.
Elle a plein de qualités.
Elle est intelligente, tendre.
Elle aime les animaux.
Tu sais comment lui faire comprendre ?
Achète-lui un perroquet.
Allez !
Je suis désolé qu'on te l'ait dit.
Ça fait partie des relations.
Au final, tu te fais à ces petits
défauts qui t'énervent au départ.
J'imagine.
Tu t'es bien fait à ce que Lily
mâche super fort, non ?
Lily mâche pas fort.
Mec... allez, c'est pas nouveau.
Pourquoi tu crois que je l'appelle
"Chewmâcheca" ?
Parce qu'elle est loyale,
porte des ceintures brillantes
et que je ressemble à
Harrison Ford, jeune.
Réfléchis.
Honnêtement, c'est le coup
le plus bas que tu m'aies jamais fait.
Je pensais vraiment que tu savais.
On a mangé des côtelettes l'autre jour.
On aurait dit Jurassic Park.
Tu sais quoi ? Ça fait rien.
<i>Mais en fait, si.</i>
Dis-moi, y a quoi dans ces céréales
à part des branches mortes et
des petits os d'animaux ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Lily, je t'aime, mais honnêtement,
quand tu manges,
on croirait entendre un broyeur
rempli de vis murales.
C'est quoi ton problème ?
Ça fait dix ans qu'on est ensemble,
et tu me dis ça maintenant ?
Je m'en étais jamais rendu compte
jusqu'à...
Jusqu'à quoi ?
Il est gonflé, Ted !
C'est nul de dire que je mâche fort.
Ouais, c'est dingue.
Tu peux arrêter avec les Bretzels ?
Oh mon Dieu,
je mâche vraiment si fort ?
OK, maintenant que tu le dis,
ça peut ressembler au son
d'un tournevis dans un taille-crayon,
mais dans un sens sympa.
C'est de la faute de Ted.
Comme s'il était parfait, M. Correcteur.
Comment ça ?
Allez ! Tu es sortie avec lui un an,
t'as jamais remarqué que Ted
parle principalement pour te corriger ?
Tu me passes un Kleenex ?
Tu sais, Kleenex c'est une marque.
Ça, c'est un mouchoir.
Oh mon Dieu,
Frankenstein va tuer la petite fille ?
Le Dr Frankenstein n'est pas
dans cette scène,
Ça, c'est la créature de Frankenstein.
Ça m'a littéralement retourné la tête.
C'est du figuré.
Oh mon Dieu, t'as raison.
C'est super énervant.
Pas vrai ?
Ils viennent d'où ces Bretzels,
d'Ace Hardware ?
Salut. T'aimes le kettle corn ?
Je vire tout ce qui croustille.
Les stores sont fermés ?
- J'en sais rien.
- Les stores sont-ils fermés ?
Oui, les stores sont fermés.
Je crois pas avoir été suivi,
mais on sait jamais.
Ferme la porte
et reste loin des fenêtres.
T'as une raison pour agir comme ça ?
On va savoir si tu es un avocat.
Pour ma conscience,
je dois t'informer
qu'utiliser ce logiciel
est une violation du Patriot Act,
de l'initiative de défense stratégique,
et le National Security Act
de 1948 qui a créé la CIA.
J'espère que tu l'as eu.
Car, si on utilise ce logiciel,
le concierge, Gligor,
que j'ai berné en mettant ses empreintes
sur mon PC aura besoin d'un bon avocat.
T'es sûr de vouloir le faire ?
Je dois le savoir, oui.
Très bien.
D'abord,
aller sur le site du barreau de NY.
On désactive leur pare-feu,
et l'algorithme récursif
saisit ton mot de passe.
Puis,
cette application s'efface elle-même
sans laisser aucune trace
de notre présence.
Prêt à voir ton avenir ?
Oui.
C'est un chien
faisant caca sur un bébé.
Ouais, c'est pas génial ?
T'as fait tout ça
pour que je regarde cette vidéo ?
Ouais, ça valait le coup.
C'était le plus gros exam
de ma vie, je suis super stressé et...
C'est marrant.
Ted, viens voir ça.
Ouais, je dois...
Elle rappellera quand elle réalisera.
Sûrement d'ici 45 minutes.
Vous voulez boire un coup ?
- Juste de l'eau.
- Techniquement, l'eau se boit.
Vraiment, professeur ?
On la boit,
c'est comme ça que ça marche ?
J'allais m'en mettre sur la peau
et espérer qu'elle l'absorbe.
Ou tu pourrais mouiller ton T-shirt.
Qu'est-ce que t'as ?
Tu corriges tout le temps les gens.
C'est tout à fait vrai.
J'avais jamais remarqué, mais là
ça me rend littéralement dingue.
C'est du figuré.
Peut-être, mais
c'est pas pire que ton utilisation
de "littéralement"
dans une phrase sur deux.
Ils enseignent pas
le vocabulaire au Canada ?
Non, littéralement.
Non, littéralement.
La ferme, c'est rien comparé à toi
chantant ce que tu fais, tout le temps.
Quoi ?
Je paie mes factures
en utilisant l'enveloppe timbrée
d'une oeuvre caritative
à qui j'ai pas donné d'argent.
J'écris un chèque,
car je me sens coupable.
L'Armée du Salut
ne se bat pas de façon juste.
Je descends au sous-sol...
avec mon linge et des pièces.
Mais je reviens vite, car j'ai oublié
la lessive et l'adoucissant.
Tes rimes sont trop bordéliques.
Oh, allez !
Et toi, Barney ?
Toi, tu...
Intéressant, tout le monde
a une sale habitude sauf moi.
J'ai trouvé.
Tu parles parfois
avec une voix haut perchée.
Et tu utilises tout le temps
des phrases bateaux bidon.
Parfois, tu t'évades et
ne fais plus attention à ce qu'on dit.
Pardon, quoi ?
Voyez, vous ne trouvez rien.
Car je suis génial !
Les trois, là !
Techniquement,
génial n'est pas une phrase bateau,
plutôt un mot bateau.
J'ai littéralement envie
de t'arracher la tête.
C'est au sens figuré !
Non, je veux littéralement dire
littéralement.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Lily, qu'est-ce que tu manges ?
- Du gravier ?
- Ouais, hein ?
On dirait des boutons de manchette
dans un aspirateur.
Et pourquoi tu le chanterais pas ?
Car je ne chante pas
sur tout ce que je fais.
Non, parfois tu chantes
des trucs insensés, comme un malade.
Et le pire, c'est que c'est accrocheur.
Abricot, orties,
banane, chat, danse, 8663.
On la connaît, car tu l'as chantée
pendant trois heures, c'est quoi ?
C'est mon mot de passe.
AOBCD8663
- Oh, Marshall !
- Génial !
Y en a une autre : "Golden reverseur",
où le chien...
- Ouais, on imagine bien.
- Bon, les amis.
Je suis avocat.
<i>Ainsi, on a cessé de se battre
et avons fêté le succès de Marshall.</i>
<I>C'est difficile d'ignorer l'habitude
de quelqu'un quand on l'a remarquée.</i>
Je suis avocat,
car j'ai été reçu au barreau.
J'impose la loi Marshall
sur ce champagne.
T'es littéralement sur un nuage, là ?
Tu n'auras plus jamais
à passer cet examen.
En fait, s'il veut pratiquer dans
un autre État, il devra le repasser.
Mais, New York, mon vieux ! Super !
En robe d'avocat !
<i>Mais si on les aime assez,
ces habitudes sont faciles à oublier.</i>
<i>Trois ans plus tard,
j'ai recroisé Cathy.</i>
<i>Elle allait bien.</i>
Oh mon Dieu, ça fait si longtemps.
3 ans, non 4, non 3,
j'ai été blonde entre-deux.
C'était trop. C'est vrai ce qu'on dit,
les blondes s'éclatent plus.
Mon Dieu, je suis mal élevée.
Voici mon fiancé, oui, je suis fiancée.
Ted, voici Daniel.
Daniel...
voici Ted.
Super, enchanté de te rencontrer.
Vous avez l'air faits l'un pour l'autre.
Mon Dieu, je sais.
Le coup de foudre.
On devrait sortir. T'es avec quelqu'un ?
Une sortie à 4, c'est bizarre ? Non !
On peut prendre un brunch, je sais où.
- Vous aimez les popovers ?J'adore ça.
- <i>Elle parle beaucoup, hein ?</i>
Ils ont de la confiture de fraise.
(Bris de glace)
the early bloom of romantics is a wonderful thing.
you meet someone, you have a connection, and that person
becomes sheer perfection in your eyes.
you just can't find anything wrong with them.
you can't wait to tell the world about it.
she convinced you to go jogging?
wow, you really want to get in this girl's pants.
i'm telling you, you guys are gonna love her.
lily, she knows all about art.
marshall,
she's open to the existence of ufos.
barney,
she's hot. robin,
she's not hotter than you.
-like her already. -how not hotter?
so we all went out to dinner, and i couldn't wait
to see if my friends were as crazy about cathy as i was.
so, what's everyone getting?
well, i can't decide.
which sounds better, chicken or lasagna?
lasagna. just get the lasagna!
oh. you guys just got a new place.
how many bedrooms is it?
two. it's two bedrooms!
okay! let's hear it.
what's wrong with cathy?
are you kidding me, ted? she's got a...
you n't notice it?
notice what?
oh, he doesn't see it.
if we point it out, we're gonna ruin her for him.
as his friends,
we'll just keep him in the dark.
you're right.
she's great, man.
she's a keeper. just...
keep her somewhere else.
marshall, what is everyone's problem with cathy?
oh, she's a total nightmare, ted,
but can we talk about this later?
i'm a minute away
from finding out if i'm gonna be a lawyer or not.
you see, kids, during the summer,
marshall had taken the new york bar exam.
his years of school, his countless hours of study,
had finally culminated in this grueling, two-day ordeal.
and... begin.
the pressure of it was enormous.
every year, people taking the bar simply cracked.
no! no!
no!
no!
but marshall had made it through.
and...
time.
time's up.
right.
time.
-sir. -i know.
-your time is... -i know it is.
give me...!
now, months later, the results of that exam were scheduled
the post online at 10 o'clock
and this is 9:59.
damn, they're not up yet.
oh, don't worry, baby. i'm sure you rocked it.
i mean, how many people fail the bar?
half.
oh, my god, half?
only half the people pass?
i mean, half the people pass.
that's fantastic.
go, marshall.
oh, hey, can i jump on there?
i want to show you something awesome. what?
no. bar results. my future.
trust me. you need to see this.
what is so important that i need to see it right now?
it's a video of a dog pooping on a baby.
how do i need to see that?
why would i want to see that?
in what possible way could subjecting my eyes and my brain
to something that disgusting enrich my life?
it's a dog pooping on a baby.
get away from my computer.
okay, just do a quick google search for "caca spaniel."
the results are in.
whoo. what's it say?
"input password."
input the password.
it's okay. they assigned it to me when i took the test.
it's gotta be around here somewhere.
here. here-here-here.
jelly beans, fluffernutter, gummi bears, ginger snaps...
this is a grocery list.
for who? a witch building a house in the forest?

sugar helps me study.
this is like the shopping a ten-year-old does
when his parents leave him alone for the weekend.
what parent leaves a ten- year-old alone for the weekend?
and your mom was perfect.
i can't find my password! okay, just...
can't you let 'em know that you lost it
and they'll e-mail it to you or something?
no! they won't let me do that.
i'm gonna have to wait till the results come in the regular mail.
that could be weeks from now, if ever!
our mail carrier hates me ever since i asked her
when the baby was due.
she wasn't pregnant?
no, he was not.
ooh. okey, well, that's a drag,
but the results will come eventually.
just try to keep it off your mind until then.
hey, brad.
oh, congratulations, man.
i'm, uh... i'm not sure yet.
i lost my password.
that's great, cara.
i don't know yet. i lost my password.
i don't know how i lost it!
this staff happens!
oh. ohh! you're one to talk.
you misplace stuff all the time.
i'm sorry.
i'm sure the nurses are stealing your medicine, grandma.
love you too.
if i have to wait six weeks to find out if i passed,
i-'m gonna have a heart attack.
based on that grocery list, i'd say diabetes is a bigger worry.
you know what? laugh all you want.
this affects my whole future, all right?
okay.
i probably shouldn't be telling you this.
i definitely shouldn't be telling you this,
but there is a way i can help you with your problem.
how?
i know a guy at work
he can get access to software designed to penetrate firewalls
and retrieve passwords through secure servers.
i can get into any computer.
so what do we do? like, arrange a secret meeting
in a darkened parking structure?
no.
can we?
no
i have a trench coat.
dude, be cool.
so, i just got off the phone with cathy.
god, you guys are so right.
i totally hear it now.
see it now?
smell it?
what is it?!
i left the table for two minutes.
what could she have possibly done
in that time that was so horrible? was it...
i'll be back in one second.
one time, in the tenth grade, as a joke, i told everyone
that my english teacher had sex with me.
he's still in jail.
or maybe...
i'll be back in a second.
so i volunte at the pound.
oh, isn't that nice?
yeah. you can't imagine the rush
you getrush you get from killing a unwanted dog
i make bracelets from out of the collars.puppy
or...
||i'll be back in one second.
i bet he's going to the urinal.
yeah.
i remember when i had a penis.
it wasn't anything she did while you were in the bathroom.
it's just the way she is.
i don't get it.
if it's so obvious and you guys all see it,
how come i don't?
cause we're not trying to have sex with her.
mmm. brother,
you're driving the "i want to have sex with her" truck,
and it's got a huge blind spot.
that's ridiculous.
is it really?
ted, let me tell you a little story
about a young lady i wanted to have sex with-- lucilia.
on a white sand beach in Rio de Janeiro,
we made love for ten straight hours.
when we were done,
she applauded
and told me i was far, far better
than the best lover she could possibly imagine,
and that i had restored her faith in god.
what does this have to do with cathy?
who's cathy?
just tell me what the hell
is wrong with her already.
okay. you want to know?
yes.
you want to shatter
this beautiful illusion you've created for yourself?
fine. here it is.
cathy talks... a lot.
oh, come on.
that's not true.
ted. really, really think about that dinner
we all just had together.
and i did.
so, what's everyone getting?
well, i can't decide.
which sounds better, chicken or lasagna?
i like chicken.
i like lasagna. i like them both,
but i really like pork
a lot of people don't
eat pork, and maybe it's because
of that movie babe or something.
but that was funny.
he was a talking pig
and he was like "bah, ram, ewe!"
what-what if
there was a sorority, "bah, ram, ewe?"
i'd totally rush it.
...and so i named him dr. seuss!
lorax is a funny word.
lasagna! just get the lasagna!
oh, you guys just got a new place.
how many bedrooms is it?
i would love
to have an extra bedroom,
because i would put a stairmaster in there.
i'll be back in one second.
or a futon. futons are great.
or what about one of those
murphy beds?
who invented the murphy bed?
was it a guy named murphy?
oh, my god.
do you guys remember thatshow murphy brown?
that was a funny show.
she had a new assistant every episode.
...and it was like half an hour
before i realized he wasn't even on the phone anymore!
isn't that hysterical?
two! it's two bedrooms!
hey, do you guys like cannolis?
because i know this place and it's in the south bronx
and you wouldn't expect it,
but they have the best cannolis in town.
and just like that, the illusion was shattered.
she just never shuts up, does she?
she didn't stop
to swallow her food.
i was scared for her.
i didn't want her to choke.
at first
so kids,the girl i was dating would not stop talking.
can you imagine how awful that is?
somebody got stay me here because the thing i am going out has so much.
do you own a work?
cause that's really how...
don't you just love autumn?
today i'm dressed for.
oh, my god. the sweetest thing.
and i know this great place where we can go.
they have guys and girls clothes.
we could both shop at the same time.
and a lot of times boyfriends and girlfriends...
why are you running so fast?
well, thank you, pal.
you and your little friends,
you just had to tell me.
you just to give in to my incessant begging.
you said that you wanted to know.
i didn't want to know!
you said you wanted to know!
well, i didn't know i didn't want to know!
you knew. and you know me.
and you should have known i didn't want to know!
you know?
i'm sorry we told you.
i'm surprised she didn't tell you herself at some point.
there's only a finite combination of words
in the english language.
well, you could have let me enjoy it a little longer.
she's got all these
other great qualities.
she's smart. she's caring. she loves animals...
you know how to teach her a lesson?
buy her a parrot.
oh, come on. i'm sorry that we told you, okay?
it's part of being in a relationship.
eventually, you get used to these annoying little things
that bug you at first.
yeah, i guess.
i mean, you got used to lily's loud chewing, right?
lily doesn't chew loudly.
dude...
come on. this isn't news.
Why do you think I call her "Chewbacca"?

i assumed because she's loyal, wears shiny belts
and i resemble a young harrison ford.
think about it.
oh, man, honestly, dude, that's the meanest thing
you've ever done to me.
i really thought you knew.
we had ribs the other night. it sounded like jurassic park.
ha-ha-ha. you know what?
it doesn't matter.
but it did.
say, what's in that cereal
besides dry twigs and small animal bones?
what's that supposed to mean?
lily, i love you, but honest to god,
when you eat, it sounds like a garbage disposal
full of drywall screws.
what's the matter with you?
we've been together ten years, and you're saying this now?
well, i never noticed it before until...
until what?
can you believe ted?
what a lame thing to say, that i'm a loud chewer.
yeah, that's crazy.
maybe enough with the pretzels.
oh, my god, do i really chew that loudly?
no, no, no.
okay, now that you pointed it out,
maybe it does sound slightly like someone put
a screwdriver in a pencil sharpener,
but in a cute way.
this is all ted's fault.
oh, like he's so perfect, mr. corrector.
what do you mean?
oh, come on. you dated the guy for a year
and you never noticed that most of what ted says
is correcting you.
hey, can you hand me a kleenex?
actually, kleenex is a brand.
this is a facial tissue.
oh, my god, is frankenstein gonna kill that little girl?
uh, dr. frankenstein isn't in this scene.
that's frankenstein's monster.
that literally blew my mind.
figuratively.
oh, my god, you're right.
that is so annoying.
isn't it?
where are those pretzels from, ace hardware?
hey, man,
you like kettle corn?
i'm trying to get rid of anything crunchy.
are the blinds closed?
i don't know.
are the blinds closed?!
good, i didn't think yes, the blindsi was followed,|
but you can never be too sure.
now double-lock the door
and stay away from the windows.
is there a reason that you're acting like this?
we're about to find out if you're a lawyer.
now, in good conscience, i have to inform you
that using his software
is in violation of the patriot act,
the strategic defense initiative,
and the national security act of 1948, which created to cia.
so i hope you passed the bar because
if we use this software, the night janitor gligor
who i fooled into putting fingerprints on my computer,
is going to need a good lawyer.
are you certain you want to go through with this?
i have to know, yes, yes.
very good.
first, we go to the new york state bar web site.
we disable the firewall, then the recursive algorithm
grabs your pasord, and as the application erases itself
leaving no trace we we here ever...
you ready to see your future, bro?
yes.
it's a dog pooping on a baby.
right! isn't that awesome?
so you went through all this just to get me
to look at your stupid video?
yeah, it was worth it.
barney, barney, that was the biggest test of my life.
i'm incredibly stressed out right now, and i...
okay, that's pretty funny.
you got to see this.
uh-huh, yeah, i have to...
she'll call back when she realizes i'm gone.
probably in about 45 minutes.
you guys want a drink?
i'll just have a water.
mm, technically, water is a drink.
really, professor?
you drink it? is that how water works?
because i was just gonna smear it on my skin
and hope that i absorbed it.
or you could, you know, pour it over your shirt.
what's with you?
you're always correcting people.
-you totally do that! -that's absolutely right.
right? i never noticed it before,
and now it's literally driving me crazy.
figuratively.
okay, maybe so, but it's no worse
than you using the word "literally"
in every other sentence.
don't they teach vocabulary in canada?
they literally don't. they literally don't.
shut up, marshall.
that's nothing compared
to your thing of singing what you do all the time.
what?
Paying my bills using return address labels
From a charity that I haven't given money to
Writing a check  cause now I feel guilty
The Salivation Army does not fight fair.
Heading down to the basement today
With my laundry  and a roll of quarters
But I'm back too soon
Cause I left  the detergent
And the fabric softener
wow. those lines are so sloppy.
oh, come on!
what about you, "barney"?
okay, you...
always...
interesting, interesting,
everyone has annoying habits but me.
oh, got it.
okay, you sometimes talk in a weird high-pitched voice.
and you're constantly using lame catchphrases.
and sometimes you space out and don't even pay attention
to what we're talking about.
i'm sorry. what?
oh, see?
you can't think of anything
cause i am aewsome
all three right the.
well, technically, "awesome" wouldn't be a catchphrase.
if anything, it's more of a catchword.
i literally want to rip your head off.
you mean "figuratively"!
no, i literally mean "literally."
literally, literally literally.
oh, my god, lily, what are you eating, gravel?
oh, i know, right?
it sounds like cufflinks going up a vacuum cleaner.
well, why don't you sing about it?
because i don't sing about everything i do.
no, no, sometimes you just sing nonsense sentences
like a stroke victim,
and what's worse,
they're catchy.
Apple,orchard,banana, cat dance,

see? we know that one because once you sang that
for, like, three hours. what the hell is that?
that's my password.
AOBCD8663
AOBCD8663.
-oh, marshall! -awesome!
there's another one.
it's called "golden reliever," where this dog... yeah,
-we can guess. -all right, guys,
guys, guys.
i'm a lawyer.
it just like that
we stopped fighting and celebrated marshall's success.
you see, when someone's bad habits are pointed out to you,
it's hard to ignore them.
i'm a lawyer now cause i passed the bar
i'm imposing marshall law on this champagne.
are you literally on cloud nine right now?
baby, you never have to take the bar again.
actually, if he practices law in another state,
he will have to,
but new york, man!
it's a great state to practice law in!
lawsuit up!
yeah! whoo!
yeah! yeah!
but if you love them enough,
those bad habits are easy to forgive
3 years later i ran into cathy
and she was doing well.
ted?!
oh, my god, i haven't seen you in so long!
how long has it been? three years? no, four.
no, three, 'cause i went blonde and then i went back
cause i was having too much fun.
blondes have more fun.
oh, my god, i'm being so rude.
ted, this is my fiance
yes, i'm engaged.
ted, this is daniel.


you guys
seem perfect for each other.
oh, my god.
i know, right? total, it was like love at first sight.
hey, we should go out sometime.
are you seeing anyone? because we could double-date.
is that weird? no, it's not.
we can go have brunch. i know this place.
do you guys like popovers? because i love popovers.
they're like croissants,
but they're a little bit less flaky and they're kind of round.
hey, they have strawberry jam.
<i>Quand on était ensemble, Robin et moi
avions cette blague récurrente.</i>
<i>On était les seuls à trouver ça drôle.</i>
Mais non ! Mars n'a pas 31 jours !
Bien sûr que si !
Tout le monde le sait.
C'est de la culture générale.
Général Culture !
<i>Et on le faisait tout le temps.</i>
C'est pas triste qu'en 2007,
certains pays ne condamnent pas
les tortures corporelles ?
Caporal Torture !
<i>Parce qu'une fois commencé,
c'est étonnamment dur d'arrêter.</i>
J'ai du caramel coincé dans ma dent.
Colonel Coincé-dans-ma-dent !
- Pitié, arrêtez !
- Je vous déteste !
<i>Mais là, on était séparés,
donc quand Marshall a dit :</i>
Mais après la 1re année,
j'aurai une augmentation majeure.
<i>On a laissé couler.</i>
<i>En surface, ça semblait
bien aller entre Robin et moi.</i>
<i>Mais en vrai,</i>
<i>essayer d'être ami avec son ex
est plus dur qu'il n'y paraît.</i>
<i>Impossible d'être aussi franc qu'avant.</i>
Cette superbe stagiaire
se penche sur mon bureau,
je pouvais voir
qu'elle avait un pierc...
Brosnan... Pierce Brosnan est
mon James Bond préféré.
<i>Mais le plus important,
c'est que vous ne pouvez jamais,</i>
<i>ô grand jamais être seuls ensemble.</i>
- Je dois y aller.
- Je vais payer.
Moi, pipi.
- Je vais aider Marshall.
- Je vais pisser avec Lily.

Voilà, on a notre dinde.
C'est excitant, non ?
Notre 1er Thanksgiving en groupe.
Ouais,
ça va être un Baffegiving mémorable.
Quoi ?
J'ai dit que ça allait être
un Thanksgiving mémorable.
Ça va être génial,
juste nous cinq, hein ?
Oh, ça me rappelle que j'ai invité Bob.
T'es sortie que trois fois avec lui,
on le connaît même pas.
Il ne sait pas où passer les fêtes.
Je savais pas quoi dire.
- C'est vraiment un gros souci ?
- Oui !
C'est notre 1er Thanksgivng.
Dans 30 ans,
on regardera les photos et on dira :
"Oh, voici les 4 personnes
que j'aime le plus au monde."
"Et Bob."
Désolée, parfois j'oublie combien vous
prenez ça au sérieux, les Américains.
Le vrai Thanksgiving, c'était
il y a plus d'un mois.
Pardon ?
Viens-tu de dire
que le Thanksgiving canadien était,
et je cite :
"Le vrai Thanksgiving" ?
Que peuvent bien célébrer
les Canadiens ?
Le Thanksgiving canadien célèbre
l'explorateur Martin Frobisher
et sa recherche valeureuse,
bien qu'infructueuse,
du passage du Nord-Ouest.
Comment peut-on
vous considérer un pays ?
Au fait, si quelqu'un
veut venir plus tôt jeudi
on peut mater
le défilé de Baffegiving.
Là, tu l'as redit.
- Dis quoi ?
- Baffegiving.
Ah oui, effectivement.
Tu sais pourquoi ?
J'ai inventé une nouvelle fête.
Baffegiving.
C'est le jour
où on peut se retrouver ensemble,
et donner des baffes.
<i>Il faut que je vous explique.</i>
<i>Vous vous souvenez du pari-baffe ?</i>
<i>Un an plus tôt, Marshall a parié
avec Barney et a gagné</i>
<i>le droit de le gifler cinq fois.</i>
<i>Il a déjà utilisé la 1re.</i>
<i>Et la 2e.</i>
<i>Mais Marshall gardait un truc
spécial pour la 3e.</i>

Le compte à rebours finit à 15 h
le lendemain de Thanksgiving,
j'ai fait les comptes !
Il y a combien de jours en octobre ?
Trente.
Mec, je croyais qu'on avait réglé ça,
l'année dernière.
J'aime beaucoup Halloween, c'est sympa.
C'est surtout demain.
Merde !
Attends.
Tu vas me baffer à Thanksgiving ?
Baffegiving...
C'est interdit. Lily ?
Tu es l'arbitre, est-ce permis ?
La maîtresse de maison en moi, qui
va inaugurer sa porcelaine de mariage,
a envie de répondre "sûrement pas".
Mais ouais, je vais le permettre.
Tu sais quoi ?
Si t'essaies de m'effrayer
à l'idée de passer Thanksgiving...
Baffegiving.
chez toi, tu as loupé ton coup.
- À vrai dire, j'ai pas peur.
- Ah bon ?
Exact, parce que tu l'as gâché.
Le pire dans tout ça, c'est de
ne pas savoir quand ça arrivera,
Mais là, je sais
quand je vais me faire baffer.
Tu as retiré tout le suspens.
T'as dévoilé le jeu que tu as en main.
Et jeudi, à 15 h 01,
ma main se dévoilera à ton visage.
Voilà Bob, au fait, pour info,
il est un peu plus vieux que nous.
- Quel âge ?
- 41 ans.
Hé, Bob, par ici.
<i>Bon, les enfants, en vrai,</i>
<i>Bob était sûrement comme ça.</i>
- Salut, chérie.
- Salut.
<i>Mais quand votre ex sort avec quelqu'un,</i>
<i>votre cerveau
tend à exagérer leurs défauts.</i>
<i>Voici comment j'ai vu Bob.</i>
Salut, les gars, ça gaze ?
- Salut, mec, ça va ?
- Enchanté.
Désolé du retard,
j'étais au téléphone avec mes parents.
- Parents ?
- Ils sont toujours sur mon dos,
"Tu vas faire quoi de ta vie,
tu as 41 ans ?"
Et moi : "Relax, le snow-board est
une carrière légitime."
"Vous devriez être heureux
que j'ai trouvé ma voie."
Et en parlant de voie...
fais-moi un bisou, bébé.
Allons chercher un truc à boire.
Incroyable.
Robin sort avec Orville Redenbacher.
De quoi tu parles ?
Il a 41 ans, il est superbe.
Ouais, mec, il est plutôt en forme.
Il te foutrait une dérouillée.
Mais vous voyez pas ?
Il a 150 ans, Robin a 27 ans.
Allez, à toi Barney.
Rien que du respect pour cet homme.
Au fait, on va tous faire des tartes
chez Robin, demain.
On peut pas laisser Marshall seul
dans l'appart avec des tartes, la nuit.
Pour la énième fois,
Manger la nuit c'est un vrai, sérieux,
et délicieux problème médical.
À quelle heure vous allez chez Robin ?
- 19 h 30.
- Parfait.
Par précaution,
j'y serai à 20 h, 20 h 30.
Désolé, je suis en retard.
Où sont Marshall et Lily ?
Ils viennent d'appeler, ils sont
débordés par les préparatifs.
Bob vient ?
Non, il est allé voir Green Day.
Donc...
On est que tous les deux.
On va faire des tartes.
- Le truc que les amis font ensemble.
- Exact.
- Super.
- Ouais.
Super, on va pouvoir discuter.
- Je vais passer un coup de fil.
- Je vais faire préchauffer le four.
C'est moi. Faut que tu viennes ici
faire des tartes.
J'y serai, pas de problème.
Génial, tu me sauves la vie.
C'est encore bizarre d'être seul
avec Robin. Mais si tu étais là...
Plus un mot.
Quand je t'ai sorti de cette
carcasse brûlante
c'était pas pour avoir
un navire de guerre à mon nom.
<i>Si tu insistes, oui,</i>
je serai là pour le baptême.
Tu dragues quelqu'un, là, hein ?
Non, je vais pas porter la médaille
de l'honneur, ça manquerait de tact.
Donc, tu viens pas ?
Merci à vous, M. le président.
Désolé.
<i>Après une longue nuit,
c'était enfin la grande fête.</i>
<i>Pardon, les deux grandes fêtes.</i>
Marshall, tu t'occupes
de la sauce de canneberges ?
Un instant.
Je n'ai qu'une multitude de mains.
Tu vois, c'est des dindes,
mais ce sont aussi des mains.
Car on va manger de la dinde...
puis je vais te baffer en pleine tête.
Pitié ! Tu gâches tout le suspens.
Dans un film d'horreur, le tueur
ne prend pas une trompe pour annoncer :
"Attention, ados sans surveillance
de la maison du lac !"
"À précisément 3 h du matin,
je vais sortir de ce placard
et vous écharper avec une machette."
"P.-S : le feu
est mon seul point faible."
- Salut.
- Joyeux Thanksgiving.
Toi aussi.
Lily est dans la cuisine ?
- Lily ?
- Marshall ?
Il est arrivé quelque chose
de très étrange, hier soir.
Comment ça ?
T'as peut-être pas vu,
mais depuis notre rupture,
Robin et moi n'avons jamais été seuls.
On est dans la cuisine.
à faire les tartes. Et on réalise...
on n'a carrément rien à se dire.
On peut pas parler
de comment on était proches,
ni de comment on ne l'est plus.
T'as l'impression que parler
ne ferait qu'empirer les choses.
Exactement ! Tu sais pourquoi ?
Car tu veux pas blesser
quelqu'un qui compte vraiment.
Surtout pendant les fêtes.
Quel genre d'être humain
voudrait causer
une souffrance morale ou physique ?
T'auras quand même ta baffe.
Je voulais partir.
Mais je pouvais pas la laisser faire
toutes les tartes, elle était crevée.
J'ai bâillé plus de mille fois
pour qu'il parte.
Ouais, y en a
qui comprennent pas le message.
D'ailleurs,
je suis vraiment débordée, là.
Je regardais l'heure, je soupirais,
il ne comprenait pas.
Pas sûre d'avoir le temps
d'écraser les patates près de toi.
Et il a fait ce qu'il fait toujours
quand il y a un silence gênant.
Le presse-purée : près du pot.
Il panique et sort le premier truc
qui lui passe par la tête.
Tu savais que les premières tartes
viennent de l'Égypte Ancienne ?
Tu te souviens du dernier Thanksgiving,
quand on a fait l'amour 7 fois ?
- Horrible !
- Quoi ?
Je pensais que ça briserait la glace.
J'avais déjà brisé
la glace avec mon anecdote.
Il a rendu le truc 10 fois plus gênant.
Comment tu réponds à un tel truc ?
Tu savais qu'on peut voir
les pyramides d'Égypte depuis l'Espace ?
Probablement.
Le four est préchauffé.
Les tartes aux noix
vont prendre plus de temps.
Si on mettait celle-là en premier ?
Des tartes aux noix, pourquoi ?
C'est ma préférée.
- T'es allergique.
- Je sais.
J'aime la sentir,
c'est comme manger avec son nez.
On fait une tarte pour Bob.
Eh bien...
Elle t'a fait faire
une tarte pour ce type ?
C'est une vraie baffe en pleine tête.
T'aurais pu me dire
que c'était pour Bob.
J'ai pensé que ça pourrait t'énerver.
M'énerver ? Attends un peu.
Tu crois que...
Tu crois que je suis jaloux de Bob ?
Je sais pas. C'est si ridicule
de penser que tu puisses l'être ?
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce qu'il a 100 ans.
- Non, Ted ! Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Pas vrai ?
Si je suis jaloux de Bob,
c'est parce qu'il était là
au tout premier Thanksgiving.
- Allez !
- Si je suis jaloux de Bob,
c'est parce que Noë
lui a tiré dessus sur l'arche.
Si je suis jaloux de Bob,
c'est parce que je suis un simple
architecte, lui a découvert le feu.
Que faire de mieux ?
Il a 41 ans !
Pourquoi t'es si dur avec lui ?
Mais non ! Je plaisante, c'est tout !
C'est ce que font les amis.
C'est méchant.
On tombe sur le dos de Barney
quand il sort avec une pétasse,
mais quand tu couches avec le père
de Beetlejuice, je peux rien dire ?
Primo, Bob et moi
ne couchons pas ensemble.
On se voit comme ça.
Deuxio, ai-je dit un mot sur le défilé
de conquêtes idiotes qui
m'est passé devant ces derniers mois ?
L'une d'elles
t'a fait faire un tatouage !
- C'est pas...
- Si on est si bons amis,
pourquoi c'est si bizarre
de faire une tarte pour Bob ?
Si on est si bons amis, pourquoi tu m'as
pas dit que c'était ce qu'on faisait ?
On verra ça plus tard,
je devrais y aller.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
C'est Thanksgiving.
Je sais, désolé, c'est stupide.
Je suis désolée aussi.
- On est amis, j'en suis contente.
- Moi aussi.
Vous avez couché ensemble, hier soir !
C'est une très mauvaise idée.
C'est une idée affreuse.
Rechute là !
C'est là qu'on tope là,
puis c'est un peu bizarre.
Et encore un tope là !
Qu'est-ce que vous faites,
tous les deux ?
Vous avez rompu il y a six mois.
- Tu sors avec un autre homme.
- Correct, Monsieur.
Qui vient
à mon Thanksgiving, aujourd'hui.
- C'est un fait.
- Événement auquel Ted est aussi convié.
Patatras !
Pourquoi tu veux gâcher
le Thanksgiving américain ?
Lily, c'est pas si terrible que ça.
Bob et moi, c'est pas si sérieux. Ce qui
s'est passé avec Ted était un accident.
Vous en avez parlé au moins ?
- J'entends quelque chose brûler.
- Je dois aller au boulot...
Il faut pas qu'on en reparle.
Il faut qu'on en reparle.
Pour sauvegarder notre amitié.
- Faut qu'on parle.
- Pause champignon ?
On doit parler d'hier.
Tu sais que certains champignons
sont carnivores ?
Probablement.
Non ?
Ted, on peut régler ça ?
- Je suis pas fâchée, je pense...
- Attends...
Pourquoi tu serais fâchée,
t'as commencé.
Quoi ? T'es fou !
On a fait la paix.
On s'est enlacé, j'ai voulu me
retirer, t'as gardé ta main sur mon cou.
Parce que ta main
était encore sur ma taille.
Allez, tu t'es penchée vers moi.
Je me suis penchée vers toi ?
T'es comme ce pauvre gosse en poussin
qui sait qu'il touchera pas la balle
qui fait donc : "Oups, le lanceur
m'a touché, j'ai gagné une base."
C'était toi chez les poussins, hein ?
Mon pourcentage
d'atteinte de base crevait le plafond.
Les baffapéritifs.
Ça suffit !
C'est Thanksgiving,
réglez ça, tout de suite.
Si vous recouchez ensemble,
pas de dessert !
Qu'est-ce que c'est
que ce Thanksgiving ?
Comme d'habitude.
Te stresse pas, bébé,
je vais te trouver un truc relaxant.
Merci, bébé.
De la musique classique, peut-être.
Regardez ça !
On est dans
la dernière heure du décompte.
J'ai pas peur.
Alors pourquoi ta joue droite
tremble-t-elle ?
Peut-être parce que le Futur-Moi
baffe le Futur-Toi si fort
que ça se réverbère dans le passé,
perturbant le continuum espace-baffe.
S'il te plaît, me baffe pas.
- Pardon ?
- Me baffe pas à nouveau,
Je veux pas être baffé à nouveau,
les 2 premières fois ont fait trop mal,
J'aime pas ça, j'aime pas ça du tout !
Je croyais avoir tout fait foirer
en mettant un compte à rebours.
T'as rien fait foirer,
c'est encore pire !
J'arrive plus à dormir ni à manger,
J'ai perdu 5kgs, mes costards tombent,
Tu sais quoi ? Je me tire.
- Non, tu peux pas partir.
- Et pourquoi pas ?
Les règles ne stipulent pas que je doive
subir ce genre de torture mentale !
Tu as le droit de baffer ma figure,
pas mon esprit ! Bien le bonjour !
- Mais c'est Baffegiving !
- Non !
C'est Thanksgiving !
Notre premier en tant que couple marié,
en tant qu'adultes.
Et tu n'essayes même pas de participer.
Aucun de vous n'essaye.
Donc,
En tant qu'arbitre du pari-baffe,
je mets en place une règle.
Thanksgiving est un jour de paix,
Il n'y aura pas de baffe aujourd'hui.
- Quoi ?!
- Ouais !!
Dans ta face !
Pas dans ma face, dans ta face !
- Ça gaze, les mecs ?
- Salut, Bob.
- Bébé, s'il te plaît...
- La parole de l'arbitre est arrêtée.
Alors, va dans la cuisine écraser
des pommes de terre, et que ça saute.
Pour le reste de la journée,
on va profiter de cette fête
en tant qu'adultes civilisés.
Pas trop adultes, j'ai fait
des coupes de Jell-O,
On va se mettre la misère,
les mecs.
Regarde-nous,
on peut pas être ensemble deux minutes.
Apparemment pas.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
On est censés être amis.
On est pas des amis, si ?
Pas vraiment. On s'évite.
On sourit poliment.
On fait semblant d'être amis,
car sinon ce serait incommodant.
Peut-être qu'on devrait arrêter
de faire semblant.
Peut-être bien.
Alors...
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait maintenant ?
J'imagine qu'on va manger notre dîner.
Et c'est fini.
Joyeux Thanksgiving.
<i>Donc, on s'est installé pour notre
premier Thanksgiving ensemble.</i>
<i>Et apparemment, notre dernier.</i>
Marshall, tu manges pas,
quelque chose a gâché ton Baffappétit ?
Non, je pensais que le chef voudrait
dire quelques mots avant de manger.
Non. C'est nul.
Mangez et tirez-vous.
J'aimerais dire un mot.
Si vous êtes d'accord.
Aujourd'hui, Lily a fait
quelque chose de grand.
Non seulement elle nous a réunis
et a préparé un délicieux repas,
elle a aussi inauguré
une nouvelle tradition.
On refera ça l'année prochaine,
celle d'après,
peut-être jusqu'à la fin de nos vies.
C'est incroyable si on y pense.
Et tout ça, grâce à toi, Lily.
Je t'aime.
Au premier d'une multitude de
Thanksgivings ensemble.
C'est de la bombe !
Un joli petit Thanksgiving.
Je suis le benjamin de 10
enfants dans ma famille.
Nos Thanksgivings sont un foutoir,
Les engueulades, les cris...
<i>Et un truc drôle s'est produit.</i>
C'est vraiment d'un ennui majeur.
Major Ennui !
- Oh non !
- Je croyais c'était terminé.
Faut croire que non.
Faut croire que non.
<i>Vous voyez, l'amitié ne se commande pas.
Ça arrive. On n'y peut rien.</i>
<i>Ce premier Thanksgiving fut
un super dîner</i>
<i>avec les 4 personnes
que j'aimais le plus au monde.</i>
<i>Et Bob.</i>
<i>Et ça devint une tradition.</i>
<i>Chaque année,</i>
<i>on va chez tante Lily
et oncle Marshall pour Thanksgiving.</i>
Regardez !
Les 20 dernières secondes du compte
à rebours pour que dalle de Marshall !
Barney, range ça.
Ça fait quoi Marshall,
d'être assis là impuissant,
ta grosse main molle
balançant dans le vent ?
- La baffe va arriver dans 10, 9, 8...
- Oh, jolie attention.
Dommage !
- Barney range ça !
- Je le ferai dans 5, 4...
Tu peux le baffer.
Quoi ? Attends, tu...
Ça fait trois !
Merci bébé, t'es la meilleure !
Et en bonus, j'ai composé une chanson
spécialement pour cette occasion !
Ted, lumières !
<i>Quelle est cette sensation</i>
<i>qui t'a remis à ta place ?</i>
<i>Une brûlure intense
sur le côté de ta face.</i>
<i>Tu sens le sang accourir vers ta joue,</i>
<i>les larmes emplissent tes yeux.</i>
<i>Tes lèvres tremblent,
mais tu restes muet.</i>
<i>Tu essayes, oh, tu essayes,
de ne pas pleurer !</i>
<i>Tu t'es fait baffer !</i>
<i>En pleine joue, mon pote.</i>
<i>Tu t'es fait baffer !</i>
<i>Oui, ça vient vraiment d'arriver.</i>
<i>Tout le monde l'a bien vu,</i>
<i>et tout le monde a bien ri et applaudit.</i>
<i>C'était génial.</i>
<i>Tu t'es fait...</i>
<i>baffer !</i>
Joyeux Baffegiving à vous tous.
Eh bien, amusez-vous bien.
Ça va être un rangement majeur.
Major Rangement !
On va faire ça
à chaque fois maintenant, non ?
C'est l'idée générale.
Général Idée !
back we are dating robin and i had this running joke.
we were the only two people in the world who found it funny
no way.
march does not have 31 days.
yes, it does.
everyone knows that.
it's like general knowledge.
general knowledge. general knowledge.
and we did it all the time.
isn't it sad?
i mean in 2007,
some countries actually still condone corporal punishment.
corporal punishment. corporal punishment.
because once you start
it's surprisingly hard to stop
oh, man, i got a kernel stuck in my teeth.
colonel stuck-in-my-teeth.
please stop! i hate you!you're killing me!
but now, we were broken up,so when marshall said...
but after the first year,i get a major pay raise.
we just let it slide.
you see, on the surface,robin and i looked like
we were doing great.
but the truth is,
trying to be friends with your ex
is a lot harder than it looks
you can't be as candid as you used to be
so then this hot intern leans over my desk,
i can totally see she has a pierced...
brosnan.
pierce brosnan is my favorite of all the bonds.
but most importantly, you can never, ever be alone together.
i gotta go.
-i'm gonna go pay.  -peeing.
i'm gonna help marshall pay.
i'm gonna help lily pee.
all right,we have a turkey.
yeah, we do.
isn't this exciting?
our first thanksgiving together as a group.
yeah, this is gonna be the best slapsgiving ever.
what?
i said this is going to be
the best thanksgiving ever
yeah, this is going to be great.
just the five of us, right?
oh, uh, that reminds me: i invited bob.
bob?
you've been on, like,three dates with that guy.
we haven't even met him.
well, he didn't have anywhere else to go,
and i didn't know what to say.
is it really that big a deal?
yes.
this is our first thanksgiving.
30 years from now, we're going to look at the photos
and say, "oh,  there's the four people i love most in the world.
and bob."
i'm sorry,sometimes i forget
how seriously you guys take american thanksgiving.
real thanksgiving happened over a month ago.
i'm sorry.
did you just say canadian thanksgiving was
and i'm quoting,"the real thanksgiving"?
what do canadians even have to celebrate about?
canadian thanksgiving
celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant
yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt
to find the northwest passage.
why are you guys even a country?
oh, hey, by the way,
if anyone wants to come over early thursday,
we can watch the slapsgiving day parade.
well,there,you said it again.
said what?
slapsgiving.
oh, i guess i did.
you know why? i've invented a new holiday: slapsgiving.
it's the one day we set aside each year
to gather together and give slaps.
i should explain
kids, you remember the slap bet
a year earlier, marshall made a bet with barney
and won the right to slap him five times
he had already used the first
and the second.
but marshall had something special in store for the third
slapcountdown.com.
no.
no, no.
the countdown ends at 3:00 p.m.
the day after thanksgiving.
i counted it out.
how many days are in october?
uh, thirty.
dude, i thought we cleared this up last year.
i like halloween very much.
is nice.
is also tomorrow.
damn it!
wait, you're gonna slap me on thanksgiving?
slapsgiving.
that's not allowed.
lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed?
the hostess in me who's using her wedding china
for the first time wants to say hell, no,
but yeah,i'm going to allow it.
well, you know what?
if you're trying to freak me out
about spending thanksgiving...
slapsgiving.
at your place, then you failed.
truth is, i'm not scared.
-really?-right.cause you blew it.
hmm.the worst part about getting slapped
is not knowing when it's going to happen.
but now i know exactly when i'm gonna get slapped.
so, you took all the suspense out.
you showed your hand.
and thursday at 3:01 p.m.,
your face is going to show my hand.
oh, there's bob!
by the way, heads up, he's a little bit older than us.
how old is he?
he's forty-one.
hey, bob!
over here!
okay, kids, the truth is,bob probably looked like this.
-hey, sweetie.-hi.
but when your ex is dating someone new
your mind tends to accentuate their flaws.
this is how i saw bob.
hey, dudes,what's crackin'?.
-hey  -hey, man, how are you?
good to meet you.
sorry i'm late.
i just got off the phone with my parents.
parents?
they were totally on my case:
"what are you gonna do with your life? you're forty-one."
and i'm like, "chillax,snowboarding is a legit career.
you ought to be stoked i found my bliss."
and speaking of bliss,sugar me, baby.
let's go get a drink.
unbelievable.
robin is dating orville redenbacher.
what are you talking about?
he's forty-one.he looks great.
yeah, du he's in pretty good shape.
he could kick your ass.
how are you guys not seeing this?
he's 150; robin's 27.
barney, come on,what do you got?
nothing but respect for that man.
oh, by the way, we're all baking pies at robin's tomorrow.
marshall can't be trusted in the apartment with pies overnight.
for the millionth time,
sleep-eating is a very serious and delicious medical condition.
hey, uh, what time are you guys going to robin's?
7:30.
perfect.
just to be safe,i'll get there like 8:00, 8:30.
sorry i'm late.
where are marshall and lily?
uh, they just called.
they're both super swamped preparing for tomorrow.
is bob coming?
no, he went to see green day.

so it's...
-...just the two of us.  -...just the two of us.
making pies.
pies. they're things that friends make together.
yeah, they do.
-great. -yeah.
great. well, this is great.
-it'll give us a chance to catch up.  -yeah.
-i'm going to make a phone call. -i'll put it in the oven.
hey, it's me.
listen, you have to come over here and make pies.
yeah, i'll be there, absolutely.
oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver.
it's still kind of weird being alone with robin,
but if you were here...
hey, say no more.
i mean, when i pulled
you out of that burning wreckage,
i wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me.
but if you insist,
yes, i'll be there for the christening.
you're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?
no, i'm not going to wear the medal of honor.
that would just be tacky.
so you're not coming to make pies.
no, no.
thank you, mr. president.
sorry.
after a very long night, it was finally the big holiday.
sorry, the two big holidays.
oh, marshall,
are you working on the cranberry sauce?
in a minute, baby. i've only got so many hands.
you see what i got going on here?
they're turkeys, but they're also hands,
because later, we're going to eat turkey...
and then i'm going to slap you in your face.
please, you took out all the suspense.
in a horror movie,
the killer does not grab a bullhorn and announce,
"attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house:
"at precisely 3:00 a.m.,
"i'm gonna jump out of that closet right there
"and hack you all up with a machete.
p.s. fire is my one weakness."
hey, ted.
-hey, happy thanksgiving.  -you, too.
is lily in the kitchen?
-yep.  -great.
-marshall?  -lily?
-yeah?  -uh-huh?
something really weird happened last night.
what do you mean something weird happened last night?
you may not realize this, but since we broke up,
robin and i have never really been alone together.
so we're in the kitchen,
starting on the pies, and we realize,
we don't have a damn thing to say to each other.
i mean, you can't talk about
how close you used to be.
you can't talk about how close
you're not now.
you just feel like everything you say
is gonna make things worse.
exactly. and you know why?
because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about,
especially around the holidays.
i mean, what decent human being would want to cause
any kind of emotional or physical pain...
you're still getting slapped.
i wanted to leave, but i couldn't stick her
with making all the pies by herself.
she was exhausted.
i yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave.
yeah, some people just can't take a hint.
by the way, i'm really swamped in here.
i kept looking at the clock and sighing--
totally clueless.
uh-huh. i'm not sure i have time to mash
those potatoes, you're standing right next to.
and then ted does the thing that he always does
when there's an awkward silence.
yep. masher's right there, next to the pot.
he panics and says the first thing that pops into his head.
hey, did you know that
the first pies in recorded history came from ancient egypt?
remember last year's thanksgiving,
when we had sex seven times?
-ooh. terrible.  -what?!
i thought it would break the ice.
i'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact.
then he makes it ten times more awkward.
how do you respond to something like that?
did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space?
probably?
ooh, the oven's pre-heated!
okay, um...
the pecan pie is gonna take the longest.
why don't we put that one in first?
pecan pie? why are we making that?
um, it's my favorite.
you're allergic.
i know. i just like smelling it.
it's like eating with your nose.
so we're making a pie for bob.
yeah.
she's got you making pies for this guy?
yeah.
that is a real slap in the face.
you know, you could have just told me it was for bob.
yeah, i-i just thought it might upset you.
upset me? wait a second.
do you think that...
...do you think that i'm jealous of bob?
i don't know.
is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?
-yes.  -why?
because he's a thousand years old.
no, ted, what are you doing?
right?
the only reason i'm jealous of bob
is that we can only talk about the first thanksgiving,
but he was actually there.
come on.
the only reason
i'm jealous of bob is because
i heard noah gave him shotgun in the ark.
ted...
the only reason
i'm jealous of bob
is that i'm just an architect, but he discovered fire.
how do you top that?
he's 41! why are you bashing on him so hard?
i'm not. i'm just joking around.
that's what friends do.
it's mean.
well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney
when he dates some skanktron,
but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad,
i'm not allowed to say a word?
first of all, bob and i are not sleeping together.
we're just dating.
secondly, have i said one word
about the parade of dubious conquests
you've been marching past me the last few months?
one of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?
-hey, that is...-and if you and i are such good friends...
why is baking a pie for bob so weird?
yeah, if you and i are such good friends,
why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing?
okay, maybe we should talk about this later.
i-i should get going.
well, what are we doing?it's thanksgiving.
i don't know. i'm sorry.
this is stupid.
i'm sorry, too.
of course we're friends.
i'm glad we're friends.
me, too.
you guys slept together last night?
that is a terrible idea!
horrible idea.
relapse five!
that's where we high-five,
then it's awkward for a little bit...
and then we high-five again!
what the hell were you doing?
let's review:
you and ted broke up six months ago
-yep  -you're dating another man...
you are correct, sir.
...who's coming to my thanksgiving today...
that is a truth-fact.
-..an event ted is also attending.-ka-blammo.
why are you trying to destroy american thanksgiving?!
oh, lily, it's not as bad as it sounds.
bob and i aren't that serious,
and what happened last night with ted was a fluke.
well, did you guys at least talk about it?
-there's office material...-i hear something burning...
clearly, we need to ignore this.
clearly, we need  to talk about this.
you know? to save the friendship.
-we need to talk.-stuffed mushroom?
we need to talk about last night.
did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous?
probably... not?
ted, can we please just deal with this?
look, i'm not mad.
-i just think...-wait, wait, wait, wait.
why would you be mad-- you started it?
what?! you're crazy!
we called a truce, we hugged,
and when i tried to pull away,  you kept your hand on my neck.
only because your hand was still around my waist.
oh, come on! you leaned into it.
-i... leaned into it?-yeah.
you're like the crappy kid in little league
who knows he's not going to make contact,
so he just..."oops, i got hit by the pitch.
better take my base."
oh, that was you in little league, wasn't it?
my on-base percentage was off the charts!
oh, no!
the slap-petizers.
you know what? that's it!
this is thanksgiving. solve this right now.
and if you have sex again, neither of you gets dessert!
oh, what the hell kind of thanksgiving is this anyway?
um, most thanksgivings.
don't stress, baby.
i'll try to find us something relaxing.
thanks, baby.
ooh, some classical music, maybe.
oh, my!
look at that.
that means we're in the final hour of the countdown.
i'm not scared.
then why is your right cheek twitching?
it's not...
maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard,
it reverberates back to the present,
shattering the time-slap continuum.
please don't slap me.
i'm sorry, what?
oh, god! don't slap me again!
i don't want to get slapped again,
and the first two times hurt so bad, i don't like it!
i don't like it one bit!
i thought i ruined it by putting a clock on it, barney?
well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse!
i can't eat.
i can't sleep.
i've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me.
you know what?i'm outta here.
well, no, no, no. you can't leave.
why can't i?!
nowhere in the rules does it say that i have to sit
through sort of mental torture!
you are allowed to slap my face, sir,
but you are not allowed to slap my mind!
good day!
-but it's slapsgiving.-no!it's not!
it's thanksgiving!
our first one as a married couple,
as grownups--
and you're not even trying to be a part of it!
none of you are!
so...
as slap bet commissioner,i'm issuing a ruling.
thanksgiving is a day of peace.
there will be no slaps today!
-what?!-yes!
in your face!
not my face... your face!
-what's up, dudes? - all:hey, bob.
-baby,please... -no!
the slap bet commissioner's word is final,
so get in the kitchen and mash some potatoes, now.
and for the rest of the day,
we are going to enjoy a civilized, grownup holiday.
not too grownup.
i made jell-o shots.
we's gonna get silly, bitches.
look at us!
we can't be alone together, can we?
apparently not.
what does that mean?
we're supposed to be friends.
we aren't friends, are we?
not really.
we avoid each other.
we smile politely.
we're two people who pretend to be friends
because it would be inconvenient not to.
well, maybe we should stop pretending.
maybe we should.
so...
oh, what do we do now?
i suppose...
we eat dinner.
yeah.
and then that's it.
okay.
happy thanksgiving.
so we sat down to our first thanksgiving
together as a group...and, apparently, our last.
marshall,you're not eating.
did something spoil
your slap-petite?
no, i just thought...before we eat,
maybe the chef would like to say a few words.
nope. this sucks.eat up and leave.
well, then, i'd like to say something.
if that's cool?
um... today,lily did something great.
not only did she gather us all here together
and cook a delicious meal,
but she also started a new tradition.
we're gonna do this again next year,
and the year after that-- maybe for the rest of our lives.
i think that's pretty amazing if you think about it.
and it's all thanks to you,lily.
i love you.
so, to the first of many thanksgivings together.
this is rad!
a nice, small,simple thanksgiving.
i'm the youngest of ten in my family,
so our thanksgiving is a mess.
all the yelling and the screaming...
and then a funny thing happened...
it's really a major buzz-kill.
-major buzz-kill.-major buzz-kill.
oh, no...
i thought we were done with that?
i guess we're not.
guess we're not.
you see kids, friendship is an involuntary reflex--
it just happens,you can't help it.
that first thanksgiving turned out to be a wonderful dinner
with the four people i love most in the world...
and bob
and it did become a tradition.
that's why every year,we go to aunt lily
and uncle marshall's for thanksgiving.
hey, check it out!
we're in the last 20 seconds
of marshall's countdown to nothing.
barney, put it away.
how does it feel, marshall,to sit there, impotently--
your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind?
the slap will occur in ten..
ooh, classy touch, dude.
too bad!
barney, put it away. ...six...
-i will in... five...-five, four...
-you can slap him.-...three...
-what?! wait, you...-two...
...one.
that's three!
thanks, baby, you're the best.
and as a special, added bonus,i've composed a song
just for this occasion.
ted, lights!
what is this feelin'
that's put you in your place
a hot, red burnin' on the side of your face
you feel the blood rush to your cheek
tears start to fill your eyes
and your lips are tremblin'
but you can't speak,you're tryin'
oh, you're tryin'
not to cry!
-you just got sla-apped-oh, oh!
-across the face,my friend-oh, oh, oh
you just got slapped
yes,that really
just happened
everybody saw it
and everybody laughed and clapped
it was awesome
wait,you just got...
slapped.
happy slapsgiving, everybody.
well,guys have fun
this is gonna be majoy cleaner
major cleaner
oh man,we're gonna be doing this all the time,now aren't we
that's the general idea
general idea


<i>En 2007, on aurait dit que tout le monde
allait à ces trucs de dingue appelés</i>
"salle de sport".
<i>L'idée était de leur payer
un max d'argent</i>
<i>pour courir
et soulever des trucs.</i>
<i>La plus grosse arnaque qui soit.
Et des gens gobaient ça.</i>
<i>Moi inclus.</i>
J'ai oublié mon portefeuille.
<i>Ça a commencé avec un de ces moments</i>
<i>où vous réalisez
que vous êtes pas si en forme que ça.</i>
C'est plus loin qu'il n'y paraît.
Les bons de réduc
sont dans ma commode.
Trop loin, tant pis.
Pitié, ne me jugez pas.
J'ai lavé ma honte
en mangeant toute la pizza.
Je me suis réveillé
tout gras et en sueur.
Mes draps ressemblaient à des
emballages de "deli sandwich".
Je devrais m'inscrire
dans une salle. Tu y vas, toi ?
Je vais à Total Rip Fitness
mais je ne m'y entraîne pas.
Tu fais quoi ?
J'investis.
Voilà un de mes investissements, là.
Sheryl, ça paie de travailler dur.
Continue comme ça.
Donc, tes investissements...
- ... sont des femmes ?
- Oui.
Des femmes qui...
comment puis-je le dire délicatement ?
... sont grosses !
Donc, je viens ici leur donner
le plus d'attention,
une fois canon, sur qui
viendront-elles se jeter ?
Celui qui a investi en elles
quand elles ne l'étaient pas.
Je sais pas si je suis purement dégoûté
ou très très impressionné.
Tous les investissements
ne paient pas de dividendes.
Tu vois la fille,
là-bas, au distributeur, Tania ?
Elle est à un Kit Kat de
devenir une action Eurotunnel.
Salut, Barney.
Beckie, les vélos elliptiques
te réussissent, bon boulot.
Celle-là va bientôt récompenser
les investisseurs.
Je prévois une croissance agressive
dans mon futur.
Eh ouais !
Ça me donne envie de m'inscrire.
Je pourrais devenir super forte
et te frapper très fort au visage.
On devrait tous le faire.
Frappons tous Barney au visage !
Non, sérieux.
On devrait vraiment s'inscrire.
On a grossi à la bière ensemble.
Autant perdre ça ensemble.
Ou alors, on pourrait arrêter la bière.
- Moi je dis, on s'inscrit.
- Ouais.
C'est toi, Marshall ?
- Salut, je suis Trish, ton entraîneur.
- Salut.
Ravi de te rencontrer, Trish.
C'est un plaisir.
Marshall, je peux te parler un moment ?
- Bien sûr.
- Super.
Une seconde.
Chéri, je crois qu'elle est un peu trop
sexy pour être ton entraîneur.
Je comprends.
Je veux dire...
je vois ce qui t'inquiète.
Mais, je prends juste soin de mon corps.
Tu seras toujours mon sucre.
Alors, Marshall, es-tu prêt
à t'engager avec ton corps ?
Je t'en prie, ça, c'est tout moi.
J'irais dans le Vermont pour m'engager
officiellement avec mon corps.
C'était bizarre à dire.
OK !
- Commence par 100 pompes.
- OK, je dois en faire combien ?
Cent.
Je croyais que c'était
façon de parler, comme :
"Fais un milliard de pompes",
je peux en faire 100.
Tu sens ça ?
Ça sent la petite fillette
dans mon centre.
Tu joues la fillette ?
Alors, à terre et fais en moi 100 !
T'es pas obligée de me crier dessus.
J'adore cet endroit.
C'est juste des femmes qui veulent
faire du sport, pas besoin de...
me maquiller, de me coiffer,
de porter des fringues branchées...
C'est génial, ici.
On doit retrouver Robin,
j'espère que tu la détestes pas,
elle est canon.
La ferme !
Lily, dis-lui de la fermer.
Désolée, maton lesbienne,
on se connaît ?
Ted, Lily, vous croirez jamais
ce qu'il s'est passé.
Salut, mec, moi c'est Barney.
J'étais au bar à jus.
Que puis-je vous servir ?
Oh, mon Dieu, Rhonda ?
C'est Barney.
Barney Stinson de
Staten Island Boulevard.
Barney de Staten Island Boulevard,
je vous sers quoi ?
- J'hallucine, elle m'a pas reconnu.
- C'est qui ?
C'est Rhonda.
C'est elle qui m'a dépucelé.
The Legen... dary Team
http://nosvospersos.blogspot.com
Bébé, t'as toujours mal ?
Trish m'a fait faire 70 pompes,
elle en a reconnu que 10.
Ensuite, elle m'a fait faire 100 abdos.
Et après elle m'a fait pleurer
rien qu'avec ses mots.
C'est pas logique.
Comment peut-elle m'avoir oublié ?
C'était peut-être pas bien pour elle.
C'était ta première fois.
Ted, c'est moi...
j'assure un max.
Tu me crois pas ?
C'est l'heure d'une histoire.
C'était en 1998.
Je sortais avec Shannon depuis la fac.
On se réservait pour le mariage.
Quand on s'est séparés,
j'avais 23 ans et toujours vierge.
J'y connaissais rien en fille.
Donc je suis allé voir le gars
qui s'y connaissait grave.
Mon frère, James.
Attends, ton frère gay, James ?
C'était avant qu'il le devienne.
Barney, tu dois te trouver une fille
et coucher avec le plus vite possible,
c'est ce qu'on fait après une rupture.
Je sais, j'en ai envie, mais...
je crois que j'ai peur.
Bien sûr que t'as peur, c'est crade,
imaginer faire ça avec une femme...
Mais ça s'appelle être un mec.
Essaie de penser au baseball.
J'imagine les joueurs sur le terrain
et ça passe plus vite.
Mais j'y connais absolument rien
en drague.
Qu'est-ce que tu.. ?
Comment tu... ?
- Où est-ce que tu... ?
- Stop.
N'y réfléchis pas trop,
tu veux pas te choper le yips ?
Le yips ?
Quand tu penses trop
à des trucs simples
et que tu peux plus les faire.
Le yips.
Ça arrive aux athlètes, tout le temps.
Comme le 2e base
qui n'arrive plus à lancer vers la 1re.
Ou le patineur qui fait un triple boucle
piqué parfait, et rate son arabesque.
Je regarde beaucoup
le patinage dernièrement.
Mais James,
pourquoi les femmes voudraient
coucher avec moi ?
C'est pas comme si j'étais
un Backstreet Boy.
La faiseuse d'homme.
Rhonda "faiseuse d'homme" French,
était l'amie de notre mère.
- T'as des rois ?
- Pioche.
Patty, tu connais ce nouveau
livreur de journaux ?
Je l'ai laissé franchir ma lisière,
si tu vois ce que je veux dire.
T'as vu ce nouveau type
qui a nettoyé ma piscine ?
Je l'ai laissé serpenter ma tuyauterie,
si tu vois ce que je veux dire.
Tu connais le nouveau livreur
du traiteur chinois ?
J'ai couché avec lui.
J'ai pas trouvé de jeu de mots,
ça s'est passé il y a 20 min.
Bien sûr !
"La faiseuse d'homme" !
Et ça sera plus facile
parce qu'elle me connaît bien.
- Bonsoir, Perry.
- Barney.
Bonsoir, Mme French.
On s'est pas vus depuis un moment,
mais si par hasard, on pouvait...
Tu m'as fait monter aux rideaux !
C'est le meilleur pied
que j'ai jamais pris.
Je suis né cette nuit-là.
Je me suis relevé tel un phoenix,
de sa poitrine mentholée
et je suis entré dans ce monde
couvert d'Armani et complètement génial.
Laisse-moi arrêter.
OK, arrêtons.
Laissons une chance à l'infarctus
de s'installer
dans 2 ou 3 ans, quand tu auras 40 ans.
J'ai 29 ans.
50 de plus !
Salut, chéri.
J'ai un entraîneur aussi, voici Max.
On va travailler la souplesse.
- Je vais l'étirer.
- Super.
Attends, quoi ?
50 de plus, maintenant !
Ça, c'est pas cool.
Tu sais, Rhonda...
être tombé sur toi m'a rappelé
le bon vieux temps. Tu étais populaire.
J'avais mon petit succès à l'époque.
Et il y avait un jeune homme qui...
sortait du lot.
Freddy Shibatoni !
Ce gosse avait une langue de lézard.
Je pensais à quelqu'un d'autre.
Chaz Oldeman !
Des hanches de femme,
mais il savait s'en servir.
Et moi ?
- Toi ?
- Oui, on a couché ensemble.
Et tu as dit que j'étais
le meilleur de tous.
Vraiment ?
Ah ouais.
À ce propos.
Et dis-lui qu'il est le
meilleur que t'aies jamais eu.
Je sais pas.
C'est juste un gosse.
Non, il a 23 ans et
il se sent vraiment mal, Rhonda.
Je t'en prie.
On pourrait faire un marché.
Quoi ?
Je peux pas, j'ai une petite amie.
Son vagin est le seul pour moi.
Je l'adore.
C'est pas du tout effrayant.
Dommage, ton frère va rester vierge.
D'accord.
Reggie Jackson.
Mais, et ces compliments ?
Tu m'as fait monter aux rideaux.
C'est le meilleur pied
que j'ai jamais pris.
Je t'ai fait monter aux rideaux.
Tous les rideaux que j'ai fait monter
sont la conséquence du sus-dit rideau.
Désolée, Barry.
C'est Barney.
Je fais des abdos et elle me dit :
"Allez, plus qu'une série."
Je rassemble mes forces
et je fais cette série.
Puis, elle me dit :
"Encore une série."
Je demande si c'est la dernière,
elle dit : "Oui."
Je la fais, et elle me dit :
" Encore une série."
Elle m'a menti.
J'ai mal partout.
Bébé, l'intérêt de faire
du sport est de se sentir mieux.
Elle te rend malheureux.
Appelle-la et démissionne.
Faut que je termine
ce que j'ai commencé.
- Je le fais si tu as peur.
- Son numéro est sur cette carte.
Salut, c'est Trish ?
C'est la femme de Marshall.
On a un problème,
et c'est toi.
Je sais pas pour qui tu te prends.
Mais dorénavant,
tu ne donnes plus d'ordre à Marshall.
Tu es une employée,
on te dit quoi faire.
Et je te dis que t'es virée, garce.
Tu devrais y aller. Elle est en colère.
Salut l'ami. Toujours préoccupé
par l'histoire de Rhonda ?
Pourquoi laisserais-je l'assentiment
d'une femme définir ce que je suis.
- C'est très mature.
- Laisse-le finir.
Quand je peux avoir l'assentiment
d'un essaim de mannequins
définir qui je suis.
Quoi ? Trois tickets pour l'after
du défilé de Victoria Secret.
Je peux y aller ?
Ouais. T'es trop courbatu
pour faire quoi que ce soit.
C'est pas un simple match
de championnat.
C'est la phase finale.
Souvenez-vous. On bosse en groupe.
On est une équipe.
Si quelqu'un voit Heidi Klum,
levez la main.
Cible repérée, on creuse.
- Chouette, cette soirée, hein ?
- Ouais, super.
Vous travaillez pour la boîte ?
Oui, c'est la compagnie
De-moi-dans-ta-culotte.
C'est vulgaire.
Mec !
Je sais pas. Quelle horreur !
Je suis désolée.
Attends. C'est bon, ça va.
C'est tout simple.
Mannequins.
Je sais, hein ?
Cette soirée est légen...
attendez...
Combien de temps faut attendre ?
Je crois qu'il fait une attaque.
- Qu'est-ce que j'ai ?
- Je ne sais pas.
J'ai pas le yips, hein ?
Non, détends-toi.
Y a Alessandra Ambrosio. L'anglais
n'est pas sa langue maternelle.
Même si tu foires, elle en saura rien.
Ce sont de très beaux nichons.
Nichons ?
Je connais pas ce mot.
Tu veux danser ?
Je parle de ça.
Je peux pas avoir le yips, pas ici.
Pas maintenant.
C'est moi, Barney.
Heidi Klum.
Merci d'être venus.
Je suis Barney.
Bonjour, enchantée.
- Il va bien ?
- Il a le yips.
Il a pas pu draguer de la soirée.
Il a le yips ?
C'est dur.
En Allemagne, on appelle ça :
C'est dur.
Je sais pas ce qui m'arrive,
j'ai perdu confiance en moi.
Barney, tu devrais peut-être
t'ouvrir à quelqu'un.
Tu devrais peut-être t'ouvrir à...
Il vient de découvrir
que la femme qui l'a dépucelé
l'a fait car son frère l'avait payée.
C'est dur, ça.
Le seul truc
pour se débarrasser du :
Tu dois sortir d'ici,
tu dois trouver cette femme,
et tu dois lui prouver ta valeur
une fois pour toutes.
C'est la seule façon pour toi
de te retrouver.
Oh, des minis hamburgers !
J'adore les minis hamburgers.
<i>Wiedersehen.</i>
Je viens de me faire Heidi Klum !
Quoi ?
Entrez.
Salut, Rhonda.
Salut petit,
je suis surprise de te voir ici.
Peut-être...
tu veux... sexe ?
Sexons.
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Je regarde la Roue de la Fortune.
Tu peux continuer,
je te mettrai face à la télé.
- C'est mignon, mon petit.
- Génial !
Non, je vais pas coucher avec toi.
Assieds-toi un instant.
Je ne suis plus la "faiseuse d'hommes".
Tu sais quoi ?
Il y a cinq ans, j'ai réalisé
qu'il y avait un vide en moi qu'aucune
quantité de sexe ne pourrait emplir.
J'avais besoin de plus.
Et puis, j'ai découvert...
les casinos indiens.
Ça fait bizarre de ne pas te voir
en costume, qu'est-ce qui t'arrive ?
Pas grand chose.
Toute ma vie sexuelle
n'était fondée que sur des mensonges.
Toute mon identité est perdue dans
un puits rempli de cendres mentales.
Le travail, ça va.
Je retournerai jamais à cette salle.
Aujourd'hui,
j'ai dû demander à un stagiaire
de découper mon bagel
et de me donner la béquée.
J'arrête aussi, cet endroit est affreux.
Et ton entraîneur musclé qui aime
tellement t'étirer dans tous les sens ?
En fait, ce type n'avait
aucun lien avec la salle.
Allez les mecs, laissez pas tomber.
C'est génial pour nous.
Aujourd'hui, Robin et moi
avons passé un moment vraiment sympa.
Je voulais juste venir
pour te remercier.
Me remercier de quoi ?
Tu sais comme c'est dur
pour des ex d'être amis
à cause de la tension sexuelle ?
Envolée !
Merci.
Tu peux te moquer, mais je t'ai pas vu
t'entraîner une seule fois.
Faux. J'étais là, aujourd'hui.
Mais t'es parti tôt.
Super.
Je vais devoir rentrer
pour le recharger, maintenant.
Attends un peu !
Tu t'es pas entraîné mardi non plus.
J'ai pris le mauvais short.
T'as disparu lundi aussi !
Non. J'étais à la salle tout le temps.
Ah, j'adore cette salle.
Lily, aide-moi à plier ces trois doigts.
En fait, j'ai une idée.
Fais-le ! Allez, fais-le !
Espèce de nullard !
Pitié, pitié, je veux juste
rentrer chez moi !
Allez, c'est ta dernière série !
T'as déjà dit ça la dernière fois...
Envolée !
J'ai vu ton ami Ted, à la salle.
Après avoir vomi et fait fuir
tout le monde au bar à jus de fruits,
il m'a dit que tu n'allais pas bien.
T'as changé d'avis pour qu'on ait
l'amour ? Qu'on fasse le sexe ?
Pénis, vagin ?
Mais qu'est-ce que j'ai ?
Je comprends pas.
T'as couché avec tellement de mecs.
T'as couché avec mon frère,
on est pareils.
J'étais si nul que ça ?
- Personne n'est bon la première fois.
- Je l'étais !
Du moins, je croyais l'être.
Tu sais quoi,
le sexe ne fait pas tout.
Quand remonte la dernière fois que
tu as eu une discussion avec une fille
sans intention de coucher ?
Je me suis assis
près de Madeleine Albright
à une soirée de bienfaisance une fois.
J'avais aucunement l'intention
de la draguer.
Tu sais, coucher avec moi
à nouveau ne résoudra rien.
Je me demande ce qui peut le faire.
Je crois avoir une idée.
Est-ce que tu as des rois ?
Non. Pioche.
Tu vois Barney,
c'est pas sympa d'être assis là, et...
passer une soirée avec une femme,
sans idée derrière la tête,
faire la conversation ?
Ouais, c'est nul en fait.
Oh, mon Dieu, Barney !
Tu m'as vraiment fait
monter aux rideaux.
C'était incroyable !
- Et je mens pas !
- Je sais que tu mens pas, bébé.
C'était bon pour toi ?
C'est le plus grand pied
que j'ai jamais pris.
À plus.
Papa est de retour.
- Alors, comment ça va ?
- Pas mal... pas mal.
Je peux bouger mes jambes,
et lever mes bras... jusqu'ici.
Tu sais, j'ai l'impression
d'avoir plus d'énergie.
C'est dur au début, mais maintenant,
si un jour passe sans m'entraîner,
ça me manque.
Je suis fier de nous.
La première semaine est la plus dure,
on a passé la tempête.
S'inscrire à la salle est la meilleure
décision qu'on ait jamais prise.
<i>Et on n'y est jamais retournés.</i>



kidsúČback in 2007, it seems like everyone belonged to
these silly things called gyms.
The idea was you'd pay them lots of money
to run around and lift heavy things.
biggest rip-off in the world
and yet people fell for it.
including me.
oh, forgot my wallet
it started with one of those moments
when you realize you're not as in shape
as you want to be.
ah, it's further than it looks.
aw, coupon's on my dresser.
that's too far. forget it.
Please don't judge me.
I winded up with shame eating the whole pizza.
I woke up all greasy and sweaty.
my sheets looked like what they wrap deli sandwiches in.
maybe I should join a gym.
you go to a gym?
Well, I go to Total Rib Fitness, but I don't work out there.
What do you do?
I invest.
There goes one of my ivestment now.
cheryl, hard work's pay it off.
Keep up the good work.
So your investments are women?
Yeah
Women who, how shall put this delicately
They fat.
So, I come here,
give them lots of attention now.
Then when they get hot, who's the first guy they run to?
The one who invested in them when they weren't
Wow, I can't decide if I'm thoroughly disgusted
or really, really impressed
of courese, not all investments pay dividends.
see the girl over there vending machine-- toya.
she is one kit kat away from junk bond status.
hey,barney.
becky, elliptical machine's
really working for you. nice stuff.
that one's going to reward shareholders soon.
i forsee aggressive growth in my future.
what up?
wow,that makes me want to join a gym.
so i can get super strong
and punch you really hard in the face.
yes, we should all do it.
yeah, let's all punch barney in the face.
no, I'm serious.
We should totally join a gym.
come on,we put on
under beer weight together--
we might take it off together.
or we could just stop drinking beer.
no. i say we join a gym.
-are you marshall?  -yeah.
hi, i'm tresh.
I'm the trainer you signed up for.
oh,hi.
really great
to meet you, tresh.
it's a pleasure.
marshall, can i talk to you for a second?
-sure. -great
just a second
ah, sweetie, i think
she maybe just a little too hot to be your trainer.
I get it.
i mean, i see what you're worried about.
but this just about me taking care of myself.
you'll always be my sugar.
so,Marsll, are you ready
to make a commitment to your body?
pssh! please, i'm all about committing to my body.
i'll drive to Vermont and have a commitment ceremony
to my body if you want.
that was a weird thing to say.
all right. start with 100 push-ups.
-all right,cool. how many do you want me do? -100.
oh,i thought that was a figure of speech--100 push-ups,
like do a bazillion push-ups.
no one can do 100.
do you smell that?
no.
it smells like there's a little bitch in my gym.
are you being a little bitch in my gym?
no.
then get on the floor and give me 100!
you don't have to yell at me.
i love it here.
It's just normal women who want to get in shape.
i don't have to put on makeup,do my hair,
wear some trendy outfit.
yeah,this place is great
we're meeting our friend Robin here.
i hope you don't hate her. she's pretty hot.
shut up.
lily,tell him to shut up.
i'm sorry, lesbian prison guard, do we know each other?
ted, lily, you'll never believe what just happened.
oh, hey, dude, i'm barney
so i was at the oothie bar...
what can i get you?
oh, my god, Rhonda?
it's Barney.
barney stinson from statensland boulevard.
hey,barney stinson from  stateniand boulevard.
what can I get you?
i can't believe she didn't remember me.
why? who is she?
that's Rhonda
i lost my virginity to her.
baby,are you still sore?
tresh made me do 70 push-ups,
but she only gave me credit for ten.
then she had me do 100 sit-ups
and then she made me cry, using only her words.
it just doesn't add up.
how could Rhonda not remember me?
well,maybe it wasn't that good for her.
i mean,it was your first time.
Ted, it's me.
i rocked her world.
you don't believe me? okay,story time.
the year was 1998.
i'd been going out with shannon since freshman year of college.
we were saving ourselves.
so when  broke up
there i was, 23 and still a virgin.
i knew nothing about girls.
so i wento the guy
who knew everything about girls-- my brother james.
wait,your gay brother james?
yeah,this was before he was gay.
barney...
barney,you need to find a girl
and have sex with her asap.
that is what dudes do after a breakup.
i know i want to,but... i guess i'm just scared.
of course you're scared.
it's gross.
the thought of doing that with a woman.
but it part of being a guy.
try thinking  about baseball.
somehow i imagine those players on the field
and it's over a lot faster.
but i don't know the first thing about seducing a woman.
what do you...? how do you...?
where do you...?
stop. don't overthink it.
you don't want to get the yips.
the yips?
yeah,when you overthink simple things so much
that you can't do them at all.
the yips
yeah,it happens to athletes all the time.
like the second baseman who suddenly can't throw to the first
or the figure skater who does a perfect triple toe loop
and then loses it on the arabesq.
i've actually really been getting into
figure skating lately.
but james...
what woman's gonna have sex with me?
it not like i'm a backsreet boy
the man maker.
rhonda man maker french
was our mom's friend from down the street.
got any kings?
go fish.
so,patty,know that new paperboy?
i let him throw one into my hedges,if you know what i mean.
did you see at new guy who cleans my pool?
i let him snake my drain,  if you know what i mean.
you know that chinese food delivery boy?
i had sex with him.
i don't have a funny way of saying it yet.
it just happened 20 minutes ago.
of course.
the man maker
and 'll be easier too,
'cause she knows me so well.
hi,barry.
barney.
hi,ms. french.
i know we haven't seen each other for a while,
but if there was any chance...
oh,boy.
wow,you just rocked my world.
that was the best sex i ever had.
that was the night i was born.
i rose like a phoenix from her mentholated bosom
and strode into the world,
armani clad
and fully awesome.
god,please let me stop!
yes,great,let's stop.
let's just kick back and wait for the massive coronary
you're going to have, a couple years from now when you're 40.
i'm... i'm 29.
50 more!
hi,sweetie.
i got a trainer,too.
this is max.
we're going to focus on flexibity.
yeah,i'm gonna stretch her out.
great. wait,what?
50 more,now!
ok,well,that's not cool.
you know,rhonda,
running into you
real got me thinking about the d days
you were quite popular.
i sure got around back then.
and there was one young man who stood out above the pack.
freddy shiba tony
that kid had a tongue like a gecko.
no,no,i was thinking about someone else.
chaz aldman.
hips like a woman, but he knew how to use them.
what about me?!
you?
yes we slept together.
and you said i was the best you ever had.
did i?
right.
about that...
and then him that
he's the best you ever had.
oh,i don't know.
he's jusa kid.
no he isn't. he's 23 and he is really huing,rhonda..
please.
maybe we could make a deal.
what?
i dot know...
no,girl,i got a girlfriend.
ye,yeah,ah,hers is the only vagina for me.
oh... i love it.
it... it isn't scary at all.
well,too bad.
i guess your broer's going to stay a virgin.
fine.
reggie jackson, reggie jackson,
reggie jackson...
but those compliments you gave me.
you just rocked my world.
that was the best sex i ever had.
but you said i rocked your world.
all subseqnt
worlds that i rocked
were only so rocked because of the confidence I earned
from you said first world rocking.
sorry barry.
it's barney.
so i'm doing sit-ups
and she says,"all right,marshall,
just one more set."
so i summon all my strenght and do that set,
and then she says,
"give me another set."
so i'm like,"is this the last set?"
and she says yes.
so i do that set and then she says,
"give me another set."
she lied to my fece!
everything hurts.
baby,the whole point of working out
is to feel better.
this trainer is making you miserable.
you have to call her and quit
i got to work through it.i got  finish what i started.
if you're too scar,i can call her.
her number's on this card.
hi. is this trish?
this is marshall wife.
listen we have a problem here.and it's you.
i don't know
who the hell you think you are,
but from now on you don't tell marshall what to do.
you are an employee.
we tell you what to do.
and i'm tellin you.you're fired,bitch.
okay,bye.
you'd better get down there,baby.
she's pretty pissed.
hey,buddy.
still bummed about the whole rhonda thing?
no. why would i let the proval of one woman define who i am?
that's very mature of you,barney.
let him finish.
when i can let the approval of a aggle of supermodels
define who i am. what? what?
three tickets to the after party
of the victoria's secret fashion show?
uh,kap ammie!
lily,um,could i go?
go. you're too sored to do anything anyway.

he has the yips?
ooh,that's bad.
you know in germany,we call this (speaks germany phra).
wh,that is bad.
i don't know what's happened to me.
i've,i' totally lost my confidenece.
barney,maybe you have to open up to somebody.
maybe you have to open up to some...
he just found out at the woman lost his virginity to
only did it because his brother bribed her.
oh,that a rough one.
i mean the only thing i can think of
to get rid of(speaks gean phras
is you have to go out there.
and you need to find that woman
and you need to earn it with her for real.
That is the only way how you can find yourself.
I see little hamburgers!
i love little hamburgers.
Aufwiedersehen.
I just made out with Heidilum.
What?
Ted,just... okay?
Come in.
Hi,Rhonda.
Hi,kiddo. Surprised to see you here.
So,hey,uh,maybe,how about sex?
Let's sex.
What are you talking about? I'm watching Wheel of Fortune.
You can keep watching. I'll face you toward the TV.
That's a cute idea,kid.
Great.
No,I'm not having sex with you.
Sit down a minute.
I'm not the Man Maker anymore
You know what?
About five years ago,
I realized there was an emptiness inside of me
that no amount of meaningless sex could fill.
I needed something more.
And that's when I discovered Indian casinos.
Hey,Barney,
it's weird not seeing you in a suit. What's going on?
Uh,not much. My entire sexual history
was built on a rotting foundation of lies.
My whole identity is lost in a pit of menthol ashes.
Work is good
I'm never going back to that gym again.
today at work, I had to have an intern
rip up my bagel and put little pieces in my mouth.
Yeah,I'm done there,to
That place is horrible.
what about your big muscular trainer
who's so into stretching you out?
Yeah,well,turns out
that guy had no affiliation with the gym whatsoever.
Come on,guys,don't give up on the gym.
It's been great for us.
Like today Robin and I had a really nice moment.
Robin,hey, I just wanted
to come over and thank you.
Thank me for what?
Well,you know how it's hard for exes to friends
because there's this lingering sexual tension between them?
Gone. Thank you.
You know,for all the crap you' given me
I haven't seen you work up a sweat there once.
It's not true.I was there today.
Yeah,but didn't you leave early
Oh,great
now I gotta go home and charge this
Wait a minute.
You didn't work out Tuesday either.
Brought the wrong shorts.
Yeah,and you totally disaeared on Monday,too.
No,I was at the gym the whole time.
Ooh! Oh,I love this gym.
Lily,help me bend down these three fingers.
Actually,I have an idea.
Do it! Come on! Do it,you worthless piece of crap!
Please! Please,I just want to go home.
Come on.This is your last set!
You said that last time!
Gone.
Rhonda.
I saw your friend Ted at the gym.
After he puked and cleared the line at the smothie bar,
he said you were kinda having a tough time.
Did you change your mind about having love,making sex,
penis vagina?
What is the matter with me?
Oh,honey...
I just,I don't get it.
You slept with so many guys.
You slept with my brother.
We are practically the same person.
Was I really so bad?
Nobody's good the first time.
But I was. At least I thought I was.
Oh,Barney,you know what,sex isn't everything.
When is the last time you had a convsation
with woman with no intenon of score in with her?
I sat next to former Secretary of The State
Madelee Albright at a benefit once.
I certainly did't intend to hit that.
Yeah,well,I'll tell you what.
Sleeping with me again isn't gonna solve anything.
I don't know what else is.
I think I know.
Do you have any kings?
No,go fish.
See,Barney,isn't it nice to just sit
and have a evening with a woman,no agenda?
Just make nice conversation?
No.
Yeah,kinda sucks, doesn't it?
Oh,my God,Barney, you really did just rock my world.
That was amazing.
And I'not lying.
I know you're not lying,baby.
And it was good for you?
It was the best sex I've ever had.
Later.
Daddy's back.
Hey,buddy, how's it going?
Hey. Pretty good.
Pretty good. Ooh!
I can move my legs now and can lift my arms this high.
Yeah,you know,I feel like I have more energy.
Ye,it was hard at first but now if I go a day
without working out,I miss it.
I'm proud of us,guys.
The first week is the hardest.
We're over the hump.
Joining that gym was the best decision we ever made.
And we never went back to the gym again.


Oh, mon Dieu !
J'ai un tatouage.
C'en est pas un.
Ça, mon cher, c'est un tatou-pouffe.
Un tatou-pouffe.
<i>Les enfants,
trop souvent dans la vie,</i>
<i>on prend des décisions
impossibles ŕ assumer.</i>
<i>Cette histoire concerne ces décisions</i>
<i>et les conséquences qui s'en suivent.</i>
Dites au revoir, les enfants.
Car il ne sera bientôt plus lŕ.
Mais Ted, sans le papillon,
comment saura-t-on
que t'es une stripteaseuse de Reno
avec un complexe d'Électre ?
Profitez
de ces derniers moments de moquerie
parce qu'aprčs dix séances
étonnamment chčres,
Stella va m'effacer ce papillon
du bas du dos.
Dr Stella Zinman, c'est la meilleure.
Et elle est plutôt mignonne, en fait,
on va au cinéma ce soir.
- Quoi ?
- Je l'ai invitée.
Pourquoi t'as fait ça ?
- C'est quoi ton problčme ?
- Pourquoi ça ?
Mec...
Ne chie pas lŕ oů tu manges.
Non, ça compte pas.
Si c'est quelqu'un que tu vois de façon
réguličre et que tu ne peux éviter...
Et lŕ, tu es son client,
alors oui, ça compte.
Ted, tu connais la rčgle d'or, hein ?
"Aime ton prochain."
C'est plutôt : "Fais aux autres
ce que tu aimerais qu'on te fasse."
Ça vient de... la Bible ?
Merde, Ted.
J'ai fondé ça sur la rčgle d'or :
"Aime ton prochain", donc...
Bon, la rčgle d'or est
"Aime ton prochain",
mais il y a une rčgle
au-dessus de celle-ci,
la rčgle de platine.
Ne jamais jamais jamais
aimer ce prochain.
C'est charmant, mais c'est pas
un proche, c'est mon médecin.
Si tu veux bien m'excuser.
Barney n'a pas tort.
Tu te souviens de mon histoire
avec Curt, au boulot ?
Et notre histoire avec les Gerard,
au bout du couloir ?
Faut-il te parler de moi
et Wendy la serveuse ?
J'ai pas le temps.
Je passe la porte dčs que je finis
de me coiffer.
On a donc une bonne demi-heure.
Durant ce temps, on te convaincra
de ne pas sortir d'ici.
C'est une histoire
vieille comme le monde, mon cher.
Ça se déroule toujours suivant
les 8 męmes étapes.
Étape 1 : L'attirance.
C'est vrai.
- 12.
- Arręte !
Voici ton Gin Tonic.
Zut, regardez-moi ça.
Vous devez ętre nos nouveaux
voisins, je suis Michaël.
- Moi c'est Laura.
- Bienvenue dans l'immeuble.
Vous connaissez
un bon coin pour les brunchs ?
On adore les brunchs !
Tu dois ętre Robin.
Curt "L'Homme de Fer" Defer.
- Je vais m'occuper du sport.
- Bienvenu.
J'ai l'impression de te connaître,
es-tu un ancien athlčte ?
Hockey.
L'attirance est instantanée
et indéniable.
Mais tu le sais trčs bien.
Tu as vu tes amis commettre
les męmes erreurs.
Tu t'es bien moqué d'eux.
Bande d'idiots, mais quand męme...
tu crois que lŕ, c'est différent.
La rčgle de platine
ne s'applique pas ŕ moi.
Et voici l'étape 2 :
Le Marché
Je craque pour le type des sports.
Je sais, je sais, mais il jouait
au hockey et je suis canadienne.
J'y peux rien.
S'il lui manquait des dents, je lui
aurais sűrement déjŕ sauté dessus.
Robin, ne fais pas ça.
Tu te souviens pour Marshall et moi,
avec les Gerard au bout du couloir ?
Michaël et Laura sont géniaux !
On va les inviter ŕ dîner chez nous.
On est ŕ New York.
On sympathise pas avec ses voisins,
on leur fait signe poliment
dans le couloir,
on appelle les flics
si on les a pas vus depuis longtemps
et que ça sent bizarre.
C'est tout !
On va pas sortir ensemble,
juste faire amis-amis.
C'est la version couple de
"sortir ensemble".
Et vous avez la version couple
de "bander" pour eux.
Vous voulez faire du lčche-vitrine
chez Confo avec eux.
Vous voulez aller chiner ensemble,
hein ?
Ça vous ferait kiffer de chiner
avec eux.
Faut-il que je vous rappelle
pour Wendy la serveuse et moi ?
J'ai décidé de séduire
Wendy la serveuse.
Y a-t-il une rčgle disant que
j'ai pas le droit de séduire
la serveuse de mon bar préféré ?
Je sais pas, j'imaginais
que t'en avais créé une.
Ouais, avec un nom facile ŕ retenir.
Eh bien, j'en ai pas.
J'en ai pas et n'en aurai jamais
parce que c'est une super idée !
Voyons, elle est naďve
et je m'ennuie,
on est faits l'un pour l'autre.
On adore ce bar.
Si tu foires avec la serveuse,
tu vas tuer le bar !
- Tueur de bar.
- Ne tue pas le bar, mec.
Ŕ mon avis, ça ira.
Et c'était une grosse erreur.
Ŕ mon avis, ça ira.
Et c'était une énorme erreur.
Ŕ mon avis, ça ira.
Et c'était une grosse erreur.
Ŕ mon avis, ça ira.
The Legen... dary Team
http://nosvospersos.blogspot.com
Crois-moi, tu ne dois pas faire ça.
Stella et moi sommes adultes.
On est matures, intelligents, capables
de prendre les bonnes décisions.
Tu as un tatou-pouffe papillon.
On va juste au ciné,
si ça devient bizarre
je laisserai tomber.
Tout le monde croit ça.
Ensuite vient l'étape 3 :
La Soumission.
Carl a dű se sauver.
Ça te dérange pas de m'aider ?
Pas du tout.
J'ai deux billets pour les Rangers,
au centre.
Tu veux venir ?
Les déménageurs ont égaré
nos ustensiles de cuisine,
on a pas une seule casserole.
Apparemment, on va commander.
Vous voulez dîner avec nous, ce soir ?
- Je les adore !
- Moi aussi !
Intéressante, cette utilisation
du pistolet ŕ boisson.
Le club soda, ça peut faire monter
n'importe quoi au plafond
C'est enfin arrivé.
Tout ce temps,
chaque verre que je t'apportais...
j'ai toujours su qu'il y avait
une connexion latente entre nous.
Et j'avais raison.
Je peux avoir un Gin Tonic ?
Je parie que tu l'as pas payé.
Oh que si...
Tu dois l'admettre, il y a un bon côté
ŕ briser la rčgle de platine.
Étant son petit ami, j'aurais peut-ętre
une remise sur les soins.
Bien sűr, Ted, il y a un bon côté,
mais c'est au début.
C'est l'étape 4 :
Les Avantages.
On peut partager un taxi pour le boulot,
on se retrouve toujours au déjeuner,
et hier soir, au match de hockey,
Curt nous a emmenés dans les vestiaires
et j'ai rencontré Mason Raymond !
Ailier gauche des Canucks de Vancouver !
C'est quoi le contraire
de balancer un nom connu ?
Merde ! Un peu d'enthousiasme.
Oui, on se voit tous les jours, mais
ça a l'air de bien marcher.
C'est ce qu'on a cru.
C'est si commode,
ils sont juste au bout du couloir.
Mettons qu'on est dimanche
et qu'on veut pas faire de brunch seuls.
On traverse le couloir.
Mettons qu'on veuille dîner,
explorer le vin
et la cuisine de la vallée de la Loire.
On traverse le couloir.
Disons qu'on veuille jouer
aux charades mimées.
Vous traversez le couloir ?
Allez, réjouissez-vous pour nous.
C'est super ce qui nous arrive.
C'est ce que j'ai cru.
- Faut que tu le frappes.
- On ne...
Salut, chéri. Je t'ai fait faire ça
en cuisine, c'est offert.
Au revoir.
Enfin, pas "Au revoir"...
je ne pars pas...
Je serai lŕ-bas.
Allez, des nachos gratuits !
Quoi ?
- On aime ce bar.
- Ne tue pas le bar, mec.
C'est comme notre maison.
- Ne tue pas le bar.
- Tu tues le bar.
Je ne tue pas le bar.
Wendy a bien vu comment
j'opčre dans cet endroit.
C'est trčs clair pour les deux parties
que ce n'est rien d'autre
qu'une aventure passagčre.
Ça va.
En fait, pas du tout.
Ça va.
En fait, pas du tout.
Ça va.
En fait, pas du tout.
Ce qui nous amčne ŕ l'étape 5 :
La Déconvenue
... mais il devrait revenir
sur le terrain pour le printemps.
C'était la rubrique sport.
Ŕ vous, Robin.
Merci, Homme de Fer.
Ŕ tout de suite.
Et... coupé.
Ça te dit de faire un truc plus tard ?
Maintenant, tu me parles ?
De quoi tu parles ?
Je parle d'hier soir.
T'avais dit que tu m'appellerais.
Tu me manquais, j'ai veillé tard
et t'as pas appelé.
Ça m'a énormément touché.
Désolée, j'ai dű oublier.
Désolé, chérie,
je veux pas de dispute ce soir.
C'est l'anniversaire
de notre 1re semaine !
S'il te plaît, apporte une coupe
de champagne ŕ cette beauté, lŕ-bas.
Quoi ?
Juste ici... toi.
C'est toi, la beauté.
C'est ce que je voulais dire.
Du champagne, ça te dit ?
C'est pour moi.
Merci, chéri.
Salut, voisins.
On a acheté le nécessaire
pour une fiesta mexicaine.
En fait, on a des billets...
Et aucune fęte ne serait
complčte sans...
Mec, on a d'autres plans, donc...
OK, un mot.
Deux syllabes.
Sonorité proche.
Parade : charades.
Vous en dites quoi ?
Ce qui nous amčne ŕ l'étape 6...
Écoute, je pars,
donc si tu veux bien noter le reste,
je le lirai demain.
- Ne fais pas ça, Ted.
- Tu peux t'écarter ?
Ne fais pas ça, Ted !
Mec !
C'était parfait.
T'es un sale con.
Ce qui nous amčne ŕ l'étape 6.
Tu réalises enfin que t'as commis
une grosse erreur,
et tu dois vivre avec.
L'étape 6 s'appelle purg... attendez...
attendez encore...
attendez une éternité pour découvrir
que la seule issue est "atoire" !
Purgatoire
Mon Dieu, je suis trop bęte.
Curt "L'Homme de Fer" Defer
n'arręte pas de me laisser
des mots doux sur post-it.
Sur le prompteur, sur mon bureau,
sur la machine ŕ café,
dans le bocal des sachets de sucre
ŕ côté de la machine ŕ café.
"Voici du sucre pour mon sucre."
L'Homme de Fer !
Je me souviens de ça.
Mon Dieu, on est trop bętes.
Ŕ chaque fois qu'on sort,
ils sont lŕ, ŕ nous attendre.
Des fois, on envoie Ted
en reconnaissance
Personne.
On sort une seconde plus tard,
et ils sont lŕ !
C'est surnaturel. C'est des fantômes ?
Y a que nous qui les voyons ?
Salut, voisins ! Salut, voisins !
Je me souviens de ça.
Comment vous avez pu me laisser
sortir avec Wendy la serveuse ?
Mon propre bar.
Je peux pas draguer
dans mon propre bar !
Vous vous souvenez l'ancien Barney ?
C'était un lion, le roi de la jungle.
Traquant la moindre proie,
il attaquait pour tuer.
T'as une chambre froide remplie
de corps ŕ ton appart, avoue.
Regardez-moi, maintenant,
dégriffé,
castré,
ce qui fut jadis ma jungle
est maintenant mon zoo.
Et je suis forcé de ne m'accoupler
qu'avec la męme vieille lionne.
Encore, et encore, et encore,
alors que des familles paient
pour nous regarder.
Cette métaphore part en sucette.
Mettez-moi une clochette et
grattez-moi le ventre, les enfants.
Car je ne suis plus
qu'un chat d'appartement docile.
On adore ce bar.
Tu peux pas la larguer ?
Épouse-la.
Wendy La Serveuse Hyphen-Stinson
Ne tue pas le bar, mec.
Et donc, inévitablement, tu dois faire
ce que tu redoutais depuis le départ.
Une relation-ectomie
est déjŕ délicate en temps normal.
Dans le cadre de la rčgle de platine,
ça nécessite une main trčs, trčs sűre.
Et ça, c'est l'étape 7 :
La confrontation
Faut qu'on discute.
Je t'aime bien.
On vous aime beaucoup.
Je t'aime pas.
On fait mine que ça marche,
mais c'est faux.
Et je commence ŕ me lasser
de toute cette parodie.
On commence ŕ se lasser des charades.
Je veux dire,
je t'aime pas de cette façon-lŕ.
Je t'ai aimé comme ça,
mais comme j'ai vu
tout ce qu'il y avait ŕ voir,
je sais pas, j'ai envie de voir
les męmes choses, mais...
chez d'autres femmes.
Donc, on pourrait peut-ętre
redevenir de simples collčgues.
On devrait peut-ętre
redevenir de simples voisins.
D'autres femmes et toi,
si ça t'intéresse.
Mais les autres femmes
doivent ętre lŕ aussi.
C'est le point important.
Mince !
T'es terrifié ŕ l'idée de t'impliquer
avec qui que ce soit, n'est-ce pas ?
Ou ça !
Disons que c'est ça !
Bon, je peux avoir un Gin Tonic ?
Et pour les relations normales,
ça s'arręterait lŕ. Fin de l'histoire.
Mais comme tu dois revoir
cette personne, il y a l'étape 8 :
La Descente
Et voici Curt "L'Homme de Fer" Defer,
pour le sport.
Les Knicks ont perdu.
C'est vraiment triste,
ils avaient une vraie chance.
Et d'un seul coup : Game Over.
Et pourquoi ?
Pourquoi, Robin ?
Leur tir extérieur
n'a pas été trčs bon cette saison.
Les Knicks ont perdu parce qu'ils
avaient peur d'ętre blessés.
Donc, ils n'ont męme pas essayé.
Vous savez ce que j'en pense ?
Je pense que les Knicks
ne méritaient pas mon amour au départ.
Les Knicks craignent.
C'est tout pour le sport.
- Tu vois quelque chose ?
- C'est dégagé.
On y va !
- C'était juste.
- Trop juste.
C'est pas possible !
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Aucune idée.
Vous ętes lŕ ?
J'ai oublié mes clés,
vous pouvez ouvrir ?
- Ce n'est que Ted.
- Attends !
Bébé, on n'a qu'une solution.
Vite, Michael et Laura sont sűrement...
Salut, voisins.
Barney, saches
que je n'ai pas de ressentiment.
C'était pas une bonne idée
qu'on s'engage.
J'espčre qu'on peut rester amis.
Merci, Wendy.
Bien sűr que oui.
Fais-moi savoir si tu as besoin
de quoi que ce soit.
Faut reconnaître ça ŕ Wendy,
c'est trčs mature.
Elle va essayer de me tuer.
C'est empoisonné.
- Tu es ridicule.
- Le tien aussi.
Elle essaie de me tuer
ainsi que mes proches.
- De quoi tu parles ?
- Regarde les faits.
Je la largue et elle dit :
"Pas de ressentiments."
Elle est folle.
Quelle autre explication ?
Que tu te laisses croire
qu'elle est folle
pour éviter l'explication plus probable
qu'elle ne veut plus sortir avec toi.
Oů Marshall a-t-il eu ce hamburger ?
Je suppose que c'est Wendy
qui lui a amené.
- Mec ?
- De rien.
Attends, t'es lŕ,
ŕ prétendre ętre l'expert sur le sujet,
alors qu'il n'y a eu
aucune conséquence ŕ ta rupture ?
Pas encore.
T'es stupide.
Bon, je décolle.
- Quoi ?
- J'ai un rencart.
Qu...
Quel con !
N'as-tu rien écouté ?
Attirance, Marché,
Soumission, Avantages, Déconvenue,
Purgatoire, Confrontation, Descente.
Tout ceci va t'arriver
de la męme façon que ça nous est arrivé.
C'est la loi de la nature.
J'en ai marre de ces lois.
Il y en a trop : l'échelle sexy/folle,
la loi du citron, la rčgle de platine.
Si tout le monde suivait tes rčgles,
la race humaine cesserait d'exister.
Oui, il y a des chances
que Stella et moi
ne vivions pas heureux ŕ jamais.
Y a une grande probabilité
que ça finisse mal.
Ça finira pour une raison
parmi des millions de possibilités.
C'est pas pour ça
que je vais pas essayer.
Quand ça échouera,
que Dieu me vienne en aide,
ce sera pas ŕ cause de rčgles.
P.-S : merci
d'avoir parfait ma coiffure.
<i>Stella et moi sommes donc sortis,</i>
<i>mais en fait,
c'était pas vraiment un rencart.</i>
- Comment ça, c'était pas un rencart ?
- Elle pensait qu'on sortait entre amis.
Pourquoi ça ?
Elle a vu ton tatouage
et a pensé que t'étais homo ?
Apparemment, une rčgle dit
que je ne peux pas sortir avec Stella.
Exactement, la rčgle de platine.
Stella lit mon blog.
Non, ça vient
de l'association médicale américaine.
Les médecins ne peuvent sortir
avec leurs patients.
Navrée, Ted.
C'est bon.
Vous regardez quoi ?
<i>C'était la fin de l'histoire
entre Stella et moi.</i>
<i>Au moins pour l'instant.</i>
<i>Mais je sais pas.
En repensant ŕ la rčgle de platine,</i>
<i>je me dis qu'il y a une 9e étape.</i>
<i>Appelons-la : Coexistence.</i>
<i>C'est quand on réalise que cette colčre
et ce ressentiment sont inutiles.</i>
- Merci de nous avoir suivis.
- Bonsoir.
<i>Et on commence ŕ en lâcher un peu</i>
Salut.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ce soir ?
- On a invité des amis.
- On va faire des charades.
Amusez-vous bien.
<i>Et ŕ reprendre le cours de sa vie.<i>
<i>Ça prend juste un peu de temps.</i>
Offert par la maison.
Merci.
oh, my god!
i have a tattoo.
oh, that's not a tattoo.
that, dear boy,is a tramp stamp.
a tramp stamp.
kids, too often in life,
we make decisions that we're not prepared to live with.
this is a story about those decisions,
and the consequences that follow.
say good-bye, kids,
'cause it won't be around much longer.
oh, but ted, if you get rid of the butterfly,
how's everyone gonna know
you're a stripper from reno with daddy issues?
yes, yes,enjoy these final moments of mockery
because in just ten surprisingly expensive sessions,
stella is gonna zap that butterfly
right off the face of my lower back.
-stella? -Dr.stella zinman.
she's the best in the business.
and she's rather cute.
in fact... we're going to a movie together tonight.
what?
i asked her out.
ted, why would you do that?
what's the matter with you?
-what?what do you mean?  -dude...
don't poop where you eat.
oh, no, this doesn't count.
if it's someone you see on a regular basis,
and you can't avoid them...
and in this case,you're paying them...
then yes, it counts.
ted,
you've heard of the golden rule, right?
"love thy neighbor?"
uh, actually,it's "do unto others
as you would have them do unto you."
it's from the bible.
damn it, ted, i've worked out this whole thing
where the golden rule is"love thy neighbor,"
now, the golden rule is"love thy neighbor."
but there's one rule above it:
the platinum rule:
"never ever, ever, ever,love thy neighbor."
well, that's cute.
but she's not my neighbor;she's my doctor.
-so if you'll exse me...  -wait, ted,
barney has a point.
remember what happened with me and curt down at the station?
oh, yeah, and remember what happened with us
and the gerards across the hall?
need i remind you
about me and wendy the waitress?
yeah, i don't have time for this.
i'm out the door as soon as i'm finished with my hair.
good, then we've got a solid half hour.
and in that time,we will convince you
not to set foot out that door.
it's a story older than time, my friend,
and it always plays out in the same eight steps.
step 1: attraction.
it's true.
that's not even possible.
-12 of them.  -there's no way.
-here's your gin and tonic.  -thanks.
oh, gosh.
look at that.
you must be our new neighbors.
-i'm michael.  -and i'm laura.
oh, hi, welcome to the building. yeah.
do you guys know any good brunch places around here?
we love brunch!
you must be robin.
curt "the iron man" irons.
i'm gonna be doing sports.
oh. welcome.
you look really familiar.
are you a former athlete?
hockey.
the attraction is instant and undeniable.
but you know better.
you've seen your friends make the same mistakes before.
you've laughed smugly at them.
idiots.
but still, you think,
"this is different.the platinum rule doesn't apply to me."
and that's step 2.
bargaining.
-i think i've got a little crush on our sports guy.  -no.
-no, don't do it.  -no, no.
i know, i know.
but he used to play hockey,and i'm a canadian.
i can't help it.
if he were missing some teeth,
i probably would've already hit that.
robin, it's a mistake.
remember what happened with me and marshall?
the gerards across the hall?
michael and laura.
they're awesome!
we're gonna invite them over for dinner.
-no! no!really? -are you insane?
guys, guys, guys,
this is new york city.
you don't get close to the neighbors.
you nod at them politely in the hall.
you call the cops if you haven't seen them in a while
and you smell something funny, and that is it.
we're not gonna date them.
we're just gonna be friends with them.
that's the couples version of dating.
and you've got the couples version of the hots for them.
you want to browse at pottery barn with them.
you want to go antiquing with them, don't you?
you want to antique the crap out of them.
need i remind you
what happened with me and wendy the waitress?
i've decided to seduce wendy the waitress.
no!
-don't do it!  -request denied!
what rule is there
that says i can't seduce the waitress at my favorite bar?
i don't know. i'd expect you to have one already.
yeah, with some sort of catchy name.
well, i don't.
i don't have one and i never will be
because it's a great idea.
come on, guys.
she's gullible.i'm bored.
we're perfect for each other.
barney.
we love this bar.
if you screw over wendy the waitress,
you're going to kill the bar.
-bar-killer.  -don't kill the bar, dude.
yeah, well...i think it'll be okay.
and it was a huge mistake.
yeah, well, i think it'll be okay.
and it was a huge mistake.
yeah, well...i think it'll be okay.
and it was a huge mistake.
yeah, well...i think it'll be okay.


ted,trust me
you don't want to do this.
look, stella and i are both adults.
we're both smart, mature people
capable of making good decisions.
you have a butterfly tramp stamp.
we're just seeing a movie.
if it seems at all weird,i'll back off.
that's what everyone thinks.
and then along comes step 3:
submission.
night.
hey, barney.
carl had to take off.you mind giving me a hand?
not at all.
robin.
i got two tickets to the rangers.
center ice.
want to go?
and then we discover the movers lost all our kitchen boxes.
we don't have a single pot or pan.
guess we're ordering take-out.
want to have dinner with us tonight?
-i love them.  -me, too.
that was an interesting use of the beverage gun.
club soda can get anything off.
it finally happened.
all this time,
every drink i brought you...
i always felt there was this unspoken connection between us.
and i was right.
hey, can i get a gin and tonic?
see, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic.
oh, i paid for it.
but you got to admit,there is an upside
to breaking the platinum rule.
like maybe as her boyfriend,
i could get a discount on treatments.
oh, ted.
of course there's an upside.
at first.
that's step 4.
perks.
we can split a cab to work together.
we always have a standing lunch date.
and last night,at the hockey game,
curt got us into the locker room,
and i met mason raymond.
left wing for the vancouver canucks.
what's the opposite of name-dropping?
damn it, you guys.
be psyched.
yes, we see each other every day,
but i think it's going really well.
that's what we thought.
and it's so convenient.
they're right across the hall.
say it's sunday,
and we want to have a brunch double date with someone?
we just go across the hall.
and say we want to have a dinner party
exploring the wine and cuisine
of france's loire valley?
we just go across the hall.
say we want to play a game of charades...
you just go across the hall?
come on, people.get excited for us.
we've got a great thing going here.
that's what i thought.
-dude, you got to flick it.  -you don't...
hi, sweetie.
i had the kitchen whip these up, no charge.
okay.
bye.
i mean, not bye. i'm not leaving.
i'll be over there.
okay.
come on, guys.free nachos.
what?
we like this bar.
don't kill the bar, dude.
nay, we love this bar.don't kill the bar, dude.
this bar is like home to us.
-don't kill the bar, dude.  -you're killing the bar.
i am not killing the bar.
wendy the waitress
has seen how i operate in this place.
it is perfectly clear
to everyone involved
that this is nothing more than a temporary fling.
it's fine.
but it wasn't.
it's fine.
but it wasn't.
it's fine.
but it wasn't.
which brings us to step 5:THE TIPPING POINT
...but he should be back on the mound
by spring training.
and that's sports.
back to you, robin.
thanks,iron man.
we'll be right back.
and clear.
so want to do something later?
oh, so you're talking to me now?
what are you talking about?
i'm talking about last night.
you said you'd call and you didn't.
i missed you and i waited up, but you didn't call.
that really hurt.
um, i'm sorry, i-i guess i just forgot.
i'm sorry, sweetie.
i don't want to fight tonight.
it's our first weekiversary.
on my suggestion,you...
hey, wendy, uh,do me a favor
and send a glass of champagne
to that pretty young thing over there.
what?
over there.
you.
you're the pretty young thing...
is what i meant.
champagne? would you? on me.
oh. okay.
thanks, sweetie.
okay.
all right.
hey, neighbors.
we bought all the fixings for a mexican fiesta.
um, well, we actually have tickets...
and no fiesta would be complete without...
dude, actually,we made other plans, so...
okay. one word.
two syllables.sounds like...
..."parade."charades.
charades.
what do you say?
-oh, no.-oh, no.-oh, no.
which brings to step 6.
yeah, listen,i'm leaving.
so if you want to write the rest of these down,
i will read it tomorrow.
don't do this, ted.
you want to get out of the way?
-don't do this, ted. -all right.
don't.
dude! gah!
it was perfect!
you're such a jerk.
which brings us to step 6.
you finally realize you've made a huge mistake
and now you have to live with it.
step 6 is called purg...wait for it.
keep waiting...
keep waiting for all eternity
only to discover there's no escape-- atory.
god, i'm such
an idiot.
yeah.
curt "the iron man" irons
keeps leaving me love notes on post-its.
on the teleprompter,on my desk,
on the coffee-maker,
on the jar of sugar packets next to the coffee-maker.
"here's some sugar for my sugar."
the iron man.
i remember that.
god, we are such idiots.
yup.
every time we step out the door,
they're out there waiting for us.
sometimes, we'll send ted out first as a scout.
nobody's there.
then we'll go out one second later, and there they are.
it's freakin' supernatural.
are they ghosts?can only we see them?
"hey, neighbor.""hey, neighbor.""hey, neighbor."
hmm, i remember that.
how could you guys let me date wendy the waitress?
-oh, you are kidding me.  -what?!
-don't kill the bar, dude. -we said, "don't do it."
my own bar.
i can't hit on women in my own bar.
remember the old barney?
he was a lion,the king of the jungle,
stalking whatever prey he chose,
going in for the kill.
you've got a whole meat locker at home
full of corpses,don't you?
now look at me.
clawed. neutered.
what was once
my jungle is now my zoo.
and i am forced to mate with the same old lioness
again and again and again,
while families pay to watch.
yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart.
put a bell around my neck and scratch my belly, kids,
for i am just a docile housecat now.
meow.
well, we love this bar.
you can't dump her.
marry her if you have to.
wendy the waitress hyphen stinson.
don't kill the bar, dude.
and so, inevitably,you have to do the thing
you've been dreading all along.
now, a relationship-ectomy
is a delicate surgery as it is,
but in the case of the platinum rule,
it takes a very, very steady hand, and that's
step 7: confrontation.
curt, we need to talk.
i like you...
guys, we like you a lot...
i don't like you.
we're pretending this works,but it doesn't.
and i'm getting a little sick of the whole charade.
we're getting a little sick of charades.
i mean, i don't like you that way.
i used to like you that way.
but now that i've seen everything
there is to see, i don't know,
i kind of want to see those same parts
just on other girls.
so maybe, we could go back to just being coworkers.
maybe we should just go back to being neighbors.
other girls and you,
if you're into that.
but the other girls have to be there, too.
that's the important part.
gosh, you're just terrified
of ever getting close to anyone, aren't you?
Or that.
Let's say it's that.
So can i get a gin and tonic?
And in any other relationship,
that would be it.
End of story.
But because you have to see this person again,
there's a step 8: fallout.
And now, here's
Curt "the iron man" irons with sports.
Curt?
Curt?
Well, the knicks lost.
It's sad, really.
they had a real shot.
Then, out of nowhere, game over.
And why?
Why, Robin?
Uh, well, their perimeter shooting
has been a little bit off this season...
The knicks lost because they were afraid of getting hurt.
So they didn't even try.
Well, you know what I think?
I think
the knicks didn't deserve my love to begin with.
The knicks suck.
And that's sports.
Do you see anything?
I think we're clear.
Okay, go, go, go!
That was close.
Too close.
You've got to be kidding me.
What do we do?
I have no idea.
Guys, are you there?
I forgot my keys. can you open up?
It's just ted.
Wait!
Hello?
Guys?
Baby, we only have one choice.
Okay, hurry! michael and laura are probably...
Hey, neighbors.
Barney, I just want you to know, I have no hard feelings.
It wasn't the best idea
for us to get involved.
I hope we can still be friends.
Thanks, Wendy.
Of course we can.
If you need anything else, let me know.
I've got to hand it to wendy the waitress
that was very mature of her.
She's gonna try to kill me.
This is poisoned.
What? You're being ridiculous.
Yours is poisoned, too.
She's trying to kill me and everyone close to me.
-What are you talking about?  -Ted!
Look at the facts  I dump her.
And she says, "no hard feelings."
She's a psycho!
What other explanation is there?
Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy
So you don't have to face the far more likely possibility
that she doesn't want to date you either?
Where did marshall
get that hamburger?
I don't know, I guess
Wendy the Waitress brought it to him.
Noooooo!
Dude.
You're welcome.
Wait a second.
You've been sitting here,
pretending to be the expert on all this,
but the truth is, the was no real fallout
from your breakup at all?
Yet.
You're an idiot.
Alright, I'm taking off.
-What?!  -I have a date.
-Wha...?  -You are such a jerk!
Ted, have you not been listening?
attraction, bargaining, submission,
perks, tipping point,
purgatory, confrontation, fallout!
these things will all happen to you
as surely as they happened to all of us!
it's a rule of nature!
well, i'm sick of all the rules!
there's too many of them!
the hot/crazy scale, the lemon law,
the platinum rule...
if everyone in the world
followed every one of your rules,
the human race would cease to exist.
yes, chances are
stella and i are not
going to live happily ever after.
the overwhelming odds have it ending badly.
and when that happens,
it'll be for one of a million possible reasons.
but that doesn't mean i'm not gonna try.
and when it does fail,
so help me god, it's not gonna be because of some rule.
p.s.
you just made my hair look awesome.
good night.
so stella and i went on our date.
but here's the funny thing:
turns out, it wasn't actually a date.
so what do you mean "it wasn't a date"?
she thought we were seeing a movie just as friends.
why would she think that?
did she see your tattoo
and assume you were gay?
apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date stella.
exactly: the platinum rule.
stella reads my blog.
no, this rule comes from the american medical association.
doctors aren't legally allowed to date their patients.
oh, sorry, ted.
eh, it's okay.
what are you guys watching?
so that was the end of the story
between me and stella, at least for the time being.
but i don't know, looking back on the platinum rule,
i think there's a ninth step.
we'll call it coexistence.
it's the moment you realize that all that anger
and resentment just isn't useful.
thanks for watching.
good night.
and you start to let go of it.
hey, guys.
so what do you guys have going on tonight?
we're going to have a few friends over.
gonna play some charades.
have fun.
and move on with your life.
it just takes a while.
on the house.
thanks.


<i>... mais en 2008, on en a eu assez.
<i>Enfin, la plupart d'entre nous.
Qui veut embrasser
la pierre de Barney ?
Voilŕ l'Homme-Mystčre.
Non, c'est Gumby. On pourra
te changer en noeud plus tard ?
Salut, joueur de la NBA sur la touche
pour une blessure au genou.
Trčs bien, moquez-vous,
mais c'est mon costume
porte-bonheur de la St Patrick.
J'ai fait nettoyer ŕ sec
un paquet de taches de ce bijou.
Il porte chance parce qu'il est vert !
La couleur du allons,
comme dans allons-y !
On en a discuté et...
on va pas fęter la St Patrick
cette année.
Allez, voyons.
T'es sér...
Faut que je m'allonge.
On peut se faire un billard sur toi ?
Intolérable, c'est tellement pas Raven.
Vous avez prévu quoi d'autre ?
On a eu les clés de notre nouvel appart,
on va y aller, accrocher ce tableau,
faire une soirée jeu de société,
tu peux venir si tu veux.
Une soirée jeux de société ?
Voyons !
Allons boire de la bičre verte.
Allons boire des jellos shot verts.
- Et l'esprit de la St Patrick ?
- On boit du thé vert.
Avec de la caféine.
Navré, Peter, on est adultes,
Neverland, c'est fini pour nous.
OK, d'accord.
Vous savez quoi ?
Je vais la fęter tout seul.
J'ai pas besoin de vous,
vous me rendez malade !
Il avait l'air un peu vert.
Joyeuse St Patrick.
Ça va ?
Ça fait un moment qu'on s'est parlé.
- C'est qui ?
- Le cul de Ted.
Merde, c'est au moins la 8e fois
qu'il appelle tout seul aujourd'hui.
Ŕ dire vrai, j'ai appelé le cul de Ted
vers 14 h.
Il a mis du temps ŕ te rappeler.
- Oů es-tu ?
- Dans un taxi,
vers le centre-ville
avec nos deux rencarts pour la soirée.
Oui ! Ça se passe aussi rapidement !
<i>On va ŕ ce club</i>
et tu viens avec nous.
- Pour la derničre fois...
- OK, je voulais pas te le dire
devant Marshall et Lily,
car ils sont vieux et mariés
et c'est trop tard pour eux.
Mais Ted...
le monde va se terminer ce soir.
Penses-y, la fin du monde, Nostradamus,
Notre-Dame,
Fighting Irish, irlandais,
le jour de la St Patrick,
<i>voilŕ, mec.</i>
Mec, c'est l'heure de l'apocalypse.
Le mec-armageddon.
T'es jeune, célibataire,
tu t'amuses plus avec moi.
Tu veux passer
ta derničre nuit sur Terre
ŕ jouer ŕ un jeu de société avec
Marshall et Lily ?
Mes mains sentent bizarre.
Sens ça.
C'est vrai, c'est nouveau.
Je suis lŕ dans cinq minutes.
Super, il est d'accord.
Ted est un mec génial, il...
Tu vas l'adorer.
<i>Donc le 17 mars 2008,</i>
<i>je suis allé ŕ une grosse soirée
de St Patrick.</i>
<i>Et j'ai bien fait,</i>
<i>parce que le plus drôle,</i>
<i>c'est que votre mčre y était.</i>
HIMYM 312
The Legen... dary Team
Tu connais Ted ?
- Moi, c'est Mary.
- Joyeuse St Patrick.
Je connais pas Ted non plus,
moi, c'est Stephanie.
Mec, tout doux. J'étais preums.
Mary est canon.
Dans ce cas, je veux Mary.
D'accord.
Je vois... psychologie inversée.
Alors, je reste avec Stephanie,
Dr Freud.
- Tu veux laquelle ?
- N'importe.
- Je veux les deux.
- T'es débile.
C'est peut-ętre sans importance,
j'ai pas l'impression qu'on va rentrer.
Regarde.
Tu sais pourquoi y a la queue ?
Parce que j'ai lâché Marshall et Lily,
résultat,
l'univers nous punit, voilŕ.
Combien pour qu'on rentre ?
20 ?
40 ?
Allez, tu nous fais passer pour quoi ?
File-lui ton pot d'or.
Juste vous deux ?
Pas de panique, votre ratio sera intact,
2 canons nous accompagnent.
La mienne est la plus canon.
Désolé, vous auriez été seuls,
vous rentriez tout de suite.
Y a que des filles ŕ l'intérieur.
On va finir par penser que
c'est un bar de lesbiennes.
Excusez-nous un moment.
Pour ętre honnęte, j'en rajoutais
sur l'histoire de Nostradamus.
Mais je commence ŕ vraiment penser
qu'il va se passer quelque chose.
Jamais dans l'histoire
des clubs new-yorkais,
il n'y avait eu une pénurie de gars.
Pas męme pendant
la grande pénurie de gars de 1883.
On va lâcher ces filles.
Tu les as traînées lŕ.
Je vois pas d'alliance ŕ ce doigt.
OK, attends.
Les filles dedans sont plus sexy
que nos rencarts ?
Je sais pas si elles sont plus sexy,
mais elles sont plus bourrées.
Bienvenue dans ton nouveau
nid douillet.
OK, pose-moi,
Robin nous trouve bizarres.
Non, ça va.
C'était juste bizarre dans le métro.
Je vais regarder si les anciens proprios
ont laissé des trucs gratuits.
Je vais accrocher notre 1er tableau.
Il y a déjŕ un clou.
Un clou gratuit !
Et d'un !
- Alors ?
- Parfait.
C'est ridicule !
C'est le clou ?
Le mur penche ou quoi ?
Il y a des courants d'air ?
Quoi ?
Ton appart est penché.
Comment ça ?
<i>C'est le genre de truc qu'on voit pas
tant qu'on l'a pas vu.</i>
<i>Mais une fois qu'on l'a vu,
impossible de l'ignorer.</i>
<i>Le nouvel appart de Lily et Marshall</i>
<i>était penché.</i>
Ça veut dire qu'on a dépensé
toutes nos économies dans...
- un appart penché ?
- Oh, mon Dieu !
- Elle va piquer une crise.
- C'est rien.
Regardez ce que j'ai trouvé
dans la chambre des enfants, un skate !
Et de un !
Les Hyppos-Gloutons ! Et de 2 !
Je vais voir la cuisine.
Elle est aveugle ou quoi ? On dirait
les 20 derničres minutes du Titanic.
On doit rien dire, si Lily découvre
que son nouveau nid est penché,
- ça va lui briser le coeur.
- Une essoreuse ŕ salade !
J'adore cet appart !
Juste pour ce soir, OK ?
C'est une pente savonneuse.
Voyons ça sous le meilleur angle.
J'en ai une 3e,
mais je vais pas la dire.
Je pense qu'on a chuté
dans une voie éthico-philosophique.
Costume vert.
J'ai lâché Marshall et Lily
et j'ai été récompensé
de 2 superbes nanas.
Ce costume est fait de vert.
On s'est débarrassés des 2 beautés
et nous voilŕ récompensés
par une nuée de beautés.
Taille 38.
Comme si les lois de l'univers
marchaient en sens inverse.
- Mettez ça sur ma note.
- Quel nom ?
Garido.
J'essaie un truc et si ça marche...
Vous désirez ?
Un Don Perignon ŕ mettre sur ma note.
- Trčs bien, ŕ quel nom ?
- Garido.
- Mec...
- Tu as raison.
Mettez 2 bouteilles.
Maintenant,
on attend qu'un truc cool...
C'est la tradition ŕ la St Patrick
quand on n'est pas en vert,
tu dois ętre puni.
Je le mérite.
Moi non plus, je ne porte pas de vert.
C'est...
du turquoise.
- L'éclairage le rend...
- Moi, c'est Ted.
Ashlee, avec deux E.
Bah voyons, tout au plus du C.
Vous pouvez vous joindre ŕ nous.
On a une bouteille de Tequila
et des nombrils outrancičrement
profonds.
C'est officiel : sois mauvais et
tu seras récompensé.
Ted, écoute. T'entends ?
C'est l'univers qui s'adresse ŕ nous.
On n'a pas ŕ construire
un terrain de baseball, hein ?
L'univers nous dit qu'on a
un laissez-passer ce soir.
Il nous dit qu'on n'a pas ŕ vivre
avec la peur de...
- T'es toujours lŕ ?
- Oui.
Des répercussions de nos actes.
On n'a rien ŕ attendre du lendemain,
et tu sais pourquoi ?
Il n'y a pas de lendemain.
- Pas de lendemain ?
- Au fait, M. Garido.
La 2e bouteille de champagne
vous donne droit ŕ du caviar.
Bonne dégustation.
- Pas de lendemain !
- Pas de lendemain !
Je me demande ce que font les adultes
en ce moment.
J'ai encore gagné.
Pourquoi j'arręte pas de gagner ?
Peut-ętre ton hyppo est plus glouton
que les nôtres.
C'est ça.
C'est pas ŕ cause de la gravité.
C'est sűr, tu peux me croire.
C'était quoi ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
OK, Lily...
pendant que tu étais
dans l'autre pičce, Robin et moi,
on a découvert
un truc sur l'appartement.
Rien de grave.
C'est pas un désastre.
C'est juste un truc avec lequel
il faudra apprendre ŕ vivre.
On a vu un fantôme.
Quoi ?
Il plaisante, hein ?
Non, on a vraiment vu un fantôme.
Il ressemblait ŕ quoi ?
Ŕ un drap avec deux trous.
C'était un général confédéré
qui a été blessé
ŕ la bataille d'Antietam.
Il est mort ŕ l'hôpital militaire
qui se trouvait exactement ici.
Maintenant, il erre dans ces murs
criant vengeance
contre l'Union qui l'a trahi.
Il a l'air sympa. Un type bien.
Tu vois des fantômes partout.
Tu en as vu chez <i>Starbucks</i>.
Ce CD de Kenny G
a décollé de l'étagčre.
C'est la derničre fois que c'est arrivé.
Robin, tu es une sceptique,
si tu dis avoir vu un fantôme...
Il m'a traversée
et j'ai soudain senti du froid.
Un froid intense.
Tu sais, Ashlee,
je suis désolé, tu vas sűrement
vouloir partir en courant, mais...
Faut que je teste cette théorie
sur laquelle je travaille.
Ce soir,
je cherche pas une relation,
je veux sortir avec toi, partir avant
le petit dej et ne jamais te revoir.
Ça marche.
Incroyable.
Bon Dieu, le nombril est profond.
Sans lendemain, Ted !
Sans lendemain, Barney.
Sans lendemain, hein ?
J'aime cette idée.
Car s'il y a un lendemain,
je vais avoir de gros problčmes.
Pourquoi ça ?
Je suis mariée.
Dites-moi que vous plaisantez.
Vous avez pas vraiment vu un fantôme.
C'est rien, bébé,
il avait l'air amical.
Tu disais que c'était un confédéré,
c'était les méchants.
Il est sűrement raciste.
Il avait l'air poli.
Il a les courtoises maničres du Sud.
On va élever nos enfants ici.
Je veux pas qu'un confédéré
leur enseigne le racisme.
Il aime les gens de toutes les couleurs,
il se battait pour les droits d'États,
c'est tout.
Robin a dit qu'il portait un drap,
tu crois que ça veut dire quoi ?
L'appartement est penché.
Quoi ?
On a pas vu de fantôme.
Le sol est penché, n'est-ce pas ?
On a dépensé toutes nos économies
pour ce sol.
Les remboursements
des 30 prochaines années
seront pour ce sol,
et il est penché.
Merci beaucoup, Robin.
Comment un fantôme raciste peut ętre
moins grave qu'un sol penché ?
Sérieusement,
que quelqu'un m'explique.
- Pardon.
- C'est rien.
J'ai des doutes sur la théorie.
Je t'assure, pour connaître l'âge
d'une femme, regarde ses coudes.
- Pas celle-lŕ.
- Sois plus précis.
J'ai beaucoup de théories.
L'histoire de "Agis mal
et des bonnes choses arrivent".
Ashlee est mariée.
- Et alors ?
- Comment ça : "Et alors ?"
Ouvre ton réservoir ŕ cerveau,
car voici
de la connaissance premium 91.
Il y a trois rčgles sur la tromperie :
C'est pas tromper
si c'est pas toi qui es marié.
C'est pas tromper
si son nom a deux voyelles adjacentes.
C'est pas tromper
si elle est d'un autre code postal.
C'est bon pour les trois.
Comment tu sais son code postal ?
C'est une 516.
Elle peut s'habiller comme une 718,
agir comme une 212, mais c'est une 516.
Et son mari qui la laisse sortir
seule le jour de la Saint-Patrick,
si ce type n'est pas 973, je suis 307.
Wyoming.
On va devoir clouer nos meubles.
On pourra pas avoir de flipper.
Ŕ moins qu'on le cale avec des livres.
Mais comment faire si on veut lire
ces livres, c'est un cauchemar.
On peut pas élever des enfants ici,
ils grandiraient de biais.
Si on a une fille,
faudra l'appeler Oblique.
Je crois pas qu'on puisse vivre ici.
Je sais pas ce qu'on va faire.
Ouvre la porte.
Si je passe la porte,
ça fait 5 points.
Cinq points !
10 $ que je peux le faire ŕ l'envers.
<i>Lily et Marshall ont décidé de tirer
le meilleur d'une sale situation.</i>
<i>C'est aussi comme ça que le roller-luge
d'appartement fut inventé.</i>
Attention !
Bon, elle est mariée,
mais elle a pas de gosses.
Qu'est-ce que t'en sais ?
Les poignets.
On dirait que tu ne m'écoutes pas.
- T'es allé oů ?
- Juste...
- J'ai dit quelque chose ?
- Non, c'est juste...
Tu es mariée, on a bu,
et j'étais inquiet qu'on...
Trčs mauvaise idée.
On a un problčme.
C'est ton mari ?
J'ai jamais vu cet homme de ma vie.
Quel est notre problčme ?
Rick Garido, d'aprčs le barman,
c'est moi qui te paie le champagne.
Il y a une explication trčs simple.
Ensuite, la police est venue,
a arręté l'autre type
et j'ai bu gratos le reste de la soirée.
C'était super.
Super, hein ?
Rien ne te pose problčme.
- J'ai perdu mon portable lŕ-bas.
- Qu'est-ce qui va pas chez toi ?
Je perds des trucs.
Tu as embrassé une femme mariée.
Tu as commis
une fraude ŕ la carte bleue.
Tu as embrassé une femme mariée, tu sais
combien c'est offensant pour moi ?
Tu deviens Barney,
on a pas besoin d'un autre Barney.
C'était la Saint-Patrick !
C'était pas si grave que ça.
Pas si grave que ça ?
Tu vas écouter
ŕ quel point c'était grave.
- <i>Premier message
- Je vois pas d'alliance ŕ ce doigt.</i>
<i>Ainsi, la soirée commença ŕ me revenir.</i>
<i>La vraie version.</i>
Les filles dedans sont plus canon
que nos rencarts ?
Je sais pas si elles sont plus canon,
mais elles sont plus bourrées.
Rock'n'roll !
- Combien de messages j'ai...
- 17.
<i>Il est possible de penser, parfois,
que vous vous débrouillez bien.</i>
<i>Message suivant.</i>
Mettez ça sur mon compte.
Quel est votre nom ?
Garido.
<i>Puis, quelqu'un vous ouvre les yeux
et vous réalisez...</i>
<i>Message suivant.</i>
je veux sortir avec toi,
partir avant le petit dej
et ne jamais te revoir.
<i>Tout votre monde est en branle.</i>
<i>Message suivant.</i>
<i>Ŕ côté de la plaque.</i>
Écoute, vieux,
Il y a une explication trčs simple.
<i>Penché</i>.
C'était difficile ŕ entendre.
Personne n'aime sa voix
sur un répondeur.
Merci pour tout.
Tu m'as crié dessus.
Tu as été trčs ferme avec moi.
Trčs sűr de toi.
C'est cool.
Merci.
- T'es trčs sexy quand tu cries.
- La ferme.
Veines, muscles fous dans le cou,
comme le derby du Kentucky, invaincu.
Tu gâches tout.
Ŕ un moment, j'ai cru
qu'on allait s'embrasser.
Sérieux !
Je suis marié.
Un sol oblique.
- Architecturalement parlant, ça va...
- Ętre trčs onéreux.
Ça va aussi prendre du temps,
tu vas ętre coincé avec nous
un peu plus longtemps, si tu veux bien.
Tu rigoles, c'est super.
Je me demande ce qui m'arriverait
si vous n'étiez pas lŕ.
- Tu vas oů ?
- Chercher mon téléphone.
<i>C'était la Saint-Patrick 2008.</i>
<i>Des années plus tard, j'ai découvert
que votre mčre était ŕ cette soirée.</i>
<i>Je l'ai pas croisée.</i>
<i>Tant mieux.</i>
<i>Je suis pas sűr qu'elle m'aurait aimé.</i>
<i>Je suis pas sűr
que je m'aimais non plus.</i>
<i>Mais c'est rien.</i>
<i>Le lendemain est arrivé.</i>
<i>Je le savais pas encore,</i>
<i>mais ma chance</i>
<i>était sur le point de tourner.</i>
Je suis génial.
but by 2008 we'd all had enough.
Well, most of us.
To barney stone.
-Look it's the ridler. -That's not the ridler.
That's gumby.
Can we tie you in a knot later.
Hey nba player sidelined by a knee injury.

This is my lucky st. patty's day suit.
I have dry cleaned many a
Stain off this baby.
You know why it's lucky
Because it's green.
The color of go as in let's.
Barney we talked this
Over and we're not doing st.
Patrick's day this year.
Come on.let's...
Are you -- wow, okay.
I think I got to lie down.

No, no!
Unacceptable.
That's so not raven.
What are you going to do instead.

Our new apartment so we're
Going to hang that painting have board game night.
You're welcome to join us, if you want.
Board game night?
Board game night!
Come on!
Let's drink green beer.
Let's do green jello shots
Where is your st. patrick's
Day spirits
We're drinking green tea.
With caffeine.
sorry,we're grown ups now,
We can't fly up to neverland with you anymore
All right, fine,
You know what,I'll celebrate st. patrick's
Day by myself.
I don't need you people.
You make me physically ill!
He did look a little green.
Hello?
Hey. happy st. patty's day.
How are you? I've been talking to you forever
-Who is it? -it's ted's butt.
Damn it!My phone keeps pocket dialing.
That's like 8th times today.
In fairness I did call
Ted's butt about 2:00 this afternoon.
Just long enough to call you back.
Barney?
Where are you.
In a cab, heading downtown with our hot and
Sexy dates for the evening.
Yes, it happens that fast!
You're coming with us.
For the last time.
All right,
I didn't want to tell you this
in front of marshall and Lilly
They are old and married and it's too late for them anyway
but ted, the world is
Going to come to an end tonight.
Yes, think about it.
End of the world, NostradamusŁ¬notre dame,
Fighting irish.
Irish, st. patrick's day.
This is it, bro.
bro
Apocalypse now.
bro?megandon
You are young, you're single.
You will have so much more
Fun with me.
Do you want to spend your
Last night on earth playing
Board games with marshall and lilly?
My hands smell weird.
Smell this.
They do, that's new.
I'll be there in five minutes.
Yes all right!
He's in.
Ted is a great guy.
You're going to love him.
So on march 17 2008, I went
To a big st. patrick's day party.
And it's a good thing I did
Because funny story,
Your mother was there.
Hi,have you med ted.
Hi, I'm mary.
Hi, happy st. patty's day.
I haven't met ted either.
-I'm stefanie. -Hi
Dude, back off. I called this on stefanie.
Okay, mary's hot .
Well then I want mary.
Fine.
Oh, I see reverse psychology.
Then I'm sticking with
-Stefanie dr. frid. -Ok
Which one do you want more.
Either one.
I want them both.
You're an idiot.
It may be a moot point.
It doesn't look like we're getting in.
Look at this.
You know why there's a line,
it's  because i ditched marshall and lilly
And now the universe is
Punishing us for it, that's why.
What's it going to cost us
To get in, $20?
$40.
Dude come on, you're making the we folk look bad.
just give me your pot of gold.
Is it just you two?
Don't worry we're not gonna blow your race here.
We happen to have two very hot girls with us.
Mine is the hotter one.
Sorry guys, if it was
Just you two, you can go in
Right now.
We have nothing but girls in there.
People will start thinking it's a lesbian bar
Would you excuse us for just a minute?
Ted I'm going to be honest
I was full of it with
that Nostradamus thing
but I'm starting to think there's
Serious planetary crap going on here tonight.
Never in the history of new
York city nightclub has
There been a shortage of dudes.
Not even during the great
Dude shortage of 1883.
We've got to ditch these girls.
You dragged them all
The way down here.
I don't see no ring on this finger.
Hold on.
Excuse me.
Are the girls in there
Hotter than our dates?
I don't know if they're hotter
But they're drunker.
Rock and roll.
Welcome to your new dream home my lady.
All right, all right.
Put me down, robin thinks we're weird.
No it's fine,
it was only weird on the subway.
I'm going to check the other rooms to see if
The previous owners left us any free stuff.
I'll hang our first piece of art,
There's already a nail,
hey lily, free nail!
score!
-How's that. -perfect.
Now this is ridiculous
Is it the nail?
-Marshall  -Is the wall cookt crooked or something?
-Marshall  -Is there a draft in here.
Marshall,
what?
Your apartment is crooked.
What do you mean?
It was the kind of thing
You didn't notice Until you noticed it.
and once you noticed it, you couldn't not notice it.
Lilly an marshall's new apartment
Was crooked.
Oh, no!
No, no!
Oh,no, no!no, no!
Yes.
Are you telling me that
We just spend our entire
Life saving on a crooked apartment?
Oh my god
Oh,she's gonna fret
Look what I found in the
Kids' room, free skateboard,
Score one
Free hungry, hungry hippo.
Double score!
I'm going to check the kitchen
How can she not notice.
It's like the last 20 minutes of titanic in here.
We have keep this quiet,
If lilly finds out her dream house crooked
It will break her heart.
Free salad Strainer.
I love this place
Just for tonight, okay?
Ok
It's going to be an uphill battle.
I'm just saying we have to
Think of the right angle.
I have a third one but I'm
Not going to say it.
I think we've stumbled
Into some sort of ethical Worm hole.
-Green suit -yeah
I ditched marshall and lilly
And was rewarded with two beautiful girls.
Suits made of green.
We bailed on those two beautiful girls
and now we're
Being rewarded with a sea of Beautiful girls.
38 long.
Like the laws of the
Universe are working in reverse.
Can you put it on my tab.
What's the last name.
Guido.
I'm going to try something to see if this works
-hey  -hey what kind of do you get?
A bottle of dom perignon.Can you put it on my tab.
What's your name.
-Garido.  -Dude
you're right. make it two bottles
Now we wait and see something good
Oh,hello
St. patrick's tradition
If you're not wearing green,
You have to get punished.
well this is what i deserved
I'm not wearing green either.
This is deep teal the
Lighting makes it.
I'm Ted
Asheley,with two Es
please Cs at most.
You guys can join me and friends.We have a bottle of Tequila
and shockingly deep belly buttons.
Okay, it's official, do
Bad things, good things happen.
Ted, listen, are you hearing that?
That's the universe.
The universe is talking to us.
We don't have to build a baseball field, do we?
No the universe is
Telling us that we have a free pass tonight.
The universe is saying that
We don't have to live in
Fear of the -- are you still there?
Yeah, I'm still here.
For the repercussions of our actions.
There is no waiting for tomorrow
because do you know why ted?
There is no tomorrow.
No tomorrow, huh?
By the way mr. garido,
With your champagne you get
A free complimentary caviar.
Enjoy.
Not tomorrow
Not tomorrow
Hey wonder what the
Grown-ups are doing right now?
I win again!
Why do I keep winning?
Maybe your hip spoe just
Hungrier than ours.
That's it.That's what is.It's not gravity
that's for sure. I'll tell you that.
What's that?
What's going on here?
Okay, lilly.
While you were in the other
Room, robin and I
We discovered something about this apartment
It's not a big deal.
It's not like a disaster,
It's just something that
We're going to have to learn to live with.
Robin and I saw a ghost.
What?
He's kidding, right?
No, we really saw a ghost.
What did it look like?
A sheet with two holes
He was a Confederate general
Who was wounded at the battle of Antietam
and died at the army
Hospital which once stood on this very spot
And now he wanders these halls
vowing revenge against the union he once failed in
But he seems nice. good guy.
You see ghosts everywhere.
You see ghosts at starbucks.
That kenny g holiday cd
Just flew off the shelf.
Last time that happened.
Robin you're a skeptic so if
You say you saw a ghost,.
It passed right
Through me and suddenly i
Felt cold.
So very coal. cold.
You know ashley, you
Probably just want to get up
And walk away but I just
Have to test out this theory
I've been working on.
Tonight, I'm not looking for
A relationship.
I really just want to hook
Up with you, leave before
Breakfast and never see you again.
I'm in.
Unbelievable.
Hot damn, that's a deep naval!
No tomorrow ted!
No tomorrow barney.
No tomorrow, huh?
I like that idea.
Because if there is a tomorrow,
I'm going to be in
A lot of trouble.
Why is that?
I'm married.
Tell me you're messing
With me guys.
You didn't actually see a ghost
it's not a big deal baby.
He seemed friendly.
You said he's a Confederate general,
they're the bad guys.
And he's probably racist!
He seems polite.
He has courtly southern manners.
How can we bring our kids here.
I don't want a confederate general ghost teach them  racism!
He loves people of all colors and creeds.
He was fighting for state rights.That's all.
You have said he was wearing a sheet,
what do you think that means?
The apartment is crooked!
What?
Robin and i
Didn't see a ghost.
The floor is crooked, isn't it?
Yeah.
We spent our entire
Life savings on this particular.
The next 30 mortgage paying
Years of our lives will be
Spent on a floor an it's crooked!
Thanks a lot, robin.
How is racist
Ghost bear than crooked?
Someone tell me how that's better.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's okay.
So I'm having second thoughts about that theory.
I'm telling you if you want to know how old a woman
Is check her elbows.
Not that theory.
You have to be More specific,ted
Because I have so many theories.
The whole do bad,good things happen.
Asheley is married.
So?
What do you mean so?
Open your brain tank,
Because here come fromPremium 91 octane knowledge.
There's three rules of cheating.
It's not cheating if you're not the one whose married.
It's not cheating if her name has two adjacent vowels
And it's not cheating if she's in a different area code.
You're fine on all three counts.
How do you know she's from a different area code.
She's 516
She may dress like 718,she might act like 212
But trust me,she is 516
Oh and her husband
Letting her out alone on st.Patty's day
if that guy is not 973, I'm 307.
Wyoming.
Maybe we can nail down all our furniture.
We won't be able to get a pinball machine.
Unless we put a book under two of the legs or something.
But if we wanna read those books.this is a nightmare.
Can't raise our kids here.
They will grow up slanted.
If we have a daughter,
we have to call her ilene.
I don't think we can live here marshall.
I don't know what we're gonna to do.
Marshall?
Open the door.
If I make to it the door
That's five points.
Woo-hoo!
Yeah!
Five points.
10 bucks says I can do it backwards.
So lilly and marshall
Decided to make the best of A bad situation
and that's also how the apartment roller luge was invented.
Very careful,very,oh, yeah!
So she's married.
Not like she has kid.
How do you know?
Wrist!It's like you don't even listen to me.
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Where did you go.
Well, I just.
Was it something I said.
No,no,no,it's just...
Well, you're married and
We've been drinking and i was worried we might...
This is a very bad idea.
We have a problem
Hey, hey, hey.
Is this your husband.
I've never seen him in my life
Ok,what's our problem
Rick,Rick garido
According to the bar tenor
I'm the guy who has been
Buying you shall pain all night
Ok,there's a very simple explanation
The next thing I know is the police show up,
They arrest the other guy
and I'm drinking for free the rest of the night
It was awesome
Awesome?
Yeah
You don't see anything wrong with that story
Well I lost my phone in the club somewhere
What the hell is wrong with you,dude?
I lose things
You kissed a married woman ted
You committed credit card fraud
You kissed a married woman
Do you know how offensive that is to me?
You're turning into barney
We don't need another barney
It's st. patty's day!
It wasn't as bad as it sounds
It wasn't as bad as it sounds?
Huh? okay.
I want you to hear exactly
How it sounds ted
First skipped message
I don't see no ring on this finger
And then last night
Started coming back to me
The real version
Are the girls this there hotter than our dates?
I don't know if they're hotter,
but they're drunker.
Rock and roll!
-How many messages did I...  -17
Kids it's sometimes
Possible you're doing just fine in life
Next message
Can you put it on my tab?
Sir, what's the last name?
Garido.
And then someone opens your eyes a bit
And then you realize
Next message
I really want to hook up with you
Leave before breakfast an
Never see you again
Your whole world is off balance
Next message
out of whack
Ok,look,bro,there's a very simple explanation
Crooked
That was hard to listen to
No one sounds good in answerign machine
Thanks for doing that
You yelled at me
You got very firm with me
Very confident
It was cool
Thanks
You're very sexy when you yell marshall
Shut up
Crazy muscles in your neck
You're like the kentucky derby,winning streaks
You're ruining our last moment
At one point I thought we were going to kiss
Ted seriously
I'm married
A slanted floor
Architecturally speaking
Fixing that will be
Very very
Very expensive
And it's going to take some time too
So, looks like you're stuck with us for a
Little while longer if
That's okay
Are you kidding?
I love it
I don't know what's going to happen without you guys around
Where are you going
I'm going to get my stupid phone
So that was st. patrick's day 2008
I find out years later that your mom was at that party
I just didn't meet her
It's a good thing I didn't
Because if I had, I don't
Think she would have liked me
In fact I don't think I like me
But that's okay
Tomorrow had arrived
You see I didn't know it yet,
But my luck was about to change
I'm awesome!
<i>Parfois dans la vie,
d'un simple coup d'oeil, vous savez.
<i>Elle vous est destinée.
Ça peut arriver n'importe oů.
<i>Męme dans la salle d'attente
d'un centre de détatouage au laser.
<i>C'est arrivé quand j'ai vu...
<i>Stella.
Le tatou-pouffe papillon,
mon gagne-pain.
J'imagine que l'histoire inclut
une rupture noyée dans l'alcool.
Ŕ moins que ce soit un tatouage de gang.
Dans ce cas, mieux vaut en changer.
J'ai pensé qu'un tatouage
de chenille serait cool
et aprčs quelques semaines,
d'un seul coup...
Je peux l'effacer
en 10 séances d'une heure.
Mais les séances de laser
sont trčs douloureuses.
Attendez de voir
ma résistance ŕ la douleur.
Hier soir, j'ai supporté
le pire film de l'histoire.
- <i>Plan 9 from Outer Space</i> ?
- Non, le plus mauvais,
<i>Manos, Hands of Fate</i>.
Je suis docteur,
j'ai fait médecine,
c'est <i>Plan 9</i>. Si vous me croyez pas,
il passe au cinéma Pamela.
Je ne vous crois pas, Docteur.
Vous faites quoi ce soir ?
- Salut, Ted.
- Salut.
Rangez ça, c'est moi qui régale ce soir.
- Non...
- Voyons, j'insiste.
C'est si gentil, merci.
Les filles, c'est Ted, il veut payer.
Ça ne va pas ?
C'est juste que...
Je suis un peu gęné,
je pensais que c'était un rencard.
Mais c'est pas grave,
ne vous en faites pas.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Ted est gęné, il pensait
que c'était un rencard.
Ted pensait que c'était un rencard.
Stella, tu savais que Ted pensait
que c'était un rencard ?
Quoi ? Je peux pas sortir avec
un patient, c'est la rčgle de l'AMA.
Elle peut pas, c'est la rčgle de l'AMA.
Elle peut pas sortir avec un patient,
c'est la rčgle de l'AMA.
J'ai compris.
On a tous compris, Ted est un crétin.
HIMYM - Saison 3 - Épisode 13 -
The Legen... dary Team
Vous avez acheté tous les tickets.
Vous aviez raison.
C'est la pire de mes sorties ciné.
Bien sűr, aucun rapport avec le film.
Je suis désolée pour ce malentendu.
Non, ça va, j'ai pu participer
ŕ vos soirées entre filles.
Si vous n'avez pas le droit de sortir
avec vos patients,
j'attendrai la fin des 10 séances,
et je vous réinviterai.
Alors, je dois vous avertir,
je dirai non.
Je reçois des signaux contradictoires,
j'avais l'impression que vous
me reluquiez le cul depuis un moment.
Vous ętes mariée ?
Un petit ami ? Lesbienne ?
Branchée que par les blacks ?
Et pourtant vous me dites avec
la plus grande confiance,
que dans 10 semaines,
si je vous invite ŕ sortir,
vous me répondrez :
Qu'entend-elle par "non" ?
J'en sais rien, c'est énigmatique.
C'est loin d'ętre fini.
Il reste 10 semaines.
Qui sait, d'ici lŕ ?
Vous savez ce que vous allez
manger dans 10 semaines ?
Burger, cocktail de crevettes
et milkshake.
Tu sais en combien de temps une
femme décide si elle va coucher ?
8,3 secondes.
Aprčs ça, sa décision est prise.
- Elle ne changera pas d'avis.
- Ridicule.
Ah ouais ?
Décris-nous
tes premičres 8,3 sec avec Stella.
Le papillon tatoué sur le bas du dos,
c'est ŕ vous.
On a mal commencé.
Pour certains, c'est un souci,
mais je m'améliore avec le temps.
Je suis pas une chanson du Top 40,
facilement digérable.
Je suis complexe, je requiers...
du temps et plein d'écoute.
Je suis <i>Stairway To Heaven</i>.
Roger Daltrey
se retourne dans sa tombe !
C'est pas lui, hein ?
Il est męme pas mort, hein ?
Je trouve ça bien, Ted.
Tu peux faire tout ce que t'as décidé.
En fait, tu m'as inspirée.
J'arręte de me ronger les ongles.
- Mais chérie, tu adores ça.
- Je sais.
Mais je le fais pour Ted.
Dieu que c'est dur.
Laisse-moi 10 séances
- pour transformer ce non en oui.
- Vraiment, Ted ?
Tu crois ?
Dis-moi comment s'est passé
le reste de la séance.
Ça va faire un peu mal.
Je supporte la douleur.
Une fois, je jouais au tennis et...
Le détatouage fait vraiment trčs mal.
Tout le monde doit crier comme ça.
Docteur, ça va ?
J'ai entendu une femme hurler.
Aux 9 séances géniales restantes !
<i>Et puis la semaine a passé.</i>
<i>La 2e séance, je lui ai parlé de mon
été passé avec les enfants défavorisés.</i>
<i>Ŕ la 3e, on a parlé
exclusivement français.</i>
<i>Ŕ la 4e, je l'ai tellement fait rire
qu'elle en est tombée de sa chaise.
<i>Quand vint la 5e séance...
Toujours non.
Encore non. Je comprends pas.
J'ai jonglé !
T'as jonglé ? Je croyais que
tu voulais l'impressionner.
Tu fais de la magie. En quoi jongler
est plus naze que la magie ?
C'est pas naze.
- Je capte pas, elle... ?
- Ça, c'est naze ?!
On avait dit
"pas de boules de feu ŕ table".
Mais qu'est-ce qui te prend ?
Il y a plein d'alcool, lŕ.
On s'était expliqués,
c'est une violation du code anti-feu.
Mais Ted m'a provoqué.
Tu es puni, va au coin lŕ-bas.
Bref, je capte pas. Elle devrait pas
me tomber dans les bras ?
Tu peux y arriver.
J'ai dit que j'arręterai
de me ronger les ongles et tada !
C'est un défi.
Pas facile de draguer avec
le cul nu pointé vers elle.
Ça marche pour les babouins.
Ça s'appelle "la présentation".
Il me reste 4 séances, il doit
bien y avoir des possibilités.
Tu peux pas changer un non en oui,
impossible.
Je sais pas,
parfois la persévérance paie.
- J'ai fini par dire oui.
- C'est faux.
T'as dit "Non, on peut pas. On est amis,
on va ruiner la dynamique du groupe."
- Avec Ted.
- Ah, d'accord.
Attendez...
j'ai trouvé l'angle d'attaque.
Ne me criez pas dessus,
ça a tendance ŕ me faire pleurer.
S'il vous plaît, arrętez...
Un moment.
Je vous ai déjŕ dit,
quand ils vous injurient, raccrochez.
Allez, vous pouvez le faire,
je le sais.
Abby, raccrochez.
Désolée.
J'aimerais que les patients
soient plus gentils avec vous.
La réceptionniste, voilŕ mon ouverture.
Ça me plaît, séduire la réceptionniste.
- Super plan.
- C'est pas le plan.
Et en quoi ça m'aiderait avec Stella ?
Qui ?
Voilŕ le plan.
Tenez.
Je me suis arręt...
Salut, je me suis arręté pour un café.
Je vous ai pris quelque chose.
Merci, c'est vraiment trop gentil.
Vous ętes comme un chevalier.
Je devrais vous appeler Messire Ted.
Quoi ?
Rien.
Docteur Zinman, Ted est lŕ.
Merci, Abby.
Et maintenant... on attend.
<i>Et évidemment, ŕ la 7e séance,
elle me voyait sous un nouveau jour.</i>
Je m'appręte ŕ briser ma rčgle d'or.
Brisez-la.
Abby fait du bowling avec son groupe
religieux tous les mercredis,
elle voudrait vous inviter,
mais elle est trop timide.
Abby, c'est...
Ma réceptionniste.
Vous avez fait forte impression
avec le café l'autre jour,
elle n'arręte pas de parler de vous.
Je pensais que vous aviez dit "Allen".
- Vous avez dit : "Abby, c'est..."
- Oui...
Je pensais avoir dit "Allen".
Qui est Allen ?
Qui est Abby ?
Ma réceptionniste.
Exactement.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe !
Ted, tu dois rester toi-męme,
arręte les combines.
T'as raison, plus de combines.
Juste une.
Sur son étagčre,
il y a ce bouquin d'auto aide :
"Le Pouvoir De Moi".
Je sais, mais j'ai pensé
que si je le lisais
ça nous ferait
un sujet de conversation.
C'est un super bouquin, il m'a appris
le pouvoir de la mémoire absolue.
Je peux te l'emprunter ?
Je l'ai laissé quelque part...
j'ai oublié...
Ted Mosby pour le Dr Zinman.
Salut, Ted !
Je la préviens.
Télépathiquement ?
C'est drôle !
C'est drôle, brillant et génial !
Désolée du retard, j'ai 2 minutes
pour déjeuner chaque jour, c'est dingue.
Je comprends. J'étais en train
de regarder cette vieille étagčre.
J'ai vu que vous aviez lu
"Le Pouvoir De Moi". C'est drôle.
Quoi ? Oh non.
J'ai jamais lu cette stupidité,
un patient l'a laissé ici.
Dieu merci ! Tout ŕ fait d'accord,
c'est vraiment de la merde
je vois des gens lire ça dans le métro,
j'ai envie de crier : "Vivez !"
- Ted, j'ai trouvé votre livre.
- Quoi ?
"Le Pouvoir De Moi", vous l'avez
fait tomber dans la poubelle.
Non, c'est pas ŕ moi,
je l'ai jamais vu avant.
Vous le lisiez en salle d'attente.
Non, vous vous trompez de personne.
Regardez, ici : "Bibliothčque
personnelle de Ted Mosby". C'est vous !
J'aime pas dire ça,
mais je crois qu'il est temps
de niquer la réceptionniste.
Je vais pas la niquer.
Ted, tous les gamins veulent grandir
pour niquer la doctoresse ou l'avocate.
Quelqu'un doit niquer
la réceptionniste.
J'aime bien Stella !
Je t'arręte lŕ, Ted.
Ta petite Stella n'est pas si parfaite.
C'est-ŕ-dire ?
J'y suis allé
pour la juger par moi-męme.
Et quand j'étais lŕ-bas,
j'ai découvert qu'elle avait un secret.
Un terrible...
... terrible secret.
Quoi donc ?
Attends, je vais pisser.
Je suis lŕ.
- Comment ça va, le travail ?
- C'est quoi le secret ?
Oh, oui.
- Bonjour, j'aimerais voir le Dr Zinman.
- Oui, ŕ quel propos ?
Je veux juste la voir, la regarder,
voir ŕ quoi elle ressemble.
Je ne comprends pas.
Désolé, ai-je accidentellement
<i>oprima numero dos</i> en appelant ?
Vous parlez anglais ?
Je veux la voir !
Ne me criez pas dessus,
ça a tendance ŕ me faire pleurer.
S'il vous plaît, arrętez...
Au départ, elle semblait parfaite,
magnifique, intelligente.
Beaucoup trop bien pour toi.
Puis j'ai entendu cette conversation.
Abby, mon hypnothérapeute a appelé ?
Quand vais-je me débarrasser
de cette folliculophilie ?
- Folliculophilie ?
- Folliculophilie.
C'est quoi ?
Ted, ta femme parfaite n'est attirée
que par les hommes
portant la moustache.
C'est le truc le plus stupide que j'ai
jamais entendu. C'est pas possible.
T'as raison Ted. J'ai tout inventé.
Je sais, parce que ça n'existe pas.
J'en souffre un peu.
Ted Mosby pour le Dr Zinman.
Salut Ted !
J'adore la moustache.
On dirait Tom Selleck jeune,
mais 1 million de fois plus beau.
Docteur Zinman,
Magnum est lŕ pour vous.
Je plaisante... C'est stupide.
Désolée du retard.
2 minutes pour manger, comme d'hab.
Alors, on se rapproche de la...
Pourquoi ?
Sérieusement, pourquoi ?
Tu te souviens pas ?
Je parie 10 dollars
que je peux amener Ted
ŕ se faire pousser la moustache.
Tu as saboté mon avant-derničre chance
avec Stella pour 10 dollars ?
Je sais !
Je l'aurais fait gratuitement !
Mais non, tu me dois 10 dollars.
C'est nul. Ma 10e séance
est la semaine prochaine.
Je vais l'inviter
et elle va répondre la syllabe la plus
démoralisante du français : non.
Oubliez ça.
Je vais męme pas l'inviter.
Non, tu dois le faire, elle t'apprécie.
Elle l'a dit elle-męme !
Quoi, t'es allée la voir aussi ?
Je te jure que non.
Ma femme n'arręte pas
de me parler de mes coudes secs.
C'est génial d'ętre en couple.
Vous avez quelqu'un ?
Ou quelqu'un qui vous intéresse ?
In-<i>Ted</i>-ressée ?
On devrait vérifier ce grain de beauté.
Il est un peu irrégulier.
<i>Irrégulier.</i>
<i>Mon Dieu !
Ça y est, c'est la fin.</i>
... et il a un tatou-papillon au dos.
Vous pourriez arręter de parler de
votre autre patient. Je vais mourir !
Męme si ce n'est pas rien, c'est bénin.
Donc essayez de vous détendre.
Vous disiez quoi tout ŕ l'heure
ŕ propos du type au tatou-papillon ?
C'est rien. Juste un petit béguin.
- Je vous appellerai avec les résultats.
- OK, merci.
Monsieur, votre livre !
- Non.
- Si.
Elle a dit béguin ?
Elle parlait de moi ?
<i>Cette derničre séance
fut la moins pénible.</i>
<i>J'ai savouré chacun des tirs du laser.</i>
C'est fait.
<i>Le moment que j'avais attendu
10 semaines était arrivé.</i>
Maintenant que je ne suis plus
votre patient...
Voudriez-vous dîner avec moi ?
Ted, vous ętes vraiment un type bien.
C'était vraiment sympa
de vous connaître.
Je vais tuer Marshall.
Je me suis amusée
ces derničres semaines.
Mon Dieu, c'est pire que le laser.
J'ai une fille.
Quoi ?
Elle s'appelle Lucie,
elle a 8 ans.
Le boulot et elle,
c'est toute ma vie.
Mon calendrier social, c'est sortir
avec les filles une fois par mois
pour aller au ciné.
J'ai été ŕ une seule fęte
l'année derničre.
La St Patrick, c'était affreux.
Je suis partie tôt.
Mais en fait, mon seul temps libre,
c'est mes 2 minutes pour déjeuner.
C'est pourquoi je ne cherche pas.
Je n'ai le temps que pour une personne
importante dans ma vie. Et c'est Lucie.
Bref, ça a été sympa.
La prochaine fois,
réfléchissez avant d'encrer.
Si vous vous réveillez avec...
un dauphin sur la cheville,
appellez-moi.
Voilŕ.
C'est une maman.
- Ça n'arrivera pas.
- Désolé, vieux.
Prends une crevette.
Je suis le seul ŕ blâmer,
elle m'avait prévenu
qu'elle dirait non et bien sűr...
Attendez !
Vous n'avez pas dit non.
Comment ça ?
Vous étiez censée dire non,
mais non.
J'ai vérifié le transcript.
Voilŕ ce que je propose.
Vous n'avez que deux minutes, hein ?
Vous voulez un rencard
de deux minutes avec moi ?
Mon dernier rencard de deux minutes
m'a donné une fille.
Mais... d'accord.
Super.
Et... c'est parti.
- J'ai vraiment que deux minutes...
- Je sais.
Ça fait 120 secondes.
380 west sur la 22e, s'il vous plaît.
Vite, on est pressés.
380 west sur la 22e, c'est...
- Par ici.
- Merci, monsieur.
J'ai toujours voulu essayer ce resto.
Salades maison.
Alors, l'université ?
- Stanford.
- Wesleyan.
- Tu connais Adam Lazar ?
- Non, Scott Crable ?
Aubergine au parmesan.
- Merci.
- Prédécoupés, sympa.
L'addition, s'il vous plaît.
On a un film dans 15 secondes.
Super.
Comment on fait ?
Tu as pris l'aubergine,
j'ai pris que de l'eau, donc...
Je plaisante.
Allons-y.
- Nerveuse ?
- Un peu.
Ça se voit pas du tout.
Bonjour !
384 west sur la 22e.
- 15 secondes. Le film commence.
- Y a les bandes-annonces. C'est bon.
Juste ŕ temps, ça n'a pas commencé.
- Qu'est-ce qu'on va voir ?
<i>- Manos : hands of fate.</i>
- En entier ?
- Le plus important.
Le pire film de tous les temps.
J'ai failli partir 5 fois.
On est comment pour le temps ?
On a un peu de temps.
- On rentre ŕ pied ?
- Oui.
Bonjour !
Au revoir !
En quelle classe est ta fille ?
- En CE2.
- C'est une bonne année.
Elle est super.
J'aimerais juste
qu'elle arręte de fumer.
- Quoi ?
- Je plaisante.
Café et dessert.
Ce quartier n'arręte pas de changer.
C'était un petit resto italien avant.
Je sais, New York.
C'est vivant, une tapisserie
en perpétuel renouvellement.
Regarde l'heure.
Allons-y.
Le cheese-cake est génial.
- Des fleurs.
- Je suis allergique.
Tu vois, on commence
ŕ faire connaissance.
J'ai passé une charmante...
Un doggy bag.
Ce fut charmant.
- Pour moi aussi.
- Et...
Fin !
C'était pas si mal, hein ?
Pas de silence embarrassant.
Le dessert a un peu duré,
J'ai dű couper court
au bisou d'au revoir.
Je crois que je peux ętre
en retard pour une fois.
J'adorerais un 2e rencart. Vraiment.
Mais je comprends que tu n'as pas
trop le temps, mais si ça arrive...
tu m'appelles ?
<i>Et voilŕ
comment on transforme un non en oui.</i>
Mes amis m'ont dit : "Sois forte,
il mérite pas une 2e chance."
Je te pardonne.
Il avait l'air gentil,
mais il a joué avec mes sentiments.
Ce Ted a l'air d'un vrai con.
Tu sais quel est ton problčme ?
Tu es trop gentille.
Vous allez voir le médecin
pour ce grain de beauté ?
Il s'avčre que c'est juste du chocolat.
Que diriez-vous d'un bon restaurant ?
Puis on se ferait une fęte de shopping.
Je vous traiterai
comme vous le méritez.
Pour vous faire oublier
ce monstre de Ted.
Ma mčre a tort.
Il y a des types bien ŕ New York.
On devra d'abord passer
ŕ ma chambre d'hôtel.
Mon lit était cassé.
Je dois m'assurer qu'il est réparé.
Si c'est le cas, on peut faire l'amour
et faire du shopping aprčs ?
Je t'aime bien.
Kids, sometimes in life you see someone
and you just instantly know
this is the person for you.
It can happen anywhere.
Even the waiting room
of a tattoo removal clinic.
And that's what happened when I met...
...Stella.
Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp.
My bread and butter.
So I'm guessing that the real story
involves a bad breakup and some booze.
Unless it's a gang tattoo,
in which case, I think it's
time to find a new gang.
No, I just thought it would be cool
to get a caterpillar tattoo,
and then a few weeks went by,
and all of a sudden...
(laughing)
Well, I can get rid of it
in ten one-hour sessions,
but, I should warn you,
laser surgery's very painful.
Well, I think you'll find
I have a very high
tolerance for pain.
Just last night, I sat through
the worst movie ever made.
Oh, Plan 9 From Outer Space?
No, the worst movie--
Manos: Hands of Fate.
Uh, I'm a doctor,
went to medical school.
It's Plan 9.
If you don't believe me,
it's playing down
at the Pamela Theater.
Uh-huh.
I don't believe you, Doctor.
Well, what are you
doing tonight?
Hello.
Hey, Ted.
Hey.
Hey, put that away.
Tonight's on me.
Oh, no, no, don't...
Come on, I insist.
That's so nice. Thank you.
Hey, guys,
this is my friend Ted.
He wants to pay.
Oh, wow. Oh, yay.
Wow, thank you.
One, two, three, four.
Is something wrong?
No, it's just, um...
I'm just a little embarrassed.
I thought this was a date.
But it's no big deal.
Don't worry about it.
What's wrong?
Ted's embarrassed-- he
thought this was a date.
Ted thought this was a date.
Stella, did you know Ted
thought this was a date?
What? I'm not allowed
to date a patient.
It's an AMA rule.
She's not allowed to date patients.
It's an AMA rule.
She's not allowed to date patients.
It's an AMA rule.
She's not allowed to date...
Yeah, I got it.
MAN: We all got it.
Ted's a schmuck.
(laughter)
(laughing)
And you bought all the tickets.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, you were right.
Worst movie-going
experience ever.
Of course, it had nothing
to do with the movie.
I am so sorry that you
thought that was a date.
No, it's fine.
I got to hang out with you
on girls' night out.
All right, so if you're not
allowed to date a patient,
I'll just... I'll wait until
these ten session are up
and then I'll ask you out then.
Well, then,fair warning:
I'm going to say no.
Really? I'm getting mixed
signals from you.
I feel like you've been staring
at my ass for quite some time.
What, you're married?
No.
Boyfriend?
No.
Lesbian?
No.
Only date black guys?
No.
And yet you can say
with absolute confidence
that ten weeks from now,
if I ask you out on a date,
your answer will be...
No.
No... Hmm.
What could she mean
when she says no?
I don't know,
it is totally cryptic.
This is far from over.
We're talking ten weeks from now.
Who knows what she'll want then?
Do you know what you're going to want
for lunch ten weeks from now?
Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail
and a milk shake.
Ted, do you know how long
it takes a woman
to decide whether or not
she's going to sleep with a guy?
8.3 seconds.
After that,
her decision is made.
She will not change her mind.
That's ridiculous.
Is it?
Describe your first
8.3 seconds with Stella.
Lower back butterfly tattoo--
you're up.
(patients snickering)
(all groaning)
So we got off to a rocky start.
That may be a problem for some guys,
but I get better over time.
Right?
I'm not some Top 40 song--
easily digestible.
I'm complex.
I require time and multiple listens.
I'm "Stairway to Heaven."
Wow, Roger Daltrey just
rolled over in his grave.
That's not the right guy, is it?
He's not even dead, is he?
I think that's great, Ted.
You can do whatever you set your mind to.
In fact, you've inspired me.
I'm going to stop biting my nails.
But, baby, you love
biting your nails.
I know, but I'm doing this for Ted.
Hmm.
God, this is really hard.
Give me ten sessions,
I'm going to turn that "no"
into a "yes."
Really, Ted?
Mm-hmm.
You think so?
Mmm.
Well, tell me, how did
the rest of that session go?
This is going to hurt a little.
Yeah, well, I can handle pain.
This one time
I was playing tennis, and...
(high-pitched screaming)
Yeah, but tattoo removal really hurts.
Everyone probably sounds like that.
Doctor, are you all right?
I heard a woman
screaming in here.
Oh.
(laughing)
Here's to nine more great sessions.
(laughter continues)
weeks went by.
The second session I told her
about how I spent a summer
working with inner-city kids.
The third session we both spoke
nothing but French.
The fourth session
I made her laugh so hard
she fell out of her chair.
(laughing)
So by the time the fifth
session came around...
Still no.
Still no.
What's up with that?
I mean, I juggled.
You juggled?
I thought you were
trying to impress her.
You do magic.
How is juggling
any lamer than magic?
Magic's not lame.
I don't get it.
I mean...
Is this lame?
(screams)
Oh, Barney, no, no.
We said no fireballs at the table.
What the hell is wrong with you?
There's alcohol in here.
Barney...
I...
We've talked about this.
It's a fire code violation.
Yeah, but Ted provoked me.
No, no, you are on a time-out.
Go sit over there.
But...
Go!
Anyway... I don't get it.
She should be into me by now.
You know, you can do this, Ted.
I said that I would
stop biting my nails,
and kablam-ey.
It's just a challenge.
It can't be easy to woo someone
while you're sticking your
naked butt in their face.
Works for baboons.
It's called "presenting."
I got four sessions left.
Ther-There's got to be
an angle I'm not seeing.
You can't turn a "no"
into a "yes," Ted.
Can't be done.
I don't know, Barney.
I mean, sometimes
persistence pays off.
I said "yes" eventually.
No, you didn't.
You were like, "No, we
can't, we're friends.
It would mess up the
dynamic of the group."
To Ted.
Oh, right.
Wait a second.
Wait a second,
I got the angle.
Sir, please don't yell at me,
because when people yell at me,
I have a tendency to start crying.
Please don't do it.
Abby, I've told you before.
Please.
When they're rude to you,
hang up the phone.
...how difficult it
is for me to... Go on,
you can do this, hang up.
Abby,
hang it up.
I am too busy
to waste my time...
I'm sorry, I just wish
that some of the patients
would be nicer to you.
The receptionist.
That's my way in.
I like this.
Seduce the receptionist.
That's a great plan.
That's not the plan.
And how would that help me
with Stella?
Who?
Here's the plan.
(whistles)
Hi. Here.
I stopped--
Hi, I stopped for coffee
and I... and I thought
I'd grab you something.
Oh, wow, thank you, that's so nice.
You're like a knight.
I should call you Sir Ted.
What?
Nothing. Nothing.
(laughing nervously):
It's really stupid.
Um, Dr. Zinman, Ted's here.
Thanks. Thanks, Abby.
And now we wait.
And sure enough,
by session seven, she saw me
in a whole new light.
Okay, I'm about
to break my big rule here.
Break it.
Okay.
Abby goes bowling
with her church group
every Wednesday night...
Mm-hmm. ...and she really wanted
to invite you, but she's too shy.
(clicks tongue)
Abby is...?
My receptionist.
You really made
quite an impression on her
with the coffee the other day.
I mean, she has really
not stopped talking about you.
Oh, Abby.
I thought you said "Alan."
But you just said, "Abby is...?"
Right.
Right, I thought I said "Alan."
Who's Alan?
Who's Abby?
My receptionist.
Exactly.
What is happening?
(groaning):
Ted.
You just got to be
yourself, no more gimmicks.
You're right, no more gimmicks.
One more gimmick.
TED:
You know what's on her shelf?
That self-help book
The Power of Me.
(all groaning)
I know, I know, but I thought
if I read it, maybe we'd have
something new to talk about.
(all groaning)
It's actually a great book.
It taught me the power
of complete memory.
Can I borrow your copy?
I left it somewhere.
I forget.
Hi.
Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.
Hi, Ted.
I'll let her know.
Telepathically?
(laughing):
That's funny.
That's funny, smart, and great.
I am so sorry that I am late.
I have, like, two minutes
for lunch everyday.
It's crazy. Yeah, I understand.
I was just, uh, checking
out the old bookshelf here.
I see you've read The Power of Me.
It's funny...What? Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, I would
never read that piece of crap.
Some patient left it here.
Oh, thank God.
(chuckling):
I couldn't agree more.
That's total crap.
I see people reading that
on the subway
and I just want to shout,
"Get a life, people!"
Ted, I found your book.
What?
Your book The Power of Me.
I think you accidentally
dropped it in the garbage.
What? No, that's...
that's not mine.
I've never seen that before
in my life.
No, you were reading it
in the lobby.
Wha-- no, you have me confused
with someone else.
No, no, look right here.
"From the personal library
of Ted Mosby."
That's you.
Ted, I hate to say this,
but I think it's "nail
the receptionist" time.
I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.
Ted, every little boy
wants to grow up
to nail the doctor or the lawyer.
Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.
No. I like Stella.
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there, Ted.
Your little Stella is not so perfect.
What do you mean?
I went down there
and checked her out for myself.
Yeah.
And while I was down there,
I discovered that she had a secret,
a terrible... terrible secret.
What?
What is it?
Hold on, I gotta pee.
Okay, I'm back.
What's going on at work?
What's the big secret?!
Oh. Oh, right.
Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please.
Sure, what's it regarding?
Oh, I just want to see her.
Want to look at her,
see what she looks like.
I-I don't understand.
I'm sorry, did I accidentally
oprima numero dos when I called?
Do you speak English?
I want to see her!
Sir, please don't yell at me
because when people yell at me,
I have a tendency to start crying.
What are your credentials?!
Please don't do that. Please.
I want to know who am I speaking with!
BARNEY: At first she seemed
great, beautiful, smart,
way out of your league.
But then, I overheard this conversation.
...my grandfather's name--
I was the last-born so...
Oh, Abby, did my hypnotherapist call yet?
No.
(sighs)
When am I going to kick
this folliculaphilia?
Folliculaphilia?
Folliculaphilia.
What is that?
Ted, your perfect woman
can only be attracted
to men with moustaches.
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.
That's not real.
You're right, Ted.
I'm just making that up.
I know that you are
because there's no such thing.
I got it a little bit.
Hi. Uh, Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.
Oh, hi, Ted. Love the 'stache.
You look like a young Tom Selleck,
only a million times handsomer.
Dr. Zinman, Magnum's here to see you.
Just kidding.
Stupid.
Sorry I'm late.
Typical two-minute lunch.
So we are very close to getting...
(laughing)
(cackling)
Why? Just why?
Y-you don't remember?
I'll bet anyone ten bucks
I can get Ted to grow a moustache.
Uh... okay.
You sabotaged my next to last
chance with Stella
for ten dollars?
I know. I would've done it for free.
But, no. You owe me ten bucks.
This is awful.
My-my tenth session is next week.
I'm gonna ask her out,
and she's gonna say
the most demoralizing syllable
in the English language-- no.
You know what?
Just forget it.
I'm not even gonna ask her.
No, you have to. She likes you.
She said so herself.
(clearing throat)
I mean...
Oh, my God,
you went and saw her, too.
I swear to you, I did not.
My wife's always getting
on me about my dry elbows.
So good to be in
a relationship.
Anyone special
in your life?
Or maybe just someone
you're interested in?
Interes-ted in?
You know, we should really
get this mole checked out.
It's just a little irregular.
MARSHALL:
Irregular? Oh, my God.
This is it. It's all over.
One of my patients has this
little butterfly tattoo
at the bottom of his back.
Can you stop talking about
your other patients?!
I'm dying here, woman!
There you go. Look, even if it is something,
it's easily treatable, so try to relax.
Okay.
Hey, what was it you were saying before
about the guy with the butterfly tattoo?
Oh, that... that's nothing.
It's just a little crush.
So I will be calling
you with your results.
Oh. Okay. Thank you.
Oh, sir, your book!
No.
Yes.
She said "crush"?
And she was talking about me?
NARRATOR:
That last session was the least painful of all.
I savored every searing blast
of that laser.
All done.
The moment I'd waited
ten weeks for had arrived.
Stella...
...now that I'm
no longer your patient,
would you like
to have dinner with me?
Ted, you're a really nice guy...
Oh, no.
It has been so great
getting to know you.
I am gonna kill Marshall.
I've had so much fun
these last ten weeks.
Oh, my God, this is worse
than the laser.
I have a daughter.
What?
Her name's Lucy.
She's eight.
Work and being with her,
that's pretty much my life.
My social calendar
is movie night with the girls
once a month
when I can get a sitter.
I mean, I've been to one party
in the past year--
St. Paddy's Day--
it was awful, I left early.
But, really, my only free time
is the two minutes
I get for lunch, so...
this is why I don't date.
Ted, I only have time
for one most important person
in my life, and that's Lucy.
Anyway, it's been fun.
Next time, think before you ink.
But if you ever do wake up with, like,
a dolphin tattoo on your ankle,
just give me a call.
There it is--
she's a mom.
It's just not gonna happen.
Sorry, dude.
Have a shrimp.
I'm good.
I guess I got no one but myself to blame.
She told me right from the start
she was gonna say no and sure enough...
Wait a minute.
Hi.
Hi.
You didn't actually say no.
What do you mean?
All this time you were, uh,
you were supposed to say no,
but you didn't--
I checked the transcript.
(laughs)
So, here's what I'm proposing.
Uh... You only have two minutes, right?
Right.
Okay. You want to, uh...
go on a a two-minute date with me?
Last two-minute date I had gave me a daughter.
Um... Okay.
Great.
And... go.
Taxi!
Hello!
Ted, I seriously only have two minutes...
I know.
That's like 120 seconds.
380 West 22nd, please.
And step on it.
We're in a hurry.
380 West 22nd? That's...
Ha-ha!
Right this way.
(laughing):
Thank you, sir.
You know, I have always
wanted to try this place.
House salad.
Oh.
So, college?
Stanford.
Uh-huh. Wesleyan.
Oh, good. Do you know Adam Lazar?
No. Scott Crable?
Mm-mm.
Eggplant parmesean.
Thanks.
Oh, already cut up. Nice.
Could we get
the check please.
We're trying to make a movie
in 15 seconds.
Of course.  Okay, great.
Uh, how do you want
to do this?
You had the eggplant parm.
I only really
had water so...
I'm kidding.  Oh.
Okay. Let's go.
Taxi! You nervous?
A little bit. You can't tell at all.
Oh, good. Yeah.
Hello!
384 West 22nd.
15 seconds. The movie's started.
Nah, previews. We'll be fine.
Ah! Just in time.
It hasn't started yet.
So, what are we seeing?
Manos: Hands of Fate.
The whole thing?
Only the important parts.
Worst movie ever.
Yeah, I almost walked  out, like, five times.
How we doing on time? Taxi!
We got a little time.
Okay. Do you want to walk it?
Why not?
Hello!
Good-bye!
So what grade's your daughter in?
Third grade.
Ah! That's a good year.
Yeah, she's wonderful.
I just wish that I could get her to quit
smoking, you know?
What?  I'm kidding.
Oh. Look,
coffee and dessert?
You know, this neighborhood
just keeps on changing.
This used to be a cute,
little Italian restaurant.
I know. New York.
It's a living organism,
an ever-changing tapestry.
Ooh, look at the time.
Let's go.
Mmm, the cheesecake's amazing.
Flowers?
I'm allergic.
Okay. See?
We're getting to knock other.
Stella, I had a lovely--
Doggy bag?
Stella, I had a lovely time.
Me, too, Ted.
And... date.
(chuckles)
Huh?
That wasn't so bad, right?
No lengthy, awkward silences.
Dessert ran a little long, so...
I had to cut the good-night kiss.
I think I can be late just once.
Ted...
Look, I I uld love
to have a second date, I would.
But I understand that you really
don't have time right now,
but if you ever do,
will you give me a call?
Yes.
Okay.
And that, kids, is how you turn a "no"
into a "yes."
All my friends told me,
"Abby, be strong.
He doesn't deserve
another chance."
No, no, no.
But I forgive you!
No, no, no, no!
then he just kept
toying with my emotions.
Wow.
This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk.
You know your problem?
You're too sweet.
Aren't you going to see
the doctor about that mole?
Oh, yeah.
Turns out it's just
a Raisinet.
Hey, how would you like
me to take you out to a fancy restaurant
and then go on a shopping spree?
Treat you the way
you should be treated.
Would that make you forget
about that Ted monster?
My mom was wrong.
There are nice guys in New York.
We just have to go
by my hotel room first.
My bed was broken.
I just have to make sure
they fixed it.
Well, then if it's fixed,
can we can have sex on it
and then go shopping.
I like you.
<i>Les enfants,
quand nous étions plus jeunes,</i>
<i>oncle Marshall et moi adorions
le basket universitaire.<i>
<i>Chaque année, March Madness
s'emparait de l'appartement.</i>
C'est quoi, ce tableau ?
C'est notre tableau NCAA.
Grand tableau égale
grande chance.
Il me dit quelque chose,
vous l'avez trouvé où ?
Je cherche ma femme, Mme Aldrin.
On est samedi, y a pas école.
Bien sûr, comment ai-je pu oublier ?
Abruti.
- Grand tableau !
- Grande chance !
On l'a trouvé, rien d'intéressant.
Bref, tous les ans avec Ted,
on mise ensemble de l'argent
à Staten Island.
Le gagnant remporte 100 000 $
fourrés dans un sac marin.
Et on peut garder le sac.
Pourquoi vous vous infligez ça ?
Vous perdez tous les ans.
Parce qu'avant, c'était au hasard.
Cette année, on a vu tous les matchs,
lu les résultats, suivi les blessures.
C'est pas la <i>March Madness</i>,
c'est la <i>Réflexion Méticuleuse de Mars</i>.
Votre équipe a perdu, il y a 20 min.
Je savais pas
qu'ils jouaient aujourd'hui.
Ça va, Barney ?
Il y a un truc bizarre.
J'étais à la quincaillerie,
histoire de choper quelque chose.
Attends, tu dragues
à la quincaillerie ?
Il y a 4 types de femmes
qui vont seules à la quincaillerie.
Évidemment...
Célibataire, récemment célibataire,
récemment divorcée,
lesbienne qui me laisserait mater.
Plus démoniaque, tu meurs.
Pardon, il y en a 5...
récemment veuve.
Je parlais à cette fille.
Je suis sûr qu'il est mieux où il est.
Maintenant,
faut qu'on te trouve un escabeau.
Je m'étais absenté une seconde quand...
Tu vois ? Antidérapant.
- Et pareil à l'animalerie, hier.
- L'animalerie ?
Célibataire, la vingtaine, cherchant
remplacement canin pour son mec,
à la place, elle trouve Barney.
Dieu te bénisse, Ted, tu lis mon blog.
Je m'ennuie au taf.
Je traiterais bien ton ex de chien,
mais ce serait insulter
cette petite puce.
Je veux l'emmener chez moi
tout de suite.
Pas avant d'avoir eu un jouet à mâcher
d'oncle Barney.
<i>Et à mon retour...</i>
Désolé, je la gâte déjà,
mais : "Un Diamant Brut",
ton cœur ne fond-il pas ?
Salaud.
Bizarre, hein ?
La semaine dernière au musée, pareil.
Lily.
Tu joues les jeunes artistes
à la recherche d'une nouvelle muse.
T'es un voleur d'art millionnaire
cherchant l'excitation
que l'argent ne te procure plus.
Tu perds la vue et tu essayes
d'assimiler toute la beauté du monde
- avant que l'obscurité ne te gagne
- Gagné !
Je parlais à cette fille...
Pour l'instant, environ 83 %.
Sous peu, ces guides audios
seront tout ce qu'il me reste.
Je suis vraiment navrée.
Dieu que tu es belle.
Si je te donnais un casque,
tu pourrais voir
avec tes oreilles comme moi ?
<i>J'ai pas pu m'absenter
plus de 20 secondes. À mon retour...
Tu sais...
j'aime aussi l'odeur
de superbes créations.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Tu mens peut-être pas
aussi bien que ça.
Ah bon ? Et pourquoi je suis pas
en prison pour parjure ?
Mais bon,
je veux pas parler du boulot.
Il se passe
quelque chose de très bizarre.
<i>Mais le soir suivant
fut encore plus bizarre.</i>
Alan Alda, c'était lui.
Tu croiras jamais
ce qui vient de se passer.
Le type de M.A.S.H,
le perso principal.
Le beau gosse de M.A.S.H,
je ne connais que lui...
Un petit conseil.
Le type à qui tu parlais,
Barney Stinson,
je sais qu'il est charmant,
mais il dirait n'importe quoi
pour coucher avec toi. Ça a été
la plus grosse erreur de ma vie.
Oh, mon Dieu ! Où est-elle ?
- Elle a dû partir.
- Elle a dû... ?...
Elle a dit
que j'avais couché avec elle ?
- Son nom ? Comment était-elle ?
- Elle a pas dit son nom,
elle était blonde, avec des seins,
un peu pétasse.
Regard vide avec une aura
d'auto-répugnance et de désespoir ?
Elles sont toutes comme ça.
Du calme, réfléchissons bien.
Une fille que j'ai dupée,
séduite et larguée,
essaie de me nuire.
Ça devrait pas être si compliqué
de trouver qui c'est.
Miséricorde !
The Legen... dary Team
HIMYM 3x14
C'est un cauchemar.
Une fille, avec qui j'ai couché et
que j'ai larguée, essaie de me démolir.
- Mais pourquoi, mon Dieu ?
- C'est le karma.
C'est pas Karma.
Elle fait du strip-tease à Las Vegas,
et puis on s'entend bien.
Si tu veux savoir qui c'est, pourquoi
ne pas commencer par ta liste ?
- Ma liste ?
- Mec...
Fais pas genre : tu gardes pas
une liste de tes conquêtes.
J'en ai une.
C'est mon contrat de mariage.
Allez, sors la liste.
Ne sois pas aussi grossier.
Jamais je réduirais
les femmes avec qui j'ai couché
à un nom sur une liste de la honte.
C'est un scrapbook
de toutes mes conquêtes.
Je l'ai fait
au <i>Scrapbook Barn</i> sur la 7e.
Demandez Eloïse,
dites-lui que je vous ai envoyés.
T'en dis quoi, Lily ?
Tu reconnais la saboteuse ?
Je sais pas, j'ai vu que son visage.
Combien savent
qu'elles ont été photographiées ?
Toutes, mais seulement la moitié
achète une copie en partant.
Tu trouveras jamais laquelle
est la femme mystère.
Toutes ont une bonne raison de te haïr.
Voyons, du calme.
Une fille qui irait
avec un gars comme Barney et ferait
ça ou... ça ou ça et ça...
ou ferait ça avec ça là...
doit savoir à quoi elle s'attend.
Absolument.
Et ce que je fais avec elles,
devrait rester entre elles et moi.
Et vous tous.
Et Eloïse,
elle m'a aidé pour le découpage.
Je sais pas, j'en reconnais aucune.
Enfin, quelques petites célébrités,
une attachée au gouvernement,
et ce qui semble être une mascotte
de chaîne de fast-food.
C'est pas possible.
Y a trop de filles, comment je vais
réduire la recherche ?
Le top 64 des filles avec qui j'ai
couché, séparées en quatre régions.
Ce tournoi va sélectionner laquelle
a le plus de raisons de me détester.
La dernière est forcément la saboteuse.
Pas question Barney,
on va pas faire un jeu sur les filles
avec qui tu as couché.
Celle qui pensait
qu'il avait 12 h à vivre
a beaucoup plus de raisons que celle
avec qui il s'est faussement fiancé.
C'est la fille
des fausses fiançailles !
Elle a engagé
un organisateur de mariage !
"12 h à vivre" !
Elle lui a payé un voyage à Paris.
Elle a juste payé l'aller.
Tout le monde. Les mains.
"12 h à vivre" !
Bordel !
Au choix,
"Pense que j'étais Jorge Posada"
ou
"Tu as le rein de ma défunte femme".
- "Rein"
- "Jorge Posada"
Elle a acheté des tickets à la saison
pour le voir jouer.
C'est "Rein de la défunte",
comment peut-on même en discuter ?
- "Faux bébé" !
- "Perdu en mer" !
J'étais là !
Croyez-moi, c'est "Faux bébé".
Et voilà le top 16.
Au nord-ouest nous avons en 3e,
la fille qui pensait
que Google m'appartenait
contre la numéro 7, celle qui pensait
que j'étais le prof de plongée.
- "Le prof de plongée".
- Tu veux rire ?
- Elle a décompressé !
- Oh que oui.
- "Jumeau diabolique" !
- "Prince de Norvège" !
Comment ça peut ne pas être
"Prince de Norvège" ?
Barney, tu choisis.
Je choisis "Jumeau Diabolique".
J'ai couché avec elle deux fois :
en Barney et en Larney.
OK, il nous en reste quatre.
Vous en pensez quoi ?
Allez, un peu de courage.
J'en sais rien,
ça peut être chacune d'elles.
C'est pas le tableau de ma classe ?
Allez, Marshall ?
Je suis fatigué et malheureux.
Je veux appeler ma maman.
Lui dire que je l'aime.
On ira pas plus loin.
Les quatre dernières.
Ça doit être Meg,
Anna, Kate ou Holly.
On va les retrouver et tu me diras
laquelle t'a approchée au bar.
Vous m'avez piqué mon tableau !
OK, c'est là.
Quand elle sort, je me cache,
et dès que tu vois
si c'est la fille du bar, on s'enfuit.
Comment ça, non ?
Cette fille, comme les autres
du top 4, mérite des excuses,
et je te dis pas si c'est elle
tant que j'entends pas "Je suis désolé".
T'es folle ?
Ça implique que je parle à une fille
avec qui j'ai déjà couché.
C'est un peu comme vouloir changer
l'huile sur une voiture de location.
Barney, tu vas le faire.
Lily, cette fille me déteste.
Je l'ai emmenée dans un appart
qui était prétendument le mien,
dis que je l'aimais,
et l'ai laissée là, en plan.
Elle s'est fait arrêter pour intrusion,
a frappé un flic
et passé 8 jours en prison.
Merde, elle est là.
Si elle me voit, elle va me tuer.
Voilà ce qu'on va faire.
Meg ! Regarde qui est là,
ton vieil ami Barney.
Si elle me tue, va dans mon appart,
prends la valise en métal sous mon lit
et jette-la dans l'East River.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Meg, faut qu'on parle.
Tout est ma faute.
Je sais, bébé.
J'ai été trop insistante.
Je te pardonne.
Je t'aime.
Mon Dieu, moi aussi je t'aime !
C'est quoi votre problème ?
Écarte-toi de lui.
Bon, c'est pas elle, mais
tu lui dois quand même des excu...
Tu te souviens de celle-ci, non ?
Tu lui as dit que tu étais Ted
et que tu étais architecte.
Et tu te rappelles, son PC avait
une webcam et l'ADSL.
Je sais Barney, tu m'as montré.
Mais je considère toujours pas ça
comme un cadeau de Noël.
Vas-y et excuse-toi.
Elle est là.
Elle a du café chaud, peut-être
qu'elle te le jettera à la figure ?
- T'aimes ça, hein ?
- Je fais un scrapbook.
- Anna, salut.
- Voyez donc ça...
Monsieur le grand architecte.
Si tu viens pour faire fermer
le site internet, oublie ça.
- Quel site ?
- Ted-Mosby-est-un-con.com
T'as raison, je mérite bien ça.
C'est tout ce que je voulais dire.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je me fiche de qui est au courant.
Excusez-moi ?
Excusez-moi. Moi, Ted Mosby,
suis un vrai connard avec les filles.
Dites à vos sœurs, à vos filles,
de m'éviter à tout prix !
Ted-Mosby-est-un-con.com.
<i>Et ce petit site internet
reçut 400 000 clics.</i>
<i>Merci Barney !</i>
- C'est laquelle déjà ?
- C'est...
Souriez !
T'es très jolie,
t'as perdu du poids ?
On arrive à la numéro 1.
Je savais que c'était Holly,
c'était obligé.
J'espérais que ce serait pas Holly.
Barney, t'entends ça ?
On me vole mon camion !
C'est le pire truc
que tu as jamais fait.
C'est le pire truc que
quiconque a jamais fait.
À ma décharge, elle était...
plutôt ennuyante.
Elle va te tuer.
Mark, viens voir !
Barney, c'est mon fiancé, Mark.
C'est toi, le Barney qui l'a
abandonnée dans la forêt ?
Tu n'es pas fâchée après Barney ?
Tu ne veux pas d'excuse ?
Qu'il admette sa culpabilité ?
Ton camion ?
C'est du passé, tout ça.
Mark est mon présent et mon futur.
Holly a arrêté de chercher
des types comme toi
après que tu l'as abandonnée
dans les bois.
Donc, santé !
Alors, au dernier week-end du 4 juillet
passé à me faire bouffer
par les moustiques.
4 juillet...
On a commencé à se voir en juin.
On a gâché leur vie.
Le pire, c'est que tu ne t'es excusé
auprès d'aucune femme.
Le pire, c'est qu'on ignore toujours
qui est cette malade.
C'est parce que tu te débrouilles mal.
Pourquoi poursuivre
quelqu'un qui te suit ?
Tu n'as qu'à aller au bar,
draguer quelqu'un
et attendre qu'elle se montre.
C'est pas une mauvaise idée.
Je ferai la fille que tu dragues.
Je sais pas. C'est jouer beaucoup
sur une fille qui ricane quand elle ment.
Pas du tout.
Tu t'es déjà endormie
en mangeant des côtelettes ?
Je peux le faire.
Comment tu vas faire sinon ?
- Ça marche.
- OK.
Voilà comment on va faire.
Lily...
Elle te connaît,
donc reste près du juke-box
sans attirer l'attention.
Les mecs seront à table.
Faisant semblant d'avoir
une conversation normale.
Discuter...
On devrait discuter.
Voilà des mots.
Pourquoi c'est si dur ?
Rires !
Puis, j'entrerai.
Plus canon que jamais.
Tu es magnifique.
- Je sais que c'est nul...
- Chut, va-t'en.
Mais reviens plus tard.
Et Barney tentera une approche.
Salut, comment ça va ?
Bien, Barney.
Enfin, bien, étranger.
Tu es vraiment nulle, hein ?
- Retire ta main de ma cuisse.
- On doit avoir l'air de se draguer.
Je suis curieuse, que dis-tu aux filles
pour qu'elles aillent avec toi ?
D'habitude,
je leur chuchote ceci dans l'oreille.
T'es un peu excitée, là, non ?
Quelqu'un nous regarde,
va aux toilettes.
Je vais aller aux toilettes.
Quand je reviendrai, on ira
chez moi pour faire l'amour.
Regarde, une blonde
se dirige vers Robin. On y est.
Je sais pas quoi faire de mes mains,
je fais quoi normalement ?
J'ai fait une copie du tableau,
c'est laquelle ?
Je la reconnais pas.
Elle n'est pas dans le top 64.
Même pas dans le top.
Cendrillon sort de nulle part pour
tout rafler, ça réchauffe le cœur.
Ça va ?
Je la reconnais même pas.
Je me souviens pas de vous.
J'ai passé 2 jours
à tenter de me souvenir
de toutes les nanas avec qui j'ai couché
et des horreurs que je leur ai faites.
Et j'ai fait des horreurs.
Je crois que j'ai même vendu une femme.
Je ne parlais pas la langue,
mais j'ai serré la main du type,
il m'a filé les clés
d'une Mercedes et je l'ai laissée là.
Je tiens un scrapbook sur toutes
les nanas avec qui j'ai couché.
Je ne pensais pas être le genre à
oublier une fille avec qui il a couché.
Du plus profond de mon cœur,
je vous présente mes excuses
pour ce que je vous ai fait.
Je suis si fière de toi.
C'est pas elle.
- Quoi ?
- Désolée, c'est ma collègue, Sally.
On s'est retrouvées par hasard.
Je me suis excusé pour rien ?
C'était une super excuse et une façon
parfaite de terminer mon scrapbook.
Cette photo s'appellera :
"La rédemption de Barney".
Veux-tu cacher ce doigt.
<i>En fin de compte, Barney a découvert
qui était la mystérieuse fille.</i>
Mais on y reviendra plus tard.
Parfois, en cherchant une chose,
on découvre autre chose.
Même si je n'ai pas trouvé
la mystérieuse fille...
J'ai découvert quelque chose
de très important sur moi.
Reviens au lit.
Tu as un décollage de navette demaine.
Et cet astéroïde
qui se dirige vers Manhattan,
il va pas se détruire tout seul.
Je suis génial.
kids,back when we were younger,
your Uncle Marshall and I were really into college basketball.
Every year,March Madness would take over the entire apartment.
Hey.What's with the blackboard?
It's our NCAA bracket.
Big board equals big luck!
Hey, that looks familiar
Where did you get it?
Hello.
Uh,I'm looking for my wife,Ms.Aldrin.
There's no school today.It's Saturday.
Of course.How could I forget?
Dumb ass.
Big board!
Big luck!
We found it.No big deal.
Anyway,
every year,Ted and I go in together
on this big money pool out in Staten Island.
Yeah.The winner gets
$100,000 stuffed in a duffel bag.
And you get to keep the duffel bag.
Why do you guys put yourselves through this?
You lose every year.
That's because
in the past,we were just guessing.
This year,we watched every game,
read box scores,tracked injuries.
This isn't March Madness.
This is March Meticulously Thought-outness.
Your team lost 20 minutes ago.
I didn't know they were playing today.
You okay,Barney?
Something strange is going on.
I was down at the hardware store
trying to get a little somethin' somethin'.
Wait.You go to the hardware store
to pick up girls?
There are four kinds of women
who go to the hardware store by themselves.
Of course there are.
Single,recently single,recently divorced,
lesbian who will let me watch.
You could not be more evil.
Sorry.Five.
Recently widowed.
So,I'm talking to this girl...
Look,I'm sure he's in a better place.
Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.
I was only gone for a second when...
See?Skid-proof.
The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday.
Pet store?
Single girl,mid-twenties,
looking for a canine replacement
for the boyfriend who just dumped her.
Instead,finds Barney.
God bless you,Ted.
You're reading my blog.
I'm really bored at work.
I'd call your ex a dog,
but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here.
Oh,I want to take her home right now.
Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first.
And when I got back...
I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her
But diamond in the rough
Could your heart just melt?
Jerk!
Weird,right?
Yeah.The same thing happened last week at the museum.
Ooh,ooh,ooh!Lily.
You pretend to be a struggling young artist
who needs a new muse.
No.
-Marshall. -You're a millionaire art thief
casing the joint for a thrill
money can no longer give you!
Oh.No.
Robin.
You're going blind,
and you're trying to soak up all the beauty
in the world before the darkness descends.
Bingo!
So,I was talking to this girl.
At this point,about 83%.
Soon,these audio guides will be all that I have left.
I'm so sorry.
My God,you are beautiful.
How about I get you a headset
so you can see with your ears like I do?
I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds,
but when I came back...
Hmm.You know,I also love the smell of great art.
Why does this keep happening?
Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are.
Oh,really?
Then why am I not in prison for perjury?
But I don't want to talk about work.
Something weird is going on here.
But the next night got even weirder.
Alan Alda.
It was Alan Alda.
You never gonna believe what just happened.
Who was that,um,guy from Mash?
The main guy.What...?
Hawkeye from Mash.
How can I be blanking on this?
Alan Alda?
No.
Hey,a word of advice?
That guy you were talking to,Barney Stinson--
I know he seems charming,
but he's just saying whatever it takes
to get in your pants.
Sleeping with Barney was the biggest mistake of my life.
Oh,my God.Where is she?
She must have left.She...
Well,she-she said I hooked up with her?
What was her name?What did she look like?
She didn't say her name,but she had blonde hair,boobs.
Kind of trashy.
Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?
-Yes! -That's all of them.
Okay.Stay calm.
Let's think this through.
One of the girls
who I lied to,seduced and abandoned
is trying to ruin my life.
Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is.
Oh,dear God!

Some woman that I slept with and screwed over
is trying to ruin my life.
God,why is this happening to me?
It's karma.
Nah,it's not Karma.
She's stripping in Vegas.
Plus,we're good.
Look,if you want to figure out who it is,
why don't you just start by checking your list?
My list?
Dude,do not pretend you're not the kind of guy
who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with.
I have one.
It's called my marriage license.
Come on,let's see the list.
Ted,don't be crass.
I would never demean the women
that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.
This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with.
I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th.
Ask for Heloise.Tell her I sent you.
What do you think,Lil?
You recognize the saboteur?
I don't know,Barney.
I only saw her face.
How many of these girls know they're being photographed?
All of them,but only about half buy a copy on the way out.
Oh,Barney,you're never gonna figure out
which one of these is the mystery woman.
All of these women have a right to hate you.
Oh,Lily,come on,lighten up.
I mean,any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney
and do this or that,
or this <i>and</i> that,
or do this with those <i>in</i> that...
I mean,she should have known what she was getting into.
Absolutely.
And what I do with these women
should be between me and them.
And you guys.
And Heloise.
She helped me do the decoupage.
I don't know,Barney.
I don't recognize any of these women.
I mean,some minor celebrities,one government official,
and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot.
This is impossible.
There's too many girls.
How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?
The top 64 women I've slept with,
split into four regions.
This tournament
will systematically narrow down
which girl has the most cause to hate my guts.
Last girl standing has to be the saboteur.
Absolutely not,Barney.
We are not going to make a game out of the women
you've tricked into sleeping with you.
No way!
The girl who thought he had 12 hours to live
has way more cause to ruin his life
than the girl he fake proposed to.
It's fake proposal girl.
I mean,she hired a wedding planner!
It's 12 hours to live!That girl flew them both to Paris!
Oh,she only bought him a one-way ticket!
Okay,okay,everybody!Hands.
12 hours to live!
Damn it!
Okay,toss up.
"Thought I was Jorge Posada,"
or "You have my dead wife's kidney?"
-Kidney!  -Jorge Posada!
She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!
-That's true...  -It's "Dead wife's kidney."
How are we even discussing this?
-Fake baby!  -Lost at sea!
-Fake baby!  -Lost at sea!
I was there.
Trust me.
It's fake baby.
Down to the sweet 16.
And coming out of the Upper West Side,we have the number
three seed,"Girl who thought I owned Google,"
up against the number seven seed,
"Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor."
You got to go scuba instructor.
You're kidding me!
She got the bends!
Yeah,she did.
Evil twin!
Prince of Norway!
How could it not be Prince of Norway?!
Barney,you're the tiebreaker.
I'm going with Evil Twin.
You're kidding me!
Sorry,but I did sleep with that girl twice.
As Barney <i>and</i> Larney.
Okay,we're down to the Final Four.
What do you think,people?
Come on,dig deep.
Oh!I can't decide.
It could be any one of them.
Is that the blackboard from my classroom?
Come on!Marshall?
I'm tired and sad.
Mosby?
I want to call my mom,
just tell her I love her.
Okay.
Then this is as far as we get.
The Final Four.
It's got to be Meg,Anna,
Kate or Holly.
We are gonna track these girls down,
and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar.
You guys stole my blackboard!
Okay,there's her building.
When she comes out,I'm gonna hide,
and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar,
-we run like hell. -No.
What do you mean,no?
That woman,like every woman in your Final Four,
deserves an apology,
and I'm not telling you if she's the one
until hear you say,"I'm sorry."
Are you nuts?That would involve me speaking to a woman
I've already had sex with,which,frankly,
is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car.
Barney,you're doing this.
Lily,this girl hates me.
I hooked up with her in an apartment
I was pretending was my own,
told her I loved her,and then ditched her there.
She got arrested for trespassing,
bit a cop,and spent eight days in jail.
Oh,crap,there she is!
If she sees me,she's gonna kill me!
Okay,here's what we're gonna do.Hey,Meg!
Over here!
Look who it is!
Yo old friend Barney!
Barney?
If she kills me,I want you to go into my apartment,
grab the metal briefcase under my bed
and throw it in the East River.
What are you doing here?
Look,Meg,we need to talk.
It was all my fault.
I know it was,baby.
I just came on too strong.
And I forgive you.
I love you.
Oh,my God!
I love you,too!
No!
What's the matter with you?
Get off of him!
Look,she's not the one,
but you still owe her an apol...
-So you remember who this one is,right? -Yes.
You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.
Right,and if you recall,
her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line,so I...
Yeah,I know,Barney,you showed me.
And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present.
So go over there and apologize.
Ah,there she is.
Ooh and she's holding hot coffee.
Maybe she'll throw it in your face.
You're really enjoying this,aren't you?
I'm making a scrapbook.
Anna,hi.
Look who it is,Mr.Big Shot Architect.
If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site,forget it.
What Web site?
Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.
You're right,I do deserve that.
That's all I came here to say.
You know what?
I don't care who knows about it.
Excuse me.Excuse me.
I,Ted Mosby,
am a jerk to women.
Tell your sisters.Tell your daughters
to stay away!
Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.
And that little Web site went on to get 400,000 hits.
Thanks,Barney.
Okay,which one is this again?She's...
Larney!
Die!
Is it her?
-Die!-Smile.
You look good.
Have you lost weight?
We're down to the number one seed.
I knew it was Holly.
It had to be Holly.
Man,I was hoping it wasn't Holly.
Barney,did you hear that?
Somebody's stealing my truck.
Barney?
Barney!
That is the worst thing you've ever done.
That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.
But in my defense,
she was kind of annoying.
She's gonna kill you.
-Barney. -Holly.
Mark,come over here.
Barney,this is my fiance. Mark.
Barney?
You're the Barney who ditched her in the woods?
So you're not mad at Barney?
Don't you want an apology?
An admission of guilt?
Your truck back?
No,whatever happened was in the past.
Mark is my present and my future.
And if you ditching Holly in the woods
made her stop running around with guys like you,
then cheers.
Well then,
to the last Fourth of July weekend
I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.
Fourth of July?
We started dating in June.
We ruined their lives.
And the worst part of it
is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.
No,the worst part is that
we still have no idea who my stalker is.
Well,that's because you're going about this all wrong.
I mean,why chase someone who's following you?
All you need to do
is go down to the bar,hit on someone,
and wait until she turns up.
That's not a bad idea.
I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on.
I don't know.That's a lot riding on a girl
who giggles when she lies.
I do not.
Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?
No.
Look,I can do this,okay?
I mean,how else are you going to find out who this girl is.
I'm in.
Okay,here's how it's gonna work.
Now,Lily,
she knows what you look like,
so just hang out at the jukebox,
and don't draw any attention to yourself.
And the guys will be in the booth,
just pretending to have a normal conversation.
Talking,we should be talking.Words.
Here are words.
Why is this so hard?
Laughter!
And then I'll come in,
looking hot as all hell.
Wow,you are gorgeous.
Oh,God,I know that's awful.
-I just,uh.... -Shh,go away.
But come back later.
 <i>And then Barney</i>  <i>will make his move.</i>
Hey,there,how are you doing?
Fine,Barney.
I mean,um,
fine,stranger.
Wow,you really are awful at this,aren't you?
Get your hand
off my thigh,Barney.
It's supposed to look like
we're about to hook up,Robin.
You know I'm curious.
What do you say to these girls
to get them to come home with you?
Usually I just
lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear.
You're a little turned on right now,aren't you?
No.
Oh.Look,somebody's watching us.
Make your move to the bathroom.
Uh,I'm going to go to the bathroom now,
but,uh,when I come back we'll go to my place and have sex.
Dude,dude,dude,look.
Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now.We are go.
I don't know what to do with my hands.
What do I normally do with my hands?
Barney.
I brought a copy of the bracket.
Which one is she?
I don't recognize her.
She's not on the Top 64.
Not even on bracket.
Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing.
That'll warm your heart.
Are you okay?
I don't even recognize her.
I don't remember you.
I've spent the last two days trying to remember
every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things
that I have done to them.
And I have done some horrible things.
I mean,at one point,I'm pretty sure I sold a woman.
I didn't speak the language,
but I shook a guy's hand,
he gave me the keys to a Mercedes,and I left her there.
I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook
of all of the women I have slept with,
but I never thought I was the guy
who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her.
So from the bottom of my heart,
for whatever I did to you,
I apologize.
Oh,Barney!
Oh,I'm so proud of you.
That's not her.
-I'm so sorry.-What?What?
Barney,I'm sorry,that's my friend Sally from work.
We just ran into each other.
So I apologized for nothing?
Yes,but it was a great apology.
And a perfect way to end my scrapbook.
I'm going to call this photo "Barney's Redemption."
Could you stop giving me the finger?
* That one shining moment
* You reached for the sky
* One shining moment you knew
* One shining moment
* You were willing to try
* One shining moment
<i>Eventually,</i>  <i>Barney did figure out</i>
<i>who the mysterious girl was. But we on that later</i>
Barney,come back to bed.
You have a shuttle launch tomorrow.
And that asteroid that's headed for Manhattan,
It's not gonna destroy itself.
<i>Le printemps 2008
fut une super période pour moi.</i>
<i>J'ai commencé à sortir avec Stella,</i>
<i>et j'ai été augmenté au boulot.</i>
<i>J'ai donc décidé d'acheter une chose
que tous mes amis envieraient.</i>
Une nouvelle voiture !
On est à New York,
tu la conduiras jamais.
C'est un achat vraiment stupide
et désolé, mais aucun de nous
ne peut le soutenir.
- La place avant est à moi, à jamais.
- Tu peux pas dire ça.
- Et pourtant.
- Tu peux pas décréter les choses !
Je décrète que je peux décréter !
Bière.
Ça va ?
Que s'est-il passé ?
On m'a toujours dit que travailler dans
un groupe c'est comme faire la guerre.
<i>Sortir de l'école de droit, c'est comme
sortir du camp de préparation.</i>
<i>Le 1er jour de taf, on prend d'assaut
les plages, plein d'entrain.</i>
- Mec, on est avocats.
- Clair !
- On a des serviettes !
- Des foutues serviettes !
- T'as un truc dedans ?
- Rien du tout et toi ?
Des barres chocolatées.
<i>Puis, on se retrouve dans les tranchées
aux côtés de ses potes.</i>
<i>Et on ressent un sens de la camaraderie,
mais ensuite vient...</i>
<i>- la pluie d'obus.</i>
- Bonjour, Arthur.
Arthur Hobbes est
un des partenaires seniors de ma boîte.
C'est mon chef.
Il a l'air d'un mec sympa.
Mais il a un surnom.
Arthur Artillerie.
Et cette matinée ?
Bien, et la vôtre ?
Pas si mal.
Ferguson est là ?
Oui, juste à côté, dans son bureau.
- Super. Bonne journée, l'ami.
- Vous aussi.
<i>On ne sait jamais qui sera touché...</i>
J'ai lu votre compte rendu,
c'est de la merde !
En fait, c'est une insulte à la merde.
Si la merde pouvait manger
puis déféquer, ce serait ça !
Votre compte rendu est
la merde de la merde !
Si vous durez 2 jours de plus ici,
je serais choqué !
C'était violent,
le pire est arrivé peu après.
T'as entendu ?
Désolé.
T'imagines ? Il a fait ça
le jour des enfants au boulot.
Ça nous ramène à aujourd'hui.
Voilà le contexte.
je bosse sur ce rapport appelé :
"L'utilité de la jurisprudence 23-B-3
de recours collectif
"pour contester
un ordre de certification
"sur la base d'absence
de biens communs..."
On est perdus.
Tu peux l'appeler : "Le rapport ninja" ?
OK, peu importe.
J'étais censé
rendre le rapport ninja hier.
Mais j'ai été vraiment occupé,
pas moyen de le finir.
Et ce matin...
Bonjour, Ferguson.
Bonne journée ?
- Je dois y aller.
- Super. Et vous ?
Génial. Marshall est là ?
<i>Dieu merci !</i>
- Ouais, il est là.
- Super.
Bonne journée, l'ami.
Et alors...
Il m'a crié dessus.
Bébé, je suis navrée.
C'est tout ?
T'es énervé parce qu'un type a parlé
trop fort de trop près ?
On m'a jamais engueulé comme ça.
Allez, ta dernière engueulade au boulot
date de quand ?
On m'a crié dessus 3 fois aujourd'hui.
Dont une fois en coréen.
C'est la société américaine, Marshall.
L'engueulade permet de motiver.
Comme la prime de Noël
ou le harcèlement sexuel.
C'est le business.
Bébé, c'est vraiment injuste.
Tu travailles si dur.
Tard le soir, les week-ends,
je te vois jamais.
On a à peine fait l'amour
ces derniers temps.
C'est pas bien,
maman a besoin d'une douceur.
Écoute, il t'a crié dessus,
tu as encaissé.
Il te respecte sûrement plus,
maintenant.
À ce sujet...
Donc, Arthur est occupé
à me crier dessus,
<i>son visage vire au rouge,</i>
<i>les veines de son front
sont prêtes à éclater,</i>
<i>il postillonne des obus.</i>
<i>Tous les collègues passent pour lorgner.</i>
<i>Soudainement, j'ai tout pigé.</i>
- Tout quoi ?
- Tout.
Le fait que je suis devenu avocat
pour sauver l'environnement
et que là, je bosse pour les méchants.
Le fait d'être coincé à cause
d'un crédit trop important
pour un appart penché.
Le fait que je suis adulte
et que personne,
pas même Arthur Artillerie,
n'a le droit de me parler comme ça !
<i>J'ai supplié mon corps
de ne pas le faire...</i>
<i>mais ça n'a servi à rien.</i>
T'étais pas là, mais j'ai la place
avant dans la voiture de Ted, à jamais.

How I met your mother
- Saison 3 - Épisode 15 -
Comment t'as pu pleurer
devant ton chef ?
Je sais pas.
Qu'on me crie dessus comme ça,
c'était comme avoir été grondé
par mon père,
d'un coup, j'étais un petit garçon.
Je dirais pas "garçon".
Je me suis senti impuissant,
flasque.
Mince, je me suis senti castré.
Mon Dieu, qu'est-ce que tu m'excites.
Le pire, c'est que je dois lui remettre
le rapport ninja demain matin.
C'est cool, les ninjas.
Comment je peux lui faire face
à nouveau ?
Voilà ce que je ferais.
- Ce rapport ninja est fini, Marshall ?
- Je l'ai avec moi.
Là.
Je pense que ça va vous éclater.
Je vous en prie, j'ai une famille.
Alors, on en reste là ?
Parfait.
Alors que faites-vous
encore dans mon bureau ?
La violence par les armes
est peut-être une réponse AU Canada.
Mais ici aux USA, on résout
nos problèmes avec des mots.
Tu vas là-bas, les yeux dans les yeux,
tu lui balances un discours clair
défendant la dignité humaine,
comme l'a fait Abraham Lincoln.
Ouais, c'est tellement facile
d'improviser un discours éloquent.
Observe.
- Que voulez-vous, Marshall ?
- La Justice, Monsieur !
Nous sommes tous nés avec
des droits inaliénables,
dont le plus profondément élevé
est le droit...
Non, on peut pas être profondément
élevé. L'un signifie bas, l'autre haut.
Vous vous débrouillez comme un chef.
Les Hommes ont des droits,
et ces droits sont...
Je suis captivé, continue.
Certaines justices
ne peuvent ni ne seront inaliénables
telles que...
pour le futur !
Super atterrissage !
Bravo !
La sécurité va vous brutaliser
en sortant.
Les mecs, vous m'aidez pas là.
Je peux pas me confronter à Arthur,
j'ai besoin de ce job pour l'argent.
Ce serait pas génial d'y aller demain,
l'envoyer balader et démissionner ?
C'est sympa d'en rêver, mais
personne ne le fait réellement.
Gary Blauman l'a fait.
Un gars avec qui je bossais.
C'est devenu une légende.
Réunion du matin, ce vieux Blauman
se faisait mettre en pièces.
<i>Rien d'anormal à la réunion du matin.</i>
<i>Mais ce jour-là,
quelque chose d'incroyable arriva.</i>
Tu t'es humilié, tu nous as humiliés
et honnêtement, tu as humilié
nos amis coréens du Nord !
- Et encore, Blauman, si tu crois...
- Tu sais quoi, Bilson ?
Parle à mon cul !
Oh la la.
- Quoi ?
- Ouais, j'ai plus à te supporter.
Le site de mon cousin a été introduit
en bourse et j'ai gagné plein d'argent.
Tu veux savoir ce que je pense
de cette boîte ?
- Mon dieu.
- Il a pissé sur la table ?
Allez...
Les gars, vous pourriez détourner
le regard le temps que ça vienne ?
Ça aide ?
Au final, il a abandonné
et il est parti.
Le site de son cousin
a fait faillite,
il a fait concierge
dans une maison de retraite
et a pris un studio
au dessus d'un bowling.
C'est ça, la fin de l'histoire ?
Non, bien sûr.
Il est mort.
En quoi ça m'aide tout ça ?
Est-ce que quelqu'un peut me donner
un conseil utile, bordel ?
Lily, contrôle ta nana.
La leçon de Blauman, c'est :
quand ton boss te crie dessus,
tu ne réponds pas.
C'est ce que, dans le monde
de l'entreprise, j'aime appeler
la chaîne du cri.
- Du cri ?
- Oui !
La chaîne du cri
commence tout en haut.
Le boss de la boss d'Arthur crie
sur la boss d'Arthur.
La boss d'Arthur crie sur Arthur.
Arthur te crie dessus.
Tu rentres et tu cries sur Lily.
Lily crie sur l'un des enfants
de sa classe.
Enfin, cette enfant crie sur son papa :
le boss de la boss d'Arthur.
Et tout recommence,
complétant ainsi le cercle du cri.
- Je croyais que c'était une chaîne.
- Un cercle.
J'ai dit un cercle.
- Je crie pas sur Lily.
- Et je crie pas sur mes élèves,
dont aucun n'a de parent travaillant
dans l'entreprise de Marshall.
- Donc, c'est pas un cercle.
- D'accord !
Tu veux une chaîne du cri,
c'est une chaîne du cri.
J'ai pensé au cercle, car j'ai trouvé
que c'était une métaphore élégante.
Mais vas-y, casse tout.
Vous êtes toujours mauvais esprit
quand j'explique quelque chose.
Vous me saoulez !
Je suis entouré d'idiots !
Idiots !
Voyez, on se sent
pas mieux maintenant ?
Lily, j'ai besoin de ton avis,
qu'est-ce que je fais ?
- Ce que j'enseigne à mes élèves...
- Mon Dieu.
quand ils ont affaire à un agresseur,
le plus important est d'être
constructif et positif.
- Salut, Arthur.
- Salut, Marshall.
J'ai le rapport ninja.
Mais Arthur, si vous voulez que
quelqu'un se donne à fond dans le futur,
essayez de les motiver, non pas
avec la peur et l'intimidation,
mais plutôt avec encouragement,
inspiration et respect.
Bien dit Marshall,
j'avais besoin d'entendre ça.
Au fait, j'ai vu la photo de
votre femme dans votre bureau...
- ... c'est un joli petit lot.
- Et comment.
Vous savez ce que je vais faire
en rentrant ?
- Je vais lui arracher ses vêtements...
- C'est ça.
- ...la jeter sur le lit...
- Là où elle doit être !
... et lui en faire voir
de toutes les couleurs !
C'est grave.
Maman est vraiment en manque.
T'as raison bébé,
c'est une question de respect.
C'est la première chose utile
qu'on m'a dite ce soir.
Tu peux répéter ?
- Je vais lui en faire voir de toutes...
- Non, l'autre partie
J'ai le rapport ninja.
<i>Et ça a semblé être la fin de
l'histoire.</i>
<i>Mais non, car le soir suivant...</i>
Laquelle de ces moquettes ferait
mieux dans l'appartement ?
J'aime la couleur de celle-ci,
mais celle-là est si douce,
ce serait génial sous des pieds nus.
Ou un dos nu...
Des perles de sueur torrides
dégoulinant d'un torse tremblant.
Lily, on a déjà vécu ça avec
le carrelage de salle de bain.
Dis pas mon nom, Lily
doit pas savoir que c'est moi,
fais comme si c'était Stella,
dis-moi des mamours.
Ma jolie... comment ça va ?
Pas bien, pas bien du tout.
T'es où ?
Juste en bas, rejoins-moi.
Sans Lily !
OK, j'arrive.
- Je t'aime.
- Je t'aime aussi.
Vous en êtes déjà
aux grandes déclarations.
Apparemment.
Tu la baises ?
Je suis dans la merde, Ted.
Ted, je pète les plombs.
C'est une voiture neuve,
fais attention.
J'ai fait un truc stupide,
on peut rouler ?
Je dois bouger,
Roule, je t'en prie, roule.
- C'est une super place.
- Mec !
Dis-moi ce qui s'est passé.
Tu te souviens,
j'allais faire le speech de Lily,
ferme mais respectueux.
Ça s'est pas passé comme ça.
Y a beaucoup de Ketchup
sur ce burger.
Pardon. Que s'est-il passé ?
Après notre discussion hier,
je suis allé au Diner
finir le rapport Ninja.
Depuis quand t'es là ?
Si tu suis
les inepties de maternelle de Lily,
tu vas te faire déchiqueter.
Je suis là pour te sauver.
T'as faim ?
- Oui, j'allais commander.
- Tu veux quoi ?
Sandwich au bacon et frites.
Alors, les amis,
que voulez-vous ?
Un thé vert avec du citron pour moi,
pour un ami, le pain de viande.
Très bien.
Je voulais pas de pain de viande.
La chaîne du cri est réelle.
Arthur te crie dessus,
tu dois crier sur quelqu'un d'autre.
Non.
Si.
Sinon, cette colère va te bouffer.
Sur qui je crierais de toute façon ?
Je sais pas.
Sur quelqu'un qui t'aurait déçu ?
Qui t'aurait laissé tomber.
Qui t'amènerait du pain de viande
alors que tu as clairement commandé
un sandwich et des frites.
J'allais au bar, vous faites quoi ?
Je racontais une histoire.
J'aime bien les histoires.
T'en veux ?
Quoi ?
Le cornet est assez grand ?
La glace est assez bonne.
Je dis à Barney :
Je vais pas crier sur le serveur.
Oh que si.
Ce serveur est tous les patrons
et toutes les brutes
qui t'ont jamais fait honte ou bousculé.
Comment ose-t-il te refuser
la seule chose que tu veux,
qui te rendrait heureux,
un sandwich au bacon avec des frites.
Thé vert avec citron,
Pain de viande.
Bon appétit, mes amis.
Excusez-moi !
Oui ?
C'est pas ce que j'ai commandé.
Si.
Je vous prie de m'excuser,
mais j'ai commandé
un sandwich au bacon avec des frites.
Le client a toujours raison.
Non, je ne vais pas supporter ça
sans broncher.
Je termine un triple service,
soit 18 heures !
Et je dois prendre 2 trains
et un bus pour Astoria
pour que ma femme me crie dessus,
car je suis jamais à la maison.
Mange ton pain de viande !
Qu'est-ce que vous faites là ?
Super, je peux ?
C'est contre les règles de la voiture.
Détends-toi, c'est cubain.
Les gens paient pour que ça sente ça.
C'est même pas vrai.
Échange ta place,
j'ai la place avant pour l'éternité.
Tu peux pas décréter ça.
- Pourtant, je l'ai fait.
- C'est au cas par cas.
Je raconte un bouleversement
dans ma vie, là !
Un tel pourboire, vraiment ?
Pour ce serveur ?
- Il a fait un triple service...
- J'y crois pas. Tu sais quoi ?
Si tu cries pas sur le serveur,
- crie-moi dessus.
- Quoi ?
Vas-y !
Je vais pas te crier dessus.
Quoi ? Tu crois que tu vas m'énerver ?
Je t'en prie.
Balance.
D'accord, tu veux
que je te crie dessus ?
Je te crie dessus, Barney.
Désolé, tu as été couvert
par le son d'un papillon
se posant sur une feuille
à trois pâtés de maisons.
Je te crie dessus, Barney.
Le volume est là, du contenu maintenant.
Que ce soit blessant.
Les costumes
te vont pas si bien que ça !
Non, un truc vrai, allez !
Ce type t'a fait pleurer.
Fais-moi pleurer.
Ta mère est une traînée.
C'est une traînée, et désolé,
mais ton frère et toi
êtes de père différent.
Tu sais pourquoi ? Sûrement
parce que ta mère est une sale traînée.
Je me fous de ce que tu dis,
Bob Barker n'est pas ton père.
Ça, c'est pas sympa.
- Mon Dieu, je suis désolé.
- Je plaisante, continue.
C'est pas ton père.
T'as concocté cette idée délirante
qu'un présentateur
est ton vrai père, mais non !
T'as été abandonné
et t'as jamais dépassé ça.
Tu t'autorises jamais
à ressentir quoi que ce soit.
Voilà comment tu survis dans ce monde.
Tu avances tête baissée
et je vais devenir comme toi.
Et je ne veux pas de ça !
Je ne veux rien de tout ça !
J'ai pas fait avocat pour ça !
C'est pas ce que je veux pour moi.
Je démissionne, Arthur, je démissionne.
Merci, Eriksen,
il fallait que j'entende ça.
Vraiment ?
C'était pas une attaque personnelle.
Non, je parle de la démission.
On a pas d'indemnités à payer comme ça.
La sécurité va vous brutaliser
vers la sortie.
T'as fait tomber de la glace.
- Mec !
- Désolé.
C'est pas de ma faute.
Tu devais crier sur quelqu'un
en dessous de toi.
Le cercle du cri...
La chaîne du cri...
Pyramide !
La pyramide du cri !
La pyramide du cri.
Comment je vais le dire à Lily ?
Elle m'a soutenu pendant mes études,
je suis censé lui rendre la pareille.
On va perdre l'appartement.
Là où on devait élever nos enfants.
Comment je vais dire à celle
que j'aime le plus au monde
que je viens de balancer notre futur.
Tout le monde dehors !
Sortez de la voiture !
- Dehors !
- Crier n'a jamais rien résolu.
<i>Marshall dut dire à Lily
ce qui était arrivé.</i>
Je suis navré.
J'ai perdu la tête.
Mais je vais arranger ça.
Demain, je vais aller là-bas,
me mettre à genou
et supplier qu'on me rende mon boulot.
Non.
Quoi ?
Notre avenir,
c'est pas l'argent ou un appart.
Et c'est surtout pas toi, malheureux
de faire un horrible boulot.
Je suis contente de retrouver mon mari.
On verra pour le reste.
Je t'aime.
Je t'aime aussi.
<i>Finalement, ils ont pu joindre
les deux bouts, sans perdre l'appart.</i>
T'es sûr ?
Qui a besoin d'une voiture
à New York ?
- Je peux pas accepter...
- M'oblige pas à crier.
Merci beaucoup, mon pote.
Vous l'avez fait dans la voiture, hein ?
Kids,the spring of 2008 was a pretty great time for me
Stella and I had started dating,
And I'd just gotten a big raise at work,
So I decided to purchase something I knew
Would be the envy of all my friends.
A new car!
Ted, this is new york city-- you're never gonna drive it.
This is a really, really stupid purchase,
And I'm sorry, but none of us can support it.
Shotgun for eternity!
You can't call shotgun for eternity.
I just called it.
You can't just call things, barney.
I call that I can call things!
hey, baby.
Beer.
Are you okay?
Beer.
Okay, what happened?
They always told me that working at a big law firm
Was like being at war.
You get out of law school,
It's like getting out of boot camp.
That first day at work, you're storming the beaches,
Full of piss and vinegar...
Dude, we're lawyers now.
Totally.
We've got briefcases and everything.
Freakin' briefcases.
You have anything in yours?
Totally empty. you?
Candy bars.
Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies
And you feel a sense of camaraderie.
But before too long...
Hey, marshall.
...the shells start to fall.
Hello, arthur.
Arthur hobbes is one of the senior partners
At my firm, and he's... he's my boss.
He seems like a nice guy,
But he's got a nickname...
Artillery arthur.
How's your morning going?
It's going fine-- how is yours?
Not too bad, not too bad.
Hey, is ferguson in yet?
He is, he's in... just in his office next door.
That's great-- have a good one, buddy.
You, too.
You never know who's gonna get hit...
Hey, ferguson!
I read your report, and it's complete crap!
No, you know what? that's an insult to crap.
If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that!
Your report is the crap that crap craps!
If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked!
Shocked!
It was brutal,
But the worst was a few minutes later.
Did you hear that?
Yeah, sorry.
Can you believe he did that
On take your daughter to work day?
So that brings us to today.
Oh, no.
A little background.
So I'm working on this report
Called "using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent
"to contest a class certification order
Based on a lack of commonality, numerosity..."
Dude, you lost us.
Can't you just call it something cool
Like "the ninja report"?
Okay. yeah, fine, whatever.
Um, so I'm supposed
To turn in "the ninja report" yesterday.
-Awesome. -wow. cool.
But I got insanely busy with other stuff,
I didn't get a chance to finish it,
And then this morning...
-Hey, ferguson. -hey, arthur.
How's your day going?
-I gotta go. -great. how is yours?
Great, great-- hey, is marshall in yet?
Oh, thank god.
Yeah, he's right in there.
Fantastic. have a good one, buddy.
And then...
He screamed at me.
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.
What, that's it?
You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?
Barney, I have never been screamed at
Like that in my life.
Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?
I got screamed at three times today.
Once in korean.
This is corporate america, marshall.
Screaming is a motivational tool,
Like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment.
It's just good business.
Oh, baby, it's just not fair.
You've been working so hard.
Late nights, weekends.
I never see you.
We've barely made love in weeks.
It's bad, guys,mama needs her sugar.
Look, marshall, he screamed at you, you took it.
He probably respects you more for it.
Yeah, about that...
So arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment...
Face turning red,
Vein in his forehead about to burst,
Spittle flying like shrapnel.
Everyone you work with walking by your office,
Peering in.
And suddenly, I just felt all of it.
All of what?
All of it.
The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment,
And now I'm working for the bad guys instead.
The fact that I am stuck in this job
Because of a mortgage I can barely afford
On an apartment that is crooked.
The fact that I am a grown man,
and nobody, not even artillery arthur,
Has the right to talk to me like that!
I begged my body not to do it.
But it was no use.
I just... I just...
Just because you weren't around for this,
I called shotgun for all eternity in ted's car.


dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.
I don't know what happened.
There's just something about being yelled at like that,
Like I was being scolded by my dad.
Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.
Is "boy" the right word?
I felt absolutely powerless.
Flaccid-- hell, i... I felt castrated.
God, you're hot right now.
And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk
Into arthur's office and give him the ninja report.
Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.
How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?
Here's what I would do if I were you.
Hi, arthur.
Hello, marshall.
Have you finally finished the ninja report?
Yeah, I got it.
Right here.
I think it's gonna blow you away.
Please, I have a family.
So we good?
We're so good.
Then why are you still in my office?
Okay, gun violence might be the answer to everything
Up in canada, robin,
But here in america, we solve our problems with words.
Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy
With a big eloquent speech defending human dignity.
Like abraham lincoln.
Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big,
Eloquent speech off the top of your head.
Observe.
Arthur?
What do you want, marshall?
Justice, sir.
You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights,
The most fundamentally paramount of which
Is the right...
Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount.
One means highest, one means lowest.
You are nailing this.
Human beings have rights,
And those rights are, um...
You got me hooked, reel me in.
There are certain justices
That cannot or will not
Be inalienable... as such...
For the future.
Stuck the landing-- bravo!
Thank you.
Security's gonna rough you up a bit on t way out.
Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay?
I can't have some big confrontation with arthur.
I need this job, i... I need the money.
Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow,
Tell him off and then quit?
It's great to fantasize about,
But nobody ever actually does it.
Gary blauman did it.
Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now.
We were at the morning meeting
and old blauman was getting reamed out but good.
Pretty much routine
At the morning meeting, but then,
On this particular day, something amazing happened.
You made yourself look bad,
You made this company look bad, and quite frankly,
You made our friends, the north koreans, look bad!
And I'll tell you something else,
Blauman, if you think for one moment...
You know what, bilson?
You can kiss my ass.
Oh, snap.
-What? -you heard me.
I don't need to take your crap anymore.
My cousin's website went public today,
And I made a pile of money on the ipo,
so you know what I think Of this whole damn company?
Oh, my god.
He peed on the conference table?
Come on, come on, come on,
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second
Till I get started?
Come on.
Come on.
Does this help?
W ur eventually, he just gave up and left.
And then his cousin's website tanked.
And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home
And moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.
That's it? that's the end of the story?
No, no, of course not-- he died.
How does that help me?
How does any of this help me?
Can somebody, for god's sakes,
Please give me one piece of useful advice?
Lily, control your woman.
The lesson of blauman is that when your boss
Screams at you, you never scream back.
That's why there's a little thing in corporate america
I like to call the chain of screaming.
-Chain of screaming? -yes.
The chain of screaming starts at the top.
Arthur's boss's boss screams at arthur's boss.
Arthur's boss screams at arthur.
Arthur screams at you.
You go home and scream at lily.
Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class.
Then that kid screams at her dad,
Arthur's boss's boss.
And the whole thing starts all over again,
Thus completing the circle of screaming.
I thought it was a chain of screaming.
It's a circle, ted, I called it a circle.
I don't scream at lily.
And I don't scream at my kids,
None of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.
So it's not a circle.
Fine-- you want it to be a chain of screaming,
It's a chain of screaming.
I came up with the circle idea halfway through,
Cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor,
But fine, ruin it!
You guys always undermine me
When I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it!
God, I'm surrounded by idiots!
Idiots!
See, doesn't everyone feel better now?
Lily, I need your take on this.
What... what should I do?
Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...
Oh, god.
Kt.is, when dealing with a bully, the most important thing
Is to be constructive and positive.
Hello, arthur.
Hello, marshall.
I have the ninja report right here.
But arthur,
In the future, if you want someone to do their best work,
Try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation,
But through encouragement, inspiration and respect.
Well said, marshall-- I needed to hear that.
By the way,
I saw your wife's picture in your office.
That is one tasty slice.
Oh, you're damn right.
You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...
That's it.
...just throw her on the bed...
That's where she belongs.
...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!
It's bad, guys.
Mama needs it bad.
You're right, baby, it's about respect.
That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight.
Can you give me that speech again?
I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...
No, the other part, please.
I have the ninja report right here, but...
And it seemed like that was the end of it,
But it wasn't, because the next night...
Which of these carpets would look better
In the new apartment?
I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft.
It would feel great on your bare feet...
...or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat
Rolling down
Your trembling bosom.
Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?
Shh, don't say my name.
Lily can't know it's me.
Just pretend you're talking to stella.
Be all lovey dovey.
Hey, stella.
Sweetie, how's it going?
Not good, not good at all.
Where are you right now?
Right downstairs, come find me.
Without lily.
Okay, I'll see you soon.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Wow, you two are already saying the "l" word, huh?
Apparently.
You hitting that?
I'm in trouble, ted.
Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.
Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...
I did something stupid-- can we just drive somewhere?
I need to get away-- just drive, man.
Please just drive.
It's just, this is a really good parking spot.
Dude!
Look, just tell me what happened first.
Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech
That lily told me to give, be firm but respectful?
Well, it didn't totally go that way.
There is a lot of ketchup on that burger.
Sorry-- what happened?
After we all finished talking last night,
I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.
Hey, marshall.
How long have you been sitting there?
If you go in there with lily's kindergarten nonsense,
You're gonna get torn apart.
I'm here to save your life-- you hungry?
Yeah, I was just about to order.
What do you want?
A blt and gravy fries.
Okay, friends, what do you like?
A green tea with lemon for me,
And for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.
Very good.
No, I didn't want meatloaf.
Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing.
Arthur screamed at you-- now you have to scream at someone else.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.
Who would I even scream at?
I don't know.
How about somebody who's disappointed you?
Someone who's let you down.
Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf
When you explicitly ordered a blt and gravy fries.
No.
Hey, I was just heading to the bar.
What are you guys doing out here?
Oh, I was just telling ted a story.
Ooh, I like stories.
You want a lick?
-What? -is that ice cream cone big enough?
Uh, it's delicious enough.
Okay, so...
Then I say to barney...
I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.
Yes, you are.
That waiter is every boss and every bully
Who ever embarrassed or belittled you.
And how dare he deny you
The one thing that you want,
That would make you happy at this moment.
A blt and gravy fries.
One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf.
Enjoy, my friends.
Marshall.
Excuse me?
Yes?
This is not what I ordered.
Yes, it is.
I beg your pardon, sir,
But I ordered a blt and gravy fries,
And as the customer, I'm always right, so...
No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this!
I am at the end of a triple shift-- that's 18 hours!--
And then I have
To take two trains and a bus to astoria
To have my wife scream at me because I'm never home.
No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!
Hey, what are you guys doing out here?
Oh sweet, can I get a toot?
Uh-uh-- against car rules, it's against car rules!
Oh, ted, relax, it's cuban.
People pay to have their car smell like this.
Well, that's just not true.
Oh, marshall, switch seats with me.
I called shotgun for all eternity.
You can't call shotgun for eternity.
Well, that's funny, cause I did!
It's case by case.
Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!
A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?
I don't know, barney, he worked a triple, it just...
If you're not gonna yell at the waiter,
Yell at me.
-What? -yell at me.
I'm not gonna yell at you, barney.
What, you think you're gonna upset me?
Please, give me your best shot.
Okay, fine-- what, you want me to yell at you?
Yeah.
This is me yelling at you, barney.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly
Landing on a leaf about three blocks away.
This is me yelling at you, barney!
Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content.
Make it hurt.
You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!
No, something that's true-- come on.
The man made you cry.
Make me cry.
Your mom's a slut!
Yes.
Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, barney,
But you and your brother clearly have different fathers,
And you know why?
It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!
Keep going.
I don't care what you say.
Bob barker is not your father!
Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.
Oh my god, barney, I'm so sorry...
No, I'm kidding-- keep going.
Bob barker's not your father!
You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host
Is your real father, and he's not!
You were abandoned, barney!
You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it,
And so now you never allow yourself
To feel anything, and that's how you survive
In this corporate world, and if I keep heading
Down this path, I'm gonna turn into you!
And I don't want that!
I don't want any of this!
This is not why I became a lawyer.
This is not the person that I wanted to be.
I quit, arthur!
I quit!
Well, thank you, eriksen, I needed to hear that.
Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack you personally,
It's just that i...
No, no, no, the part where you said, "i quit."
Now we don't have to pay you a severance package.
Uh, security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.
Robin, you dropped a little ice cream...
-Dude! -dude! -dude!
I'm sorry.
Don't blame this on me, marshall.
I told you to yell at someone beneath you.
The circle of screaming is...
The chain of scr...
Pyramid-- the pyramid of screaming!
The pyramid of screaming.
How am I supposed to tell lily?
She supported me through three years of law school,
And now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back.
Now we're gonna lose the apartment.
The place where we were gonna raise our children.
How am I supposed to tell the person who I love
More than anything in this world
That I've just thrown away our future?
Everybody out, everybody out of the new car!
Out of the new car!
Ted, screaming never solves anything.
And so marshall finally had to tell lily what happened.
I'm so sorry.
I just lost it.
But I can fix it.
First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go in there
On my hands and knees and beg for my job back.
No, you're not.
What?
Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment.
And it's definitely not you being miserable
At that horrible job.
I'm just happy to have my husband back.
We'll figure the rest out.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Ultimately, they were able to make ends meet
Without going bust on the apartment.
You sure about this?
Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right?
Ted, I don't think I can accept...
Marshall, don't make me scream at you.
Thanks a lot, buddy.
You guys did it in the car, didn't...
Oh, yeah!
<i>Quand tante Robin
était ado, elle était...</i>
<i>une popstar canadienne.</i>
<i>Mais en 2008,
elle avait complètement changé.</i>
À suivre : "Votre bébé
essaie-t-il de vous tuer ?"
<i>Ce qui rend cette semaine-là,
encore plus surprenante.</i>
Donc, je rentre ce matin,
et brrr ça caille !
Donc, j'y vais et j'ignore pourquoi
je parle encore, car manifestement,
on se pose tous la même question :
qu'est-il arrivé aux seins de Robin ?
Je sais.
C'est dingue, hein ?
Ça m'a pris 30 min pour faire ça.
Y a du scotch, du coton, une demi-balle
en mousse, mais ça le fait, hein ?
C'est clair ! En quel honneur ?
Un vieil ami du Canada est en ville,
on va boire un verre.
Quelqu'un avec qui t'es allée
à Degrassi ?
En fait, c'était mon premier petit ami.
<i>Simon. Pour moi, c'était le plus cool.</i>
<i>Il sentait le Drakkar,</i>
<i>il faisait des figures en skate,</i>
<i>et il avait la plus géniale des
collections de T-shirts Hard Rock Café.</i>
<i>On a passé tout l'été
follement amoureux.</i>
"Vas-y, dis-moi !
Il avait une voiture ?"
C'est le type qui... ?
Comme dire ça en gentleman ?
T'a-t-il pris ta feuille d'érable ?
C'était pas comme ça.
Il semble qu'il t'ait donné
ta première grimace "Oh Canada".
<i>Ça a duré vraiment longtemps.</i>
<i>Certaines vannes étaient
élégantes, bien amenées.</i>
Attends. A-t-il cassé avec toi en
te disant qu'il était pas très chaud ?
<i>D'autres étaient grossières
et mal foutues.</i>
Un truc en rapport à la fourrure.
<i>Et d'autres étaient faciles,
mais devaient être dites.</i>
As-tu conduit sa dameuse ?
Attends, est-ce qu'il...
J'en ai plus.
Moi non plus, j'en ai "plou".
Là, j'en ai vraiment plus.
Désolée, c'était très plat-plat,
ça n'a duré qu'une semaine et demie.
T'avais pas dit tout l'été ?
Au Canada, l'été, c'est juste
la dernière semaine de juillet.
Bref, un soir, son groupe venait
de terminer un concert.
Oh, mon Dieu, Simon.
C'était vraiment
une super représentation.
Vous avez trop assuré.
Je sais.
D'après moi,
on est à 4 ou 5 concerts d'exploser.
On est énormes, aussi énormes
que les Crash Test Dummies.
Tout est là ?
OK.
Écoute, poupée,
c'est fini.
Quoi ?
Je me remets avec Louise Marsh.
Si ça, c'est pas un nom de prostituée.
Pourquoi se remettre avec
"Louise Marsh" ?
Le truc, c'est que...
ses parents viennent d'installer
une piscine.
Clair, je comprends.
Les piscines, c'est génial.
Nager, c'est de la bombe.
Nous, on a un arroseur automatique.
N'hésite pas, fonce.
Je devrais y aller.
Poupée, attends.
T'as oublié de charger
le set de batterie.
Dis-moi que tu l'as pas chargé.
Et si.
Et il vient là ?
Pourquoi tu veux le voir ?
Moi, je sais.
Tu vas gagner, hein ?
- Je sais pas de quoi tu parles ?
- Bien sûr que si.
Quand t'as pas vu quelqu'un
depuis longtemps,
nie-le tant que tu veux,
il y a toujours un gagnant et un raté.
Comme tu en as parlé,
comptons les points.
On commence avec deux gros, là.
Merci.
Il vit encore chez sa mère.
Un point pour Robin.
- Il a jamais été rockstar.
- Un pour Robin.
Il travaille à l'Aqualand
pas loin d'Ottawa.
- Point pour Simon.
- Attends.
Ils ont une piscine à vagues ?
Point pour Robin.
Ça fait 5-0,
- impossible qu'il gagne.
- Il va perdre.
À moins que d'une certaine manière
il soit devenu plus canon.
Le voilà.
<i>Et évidemment, il y avait un gagnant,</i>
<i>et un raté.</i>
<i>Seulement, ce n'était pas
évident pour tout le monde.</i>
Salut, poupée.
Oh, mon Dieu.
The Legen... dary Team
http://nosvospersos.blogspot.com
C'était quoi, ça ?
Allez, c'était pas si méchant, non ?
Regarde-toi.
T'as vieilli.
T'es superbe.
T'es encore plus beau,
comme si c'était possible.
Je sais que ça s'est pas passé
comme prévu.
Je peux pas lutter.
Je veux dire, il a encore ce "truc".
4 dollars pour une bière ?
C'est du vol !
Heureusement que j'ai des provisions.
Et alors ? C'est pas un snob.
Il est d'une autre partie
du Canada, OK ?
Le drapeau à la feuille d'érable
à l'arrière du pick-up.
Il est de province, du fin fond du nord.
On t'a donné tellement d'opportunités.
Tu sais, Robin est
une célébrité locale à New York.
C'est la présentatrice principale
à Metro News 1.
- Dis-lui.
- C'est stupide.
C'est pas cool comme
le T-shirt de Simon.
Désolé, nous voilà en train
de parler de notre star, et toi,
que fais-tu dans la vie ?
Je bosse à l'Aqualand d'Ottawa.
L'Aqualand ?
Rien à voir avec ce que fait Robin.
C'est sûr... moi, je sauve des vies.
Si je suis pas assis sur ce tabouret
en haut du toboggan à faire :
Des gens meurent.
Tu crois que c'est si facile ?
Essaie un peu.
T'as pas levé la main,
un enfant est mort.
- Non...
- Un autre est passé,
il est mort aussi.
- Bien sûr, en fait...
- Encore un autre.
Là, c'est l'hécatombe
et Robin a un sujet pour ses infos :
Flash info, mon ami Ted
a tué un tas d'enfants aujourd'hui.
C'est cool,
et puis faut bien payer les factures
puisque ton aventure musicale
n'a pas marché.
Pas pour l'instant,
mais le groupe existe toujours.
On est à 4 ou 5 concerts d'exploser.
Les Foreskins existent toujours ?
Les Foreskins ?
Il vient d'où, ce nom ?
On est quatre et on joue torse nu.
- Sérieusement.
- Je sais, désolée.
Je sais, désolée.
Mais vous comprenez pas.
Le fait qu'il ait continué le groupe,
c'est impressionnant.
J'ai abandonné mes rêves
de chanteuse, moi.
Ce qui nous amène à l'info
la plus importante de la soirée.
Alors Simon,
comment vous vous êtes connus ?
J'étais dans son clip.
T'étais plutôt une guest star.
Quand t'as gagné Mr Ado du Winnipeg,
tout le monde s'arrache la belle gueule.
Pardon,
j'ai dû voir "Let's Go To The Mall"
un millier de fois,
- t'es pas dedans.
- J'étais dans l'autre.
Il y a un autre clip !
Robin, sérieux.
Facilite-toi la vie,
donne-nous la cassette.
D'accord.
Tu me laisses pas le choix.
À compter de maintenant,
je vais consacrer
chaque minute de ma vie
à rechercher cette cassette.
J'arrête de dormir,
j'arrête de manger,
ma vie va être un enfer de moteurs
de recherche et d'appels internationaux.
À la recherche de quelque chose
qui est peut-être introuvable !
C'était dur à regarder,
t'es si cool normalement.
Je sais pas ce qui va pas.
Dès que je suis près de Simon,
j'ai de nouveau 16 ans.
C'est commun, quand tu fréquentes
quelqu'un de ton passé,
tu redeviens qui tu étais
quand tu les as connus.
- Y a pas vraiment de nom pour ça.
- Ça s'appelle <i>Revertigo</i>.
Je suis pas sûr de <i>Revertigo</i>.
Tu sais qui a un gros <i>Revertigo</i> ?
Lily, quand elle voit sa copine
de lycée, Michelle.
Michelle ? Elle a l'air sexy.
Tu sais pas pour Lily et Michelle ?
C'est quoi, cette histoire ?
Mon pote, tu vas adorer.
On n'a pas vu ta copine Michelle
depuis longtemps.
Je vais l'appeler
voir si elle veut passer.
Quoi, elles se sont embrassées ?
Encore mieux.
- Comparable.
- Comparable.
De toute façon, c'est fini.
J'ai perdu.
J'imagine qu'on n'a pas
de seconde chance.
- J'ai eu une seconde chance.
- C'est-à-dire ?
Il est venu chez moi ce soir.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je sens que c'est pas fini entre nous.
Te voir, là,
m'a fait réaliser que casser avec toi
fut la pire erreur de ma vie.
Oh... ça commence bien !
Je sais, c'est dingue, et je suis là
que pour quelques jours, mais...
tu veux sortir avec moi ?
Il t'a invité à sortir.
Viens dans ma toile, Simon !
<i>Coup de grâce.</i>
Finis-le !
J'adorerais !
Tu vas sortir avec Simon ?
Le Simon qu'on a vu ?
Ce typé mérite pas de seconde chance
après ce qu'il t'a fait.
C'était y a dix ans.
Les gens évoluent.
T'es la même personne qu'au lycée toi ?
- Oh, trop pas !
- Vous allez aimer ça.
- C'est ma meuf Michelle.
- Tu le sais bien ma pétasse.
- Comment ça va ?
- Ça va comme ça vient.
À fond !
Tu dois te prendre un verre.
J'espère que mon gros cul peut
m'accorder un verre de Vodka-Gatorade.
Trop vrai.
Je la veux avec nous tout le temps !
Je veux bien même
ne pas la draguer s'il le faut.
J'ai décidé de draguer Michelle.
C'était génial. Cinq minutes de pause.
Poupée, t'as aimé quand je t'ai lancé
mon médiator après mon solo ?
C'était génial.
Je vais en avoir besoin.
C'est bon, tu chercheras plus tard.
Cool, c'est bête
que je doive aller bosser le matin.
Poupée, tu dois aller bosser.
Tu dois passer
notre démo dans ton émission.
C'est pas une émission,
c'est les infos.
D'accord. Tu dis, genre :
vous savez la nouvelle ?
Vous devriez écouter ce groupe de rock.
Et tu le passes.
Genre, les 3 premières chansons.
Et maintenant,
"Le coin des boules de poils".
Des petits anges cherchant un toit,
présentés
par le refuge du centre-ville.
Beaucoup d'animaux ont été adoptés.
Bon, la majorité des gens
pensait qu'on allait les tuer.
Ton <i>Revertigo</i> commence
à affecter ton travail.
- C'est quoi, <i>Revertigo</i> ?
- Un mot imaginaire qui veut rien dire.
Non, c'est lorsque tu fréquentes
des gens de ton passé,
tu te comportes comme eux.
J'ai un exemple en tête,
on sait tous lequel.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui. Ted !
- Moi ?
- Quand ton ami Punchy arrive en ville,
d'un seul coup, tu es revenu au lycée.
Premièrement,
son nom est Adam Ponchiurello.
Et je fais pas ça.
Ça doit être Adam !
- Salut Punchy.
- Salut Shmosby.
- Tu veux y aller ?
- J'y suis déjà !
Mec, sérieusement.
Désolé pour ton père.
Ouais, ça a été un vrai choc.
Je peux pas croire
que toi tu me dises ça.
Pourquoi ?
Pour rien.
Robin, l'idée est,
tu fais quoi là ?
Ce type...
Vous voulez la vérité ?
J'apprécie Simon.
Vraiment, on s'amuse ensemble.
On sait,
mais on se fait du souci pour toi.
Du souci ?
OK, une seconde.
Y a-t-il une version de cette discussion
où vous feriez pas mes parents ?
Je sais pas, y a-t-il une version où
t'aurais pas 16 ans d'âge mental ?
Exactement ce que ma mère aurait dit.
Non, si j'étais ta mère, je dirais :
"On t'interdit de voir ce garçon."
- Lily !
- Désolée, mais c'est pour ton bien.
C'est ma vie !
Vous comprenez pas, vous avez
jamais ressenti ce que je ressens.
On a aussi été jeunes et amoureux.
Oui, y a un milliard d'années.
Tu as bu, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui, tu as payé la dernière tournée.
- Tu n'iras pas au concert.
- Oh que si.
Et ce soir, après le concert,
Simon et moi allons le faire.
Jeune fille, reviens ici !
Merci de ton aide.
- Aujourd'hui, au boulot...
- Pas maintenant, Ted !
Super concert.
Vous êtes toujours au top.
J'ai carrément déchiré mon solo.
Pourquoi je me sens pas
toujours aussi vivant ?
J'aime te voir si heureux.
À ce sujet.
Écoute poupée.
C'est fini.
Quoi ?
Je me remets avec Louise Marsh.
Quoi ?
Tu plaisantes.
Tu romps avec moi ?
Encore ?
Pour la même ex, dans le même camion ?
Quoi ? Ses parents ont une piscine,
c'est la même raison ?
Eh bien,
ses vieux viennent
d'installer un jacuzzi.
Désolé.
- Ça va.
- Je peux te dire, trop sincèrement,
- Simon est un chien. Hein, Michelle ?
- Trop vrai.
- C'est trop un bon à rien.
- Trop vrai.
Je vais chercher
mon champagne au soda raisin.
Ça va à Columbia ?
Oui, j'ai presque fini mon mémoire.
Je passe une maîtrise
de psychologie comportementale.
Je peux faire une remarque ?
Je sais.
Quand je suis avec Lily,
elle fait ressortir cette partie de moi.
Y a un terme pour ce phénomène.
- <i>Revertigo </i>?
En fait, c'est une régression associée.
Les voies nerveuses...
T'as pas mis mon son !
<i>Un par un, on est tous rentrés.</i>
<i>Bientôt, il n'y eut plus que Robin.</i>
Bon, je trouve pas ta vidéo.
J'ai perdu trois jours à...
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Simon m'a larguée dans son camion,
après le concert.
C'était il y a dix ans.
Non, ce soir.
Vraiment ?
Viens là.
Viens là.
C'est juste que...
quand j'étais jeune,
j'étais tellement...
vulnérable et ouverte.
Je crois que...
je voulais ressentir ça à nouveau.
Je voulais avoir 16 ans à nouveau.
C'est le truc le plus débile
que tu aies jamais dit.
Tu veux avoir 16 ans ?
J'ai vu ta première vidéo
un millier de fois.
Et c'est pas
parce que je suis fier de toi.
C'est parce que tu étais vraiment,
mais vraiment nulle.
Maintenant, regarde.
Tu es la personne la plus géniale
que j'ai jamais connue. Enfin, la 2e.
Oui, la première étant toi.
Non, la première,
c'est ce type qui vit dans le miroir.
Et alors !
Je te garantis...
que tu es bien plus géniale
que Simon le sera jamais.
Tu veux venir chez moi ?
Chez toi ?
T'es sûre de vouloir le faire ?
- N'en parle à personne, d'accord ?
- Bien sûr.
Je la mets dedans ?
Pourquoi pas.
#Je t'ai rencontré au centre commercial#
Voici la suite de ma carrière artistique
après "Let's Go To The Mall".
Ça a fait un bide.
#Mes amies disaient que j'étais idiote#
#T'es idiote#
C'est Tiffany ?
#Car t'étais plus vieux
et tu t'étais fait virer de l'école#
#Ensemble, on allait voir le monde#
#Depuis Alberta jusqu'à Ontario#
C'est tout ce dont je rêvais,
et même plus.
J'en suis ravie.
#Des châteaux de sable dans le sable#
#Je croyais voler
quand tu tenais ma main#
#Mais maintenant#
#L'éternité est de nouveau
en noir et blanc#
C'est Alan Thicke ?
#La meilleure semaine
et demie de ma vie#
#On allait à la plage#
Si tu la ressors, ce sera
pour une pub pour des tampons.
#Sur notre banc préféré#
#On parlait et
tu m'apprenais les langues#
Tu vois à quel point
tu étais nulle à l'époque ?
- T'as raison, j'étais nulle.
- Carrément nulle.
#C'est trop injuste#
#Tu comprends rien à l'amour#
Bien sûr, le robot fait une apparition
dans cette chanson d'amour.
C'était mon acolyte,
il fallait qu'il y soit.
<i>Ils l'ont encore regardé.</i>
#C'est de la folie#
#personne ne me comprend#
#Allons jusqu'au bout#
#Faisons-le#
#Tu me manques#
<i>Et encore.</i>
#Je prends la pilule#
<i>Et encore.</i>
<i>Ils l'ont regardé jusqu'à ce que,
finalement...</i>
<i>Ils arrêtèrent de regarder.</i>
Now kids
She was
but by 2008
Coming up next,is your baby trying to kill you
啥maybe
so,
so I
and
because
what
I know
I spent
cotton balls,
half of a Nerf football, but it works, right?
Totally. What's the occasion?
 And old friend from Canada  is in town
 and I'm meeting him  for a drink.
Ooh! Somebody you went   to Degrassi with?
 No. Actually, he was  my first boyfriend.
   <i>Simon. I thought</i>   <i>he was the coolest guy ever.</i>
   <i>He smelled like Drakkar.</i>
 <i>He could ollie on a skateboard.</i>
   <i>He had the most amazing</i>   <i>collection</i>
  <i>of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts.</i>
  <i>We spent the whole summer</i>  <i>madly in love.</i>
 Tell me more.  Tell me more.
  Like, did he have a car?
 So he's the guy who...
How shall I say this   like a gentleman?
 Robin, did he take your maple leaf?
No, it wasn't like that.
 Sounds to me like he gave you  your first "O, Canada!" face.
  NARROR:   <i>This went on</i>    <i>for a really long time.</i>
 <i>Some of them jokes were elegant</i>   <i>and well-crafted...</i>
Wait, wait. Did he break up with you
and tell you he's just not that Inuit?
 (laughing)
  NARRATOR:  <i>...others were crude,</i>   <i>and ill-formed...</i>
Um, something about fur trapping.
  NARRATOR:   <i>...and others were obvious,</i>    <i>but needed to be said...</i>
  Did you ride his Zamboni?
Oh! Come on!  Oh!
 (laughter)
  Wait, wait, wait.  Did he...?
I think I'm out.
Yeah, I'm also "oot."
Okay, now I'm really out.
Well, I'm sorry, guys.  It was all very tame.
 We only dated for a week and a half.
 Wha...? I thought you said  you were together all summer.
Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty  much the last week of July.
Anyway, one night,
 his band just finish playing  this gig...
  (panting)
 Oh, my God! Simon.
 That was such a good show.
 You guys totally rocked out.
Yeah.
I know.
I figure we're about  four or five gigs away
 from really exploding.
  We're gonna be big, babe.
 I mean, like  Crash-Test-Dummies big.
 So, that everything?
 Yeah.
 All right.
Listen, babe...
 It's over.
 What?
  I'm getting back together  with Louise Marsh.
Louise Marsh?!
That's a whore's name if I ever heard one.
 Yeah, why would he want to get back together  with Louise Marsh?
 Well, the thing is...
 her folks just put in a pool.
 Oh...  So...
I totally... I get it.
  Pools are great.
 Swimming's awesome.
 We have a sprinkler.
 Run right through it.
 Well, I should go.
Uh...
 Babe, wait.
 Yeah, Simon?
You forgot to load the drum set.
No!
Tell me you did not load the drum set.
 (drums feet):  I did.
(all groaning)
  And now he's coming here?
 Robin, why do you want to see this guy?
Oh! I know why.
You're gonna win, aren't you?
 I have no idea what   you' talking about.
Yes, you do.
Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time,
no matter how much you want to deny it,
there's always a clear winner and a clear loser.
Well, since you brought it up,
let's add up the points.
 You're starting out with two big ones right there.
  Thank you.
  Okay. So, Simon still  lives with his mom.
Point Robin.
Um, he never became
a rock star.
 Point Robin.
  He now works at a water slide  park outside of Ottawa.
Point Simon.
Wait. Do they have a wave pool?
No.
Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip.
 There's no coming back  from that.
 Yeah, he's going down.
 I mean, unless somehow,  he got hotter.
 There he is.
  NARRATOR:    <i>And sure enough,</i>   <i>there was a clear winner,</i>
  <i>and a clear loser.</i>
  NARRATOR:   <i>It just wasn't clear</i>  <i>to everybody.</i>
 Hey, babe.
 (giggling):  Oh, my God.
Okay, what the hell just happened?
Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?
(others groan)
 Hey, Simon.
  Wow, look at you.
 You got old.
ROBIN: Yeah.
You look great.
You got hotter,
 like that's possible.
(giggles)
 So...
  Look, I know it didn't go  as planned,
but I can't help it.
I mean...
 he's still got it.
 Whoa! Four bucks for a brew?
 What a rip.
Good think I'm packing.
  (giggles)
 So he's not a snob.
  He's from a different part
 of Canada, you know?
The maple leaf flag on the back  of the pickup truck?
 He's Red Province.
  He's from the Deep North.
The thing is,
 we gave you so many  opportunities.
 So, Simon,
Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York.
  She's the lead anchor  at Metro News One.
Tell him, Robin.
No. It's stupid.
It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.
  I'm sorry, Simon.
  Here we are nattering on   about our big celebrity.
 What do you do for a living?
Oh, I work at the Splish Splash   Ottawa Water Slide Park.
Huh! A water slide park.
That sure is different than what Robin does.
Yeah, it is...  because I save lives.
If I'm not sitting in that stool
  at the top of the slide,   going...
 Go...
  Go...
 Go...
 people die.
 What, you think it's so easy?
 You try it.
Um... (clears throat)... okay.
 Go.
You didn't put your hand up;  kid just died.
 No, I didn't know...
 Another kid just went; he died too.
Oh, well, sure.  I mean, if I was actually...
 Another kid just went; now you've got a pile-up
  and Robin's got something  to report on the news.
  This just in:  My friend, Ted, just killed  a bunch of kids today.
 Well, that's cool.
You got to pay the bills somehow
since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it?
 Well, it hasn't panned out yet,  but the band's still going.
About four or five gigs
away from really  exploding.
The Foreskins are still playing?
The Foreskins?
How'd you guys come up with that name?
(sighs)   Well, there's four of us,
 and we play without shirts.
  Babe, seriously.
 I know. I'm sorry.
 I know. I'm sorry.
  But you guys just   don't understand.
 The fact that he kept the band  going-- <i>that's</i> impressive.
  I mean, I gave up   my musical dream.
 Which brings us  to the most important piece
 of information from tonight.
 So, Simon,
how did you guys meet?
 Oh, I was in her video.
Starred in it is more like it.
 Well, once you win  Mr. Teen Winnipeg,
 <i>everybody</i> wants a piece  of the moneymaker.
 I'm sorry. I've seen "Let's Go to the Mall"
about a thousand times,  and you, sir, are not in it.
  No, I was   in the other one.
There's another video?!
  Robin, seriously,
just make this  easier on yourself
 and give us the tape.
 No.
 All right.
You leave me no choice.
From this moment on,
I will spend every waking minute   ching down this tape.
  I will not sleep. I will not eat.
  My life will be a living hell   of search engines
  and overseas phone calls,
chasing down something  that possibly can't be found.
 Okay.
It's just...
 It was so hard to watch, Robin.
 You're usually so cool.
 I don't know  what's wrong with me.
 I'm sitting next to Simon,  and suddenly I'm 16 again.
Oh, it's actually a common thing.
When you're around someone from your past,
you kind of revert back to who you were
when you knew them.
There's not really a name for it, though.
It's called "revertigo."
Yeah, I don't know about "revertigo."
  You know who gets   really bad revertigo?
 (whispers): Lily when she around
 her high school   friend, Michelle.
  Michelle? She sounds hot.
You don't know about Lily and Michelle?
No. What about  Lily and Michelle?
 Oh, my friend,  you are in for a treat.
  Hey, Lil? What?
 You know, I was  just thinking,
 we haven't seen your friend  Michelle in a while.
Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call,  see if she wants to hang out.
 Yeah.
 What... (stammers)   Do they make out?
Better.
 Comparable. Comparable.
  Whatever.  It's over. I lost.
  I guess you, uh,  you don't get second chance.
I got a second chance.
 What happened?
He came by my place tonight...
Simon.   What are you doing here?
  I just feel like there's   some unfinished business
 between you and me.
  Seeing you now...
 has made me realize   that breaking up with you
is the biggest mistake   I made in my entire life.
Oh, I like where  this is going.
 I know this is crazy,
 and I'm only in town  for a couple of days,
 but do you want to go  on a date?
 He asked you out?!
Oh, step into my web, Simon.
 The coup de grace.
  (a la Mortal Kombat):  Finish him!
I'd <i>love</i> to!
 Wait. You're going  on a date with Simon?
 That Simon?The one we met?
 Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance.
  Not after the way  he treated you.
That was ten years ago. People evolve.
I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?
  Oh, hell, no!
I think you're gonna enjoy this.
That my girl Michelle?  Bitch, you know it!
How she livin'?  She living only way she know how to.
Large!
Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here.
  I'm hoping my t ass can  hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade.
For reals.
  I want her around   all the time.
  I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her
if that's what it takes.
 Guys, I've decided  to seduce Michelle.
 (rock music playing)
  (laughs)
 (song ends)
(Robin whoops)
Yeah!   Guys, that was great.
Let's take five.
 Hey, babe,  did you like it
 after my bass solo when   I flicked my pick at you?
 That rocked.
 Yeah.
  Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back.
 Oh, uh, sure.
  Um, I think it...
  It's cool. You'll  find it later. Oh, cool.
I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning.
 Oh, but, babe, you  got to go to work.
 You got to play our  demo on your show.
Oh, well, you know, it's not a show.
It's the news.
  Right. So you   can be, like,
 "Hey, did you hear  there's some news?
 There's a rad band you  guys should check out."
  And then play it.
 Or just, like, the  first three songs.
  And now it's time  for "Puppy Corner,"
 some little angels looking for a new home,
courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter.
 * Murder
* Climb aboard  the Murder Train *
 * Murder
* Climb aboard  the Murder Train... *
  Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted.
 Of course, a lot of the   people calling in thought
  we were going   to kill them.
 Robin, your revertigo is really   starting to affect your work.
What's revertigo?
 It's a stupid, made-up word   with no meaning.
 No. It's a   phenomenon where,
 when you're around  people from your past,
 you start behaving  like them.
Oh. One example of that springs to mind.
I think we all know what it is.
 You do?
Yeah. Ted.
Me?
Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town,
it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again.
TED: Okay, okay.
 First of all,  his name is Adam Punciarello,
 and I don't do that.
(both scoffing)
 (knocking, classical music plays)
Ooh. That must be Adam.
'Sup, Punchy?  'Sup, Shmosby?!
You want to go?  I'm alrey there!
Come on!  This is it!
  Dude, seriously,   I'm sorry about your dad.
  Yeah, it was   a real shock.
I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this.
Why?
No reason.
Robin, the point is,  what are you doing?
  I mean, this guy?
  Okay, you want the truth?
Yeah. I like Simon.
I do.
 We have fun together.
Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you.
You're worried?
Okay, hold on.
 Is there any version  of this conversation
 where you guys don't sound   like my parents?
I don't know. Is there any version
where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?
 That's exactly what   my mom would say.
No. If I was your mom, I woulsay,
"We forbid you from seeing this boy."
  (scoffs)  Lily!
No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.
  (teary):   This is my life!
 You guys just don't get it!
  You've never felt the way  that I feel!
 Now, now. We were once  young and in love, too.
  Yeah, like, a  billion years ago.
You've been drinking, haven't you?
 Yeah, we all have.
 You bought the  last round.
You're not going to that show tonight!
Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else?
  Tonight, after the show,
 Simon and I are going  all the way!
 (all gasping)
 Young lady, get back here!
(teary): Thanks for your help.
  Hey, so, today at work...
  Not now, Ted!
 Geez.
Ooh!
Oh, hey, Simon.
Great show.
You guys still rock.
  Yeah.
They totally dug my bass solo.
Man!
 Why can't I always   feel this alive?!
  God, I just love  seeing you so happy.
 Yeah. (laughs)
 About that.
 Listen, babe.
  It's over. What?
  I'm getting back together  with Louise Marsh.
 (laughing):  What?
 You're kidding me.
 You're breaking up with me?
Again?
 F-For the same ex-girlfriend?
  In the same van?
What is it?
 Her-Her parents got a pool?
  Is that still the reason?
Well...
I'm sorry, Robin.
  I'm fine, really.
Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real.
Simon's a dawg.
 You feel me, Chelle?
Mm-hmm, for reals.
He a scrub.
Mm. True dat.
I'ma get me my champagne  and grape soda on.
So, how's Columbia?
Great!
I'm almost done  with my disstation.
Hmm. I'm getting a PhD in  behavioral psychology.
Um, can I make an observation?
Oh.
I know.
  Whenever I'm around Lily,
 she just brings out   that side of me.
 There's a psychological term  for the phenomenon.
 Revertigo? No.
 Actually, it's associative  regression. You see,
 the neural pathways that...
 *
  Oh, no, you did not just
 put on my jam!
 Oh. Put your hands up, girl!
Holla! Holla!
 NARRATOR:   <i>One by one,</i>  <i>we all had to go home.</i>
   <i>Soon, it was just Robin.</i>
BARNEY: All right.
  I can't find your video.
I've wasted three days tr...
 *
What's the matter?
 *
 Uh... Simon dumped me
 in his van after the show.
Yeah, Robin, that was,  like, ten years ago.
 No, tonight.
 Ooh.
 (laughing): Really?
Oh! Oh, come here.
(sobbing) Come here.
 *
 It's just...
  when I was young,  I was so...
 vulnerable and-and open to things, you know?
And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again.
I wanted to be 16 again.
Robin, that is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard come out of your mouth.
You want to be 16 again?
I have watched your first
Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times,
and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend.
It's because you were totally, totally lame back then.
But now, come on. Pa-cow!
You're the most awesome person I have ever known.
Well, second most awesome.
  Right. Of course, the-the first being you.
No.
No. The first is this guy
who lives in a place called the mirror.
(laughs) What up.
Oh.
I'm saying
that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.
 *
 Barney, do you want to  come back to my place?
Your place?
 *
Are you sure you want to do this?
Yeah. I am.
 Let's just not tell anyone   about this, okay?
 Of course.
 So, should I just put it in?
Yeah, why not?
  (sighs)
 (instrumental intro  to pop ballad plays)
 * Met you at the mall...
This was my big artistic follow-up
to"Let's Go to the Mall."
It kind of tanked.
* My friends said I was a fool
 You're a fool.    <i>Shut up!</i>
Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm.
* 'Cause you were older and got kicked out of school *
You are so rad.
  * Together we we gonna  travel the globe *
 * From Alberta to Ontario
 It's everything   I want it to be and more.
Oh, I'm so glad.  Mm-hmm.
* And now I'm building   sandcastles in the sand *
 * <i>Sandcastles in the sand</i> *
 * Thought I could fly when you held my hand *
* <i>Thought I could fly</i> *
 But now...
 * Eternity returns to black and white... *
Is that Alan Thicke?
Yeah.
 * It was the greatest   week and a half *
* Of my life
* We used to go to the beach
You know, if  you reedit it,
 there's a tampon commercial  in here somewhere.
  * On our favorite bench
 * We'd sit and talk  and you taught me to french *
 * You're good at...
Do you seem how lame  you were back then?
Yeah, you're right. I was lame.
  Totally lame. Ugh.
 * ...so unfair...
ROBOT: You don't understand about love.
  And, of course, the robot  makes an appearance
 in the sad love ballad.
He was my sidekick. He had to be.
  NARRATOR:  <i>And so they watched it again.</i>
 * Come back, please
  * I've changed my mind
  * Let's go all the way
  <i>I love you.</i>
 Let's do it.
 I miss you.
 NARRATOR:   <i>And again.</i>
 * Sandcastles may be cute
 I'm on the pill now.
  NARRATOR:   <i>And again.</i>
 * But now all they do   is remind me of you... *
 <i>They watched it over and over</i>   <i>that night until finally,</i>
 <i>they stopped watching.</i>

<i>L'histoire tant attendue de la chŤvre.</i>
<i>Cette semaine a commencť
comme les autres.</i>
<i>Barney s'est rťveillť
dans le lit d'une fille.</i>
D'aprŤs mon expťrience,
Áa se passe comme Áa :
on traÓne un peu au lit,
on se dit quelques banalitťs.
C'est fait.
Puis j'invente une rťunion,
une opťration ou un vol d'essai
que je dois pas louper.
Pour m'ťclipser de chez toi
et jamais te rappeler.
Et plus tard au bar, tu racontes
ŗ ta grande amie Robin,
l'histoire de ta derniŤre conquÍte
et elle se demande :
Qui est cette pauvre ťcervelťe
qui est allťe coucher
avec Barney Stinson ?
En fait,
tu dis Áa ŗ haute voix.
Je viens de coucher
avec l'ex de mon meilleur ami.
Et je viens de coucher
avec un trŤs bon ami de mon ex.
Meilleur ami.
Voilŗ ce qu'on va faire.
ņ la seconde oý je pose le pied ŗ terre,
tout ceci n'est jamais arrivť.
Attends !
Clic droit / Enregistrer sous...
dans le dossier photos B et voilŗ.
«a n'est jamais arrivť.
Bon plan.
Maintenant, on revient exactement
ŗ la situation d'avant.
D'accord.
Alors, Robin ?
Oui, Barney ?
Devine qui a niquť la nana
de <i>Metro News One</i> hier soir.

http://nosvospersos.blogspot.com
Je vais me doucher...
jusqu'en juin.
Et puisque tu n'as jamais ťtť lŗ,
tu seras pas lŗ quand je sortirai.
«a n'est jamais arrivť.
Jamais arrivť...
<i>Mais nier les faits
ne serait pas si simple.</i>
Alors, raconte-nous, c'ťtait comment ?
- Quoi ?
- Pťnťtrer cette barriŤre.
Toi et moi,
on est les 1ers ŗ la toucher.
Enfin, pas les premiers,
mais ŗ cette table, si.
Enfin moi, je vais la toucher
dans pas longtemps.
Oh oui.
Quand je vais la toucher,
je vais Ítre folle.
«a va durer toute la nuit,
et je pense
que je vais y inclure un clown.
J'ai peur des clowns,
mais pour toi, je serai lŗ.
Vous parlez de quoi ?
Le grand 3 - 0.
Tu sais que j'ai 30 ans vendredi ?
T'as oubliť ?
Et Áa se dit ami ?
C'est vrai.
Un trŤs bon ami au fait, le meilleur.
C'est moi ou ces verres
sont de plus en plus petits ?
Si c'ťtait un cabinet de docteur,
on lirait "essaye encore".
- «a va, Robin ?
- Oui.
J'ai dťcidť de faire le tri
dans mes vieux trucs
et de jeter
tout ce qui ne me sert plus.
Barney, tu veux ma X-box ?
Ted, elle a un nom !
Et de quoi tu m'accuses ?
D'aimer les jeux vidťos.
- Je vais chercher ŗ boire.
- Je viens avec toi.
Dieu que c'est embarrassant.
- Quoi exactement ?
-  tre ŗ cŰtť de Ted.
- Pourquoi ?
- ņ cause de notre truc.
Quel truc ?
- Tu vas vraiment le nier ?
- Nier quoi ?
- De quoi vous parlez ?
- De rien.
ArrÍtez de jouer la comťdie,
je sais tout.
Je suis au courant de la fÍte
que vous organisez.
Marshall a l‚chť le morceau,
tout ŗ l'heure.
Je ferai le surpris,
faites en sorte d'inviter Stella.
T'as une copine maintenant !
T'as oubliť celle-lŗ,
Robin qui ? Hein ?
ņ cŰtť de Stella, elle ressemble
ŗ un sac ŗ merde rťpugnant, non ?
Joyeux anniversaire, mon pote.
Marshall, j'ai besoin de ton aide.
Je suis en pleine
recherche de boulot, lŗ.
Je sais, je veux t'engager.
Pour la derniŤre fois,
je veux pas Ítre ton majordome.
Il me faut un avocat, je te payerai.
Combien ?
- Pas beaucoup.
- J'accepte.
Je lis Áa et je dois dire
que Áa me dťpasse un peu.
Tout d'abord,
il me semble que si ces contrats
ne sont pas exťcutťs ŗ la lettre,
nous serons en guerre avec le Portugal.
Oublie Áa. C'est un mardi pour moi.
Nouvelle dťchiqueteuse.
Ce bijou peut dťvorer
un vťlo en 17 sec.
C'est la Redoute.
Tout provient de la Redoute.
Quand je suis angoissť,
j'achŤte chez la Redoute. Un hot-dog ?
Bien sŻr.
Qu'est-ce qui te tracasse ?
Je vais te rťvťler un secret
que tu ne dois pas dťvoiler
ni ŗ Ted ni ŗ Robin ni ŗ Lily.
Non, plus de secrets.
Surtout maintenant que je sais
ce que vous avez fait
ŗ l'eau potable ŗ Lisbonne.
Tu vas m'ťcouter, Marshall.
J'ai couchť...
ArrÍte Áa !
J'ai couchť avec Robin.
T'as couchť avec Robin ?
Tu m'en veux ?
J'en sais rien.
- Le hot-dog est bon ?
- «a aide.
T'as couchť avec Robin ?
Je peux pas garder Áa.
Je dois au moins le dire ŗ Lily.
Tu peux rien dire ŗ personne,
secret professionnel.
- Pourquoi tu me fais Áa ?
- Faut que tu sois mon avocat
pour prouver que j'ai rien fait de mal.
Comment je peux t'aider comme avocat ?
T'as enfreint aucune loi, non ?
Robin sait que t'as couchť avec elle,
n'est-ce pas ?
J'ai enfreint aucune loi.
Mais je crois avoir brisť
une loi supťrieure ŗ tout Áa.
Le Code des potes.
<i>Pendant des annťes,
on a entendu Barney citer ce code.</i>
<i>Une liste des ŗ faire et ŗ ne pas faire
pour tous les potes.</i>
<i>Certaines, basiques.</i>
Article 1 du Code des potes :
"Les potes avant les pťtasses."
<i>Certaines, incroyablement compliquťes.</i>
Article 89 : "La mŤre d'un pote
est toujours intouchable
"mais une belle-mŤre, c'est autorisť,
"si c'est elle qui drague
"et/ou si elle porte
au moins un article affriolant."
<i>D'autres, vraiment perturbantes.</i>
Article 34 :
"Les potes ne se regardent pas
dans les yeux
"lors d'une partie ŗ 3 diabolique."
Deux mecs.
C'est pas un document lťgal,
c'est toi qui l'as ťcrit.
Tu crois Áa ?
Tu connais pas la glorieuse histoire...
du Code des potes ?
<i>En l'an de gr‚ce 1776,</i>
<i>ŗ Philadelphie,</i>
<i>Benjamin Franklin et George Washington
prenaient un verre.</i>
Mais mon pote, sťrieux.
J'ťtais preums sur cette tasspť.
Tu m'as grillť la prioritť.
Et alors ? Y a pas de loi contre Áa.
Il devrait.
Il devrait y avoir des rŤgles
sur comment se comporter entre potes.
Mais qui pourrait ťcrire Áa ?
Je dois aller ŗ Moi D.C.
pour poser pour le billet de dollar.
Et moi, je dois aller faire
du cerf-volant.
J'ťcrirai ces rŤgles.
Et je les inscrirai
au dos de la constitution.
Pour ťconomiser du papier.
C'est dťcidť !
Barney B. Stinson ťcrira...
le Code des potes !
Et j'y incluerai une mention :
"On ne croise pas le regard
lors d'une partie ŗ 3 diabolique."
- D'accord.
- D'accord.
- Tu attends quoi de moi ?
- Je perds la tÍte en ce moment.
Tu sais pourquoi ?
Car t'as couchť avec Robin.
Non, c'ťtait gťnial.
Je me sens mal,
parce que le code spťcifie :
"Pas de sexe avec l'ex d'un pote".
Mais si toi, mon avocat,
peut trouver une faille quelque part,
le malaise s'envolera.
Et tu me payerais pour Áa ?
Non, je dťchiquťterai ta paperasse.
Techniquement, tu seras payť par
une usine de jouets ŗ Pyongyang.
Barney, je suis pas psychologue,
mais tu vois pas
que c'est une tentative dťsespťrťe
pour t'ťviter une confrontation
dťplaisante avec Ted ?
Si je voulais
une ťvaluation psychologique,
j'engagerais le type qu'on paie
pour hypnotiser avant les dťpositions.
Au boulot !
<i>Alors que Marshall examinait le Code,</i>
<i>la classe de Lily
accueillait un invitť spťcial.</i>
Avec un peu de chance,
dans quelques jours,
le rhume de Frank le fermier sera parti
et c'est pourquoi
son haleine sent le mťdicament.
- N'est-ce pas ?
- C'est Áa, poulette.
Une derniŤre question
pour Frank le fermier ? Oui ?
Est-ce qu'on reverra Missy la chŤvre ?
Si c'est pas mignon.
Tu sais, petite, en sortant d'ici,
je  vais dťposer
la vieille Missy chez le boucher.
Et ils vont prendre
leurs gros couteaux...
<i>Et Frank traumatisa la classe de Lily</i>
<i>avec une explication dťtaillťe
d'oý provient la viande.</i>
Pour qu'aucune miette de Missy
ne soit g‚chťe.
Mlle Aldrin,
ne les laissez pas manger Missy ?
Je sais, j'ai dťjŗ appelť un organisme
de sauvegarde des animaux,
ils viennent la chercher lundi.
Lundi ? Mais oý va-t-elle dormir,
manger et faire ses besoins ?
OK, oý va-t-elle manger et dormir ?
Je vais la laisser sur le toit.
Je suis peut-Ítre dingue,
mais je crois pas qu'avoir une chŤvre
dans l'appart soit une bonne idťe.
<i>Je croyais pas si bien dire.</i>
<i>Car ce que Missy allait faire
dans la salle de bains ťtait si...</i>
<i>Non, vous savez quoi, c'est trop tŰt.
On y reviendra.</i>
T'es partant pour...
D'oý vient cette crotte de chŤvre ?
Comment tu sais ce que c'est ?
C'ťtait Áa
ou un búuf musquť, je me suis dit...
que ferait un búuf musquť ici ?
Devine ce que ta femme a ramenť ?
Secret professionnel,
je peux pas en parler.
- Parler de quoi ?
- Rien.
Et ta journťe sinon ?
Une crotte de chŤvre, c'est nouveau ?
Comment tout le monde sait
que c'est une crotte de chŤvre ?
- Barney t'a dit.
- Je sais pas de quoi vous parlez, Mme.
Tu peux pas soutenir mon regard,
tu rougis, tu tousses...
- et tes mains tremblent.
- Robin, viens lŗ !
Ted ne l'apprendra jamais, compris ?
«a n'est jamais arrivť,
personne ne dit rien.
Et n'ouvre pas cette canette
avant que je sois hors de portťe.
Fantastique, t'es lŗ.
Dis-moi la bonne nouvelle.
Dťsolť, t'as trop bien ťcrit ce truc,
c'est du bťton.
Mauvais avocat !
J'ai besoin d'une faille,
je veux me sentir mieux.
Je peux pas continuer
ŗ acheter des trucs !
J'ai six litiŤres autonettoyantes
et j'ai mÍme pas d'enfant ! Attends...
…coute Áa.
Ted a dŻ le casser, non ?
S'il a cassť le Code des potes,
je m'en sors !
J'y ai pensť et je dois dire
que Ted l'a toujours respectť.
Par exemple, Article 87 :
"Un pote doit toujours dire Oui".
Il t'a sauvť d'une avalanche ?
Et il t'a portť sur 10 km
avec une jambe cassťe ?
Et t'es un chanteur
de cabaret transsexuel
qui a fait partie de la mafia russe ?
Article 29 :
"Un pote prťviendra ŗ temps son pote
"d'une bagarre entre filles."
- Deux filles se battent au McLarens !
- Quoi ?
Ouais, c'ťtait dingue,
une des filles a dit...
Article 53 :
"Quand c'est possible, un pote
offrira une protection ŗ son pote."
- «a fait du bien...
- Bien.
J'aurais aimť qu'on ait du vin.
Ouais, j'aurais aimť
avoir du vin, moi aussi.
Merde, Marshall, je te paye pas
pour me dire combien Ted est un saint.
T'es mon avocat, la rťponse
est lŗ dedans. Trouve-la.
Le problŤme,
c'est pas le Code et tu le sais.
Tu es mal ŗ l'aise
parce que ce que tu as fait est mal.
Et la seule chose qui te fera
te sentir mieux,
c'est de tout dire ŗ Ted.
Et s'il veut plus jamais me parler ?
C'est un risque
que tu vas devoir prendre.
<i>Ce qui nous amŤne au 25 avril 2008 :</i>
<i>mon 30e anniversaire.</i>
<i>Ou, comme on l'appellerait plus tard,</i>
<i>"Le jour de la chŤvre".</i>
T'es oý ?
Dans une limousine,
devant la boÓte de Ted.
Tout le monde est lŗ,
Stella vient d'arriver.
Et y a un truc trop gťnial,
je te dis pas ce que c'est,
mais t'y croiras pas.
- Une chŤvre avec un chapeau ?
- Putain !
Mais tu dois la voir, c'est trop drŰle
d'avoir une chŤvre ŗ une fÍte !
<i>D'ici quelques heures,
Lily allait regretter ces mots.</i>
<i>On y reviendra.</i>
Le voilŗ.
C'est le grand jeu.
OK, Ted est dans la limousine.
On a 5 minutes, prťparez-vous.
Missy, t'es excitťe ?
Oh que oui.
On quitte la ville, lŗ.
Elle est oý, cette fÍte ?
Las Vegas.
Je croyais
qu'elle se passait sur le toit.
Surprise ! C'ťtait juste un leurre.
- Y a pas de fÍte sur le toit ?
- Si, mais on n'y va pas.
Je suis vraiment ton meilleur ami.
Ils veulent que tu passes
ton anniversaire au-dessus de chez toi.
Mais pas moi, mon pote.
J'ai sorti le grand jeu, avion privť,
suite Valderrama au Bellagio,
steaks chez BOA,
scotch au Ghostbar, puis
des places pour voir Floyd Mayweather
combattre pendant 10 rounds avec...
attends...
un grizzly.
RamŤne-moi, Barney.
Il faut qu'on aille ŗ Las Vegas.
…coute, je voulais pas le dire, mais...
Je dois te dire une chose et faut que
tu sois dans les meilleures dispositions
- pour l'entendre.
- T'as couchť avec Robin.
- Ranjit.
- T'as couchť avec Robin ?
C'est l'ex de Ted.
Comment as-tu su ?
Robin, viens voir.
Quoi ?
Je regardais des vieux trucs et j'ai...
Merde !
Bref, je suis tombť sur Áa.
De mes vacances dans le Vermont.
- Si tu le veux, c'est ŗ toi.
- J'ai couchť avec Barney.
Quoi ?
Juste une fois,
le soir oý Simon m'a larguťe,
j'ťtais vulnťrable.
Je voulais faire
comme si c'ťtait jamais arrivť.
J'ai pas pu.
Je peux pas.
Il fallait que je te le dise.
J'espŤre qu'on peut rester amis.
Bien sŻr que oui.
T'es pas f‚chť ?
Ben, c'est un peu bizarre, mais...
Non, je suis pas f‚chť.
Alors, t'es pas f‚chť ?
Je suis pas f‚chť.
Robin et moi, on a rompu il y a un an.
On est sortis
avec plein de monde depuis.
Je suis avec Stella, maintenant.
Sťrieusement, c'est pas grave.
Je suis si soulagť que tu dises Áa.
Je viens de me rappeler,
ma mŤre vient le mois prochain.
T'aimerais peut-Ítre te la faire aussi.
Ils sont oý ? J'attrape des crampes.
On peut garder la chŤvre ?
Elle est si mignonne et douce.
Oui, et elle se rťpand,
mange dans la poubelle,
ne contrŰle pas ses intestins.
On peut appeler l'asile et proposer
ŗ mon oncle Linus de vivre avec nous.
«a peut paraÓtre une bonne idťe
aprŤs quelques verres,
mais demain, tu voudras plus
de ce truc chez toi.
Tu peux parler,
t'as couchť avec Barney.
Dťsolť, je pouvais plus tenir.
Je peux pas croire
que tu aies fait Áa, c'est dťgueu.
C'ťtait incroyable ?
Quoi ?
- J'ai vraiment pas envie d'en parler.
- Je sais, mais...
C'est Barney,
c'est difficile de pas Ítre curieuse.
Il a des accessoires ?
- Lily, arrÍte.
- De la cire chaude ?
- Il t'a attachťe ?
- «a suffit.
Dťsolťe.
Il est tout doux du bas ?
3 milliards de femmes
sur cette planŤte.
3 ! Et tu couches avec celle
avec qui je suis sorti pendant un an ?
Tu te fous de moi ?
- Robin ?
- Tu crois que j'en suis fier ?
Je suis horrifiť que ce soit arrivť.
Comment c'est arrivť ?
J'aimerais savoir,
dis-moi comment Áa s'est passť.
Tu veux dire, quelles positions ?
ArrÍte !
ArrÍte !
- Frappe-le !
- D'accord, t'es en colŤre.
T'as le droit, c'est bon.
Tu sais quoi ?
Un coup gratuit.
Frappe-moi.
Oý tu veux, mais pas le visage.
Qui frappe les gens dans l'aine ?
OK, je le mťrite.
Je le mťrite.
Ce qui compte, c'est que...
- Cette histoire est rťglťe.
- Tu crois qu'il s'agit juste de Áa ?
Il s'agit...
Je t'ai vu faire des trucs moches,
vraiment moches.
ņ plein de gens.
Je pensais qu'il y avait une limite.
Je pensais Ítre la limite.
Tu dťclames toujours
ces rŤgles entre potes.
Y en a pas une qui dit : "Fais pas Áa."
Si, et je l'ai enfreinte.
Je suis dťsolť.
Mais Ted...
- Sťrieusement, la suite au Bellagio...
- J'irai pas ŗ Las Vegas.
Je vais pas laisser tomber mes amis,
ma petite amie,
pour passer mon anniversaire
dans un club de strip-tease.
Le fait que tu le crois...
Tout ŗ l'heure,
j'ai mis des trucs dans une boÓte
que j'ai appelťe :
"Trucs qui ne servent plus."
«a veut dire quoi ?
Peut-Ítre
que ta place est dans cette boÓte.
Tu veux plus Ítre pote avec moi ?
Je dis que je veux plus Ítre ton ami.
D'accord, je t'arrÍte tout de suite,
t'es sur le point de dire
un truc qui va g‚cher le voyage.
Ranjit, arrÍte la voiture.
Je prends un taxi.
<i>Ah oui, la chŤvre.
Trop drŰle, vous allez adorer.</i>
<i>Plus tard, ce soir-lŗ, elle s'est
enfermťe dans la salle de bain et...</i>
<i>a mangť un gant de Robin...</i>
<i>Attendez,
Robin vivait pas lŗ ŗ mes 30 ans.</i>
<i>C'est arrivť quand ?</i>
<i>Ah oui, la chŤvre
ťtait lŗ pour mes 31 ans.</i>
<i>Dťsolť, je me suis plantť.</i>
Well, kids, here we are.
We've arrived
My 30th birthday.
The long-awaited story of...
...the goat.
That week started just like any other.
Barney woke up in some girl's bed.
In my experience, the way this normally goes is,
We lie here for a while,
Make a little awkward chitchat.
Check.
Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery,
Rocket test flight I've got to be at,
Slip out of the apartment and never call you again.
And later at the bar,
You tell your good friend robin
The story of your latest conquest,
And she thinks to herself,
"who is this sad,  self-loathing idiot
Who climbed into bed with barney stinson?"
Actually, you usually say that out loud.
So...
...i just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend
And I just slept
With my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.
Best friend.
Okay, here's the deal, barney.
The second my feet touch the ground,
This never happened.
Okay.
Wait.
Right click, save as...
Into the .bpeg folder, and okay.
This never happened.
It's a good plan.
Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
So, robin?
Yes, barney?
Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?


Okay, uh, I am gonna take a shower,
Till june, and, um,
Since you were never here to begin with,
You won't be here when I get out.
-Okay. -okay.
This never happened.
Never happened.
Never... happened.
But pretending it never happened
Wouldn't be that easy.
So, tell us,
What was it like?
What?
penetrating that barrier.
You and I are the first ones to hit it.
Well, not the first ones,
Certainly, but the first ones at this table.
I... I...
I'm... I'm...
Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon.
yeah, you are.
Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.
It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there.
I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.
What are you taking about?!
The big three-oh.
You know,My 30th birthday's this friday.
Did you forget?
What kind of friend is this guy?
Ha-ha right.
A great friend, by the way.
The best.
Is it my imagination,
Or are these drinks getting smaller?
If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, "try again."
How you doing there, robin?
-I'm good. -Oh, so, I made a a decision.
I'm going to go through all my old stuff,
And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore.
Hmm.  barney, you want my xbox?
Ted, she has a name!
And just what are you accusing me of?
Liking video games?
I'm gonna get a drink.
I'll come with you.
Okay.
God, this is awkward.
What is?
Being around ted.
Why?
-Because of our thing.-what thing?
You're really gonna pretend this never happened?
What never happened?
What are you guys talking about?
Nothing.
Guys, cut the act. I know.
I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me.
Marshall let it slip earlier today.
Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything.
Just be sure to invite stella.
Stella!
You have a serious girlfriend now!
You're over this one.
Robin who, right?
Stella makes this one look
Like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right?
Happy birthday, bro.
Hello.
Hey, marshall, I need your help.
Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.
I know. I want to hire you.
For the last time, barney, I will not be your butler.
I need a lawyer.
I'll pay you.
How much?
A little.
I'll take it.
Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say,
This might be a little bit over my head.
For one thing, I'm fairly certain
That if these contracts aren't executed precisely,
We will be at war with portugal.
Forget that.
That's a tuesday for me.
New shredder.
This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds.
From sky mall.it's all from sky mall.
Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall.
-Want a hot dog? -of course.
Why are you upset?
Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret
That you can't tell anyone-- not ted,
Not robin, not lily.
No. no, no, no,  I don't want any more secrets,
Especially now that I know what you guys did
To the drinking water in lisbon. i...
You are hearing this secret, marshall.
I... I slept...
Stop..stop doing that.
I slept...
I slept with robin.
You slept with robin?
Are you mad at me?
I don't know.
How's the hot dog?
It's helping.
You slept with robin?!
I... I cannot keep that secret.
I mean, you know
I at least have to tell lily.
You can't. you can't tell anyone.
Attorney-client privilege.
Why are you doing this to me?!
Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer,
to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.
How can I help you as your lawyer?
You didn't break any laws, did you?
Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?
I didn't break any state or federal laws,
but I think I broke a much, much higher law.
The Bro Code.
<i>For many years,</i>
we had heard Barney<i>quote the Bro Code,</i>
<i>a list of do's</i><i> and don'ts for all bros.</i>
<i>Some were basic.</i>
Bro Code article one:"Bros before hoes.
<i>Some were unbelievably</i><i> complicated.</i>
Bro Code article 89:
"The mom of a bro is always off limits,
"but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it,
"and/or is wearing at least one a article
of leopard print clothing."
<i>And some were</i><i>just plain disturbing.</i>
Bro Code article 34:
"Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three-way."
Two dudes.
This is not a legal docume..
This is just something you wrote.
You think I wrote that?
Oh, Marshall,
don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?
<i>The year was 1776.</i>
<i>The place: Philadelphia.</i>
Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were hangng a drink.
But, bro, seriously,
I called the dibs on that wench.
You codpiece blocked me.
So what if I did?
There's no rule against it.
Well, there should be.
There should be a set of rules that govern
the way bros comport themselves among other bros.
But who shall write such a document?
I have to go to Me, D.C.,and pose for the dollar bill.
And I have to do some kite-flying or setething.
I shall write this set of rules.
And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution.
 To save paper.
It's resolved!
Barney Stinson shall write...
the Bro Code.
And I shl l include a provision
that stateth no eye contact in a devil's three-way.
-Seconded. -Seconded.
Listen, what do you want me for?
I've just been losing my mind lately,
and do you know why I feel so bad?
Yeah, because you slept with Robin.
No, that was awesome.
I feel bad
because the Bro Code  clearly states
"No sex with your bro's ex."
But if you,
my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere,
then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.
And you would pay me for that?
No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork.
Technically, you'll be paid  by a toy factory in Pyongyang.
Barney, I'm no shrink, okay,
but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you
to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?
Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation,
I'd hire the guy we pay
to hint notize us before depositions.
Now, get cracking!
<i>While Marshall examined</i>  <i> the Bro Code,</i>
<i>Lily's kindergarten class welcomed a special guest.</i>
And with a little luck, in a few days,
Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone.
And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine.
Right, Farmer Frank?
You got it, toots.
Any last questions  for Farmer Frank? Yes.
Will we ever go to see Missy the Goat again?
Oh! Ah, isn't  that sweet!
Well, you know, honey,
right after this,
I'm gonna drop old Missy off at the butcher shop.
 And they're going to take
a great big knife...
<i>And Frank went on to traumatize Lily's entire class</i>
with a graphic explanation of where meat comes from..
So not one little scrap of Missy goes to waste.
Ms. Aldrin, please don't let emem eat Missy.
I know, I know.
I already called an animal rescue,
and they're going to come get her on Monday.
Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat
and go to the bathroom?!
Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat?
I-I guess  I'll keep her up on the roof.
Look, call me crazy. I just...
I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea.
And, boy, was I right,because what Missy the Goat
would go on to do in that bathroom was so...
<i>No, you know what?</i>
<i>I'm m getting ahead of myself.</i>
<i>We'll get there.</i>
Hey, Ted.
   You ready to, um...
Where'd the goat turd come from?
How'd you know  that was a goat turd?
Well, it was either that,
or a musk ox turd,
and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?
Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.
Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it.
Talk about what?
Nothing.
How was your day?
Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new?
How does everyone know that's a goat turd?
-Barney told you. -I don't know  what you're talking about,madam.
Marshall,
you can't look me in the eye, you're blushing,
coughing,
and your hands are shaking.
come here.
Ted is never finding out about this, you understand?
Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything.
And don't even think about opening that can
until I'm out of the splash zone.
fantastic, you're here.
Give me the good news.
I'm sorry.
You did too good of a job writing this thing.
It's-it's iron-clad.
No!
Bad lawyer!
I need a loophole!
I want to feel better, Marshall!
I can't keep buying things!
I have six self-cleaning litterboxes
and I don't even have a kid.
Wait. How about this?
Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right?
And if he's broken the Bro Code,
then I'm off the hook.
I thought about that.
And I gotta say,
Ted has upheld this thing time and time again.
For example,  article 87:
"A bro shall at all times say yes."
So he saved you from an avalanche?
Yes.
And he carried you six miles to safety on his broken leg?
Yes.
And you're a pre-op transsexual nightclub singer
who used to be a member of the Russian mob?
Da.
Article 29
"A bro will in a timely manner alert his bro
to the existence of a girl fight."
Dude, two girls are fighting  at MacLaren's.
What?!
Yeah, yeah.
It was crazy. This one girl was like...
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Article 53:
"A bro will, whenever possible,
provide his bro with protection."
That feels nice.
Good.
I just wish we had some wine.
Yeah.
I wish we had  some wine, too.
damn it, Marshall.
I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is!
You're my lawyer!
The answer is in there! Find it!
Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it.
The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong.
And the only way you're ever gonna feel
any better about it is  if you tell Ted what you did.
What if he never wants to talk to me again?
Well, I guess that's just a chance
you're gonna have to take.
Which brings us to April 25, 2008.
My 30th birthday,
or as it would come to be referred to in later years:
The Day of the Goat.
Hey, where are you?
I'm in the limo,  right outside ofeded's office.
Great. Well, everyone's here.
Stella just arrived
and there is something here so awesome,
I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe...
Goat in a party hat?
Damn it!
Well, you still gotta see it.
It's so much fun having a goat at a party!
In a few short hours,
Lily would come to regret those words.
But we'll get there.
Uh, gotta go. Here he comes.
Okay. Bye.
Whoa, you guys went all out.
Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo, five-minute warning!
Everyone get ready!
Oh, Missy, are you excit??
Yes, you are!
Whoa, we're leaving the city.
Where the hell is this party?
Vegas.
Vegas? I thought the party  was on the rooftop.
Surprise!
Just a decoy, my friend.
So there's no roof party?
Oh, no. There is.  We're just not going.
This is how good a friend I am.
They want you to spent your 30th standing around
drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room.
But not me, bro.
I pulled out all the stops.
Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio.
Steaks at BOA,
scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats
to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with,
wait for it...
a grizzly bear!
Take me home, Barney.
No!
We have to go to Vegas.
Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but...
there's something that I have to tell you,
and I wanted you to be
in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it.
You slept with Robin.
Ranjit!
You slept with Robin?
Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!
When did you find out?
Hey, Robin. Come here!
What's up?
I was, uh, just going through some old stuff
-and I... -Oh, crap!
Anyway, uh,
I came across this.
-From my vacacation in Vermont. -Yeah.
I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours.
I slept with Barney!
What?
It was just one time,
it, it was the night that Simon dumped me
and I was in a really vulnerable place
and I, I wand d to just pretend like it never happened,
but I couldn't, and...
I can't.
I just, I had to tell you.
And...
I just hope that we can still be friends.
Of course we can still be friends.
So you're not mad?
Well, I'm...
it's a little weird, but, um,
No, I'm not mad.
So you're not mad?
No, I'm not mad.
I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago.
We've, we've both dated lots of people since then.
I'm with Stella now.
Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.
I'm so relieved to hear you say that.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, hey, I just remembered, um,
my mom is coming into town next month.
Maybe you'd like to nail her, too!
Where are they?! I'm getting a cramp.
Marshall, can we keep the goat?
No.
-But she's so cute and furry and soft. -Yeah,
and she also sheds, eats out of the garbage
and can't control her bobowels.
Why don't we just call Duluth Mental Hospital
and say my Uncle Linus can live with us?
Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea
after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning
you're going to want this thing out of your house.
Oh, you should talk.You slept with Barney.
Marshall!
I'm sorry!
I couldn't take it anymore.
I can't believe  you did that.
That's so gross.
Was it amazing?
What? I...
Lily, I really don't want to talk about this.
I know but it's Barney.
It's just hard not to be curious.
Did he have like devices and stuff?
Lily,come on.
-Hot wax? -Stop it.
Did he tie you to anything?
-That's enough.  -What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.
Is he all smooth down there?
Three billion women on the planet!
Three billion!
And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year!
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?!
Robin?!
You think I'm proud of this?!
I'm horrified that this happened.
How did it happen? Huh?
Barney, I want to know.
Tell me exactly how it happened.
You mean...
what position?
Okay.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it.
-Hit him! Hit him, -Ted! Stop!
-Hit him! -Stop!
-Hit him! -Okay.
Okay. Okay.
You're pissed.
You deserve to be.
Fine. You know what?
One free shot. On me.
Anywhere but the face.
Who punches someone in the groin?
Okay.Okay.
I deserved that.
I deserved that.
But what's important now is...
we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right?
You think that this is just about Robin?
This is about...
You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff.
I mean some really terrible stuff
to a lot of different people.
I just always thought there had to be a limit.
I always thought I was the limit.
You're always spouting off  these rules for bros.
Isn't one of them, "don't do this"?
Yeah. And I broke it.
I'm sorry.
But, Ted...
...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio...
I am not going to Vegas with you!
I'm not going to blow off my friends
and my girlfriend,
and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club.
The fact that you think I would...
You know, Barney,earlier this week
I started putting things in a box
and that box was labeled "stuff I have no use for anymore."
What does that mean?
It means...
maybe you belong in that box.
Are you saying you dnon't want to be bros anymore?
I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.
Okay, I'm going to stop you right there,
because it seems like you're about to say something
that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.
Ranjit, stop the car.
I'm getting a cab.
Surprise!
<i>Oh, right, the goat.</i>
<i>So funny.You're going to love this.</i>
So later in that night, the goat locked himself in the bathroom
and was eating one<i>of Robin's washcloths and</i>
<i>wait, hold on.</i>
Robin wasn't living here<i> on my 30th birthday.</i>
<i>When did this happen?</i>
Oh, wait, the goat was there<i> on my 31st birthday.</i>
Sorry,<i>I totally got that wrong.</i>


<i>Le printemps 2008 fut
trčs compliqué pour votre vieux.</i>
<i>J'avais pas revu Barney depuis
que j'avais appris pour lui et Robin.</i>
Tu veux plus ętre pote avec moi ?
Je dis que je veux plus ętre ton ami.
Mec, sérieux, arręte de m'appeler.
Désolé de pas t'avoir rappelé.
Je t'ai jamais appelé. Tu m'as appelé
15 fois et mes parents 2 fois.
Désolé, faut que je te laisse.
Y a trop de bons copilotes dans le coin.
Ted, tu pleures ?
Non.
Laisse-toi aller.
Bye, Barney.
Vous vous remettez ensemble ?
Barney me manque.
Pas de "tape m'en cinq"
depuis une semaine.
Je crois
que je perds ma cale aux mains.
Dis-moi Ted, pourquoi es-tu plus fâché
aprčs Barney qu'aprčs moi ?
C'est vrai, elle a autant couché
avec lui que lui avec elle.
Tu sais quoi,
je suis pas certaine de ça.
J'aimerais mieux que tu sois fâché
aprčs moi. C'est trop bizarre.
Je suis fâché aprčs personne.
Je t'ai pardonnée,
et j'ai passé l'âge d'ętre ami
avec Barney, c'est tout.
S'il est pas fâché, c'est parce
qu'il est heureux avec Stella.
<i>Elle avait raison.</i>
<i>Je sortais avec Stella depuis 2 mois.</i>
<i>Ça se passait trčs bien.</i>
<i>Elle avait rencontré mes amis
et passé l'épreuve avec succčs.</i>
<i>Il y avait juste un petit souci.</i>
Vous n'avez pas encore couché ensemble ?
Aprčs deux mois de relation
avec Marshall, on le faisait 24 h/24.
Je sais, j'étais dans le lit du dessus.
J'étais assis ŕ côté de vous
aux matchs de foot.
Vous attendez quoi ?
Elle veut ętre sűre
que c'est du sérieux.
Elle m'a pas encore présenté
sa fille non plus.
- Elle veut y aller mollo.
- Attends.
Donc t'as pas fait l'amour depuis...
Thanksgiving ?
Tu sais combien
de jours fériés il y a eu depuis ?
Bébé, tu te souviens du jour de
Martin Luther King ?
Oh que oui,
on lui doit beaucoup ŕ ce type.
Je suis dingue de cette fille.
S'il faut attendre, ça me dérange pas.
Je passe du coq ŕ l'âne,
quelqu'un aurait du chewing-gum,
de la glace ou de l'écorce ŕ mâcher ?
Le dernier La Redoute est arrivé.
La rumeur sur la blogosphčre
dit que tu recherches un copilote.
Je voulais te dire que je suis dispo.
Dis le mot... ou ne le dis pas,
fais juste un signe du sourcil.
C'était ça ?
Le prends pas mal Randy, mais il y a
une longue liste pour le poste.
Le poste,
c'est "Vice président du génial".
Et toi, t'es...
l'assistant de la secrétaire
du "juste OK".
L'assistant de la secrétaire
du "juste OK"...
Merci, je te décevrai pas !
<i>Donc, oncle Barney commença
ŕ chercher un autre copilote.</i>
Pete ! Barney Stinson.
Je voulais t'appeler, ça fait un bail.
Écoute, tu devrais me rejoindre
au McLarens ce soir.
Tu vas halluciner, je suis ŕ l'hôpital.
Je viens d'avoir une fille.
On dit vers 21 h 30 - 22 h ?
Stapleton ! Barney Stinson.
- Quoi neuf, boss ?
- Me faut un nouveau pote, ça te dit ?
Mec, j'aimerais bien,
mais je suis pote avec Doug Stein.
Je comprends.
C'est un bon pote.
Heureux pour toi, tous mes vśux.
Willie le barje, c'est Barney !
Quoi de neuf, B-Dog ? Ça fait un bail.
On se fait un truc ce soir ?
Oui, enfin.
Alors, voilŕ le délire.
Ma femme et moi
mettons le couvert ŕ 19 h,
Scrabble ŕ 20 h,
ŕ 21 h on regarde <i>27 Robes</i>,
ŕ 23 h tout le monde est chez soi.
Te raccrocher au nez une fois
n'était pas suffisant.
Donc je découpe ce truc
sur le dos de ce type.
Honnętement, je sais pas ce que c'était.
Ça a explosé comme un volcan.
Y avait du pus partout.
Faisons l'amour, maintenant !
Je ferme la porte.
Y a pas de serrure.
On peut le faire contre la porte,
ce sera chaud !
Ça sera comme une partie ŕ 3,
toi, moi et la porte.
Oui, mais aprčs ce sera bizarre
entre la porte et moi, demain.
Pardon. On va attendre. C'est cool.
T'es si patient, Ted.
Mais ŕ vrai dire, je suis nerveuse.
Je dois me confier.
C'est ce que je redoutais, t'as 14 ans.
C'est gęnant, mais ça fait un moment
que j'ai pas été intime avec quelqu'un.
C'est marrant que tu dises ça.
- Moi aussi.
- Ah bon ?
Depuis combien de temps ?
Un moment.
Dis-moi.
Pareil.
Ça fait 5 mois pour toi aussi ?
5 ans !
The legen... dary Team

Stella n'a pas fait l'amour depuis 2003.
Mettons ça dans son contexte.
La derničre fois qu'elle l'a fait,
le film <i>Sea Biscuit</i> galopait
dans les salles de ciné
et dans nos cśurs.
5 ans...
Si je le faisais pas pendant un an,
je serais dans la rue
ŕ me vendre pour 10 centimes.
La derničre fois qu'elle l'a fait,
le monde apprenait ŕ peine
ŕ propos du S.A.R.S.
Ted, qu'a-t-elle dit d'autre ?
Elle t'a donné d'autres explications ?
Aprčs la naissance de Lucy,
je suis sortie un peu,
mais c'était dur de trouver
quelqu'un de confiance.
Tôt ou tard, chacun d'entre eux
m'a prouvé qu'il n'en était pas digne.
Attends, personne en 5 ans ?
Les mecs regrettent les filles
avec qui ils n'ont pas couché.
Les filles regrettent
d'avoir couché avec les mecs.
Ces 5 derničres années,
j'ai pas eu de regrets.
Tu fixes mes seins.
Pour ma défense,
ils m'ont fixé en premier.
Ça veut dire quoi pour toi ?
Elle compte coucher un jour ou pas ?
En fait...
Pour tout te dire,
j'en ai vraiment envie avec toi.
Je pense pas du tout
que je le regretterai.
Tes discussions d'oreiller
sont un peu rouillées.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire,
je suis pręte.
Génial.
Pręte, lŕ tout de suite ?
Donc sa sśur va venir garder Lucy
et on prend une chambre d'hôtel
en ville samedi soir.
La derničre fois qu'elle l'a fait,
Le <i>DaVinci Code</i> venait de sortir.
Ça me semble pas si ancien ?
Pas le film... le livre.
Ça met la pression.
Pas du tout.
Cette fille est en manque,
quoi que tu fasses, elle va adorer.
Je me souviens
de ma plus longue disette.
C'est l'été que j'ai passé
ŕ San Francisco.
Ça faisait 2 mois et 19 jours
que j'avais pas été avec Marshall.
Je sais pas Lily, aprčs 5 ans elle va
s'attendre ŕ quelque chose d'énorme.
Décčs notables en 2003 :
Mon Dieu.
Nell Carter.
Vous saviez
que Nell Carter était morte ?
Je vais devoir sortir
le grand jeu pour la satisfaire.
Ça va ętre dur, elle est morte.
Pas Nell Carter, Stella.
Relax mec,
suffit juste de tempérer ses espérances.
Tu sais pourquoi j'ai tant détesté
<i>Jerry McGuire</i> ?
Parce que t'es mort ŕ l'intérieur ?
Parce que t'en as parlé
pendant 2 semaines,
"Le meilleur film de tous les temps".
Fais le contraire avec Stella,
rabaisse ses espérances.
D'accord, comme ça
quoiqu'il arrive elle sera contente.
Je suis marié, Barney,
je peux pas ętre ton copilote.
Randy, tu peux venir une seconde ?
Bonne nouvelle.
Je t'appelle en ligue supérieure.
Ŕ partir de demain soir,
veux-tu ętre mon nouveau copilote ?
Laisse-moi voir mon calendrier,
je reviens.
Ça marche pour demain.
J'ai un hors-d'śuvre surprise
pour nous aujourd'hui. Regarde.
Des patates gratinées !
- Sympa.
- N'est-ce pas ?
Ça fait un bail que j'en ai pas mangé.
Je m'en souviens comme
le meilleur truc que j'ai jamais mangé.
C'est surprenant.
- Quoi ?
- Les patates.
C'est bon... mais pas autant
que dans mon souvenir.
Męme si ces patates gratinées
sont vraiment bonnes
et ont une taille
tout ŕ fait raisonnable,
je peux pas les apprécier
ŕ cause de mes attentes irréalistes.
Ted, je vois oů tu veux en venir.
Tu essayes de rabaisser
mes attentes pour ce soir.
C'est un problčme de taille ?
La gâchette facile ?
Nombre de testicules anormal ?
C'est que, c'est important pour toi.
C'est genre <i>Ta Virginité, le Retour</i>.
Virginité II : Electric Boogaloo.
C'est ça ! Je veux pas tout ruiner.
Je veux pas que tu te demandes
si j'en valais le coup.
Ted, bien sűr
que ça va valoir le coup.
T'en fais pas.
C'est toi et moi,
y a déjŕ tout ce qu'il faut.
Nombre de testicules anormal ?
Ça arrive.
Y avait un type ŕ l'école de médecine,
on disait qu'il était ŕ une balle
de gagner la base.
Ça gaze, Bro-seph Lieberman ?
On n'utilise jamais le mot
"pote" en parlant
d'un candidat démocrate ŕ la
vice-présidence raté.
Bye bye, Geraldine Ferrar-bro.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je suis excité par tout ça.
Tu seras mon prochain chef-d'śuvre.
C'est comme Ted, quand je l'ai connu,
c'était encore plus un raté que toi.
Quel raté !
Mais ce soir,
je vais faire de toi
le meilleur copilote
de l'histoire des copilotes.
Ça va ętre plus facile
que t'imagines, mon pote.
Je lis ton blog depuis des années,
t'es un dieu pour moi.
C'est pourquoi ce soir,
ça va ętre légendaire...
attends...
...daire.
OK, Randy, allons-y.
- T'es pręt ?
- Oui.
C'est quoi le problčme ?
Rien.
Allons-y.
Non, non, s'il te plaît, attends.
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Je transpire la drague.
C'est ce que je fais. OK, allons-y.
Randy, écoute-moi.
Tu peux le faire, OK ?
Je sais pas,
ces filles sont si belles que ça ?
Ouais elles le sont, allons-y !
OK.
Mesdemoiselles, vous connaissez...
Alors, voilŕ le plan.
On prend une calčche ŕ travers le parc
et la philharmonique joue ŕ...
5 ans.
- Direct ŕ l'hôtel ?
- Direct.
Je prends mon sac.
- Salut !
- Salut. Alors,
impatiente ?
C'est clair, ça fait si longtemps
que je suis pas sortie.
Oui, on a appris.
J'aurais explosé si j'étais pas sortie
depuis si longtemps.
Parfois, elle me réveille
ŕ 4 h du mat' juste pour "sortir".
Vous parlez de quoi ?
De rien... de pizza.
Tu pensais ŕ quoi ?
Salut.
Ted, tu leur as dit.
Dit quoi ?
Tu leur as dit que j'avais
pas fait l'amour depuis 5 ans.
T'as pas fait l'amour depuis 5 ans ?
C'est une révélation incroyable
que l'on n'apprend que maintenant !
Stella, je suis désolé,
j'aurais pas dű leur dire.
C'est mes meilleurs amis, je leur dis
tout, j'ai męme pas réfléchi.
Ted, c'était si personnel.
Tes amis me prennent
pour une dingue.
Non.
Je sais que c'est bizarre, peu de gens
passent 5 ans sans faire l'amour.
- 13 ans ?
- J'ai été au top trčs jeune.
C'était difficile ŕ dire,
mais je pensais
pouvoir te faire confiance.
Tu peux.
Non, ŕ l'évidence.
Il y a toujours une raison
de ne pas coucher avec un type et...
voilŕ la tienne.
Je t'ai donné une raison
ou tu en cherchais une ?
Pourquoi j'en chercherais une ?
Parce que ça devient sérieux.
Et ça te fait peur.
Bonne nuit, Ted.
Dis-moi, sans regarder dans ta main,
quelles sont les 3 techniques
de débutants pour ramasser des filles ?
L'isoler de ses amies.
Répéter son nom dans la conversation.
- La rabaisser subtilement.
- Excellent !
Bon,
on passe ŕ la pratique.
Je suis juste derričre toi.
Bonjour, je m'appelle Randy.
Et toi ?
- Haley.
- Haley ?
Haley, c'est un joli nom, Haley.
Viens lŕ, Haley.
Haley, tu es une immonde grosse pétasse.
Désolé, Barney.
Non, t'as reçu un verre,
ça m'arrive tout le temps.
Bientôt, tu sauras anticiper,
et comme ça :
boisson ŕ l'oeil.
En voilŕ deux pour le prix d'une.
Nouveau plan, suis moi.
Bonsoir, mesdames.
J'aime bien ta broche.
C'est quoi ?
Un koala.
Je les trouve adorables.
C'est pas vrai !
Mon ami Randy est l'expert en chef
sur les koalas en Australie.
Il est ici pour bosser
avec le zoo du Bronx.
C'est vrai ?
C'est trop cool.
Qu'est-ce que tu préfčres
chez les koalas ?
Leur...
viande est délicieuse.
- Désolé, Barney.
- C'est bon.
Nouveau plan.
Tu dois apprendre ŕ parler aux femmes
sans ętre mal ŕ l'aise.
Ne sois pas nerveux. Mon amie
Robin est d'accord pour nous aider.
Tu as menacé de mettre
une vidéo de nous sur le net.
Je suis męme pas convaincue
que tu l'as.
Ce qui explique pourquoi tu es venue
de Brooklyn en pleine nuit.
Bon, Randy.
Restons simples.
Commence par te présenter.
- Bonjour, je m'appelle Randy.
- Bonjour, Randy.
- Comment vas-tu ?
- Bien et toi ?
- Bien, merci.
- Super, tu te débrouilles trčs bien.
Demande-lui ce qu'elle fait plus tard.
Que fais-tu plus tard ?
Tu saignes du nez, c'est un déluge.
Ça arrive ŕ chaque fois
que j'ai une érection, désolé.
OK, nouveau plan.
On lui entoure la tęte de gazes
pour qu'il ne saigne pas ni ne parle.
Tu es la femme...
Pourquoi es-tu si désespéré ?
Je suis un copilote, c'est mon boulot.
Est-il possible
que tu cherches ŕ compenser
la perte de Ted en te précipitant
sur un nouveau copilote ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
- Je dis que Randy est une consolation.
Non, c'est de la folie.
Randy et moi, c'est pour de vrai.
Non, et męme si t'arrives
ŕ ce que Randy baise ce soir,
est-ce que ce sera aussi bien
qu'avec Ted ?
Il était tellement heureux
le lendemain, tu sais ?
Bon, ça s'arręte pas, mais je crois
que ça repart en arričre maintenant.
J'ai réfléchi,
ça marche pas.
Oui, je m'en suis rendu compte.
Je savais que je pouvais pas voler
si prčs du soleil sans me brűler.
C'est l'histoire de ma vie.
Je laisse toujours tomber les gens.
Toi, mon pčre, le chef.
Le chef ?
Ouais, j'ai été flic pendant 3 mois.
J'ai été viré, j'étais tellement nul
que je pesais sur le budget assurance.
Tu as été policier ŕ New York
et tu m'as rien dit ?
T'as déjŕ tiré sur quelqu'un ?
- Tout le temps.
- Mais pas sur lui.
- Et pas dans le pied.
- En fait...
Y a rien de plus sexy qu'un flic.
Ça va ? Tu saignes du nez.
Une ancienne blessure.
La balle est toujours dans son sinus.
Mon Dieu. Tu sais quoi,
j'habite juste au coin,
je peux t'emmener chez moi
et m'occuper de toi ?
Ce serait trčs gentil.
Passez un bon moment.
Je suis le plus grand copilote
de tous les temps.
Ted ne sait pas ce qu'il rate.
Il fallait que tu parles de Ted, hein ?
J'ai vraiment exagéré hier soir,
je suis désolée.
J'ai peut-ętre des problčmes
avec la confiance,
mais crois-moi, j'ai mes raisons.
Tu as dit que je cherchais une raison
pour tout gâcher.
Eh bien, tu m'as mise ŕ jour.
C'est un truc que je fais beaucoup.
Je ne vais pas le faire avec toi.
J'en suis.
C'est gęnant, je suis avec une nana, lŕ.
Allez.
Je suis pręte ŕ faire un truc avec toi.
Ted, voici Lucy.
- Salut, Lucy.
- Lucy, c'est Ted.
<i>Stella et moi pensions
franchir un cap ce week-end.</i>
<i>Il s'avéra
que le cap était encore plus important.</i>
- Elle s'est endormie.
- Elle est super.
Je trouve aussi.
Ma sśur est en ville jusqu'ŕ demain.
Il y a un motel en bas de l'autoroute.
C'était incroyable.
Tu fais quoi ?
Faut que je raconte ça
ŕ Marshall et Lily.
Now kids,
the spring of 2008 was complicated time in you old man's life.
The last time I had seen Barney
was shortly after I found out he has spent night with Robbin.
Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore?
I'm saying I don't wanna be friends anymore.
It's Barney.
Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.
Ted I'm sorry, I haven't returned your calls.
Yeah I never called you,
you called me fifteen times and my parents twice.
I'm sorry, I gotta let you go.
It's just too many good wingmen out there.
Ted, are you crying?
No, I am not.
Sh....let it out, let it out.
Goodbye Barney.
-So are you two back together?  -No.
I miss Barney.
I haven't "high five" with anyone like a week.
I think I might be starting to lose my fist bone careless.
Let me asking you something Ted.
Why are you so much madder at Barney than me.
Yeah, She had just as much sex with barney
as barney had with her.
You know what? I'm not sure that's true.
I think I actually prefered if you are mad at me.
This is too wierd.
I'm not mad at anybody. I've forgiven you.
And I've outgrown Barney as a friend. That's simple.
I will tell you why he is not mad.
Because he is so happy with stella.
She was right.
Stella and I had been dating for two months.
And things were going really well.
She had mat my friends in past for flying colors.
There was just one little problem.
You guys haven't had sex yet?!
When marshall and I were two months.
We were doing it 24/7.
I know. I was in the top bunk.
Also sat next to you at football games.
So what you guys waiting for?
I... She wants to make sure we are serious first,
that's why she hasn't introduced me to her daughter either.
She wants to take things slow.
Wait, So you haven't had sex since like Thanks Giving.
Do you know how many big federal holidays
have come and gone since then.
Oh, baby, Do you remember Martin Luther King Day
Yeah, I do. We ode that dude big time.
Look, I'm crazy about this girl, if waiting is what it takes,
I'm fine with that.
And totally unrelated note.
Does anybody have gamma icer
or a piece of bark that you are not chewing.
Hey Barney, new sky mall came in.
So Worldaround blog's fear is
you are looking for a new wingman.
I wanna let you know, I am available.
Just say the word, or don't even say the word.
Just do something with your eyebrow.
Was that it?
No offence Randy,
but there is long list of candidates for this slot.
The slot is vice president of awosome.
And you are like assistant under secretary of only ok.
Assistant under secretary of only ok
Thank you, I will not let you down.
So uncle Barney began to search for a new wingman.
-Pitt, Barney Stinson. -Hey
I haven't been calling you, It has been a while.
Yeah yeah, so listen,
you should meet me in mclaren tonight.
You never gonna believe this. I'm at the hospital.
Just had a baby daughter.
So What do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock.
Starry Porten, Barney stinson.
What up, chef.
I need a new bro, what do you say?
Dude, I'd love to, But now I'm bro with Duck Stan.
Oh, I understand.
Duck Stan is a good bro.
I'm happy for you. Best of luck.
Crazy Willie. Barney Stinson.
What up B dog, long time no bro,
so are we gonna tire it up tonight or what?
Yes Finally.
Here is what on the rocket tocket.
My wife is gonna put cheese out at seven.
9pm we watch 27 dresses.
Everybody is home by 11:00. Booya.
-Hello  -Hanging up on you once wasn't enough.
So I lanced this thing  on this guy's back,
and I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know what it was,
and then it exploded like a volcano.
Pus everywhere.
Let's have sex.
Right now.I'll lock the door.
Oh, there's no lock on that door.
We can do it against the door.It'll be hot!
It'll be like a three-way: you, me, and the door.
Yeah, but then it's just gonna be weird
between me and the door tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
We're waiting. It's cool.
 You've been so patient, Ted.
The truth is...
I'm kind of nervous.
 I have a confession to make.
 I was afraid of this.
You're 14.
 No, um...
It's kind of embarrassing,but it's been a while
since I was intimate with anyone.
Wow, it's funny that you say that.
Me, too.
Really?
How long's it been for you?
It's been a while.
Tell me.
Me, too!
 It's been five months  for you, too?
Five years?!


Wow.
Stella hasn't had  sex since 2003.
Let's put this in context.
The last time Stella had sex,the movie, <i>Seabiscuit,</i>
had just galloped into theaters... and our hearts.
Five years?
 God, if I even went <i>one</i> year,
I would be out on the street selling it for a nickel.
The last time Stella had sex,
the world was just learning about SARS.
Well, Ted, what else did she say?
Did she give you any kind of explanation?
Look, after Lucy was born,I dated a little,
 but it was hard to find a guy  I could trust enough.
Sooner or later, every one of them
gave me a reason not to.
  But nobody in five years?
Look, Ted, guys regret the girls they didn't sleep with.
Girls regret the guys  they <i>do</i> sleep with.
And for the past  five years,
 I've had no regrets.
Ted, you're staring at my boobs.
In my defense,   they were staring at me.
So what does this mean for you?
Is she ever gonna want to get intimate?
 Actually...
But the truth is,I really do
want to do this with you.
 I don't think  I'd regret it at all.
 Your pillow talk's a little rusty.
You know what I mean, Ted. I'm ready.
 That's great.
Like, "right now" ready?
 So her sister's driving up   to baby-sit Lucy,
and we're getting a hotel room  in the city Saturday night.
The last time  Stella had sex,
<i>The Da Vinci Code</i>  had just come out.
Well, that doesn't seem  like that long ago.
Not the movie, the book.
 Wow.
It's a lot of pressure,   isn't it?
You know what? It's not.
This woman needs it bad.
Anything you do is going to be fireworks.
I remember my longest drought...
  <i>It was that summer I lived</i>   <i>in San Francisco.</i>
 <i>I hadn't had been with Marshall</i>   <i>in two months and 19 days.</i>
Oh, San Francisco.
I don't know, Lily,after five years,
her expectations  have gotta be pretty high.
 Notable deaths  in 2003...
Oh, my God...   Nell Carter.
Did you guys know  that Nell Carter had died?
I'm really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman.
 Yeah, it'll be pretty hard  now that she's dead.
Not Nell Carter-- Stella.
Dude, relax.
It's all about expectations management.
Do you know why I hated <i>Jerry Maguire</i> so much?
 Because you're dead inside?
No, because you built it up for, like, two weeks,
  saying it was the greatest movie ever.
With Stella, do the opposite:  lower expectations.
Right, right, and then no matter what happens,
she'll be happy
 Hey, buddy.
I'm married, Barney.I cannot be your new wingman.
No.
Hey, Randy.
Could you come in here for a minute?
 Good news.
 I'm calling you up to the majors.
Starting tomorrow night,
 how would you like  to be my new wingman?
Uh...
Just need to check my calendar. Be right back.
Tomorrow works.
I have a surprise appetizer for us today.
Check it out.
Potato skins.
Fancy.
Yeah, right?
God, it's been forever since I had potato skins.
I remember them as being
 pretty much the most delicious things ever.
Huh.
That's surprising.
What?
This potato skin.
It's good
but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head.
Even though this potato skin performed admirably,
and is a totally respectable size...
I couldn't enjoy it
because of my own unrealistic expectations.
Hmm, Ted, I see  what you're doing.
You're trying to lower
 my expectations for tonight.
-Is this a length thing?  -No.
-Quick on the draw?  -No.
-Unexpected number of testicles?  -No!
It's just that this is a big deal for you.
I mean, it's like your virginity: the sequel.
Virginity 2: Electric Boogaloo?
Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up.
I don't want you to ever wonder if I was worth it.
Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it.
Stop worrying.
It's you and me.
It already has everything it needs.
"Unexpected number of testicles?"
It happens. I knew a guy in med school...
We used to joke that he was one ball away from getting walked.
Hey.
What up, Bro-seph Lieberman?
No, uh-uh.
Randy, we never use  the word "bro" in the name
of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.
Good-bye, "Geraldine Ferrar-bro."
You know what?
I'm excited  about this, Randy.
You will be my next masterpiece.
It's like with Ted.
 When I first met him,
he was an even bigger loser than you.
What a loser.
But tonight, I am going  to make you
the greatest wingman  in the history of wingmen.
Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro.
Yeah, I've been reading  your blog for years.
  You are like a god to me.
That's why tonight is going to be legendary...
wait for it...
dary.
Okay, Randy, let's do this.
Okay.
You ready?
Yes.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
What? What's  the matter?
Nothing.
Let's do this.
No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please.
Just wait. Just wait. Just wait. Just wait!
Randy, what are  you doing?
Dripping with game,that's what I'm doing.
Okay, let's go. No. Let's...
Yes. No!
Randy, listen to me: you can do this, okay?
Oh, I don't know. Are those girls really that hot?
Yeah, they're hot. Let's do this.
Okay!
Hey, ladies.
Have you met...
-Hey. -Hey!
So, here's the plan.
Take a horse-drawn carriage through the park,
and it just so happens
-the Philharmonic is playing  an open-air... -Ted.
Five years.
-Straight to the hotel? -Straight to the hotel.
I'll get my bag.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
So, uh, looking forward to tonight?
Yeah. Definitely.
It's been such a long time since I've had a night out.
Yeah, we heard.
I would explode if it had been that long
since I had a "night out."
This one wakes me up at 4 am sometimes
just to have a little "night out."
Um, what are you guys talking about?
Nothing.
Pizza.
What are you talking about?
Hey, guys.
Ted, you told them,  didn't you?
Told them what?
You told them
that I haven't had  sex in five years.
You haven't had sex in five years?!
That is a shocking revelation
that we're just finding out right now!
Stella, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have told them.
But they're my best friends. I tell them everything.
I-I didn't even think about it.
Ted, that was so personal.
Plus, now your friends  think I'm a freak.
No, they don't.
Look, I realize it's weird, okay?
Not many people go five years without having sex.
13 years?!
I peaked really young.
That's why it was difficult  for me to tell you.
But I did tell you because I thought that I could trust you.
You can trust me.
Obviously, I can't.
You know, there's always a reason not to sleep with a guy,
and you just gave me yours.
Wait, did I give you a reason,
or were you looking for one?
Why would be looking for one?
 Because things are getting  serious between us,
and that scares you.
Good night, Ted.
Okay, Randy, now,
tell me, without looking at your hand,
are the three beginner techniques
for picking up a woman at a bar?
Isolate her from her friends;
repeat her name in conversation;
subtly put her down.
Excellent.
 Now...
let's put those to use.
  I'm right  behind you.
Hi, I'm Randy.
What's your name?
Haley.
Haley.
Haley, that's a pretty name, Haley.
Haley...
come here, Haley.
Um... okay.
Haley, you are a fat ugly whore.
I'm sorry, Barney.
Eh, so you got a drink thrown in your face.
Happens to me all the time.
Pretty soon you'll be  able to anticipate it,
and when you do?  Free drink.
We got two live ones.
New plan: this time follow my lead.
Evening, ladies.
Oh, I like your broach.
What is that?
Oh, it's a koala bear.
I think they're adorable.
No way!
My friend randy here is the leading expert
On koala bears in australia!
He's in town working with the bronx zoo.
You are?
That is so Cool!
Okay, what is your favorite thing about koala bears?
Their...
Meat is delicious.
I'm sorry, barney.
Ah, it's okay.
New plan: We need to get you comfortable
Just saying words to women.
Now, there's no reason to be nervous,
Because my friend, robin, has agreed to help out.
Because you threatened to put a video of us on the internet,
Which I'm still not convinced you have.
Right, which is why you came all the way
From brooklyn at midnight.
Now randy,
Let's keep it Simple.
Just start by introducing Yourself.
Hi.
My name's randy.
Hi, randy.
How are you?
I'm good. how are you?
-Good, thank you. -great.
You're doing really, really well.
Now ask her what she's doing later.
What are you doing later?
Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet.
Oh, god.
This happens every time I get an erection.
I am so sorry.
Okay.
Okay, new plan.
We wrap his face in gauze  so he can't bleed or talk.
You are the woman...
Barney, why are you so desperate to have this happen?
I'm a wingman.
That's what wingmen do.
Is it possible
That you're trying to fill the void of losing ted
By rushing into a new wingman relationship?
What are you saying?
I'm saying that randy is your rebound bro.
No.
That's crazy.
What randy and I have is real.
No, it's not, barney.
And even if you got randy laid tonight,
Would it feel anywhere near as meaningful
As when you got ted laid?
He was just so happy the next morning, you know?
I know.
All right.
It hasn't clotted,
But I think it's pretty much draining backwards now.
Randy.
I've been thinking,
Is isn't working out.
Yeah, I figured.
I knew I couldn't fly this close to the sun
Without getting burned.
This is the story of my life.
I always let people down.
You, my dad, the chief.
The chief?
Yeah, I was a cop for like three months.
But I got kicked off the force
Because I screwed up so much I was an insurance liability.
You were a new york city police officer
And you didn't tell me?
Did you ever shoot anybody?
Only all the time.
But not himself.
And not in the foot.
-Actually...   -ah, bah, bah,   bah, bah.
But nothing.
I don't think there's anything hotter than a cop.
Are you okay?
Your nose is bleeding.
Uh, old injury.
The bullet's still lodged in his sinus.
Oh, my god!
You know what?
I live right around the corner.
Can I take you to my place
And fix you up?
That would be very nice.
Have a great time, you two.
Oh, my god, thank you.   I can't thank you enough.
I am the greatest wingman of all time.
Ted doesn't know what he's missing.
You had to mention ted,  didn't you?
Okay, I really overreacted last night.
I'm sorry.
Maybe I have some trust issues,
But believe me, I have earned them.
You said that I was looking for a reason
For this whole thing to fall apart.
Well, you're onto me, ted.
That's actually something that I do a lot.
But I'm not going to do that with you.
Ted... I'm in.
This is awkward.
I have a girl here.
So...
Come on.
There is something that I'm ready to do with you.
Ted, this Lucy.
-Hi, lucy.  -lucy, this is ted.
Stella and I thought our relationship
Was going to take a big step that weekend.
turned out. it even took a bigger one
She's sound asleep.  oh.
She is so great.
I think so.
So, uh, I was thinking,
My sister is in town until tomorrow.
And, uh, there's a motel just down the turnpike.
-Wow, that was amazing!  -oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
I gonna call Marshall and Lily tell them about this


<i>Au printemps 2008, il se passa
un truc bizarre avec l'oncle Barney.</i>
<i>Il draguait avec succès.</i>
Je lui ai jeté la bouteille d'oxygène
dans la gueule.
J'ai tiré sur la bouteille et boum,
plus de requin.
M. Holl et moi
sommes revenus à la nage.
Je vais te chercher un autre verre.
<i>Il ne s'absentait qu'un instant,</i>
<i>mais à son retour...</i>
Où en étions-nous ?
<i>... il se faisait gifler.</i>
<i>Et ça continuait.</i>
Sale con !
<i>Jusqu'à ce que Lily soit abordée
par une inconnue</i>
<i>qui lui conseilla
de rester éloignée de Barney.</i>
<i>Lorsque ça se produit
à nouveau...</i>
Encore ?
Vraiment ?
Attends.
<i>... Barney sut où chercher.</i>
Pardon !
Est-ce que j'ai couché avec toi
puis t'ai laissé tomber ?
Tu fais quoi vendredi ?
Amy ?
Abby !

<i>Parfois, on peut faire

Un arc-en-ciel, c'est magnifique.
Quel magnifique arc-en-ciel.
Un autre arc-en-ciel ?
C'est magnifique.
<i>Puis, à la 101e fois...</i>
Arrête, non mais sérieux,
t'en as pas marre ?
Bonne journée ?
J'ai crié sur une fillette
pour avoir peint un arc-en-ciel.
Un arc-en-ciel ?
Cette pétasse méritait bien ça.
Je viens de parler à l'entrepreneur.
Apparemment, la réparation du plancher
coûtera plus cher que prévu.
Mais on peut à peine se le permettre.
Ça m'embête de dire ça,
mais tu vas devoir vendre tes trucs.
Marshall, c'est juste un jeu
qu'on joue au lit.
Je parle de tes vêtements,
tes habits de couturiers, etc.
Quoi ?
Pourquoi mes vêtements ?
On peut vendre mes affaires aussi,
mais à mon avis,
ta robe de soirée Marc Jacobs
rapportera plus que mon T-shirt
de bowling "Vive le split".
- Mec.
- Je le vendrai pas.
- J'ai déjà fait le site web.
- Un site web ?
Ça s'appelle "Lily-et-Marshall-
vendent-leurs-affaires.com".
Tu sais ce qui serait mieux
comme nom de site ?
"Un-mec-force-sa-femme-à-porter-un-sac-
poubelle-pour-les-3-ans-à-venir.com".
Ça existe.
Je suis inquiet. Cette femme
porte vraiment un sac poubelle.
Mais ma chère amie,
t'emballerais pas un grand poulet.
Pourquoi essaies-tu
de me pourrir la vie ?
T'as couché avec moi
et tu m'as jamais rappelée.
- Et ?
- C'est tout.
C'est tout ?!
Si je te laisse
saine et sauve dans la rue
avec un transport adéquat pour chez toi,
tu n'as pas à te plaindre.
Mais c'est blessant, OK ?
Et ensuite, Ted, l'amour de ma vie,
est sorti avec ma patronne.
Tu sais ce que ça fait ?
Pauvre petite Ashley.
Il y a quelques semaines,
Ted m'a quitté comme copilote.
T'as été amoureuse 2 semaines,
j'ai été son meilleur ami
pendant 7 ans.
- Ted disait que c'était Marshall...
- 7 ans !
Navrée.
Quel idiot ce Ted.
Cette relation sérieuse avec Stella.
- Je déteste Ted.
- Moi plus encore.
- Ça t'excite autant que moi ?
- Probablement pas autant, non.
Désolée d'avoir crié "Ted".
Désolé d'avoir crié "Abby".
Je m'appelle Abby.
C'est débile. Lily a-t-elle déjà porté
la moitié de ces trucs ?
Comme si t'avais porté tous les trucs
qu'il y a dans ton placard.
À vrai dire, oui.
Et les bottes de Cowboy rouges ?
Elles sont super.
Je les ai déjà portées.
Quand je dis :
"Ted ne peut pas les assumer",
- à quoi je fais référence ?
- Ses bottes de Cowboy rouges.
Je peux totalement les assumer,
c'est un style western classique.
OK, petite devinette.
Les westerns classiques qui contiennent
des bottes de Cowboy rouges.
<i>Le Bon, La Brute et la Fabuleuse</i>.
<i>Les Sept Moustachus</i>
<i>Ce Pays N'est Pas Pour Les Hétéros</i>.
Je veux pas vendre mes vêtements...
Je sais, chérie. Viens par là.
C'est 100 % soie ?
Écoute, on a vraiment besoin d'argent.
J'ai des pistes pour un boulot,
mais en attendant,
je sais pas ce qu'on peut faire d'autre.
Je vais vendre mes tableaux.
Quoi ?
Je vais les vendre, les bonnes peintures
à l'huile se vendent dans les 500 $.
Carrément, mais...
<i>Parfois, on peut faire
les choses bien 100 fois d'affilée.</i>
J'adore, c'est un chef d'œuvre.
C'est bon, on va vendre la télé.
Je veux juste être chez moi
et ne regarder que ça.
Qu'on appelle la police.
Ma femme a volé
un tableau génial au musée.
<i>Mais, à la 101e fois...</i>
Ce genre de prix,
c'est que pour les vraies toiles.
Comment ça ?
C'est juste qu'on a besoin d'argent
tout de suite,
et je suis pas sûr que
la vente de tes toiles fera l'affaire.
Tu ne crois pas en moi.
Quoi ? Non, attends, bien sûr...
Bien sûr que je crois en toi.
Je suis fière de mon travail d'artiste.
Mes toiles sont bonnes,
je suis sûre que Robin
en achèterait une.
Quoi ?
J'aime tes toiles,
mais j'essaie d'être réaliste.
Combien nous manque-t-il pour
finir les travaux ?
Environ 1 500 $.
Si je vends 3 de mes toiles
à 500 chacune,
je garderai mes vêtements.
- On a besoin d'argent rapidement.
- Laisse-moi une semaine.
OK, une semaine.
- D'accord.
- D'accord.
Je
les
assume.
<i>Le premier coup de Lily dans
le Challenge de l'art de 2008</i>
<i>fut d'exposer une de ses toiles
favorites à la galerie d'une amie.</i>
<i>Ça ne se passa pas comme prévu.</i>
<i>Puis, à la dernière minute...</i>
- J'adore.
- Vraiment ?
Votre top. Magnifique.
C'est 100 % soie ?
C'est pas à vendre !
Mes fringues sont pas à vendre !
<i>Le lendemain, Lily emmena ses toiles
à un café exposant des artistes locaux.</i>
Ça fait des heures et personne
n'a même jeté un oeil à mes peintures.
Allez, complimentons-les.
J'adore vraiment cette peinture,
c'est... joli.
Les couleurs sont jolies,
les formes sont jolies.
C'est vraiment très...
joli.
Observe.
Je crois qu'il y a une qualité
dynamique au coup de pinceau,
qui, combinée à la composition fluide
crée une résonance émotionnelle
presque Kandinskienne.
Et tu peux aussi l'apprécier
si t'es pas un con prétentieux.
Précise-moi un truc sur ta critique.
Les couleurs, elles sont jolies ?
Ou plutôt Émilie Jolie ?
Là encore...
Bottes de Cowboy rouges.
Je les assume !
Je les assume !
Tu sais ce que je déteste chez Ted ?
Quoi ?
Sa stupide coiffure.
Sa stupide coiffure géniale.
Elle est si stupide et géniale.
- Tu sais ce que je hais chez Ted ?
- Quoi ?
Son côté "Oh, je veux tomber amoureux
et avoir une vraie relation".
"Je me soucie des gens
avec qui je fais l'amour."
Trop nul.
Il est trop nul et génial.
Tu sais quoi ?
Il devrait voir combien il est horrible
quand il est en couple.
Ouais, et je dois lui montrer
que je l'ai oublié.
Tu penses à ce que je pense ?
Je crois que oui.
Tu penses à faire l'amour avec Ted ?
<i>Après 4 jours sans vendre une toile,
Lily était désespérée.</i>
Peinture à vendre !
500 $ !
Pour permettre le rêve d'une vie !
C'est comme s'ils nous voyaient
même pas.
On est rien pour eux.
Pour quoi t'as besoin d'argent ?
Pour réparer le plancher
de mon nouvel appart.
Et toi ?
Héroïne.
- T'aimes l'héroïne ?
- J'adore.
Si tu vends ton truc, je te prends
ton argent pour aller m'en acheter.
Merci pour ton honnêteté,
M. Chaussettes fou.
- Je le vendrai jamais.
- C'est pas génial.
<i>Et alors qu'elle allait perdre
tout espoir...</i>
<i>quelque chose de dingue arriva.</i>
Mon Dieu !
500 $ ! C'est qui la vraie
peintre maintenant, Marshall.
J'ai jamais dit
que t'étais pas une vraie peintre.
Je sais, bébé.
Et maintenant que je suis
une artiste pro,
je vais te dessiner
un original Aldrin.
Pour te remercier d'être
un mari si soutenant.
Je pense l'appeler...
Dans Ta Face !
Lily, sérieux.
Je suis fier de toi !
Qui l'a achetée ?
C'est le meilleur :
un couple gay sans enfant.
Des queers !
Sérieux, des queers ?
Ouais. Ils sont le cœur et l'âme
de la communauté des amateurs d'art.
Tu sais quoi ? Tu devrais les appeler
et leur offrir une toile s'ils font une
soirée art privée avec tous leurs amis.
C'est une idée géniale,
je vais les appeler.
Je peux peut-être vendre
2 autres toiles avant la date limite.
Au fait Marshall, j'avais un truc
à te dire. C'était quoi déjà ?
Ah oui.
Dans Ta Face !!
Sympa de vous croiser ici.
Vous connaissez ma copine, Abby ?
Vous sortez ensemble ?
C'est bien ça.
J'en ai fini avec ce truc d'être génial.
Maintenant,
c'est marché fermier, randonnées
et bermudas kaki,
n'est-ce pas bébé ?
C'est ça !
Les copines, ça craint !
À part moi. Tu me manques Ted.
Abby et moi, on est amoureux.
Pas l'amour chaud et passionné.
L'amour des couples.
Tu sais, soirée cinéma avec ma copine.
Puis attendre qu'elle se couche
pour voler un instant
pitoyable d'extase futile
à la lumière blafarde
de mon écran d'ordinateur.
On montre à Ted combien il est nul.
T'as pas besoin de le dire.
Arrête.
Arrêter quoi, Ted ?
Arrêter d'être amoureux ?
Après il nous demandera
d'arrêter de respirer.
On peut pas s'arrêter de respirer, Ted.
Ta coiffure est géniale.
Barney, je vois bien ce que tu fais.
Arrête.
Pas avant de partager avec toi
où mène la vie de couple.
Bébé en sucre.
Je suis si pathétiquement
amoureux de toi,
que...
bordel, allez je le dis.
- Veux-tu être ma femme ?
- Attends, sérieux ?
Je ne rigole jamais avec l'amour.
Oui, je le veux !
Merci.
Je dois appeler ma mère.
Ça, c'est toi.
- Abby sait pas que tu plaisantes.
- Bien sûr que si.
C'est enfin arrivé, maman !
J'aurais aimé que papa soit en vie
pour m'accompagner à l'église.
Totalement impliquée dans le sketch.
Oui, Lily Aldrin, je vous ai vendu
une toile aujourd'hui.
- Salut, mon chou.
- Vous semblez content.
Tu rigoles, on vient
de sortir le champagne.
Je voulais vous offrir
une chance exclusive
de voir mes autres peintures.
Oh, mon chou...
ma petite, j'aurais dû te le dire.
On l'a juste acheté pour le cadre.
Quoi ?
C'est un original Anton Kreutzer,
un cadre très rare du début du siècle.
Alors,
vous n'avez pas aimé ma peinture ?
Oh, mon chou, non, pas du tout.
Mais bon, continuez.
Si vous n'en voulez pas,
puis-je la récupérer ?
Non, on ne l'a plus.
Où est-elle ?
Je vois.
Il a jeté ma peinture.
Champagne pour tous.
C'est ma tournée.
Je suis l'homme
le plus heureux au monde.
Boisson au gingembre, c'est un sketch.
Super ! Mon rêve
de devenir une artiste est mort
et je regarde ma garde-robe disparaître.
Au revoir, ma robe préférée.
- Elle signifie beaucoup pour moi.
- Vraiment ?
Elle date du printemps 2004,
j'avais eu des temps difficiles.
Wahou !
J'ai eu un long wahou avec cette robe.
Un long wahou.
C'est le rêve.
Maintenant, elle appartient à...
canadagirl@metronewsone.com.
Ça reste dans la famille.
Lily ! Tu vas pas le croire.
- Un truc incroyable !
- Quoi ?
Je suis allé à l'appart des queers.
Pourquoi ?
Je me sentais coupable.
Ces enchères sont mon idée et te voilà
coincée ici pendant que des vautours
se déchirent sans pitié,
pour un bout de ta garde-robe.
Ça reste dans la famille.
Et surtout,
j'aime vraiment cette peinture.
Je supportais pas
qu'elle soit dans une poubelle.
Et ?
Eh bien, bonjour.
Lawrence, je suis là pour la peinture
que ma femme vous a vendue.
Celle dans le beau cadre.
En parlant de beau cadre.
Vous êtes bien grand.
Et vous êtes marié avec
cette petite chose, comment ça marche ?
J'aimerais le découvrir.
On a compris, les homos t'aiment bien.
Lily, ils m'adorent.
C'est pas l'important.
Voilà l'important.
Puisque vous êtes clairement un homme
au goût et au style impeccables,
je suis venu vous demander...
Que pensez-vous des bottes ?
Walter !
Les bottes.
Assumez-les !
J'attends dans le taxi.
Approuvé par les queers.
La peinture !
Ils m'ont dit qu'ils l'avaient jetée
dans la benne de l'immeuble.
Elle y était pas, mais le concierge
m'a dit avoir vu le Dr Greer
un vétérinaire qui bosse là,
retirer la peinture de là.
Dr Greer ?
C'est qui ?
Pourquoi a-t-il pris ma peinture ?
Tu vas le découvrir.
Je devais sortir les poubelles.
J'avais beaucoup châtré.
Pas besoin des détails.
C'est pas ce que vous croyez.
Essentiellement des testicules de chien.
J'ai remarqué votre peinture
et je me suis dit :
Une peinture gratuite.
Je l'ai prise
et accrochée en salle d'examen 3.
Et un truc très étrange est arrivé.
Salut, Muffin.
Il se rappelle
de notre dernière rencontre.
Emmenez-le en salle 3,
je vous y retrouve.
J'y suis allé,
m'attendant au pire.
J'avais jamais vu Muffin aussi calme.
Et un peu plus tard,
ce fut la même chose avec Tidbit.
Puis avec King Larry.
Et avec les triplés Weinstein.
Votre art parle à la sensibilité canine
d'un point de vue primaire.
Les chiens aiment ma peinture ?
Vous savez qui déteste ?
Les oiseaux.
Un perroquet l'a regardé tout à l'heure,
il a réussi à ouvrir sa cage
et s'est jeté dans le ventilo.
Bref,
j'ai convaincu le docteur
d'en acheter 4 de plus.
- Vraiment ?
- À 500 $ pièce.
Ça fait 2 000 $,
c'est plus que nécessaire.
Je me disais qu'on pourrait réinvestir.
- Dans quoi ?
- En toi.
<i>Marshall expliqua
qu'il lançait un nouveau site web</i>
<i>pour vendre le travail de Lily
aux vétérinaires.</i>
C'est pas la clientèle
que j'espérais, mais...
Merci de croire en moi.
Les oiseaux ne te comprennent pas.
- Salut, chéri.
- J'ai pas laissé ma cravate ici ?
Je suis en mode préparatif.
Stressville. Population : moi.
Pour le gâteau, on prend
Fudgie la Baleine ou Cookie Puss ?
C'était un sketch.
On faisait un sketch.
Pour la date, je pensais à la fête
du travail. Je voulais le 4 juillet.
Mais je ne veux pas
voler la vedette aux USA.
Abby, j'ai une mauvaise nouvelle.
- Je peux pas t'épouser.
- Quoi ?
Ted m'a supplié.
Je crois qu'il t'aime.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui, notre plan a marché.
Mieux que rêvé.
Va le voir.
Voici son adresse,
mais il travaille tard,
n'y va pas avant 2 ou 3 h du matin.
Oh, mon Dieu. Merci.
Mais je ne peux pas garder ça, alors.
Ne t'inquiète pas pour ça.
C'est un bonbon.
À plus.
Visitez notre site.
Il y a une enchère au profit
des hôpitaux pédiatriques de L.A.
Il y a des tas de trucs de la série
et c'est pour une bonne cause.
Merci.
kids,in the spring of 2008 something kind of strange
have been happening to your uncle Barney.
he's been doing great with a woman.
So I threw the pressure air oxygen into its mouth.
I shoot the tank, boo, nomore shark.
Mr. Hall and I swam back to shell.
Hey,let me serve you a drink.
He's only been gone a few moments
but when he return...
so where were we?
he gets slap!
-It kept happening...     -jerk!
until finally Lily was approached by a  mysterious woman
who wants her stay away from Barney...
so when it happened once more...
again?really? wait
Barney knew who to look for
Hey, excuse me.
Did I sleep with you and then totally screw you over?
No.
What are you doing on Friday?
Hey!
Uh... no.
Stop!
Amy?
Abby.


<i>Kids, sometimes</i> <i>you can do something right</i>
<i>a thousand times in a row...</i>
A rainbow!
That's beautiful!
What a beautiful rainbow!
Another rainbow?
It's beautiful!
<i>But then, that</i> <i>thousand-and-first time...</i>
You're kidding me.
Seriously, aren't you sick of these things?
Hey, how was your day?
Today, I yelled at a little girl for painting a rainbow.
A rainbow?
Sounds like that bitch had it coming.
So, uh, I just met with the contractor.
and it turns out,
that fixing the floors of the new apartment
is going to cost a lot more than the estimate.
But we can barely afford that to begin with.
I hate to say this,
but I think you're going to have to sell your stuff.
Whoa! Marshall,
that's just a game we play in the bedroom.
I mean your clothes.
All those designer pieces and everything.
What?
Why just my clothes?
We can sell my stuff, too,
but I got to tell you,
I think your Marc Jacobs cocktail dress
is going to go for a lot more
than my "Split Happens" bowling shirt.
-Dude. -I'm not selling that.
I've already made the Website.
You made a Website?
Yeah, it's called
"Lily-and-Marshall-sell- their-stuff-dot-com."
No, you know what would be a better name for the site?
Guy-forces-his-wife- to-dress-in-a-garbage-bag-
for-the-next- three-years-dot-com.
That's real.
I'm worried.
That woman is actually wearing a-a garbage bag.
Hmm, but, girlfriend,
you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.
Why are you trying to ruin my life?
Well, you slept with me and then you never called me again.
And?
That's it.
That's it?
As far as I'm concerned,
if I leave you safe on dry land
with adequate transportation home,
you've got nothing to complain about.
Well, it hurt, okay?
And then Ted, the love of my life,
started dating my boss instead of me.
Do you know how that feels?
Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley.
Abby! Abby.
A few weeks ago,
Ted dumped me as his wingman.
You had a crush on him for a couple weeks?
I was Ted's best friend for seven years.
Ted said Marshall was his best friend.
Seven years!
Sorry.
Ted.
What an idiot.
With his stupid
"meaningful relationship" with Stella.
Ted.
Ted.
I hate Ted.
I hate Ted more.
Are you as turned on as I am?
Probably not quite as much.
I'm sorry I yelled out "Ted."
I'm sorry I yelled out "Abby."
I <i>am</i> Abby.
Oh, cool.
This is insane.
Has Lily even worn half this stuff?
Oh, yeah, like there's nothing in your closet you've never worn?
As a matter of fact, no, there isn't.
Whatever, red cowboy boots.
those are nice boots.
I totally pull those off.
Hey, Lil,
if I were to say "Ted could never pull them off,"
-What would I be talking about? -His red cowboy boots.
I totally pull them off!
It's a classic Western look.
Oh, okay, uh, today's category:
classic Westerns that involve red cowboy boots.
Ooh, ooh! Robin.
"The Good, the Bad, and the Fabulous."
"The Magnificent Kevin."
"No Country for Straight Men."
I don't want to sell my clothes!
Oh, I know, sweetie.
Come here.
Is this a hundred percent silk?
Lily,listen, we really need the money.
I have some leads on a job, but until then,
I just... I don't know what else we can do.
I'll sell my paintings!
What?
Yeah, I'll sell my paintings.
Good oil paintings go for like, $500.
Yeah.
Totally.
But...
<i>Kids, sometimes you can</i>  <i>do something right</i>
<i>a thousand times in a row...</i>
I love it.
It's a masterpiece.
That's it. We're selling the TV.
I just want to come home and stare at this all day. Aw.
Somebody call the cops!
My wife stole an awesome painting from the museum!
<i>But then, that</i> <i>thousand-and-first time...</i>
...that kind of money only goes for real paintings.
Uh-oh.
What does that mean?
Look, it just, it just means
that-that we need money right now
and I'm not sure that selling your paintings
is-is how we're going to get it.
You don't believe in me.
No, wait, wait!
Of c...
of course I believe in you!
Marshall, I am proud of my work as an artist.
My paintings are good.
I bet Robin would buy one.
What now?
I love your painting,
I just... I'm trying to be realistic.
Well, how much money do we need
fothe contractor to finish the job?
About 1,500 bucks.
Okay.
So, if I can sell three of my paintings at 500 bucks a pop,
then I get to keep all my clothes.
Babe,
we need money fast.
Well, give me a week.
Okay, a-a week.
-Fine. -Fine.
Fine.
Pulling.
Them.
Off.
lily's first move on a great art challenge of 2008
 <i>was to display one</i>  <i>of her favorite paintings</i>
 <i>ater friend's gallery.</i>
 <i>The night didn't go so well.</i>
 <i>But then at the last minute...</i>
I love it.
You do?
Yeah, your top. It's gorgeous.
Is that 100% silk?
It's not for sale! My clothes are not for sale!
 <i>So the next day,</i>
 <i>Lily took her painting</i>  <i>to a coffee house</i>
 <i>that displayed local artists.</i>
We've been sitting here for hours
and nobody's even glanced at my painting.
Come on.
Let's start talking it up.
Wow!
I really like that painting!
It's neat!
The-the colors are neat.
The-the shapes are neat.
It's really just...
neat.
What?
Observe.
I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork
that, combined with the fluid composition,
creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.
Yes, and you can still enjoy it
even if you're not a pretentious douche.
Can you clarify something for me about your critique?
Are the colors "neat" or are they more "neato burrito?"
Uh, then again, red cowboy boots.
I pull these off!
I pull these off!
You know what I hate most about Ted?
What?
His stupid hair.
His stupid, lame awesome hair.
It's so stupid and awesome.
-You know what I hate most about Ted? -What?
How he's always like,
"Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship.
I care about the people I have sex with."
He's so lame.
He's so lame and awesome.
You know what he needs?
He needs to see just how horrible he is
when he's in a relationship.
Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I think so.
You're thinking of having sex with Ted?
 <i>After four days without</i>  <i>selling a single painting,</i>
 <i>Lily was getting desperate.</i>
Painting for sale!
$500!
Lifelong dream hanging in the balance!
It's like they don't even see us.
Yeah, we're dirt to them.
What do you need money for?
Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood floors
in my new apartment.
You?
Heroin.
Do you like heroin?
Love it.
In fact, if you sell that,
I'm going to take your money and go buy some more heroin.
Thanks for your honesty, Crazy Sock Guy.
Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...
It's not very good.
 <i>And just as she was about</i>  <i>to lose all hope,</i>
 <i>something amazing happened.</i>
Oh, my God!
500 bucks!
Who's a real painter now, Marshall?
Honey, I never said you weren't a real painter.
Oh, I know, sweetie.
And since I'm a professional artist now,
I'm going to sketch you an Aldrin original,
you know, to say thanks
for being such a supportive husband.
I'm thinking about calling it...
"Suck It!"
Lily, come on.
I'm proud of you.
Who-who bought it?
Well, that's the best part.
A gay couple without kids.
A G-CWOK!
You bagged a G-CWOK?!
Yeah, that's right.
They are the heart and soul of the art-buying community.
You know what you should do?
You should call up the G-CWOKs
and offer them a free painting
if they throw a private art party
for all their G-CWOK friends.
That's an amazing idea.
I'm going to go call them.
I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare.
Oh, wait, Marshall.
There was something I had to tell you.
What was it?
Oh, that's right.
Suck it.
Ted, fancy bumping into you here.
Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?
Uh, yeah.
Hi, Abby. Hello,
Abby. So, uh,
s-so you guys are dating now?
That's right.
I am done with this whole being awesome thing.
Now I'm all about farmers' markets
and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts.
Isn't that right, sweetie?
That's right.
And girlfriends are lame.
Unless they're me.
I miss you, Ted.
Abby and I
are in love.
Not hot passionate love.
Couple love.
You know, movie night with my girlfriend,
then waiting for her to go to bed
so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy
by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor.
We're showing Ted how lame he is.
You don't have to say it, though.
Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop.
Stop what, Ted?
Stop being in love?
Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.
We can't stop breathing, Ted.
Your hair looks amazing.
Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing.
Please stop.
Not before I share with you
what being in a relationship leads to, Ted.
Abby,
Pookie Bear...
I am so pathetically desperate for you that...
aw, heck, I'll just say it.
Will you marry me?
Wait, really?
I would never joke about true love.
Yes, I'll marry you.
Okay.
Thank you, thank you.
I have to call my mom.
That's you.
Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.
Uh, yes, she does.
It finally happened, Mama.
I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle.
Totally committed to the bit.
Yes, Lily Aldrin.
I sold you the painting earlier today.
Oh, honey, hello.
You sound happy.
Are you kidding? We're popping the champagne right now.
Well, I just wanted to offer you an exclusive chance
to view some of my other paintings.
Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, oh, I guess I should have told you.
We just bought that for the frame.
What?
Yeah, it's an original Anton Kreutzer,
a very rare frame from the turn of the century.
So... y-you didn't like my painting?
Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, no, not at all.
But you know,good for you.
Okay.
Well, if you didn't want the painting, can I...
can I at least get it back?
Yeah, no, we don't have it anymore.
Where is it?
I see.
H-He threw out my painting.
Champagne for everyone on me,
the happiest guy in the world.
This is great.
My dream of becoming an artist is dead,
and now I'm watching my wardrobe disappear
piece by piece.
There goes my favorite dress.
This dress meant a lot to me.
Really?
Yeah.
It was spring of 2004 and I had been having a hard few months.
Day-am.
I got a two-syllable "damn" in this dress.
A two-syllable "damn."
That's the dream. Yeah.
Now she belongs to...
CanadaGirl@MetroNewsOne.com.
It's still in the family.
Lily,
you're not going to believe this.
-Something amazing happened. -What?
I went to the G-CWOK's apartment.
Really? Why?
Because I felt guilty.
This auction was my idea
and now you've had to sit around all day
while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly pick apart
the carcass of your wardrobe.
It's still in the family.
And more importantly,
I honestly love that painting
and I couldn't stand to think of it
in a trashcan someplace.
Well, what happened?
Well, hello.
Hi, um... Lawrence.
I-I'm here about the painting my wife Lily solyou--
the one in the nice frame.
Talk about a nice frame.
My, my, you are a big one, aren't you?
And you're married to that little bit of a thing.
How does that work?
I'd like to find out.
Yeah, we get it.
Gay guys like you.
No, Lily, they love me,
but that's not the important part.
Here's the important part.
Since you're clearly a man
of impeccable taste and style,
I-I came down here to ask you:
what do you think of the boots?
Walter.
Boots.
Pulling.
Them.
Off.
I'll be in the cab.
G-CWOK-approved.
The painting.
Right, so, um, they told me they threw it
in the building's Dumpster.
It wasn't in there,
but the super told me that he'd seen one Dr. Greer--
a veterinarian who works in the building--
take the painting out of the trash.
Dr. Greer?
Who's Dr. Greer a-and why did he take my painting?
You're about to find out.
Long story short, I had to make a trash run.
Been a busy day-- lots of neuterings.
Ooh, we don't need the details.
Oh, n-n-no, it's not what you think.
-Oh, thank God. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, mostly just dog testicles.
Anyway...
I noticed your painting
just sitting right there on top
and I thought, "Hey,free painting,"
so I brought it upstairs
and hung it up in Exam Room 3,
and then the strangest thing happened.
Hey, Muffin.
Whoa, I think he remembers me
from the last time he was here.
Take Muffin to Exam Room 3.
I'll meet you there.
I went in, expecting the worst.
I'd never seen Muffin that calm,
and then a little later the same thing happened again
with Tidbit...
and King Larry...
and again with the Weinstein triplets.
Something about your art speaks to the canine sensibility
on a very primal level.
Really?
Dogs like my paintings?
Yeah.
But you know who it bums out?
Birds.
Yeah.
Had a parrot in there today.
He took one look at it, pried open his cage,
flew right into the ceiling fan.
Anyway, because your first painting worked so well,
I convinced Dr. Greer to buy four more.
-Really? -Mm-hmm, at $500 a piece.
That's two grand.
That's more than we need for the contractor.
Yeah, but I was actually thinking we could reinvest it.
-In what? -In you.
Marshall explained that he was building a fancy new Web site
specifically to sell Lily's artwork to veterinarians.
Well, it's not exactly the clientele
I had in mind, but...
thank you for believing in me.
Man, birds do not get you.
-Hi, sweetie. -Hey,
I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?
No, I'm in wedding-planning mode.
Stressville. Population: me.
Okay, big decision.
What do you think the cake should be:
Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?
Yeah, that was a bit.
We were doing a bit.
So I'm thinking Labor Day.
I was going to say Fourth of July,
but I don't want to steal any attention away from America.
Abby, I've... I've got some bad news.
-I can't marry you. -What?
Ted begged me not to.
I think he's in love with you.
Really?
Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed.
You have to go to him.
Here's his home address.
But you know what? He works late,
so I wouldn't go before 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.
Oh, my God, thank you.
But now I feel wrong keeping this.
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that.
That's made of candy.
Later.
Hey,go to lily and marshall sell their stuff.com
or charityfolks.com
we're having an auction to rise money
for the children's hospital of Los Angeles
you could get tons of cool stuff on the sell
and they all use for great cost
thanks
<i>Voici l'histoire de la course de taxi
qui changea ma vie.</i>
<i>Je sais, ça paraît fou.</i>
<i>De ce que j'en sais, ma vie aurait été
différente si j'avais pris, disons,</i>
<i>ce taxi.</i>
<i>Ou celui-là.</i>
<i>Dieu sait ce qui serait arrivé
si j'avais pris celui-là.</i>
<i>J'ai pris ce taxi,</i>
<i>et il changea ma vie.</i>
<i>Mais revenons un peu en arrière.</i>
- Il y a de la bière au frigo ?
- Il est 10 h du matin.
Prends-m'en une.
Il s'est passé un truc affreux.
Stella et moi déjeunions.
Ma sœur a cassé avec son copain.
Je peux enfin parler. Je le détestais !
Il arrêtait pas de dire :
"Je suis végétalien.
Les poissons ressentent la douleur.
"Je suis jamais constipé."
Quel imbécile.
En fait, ils se marient,
je voulais que tu sois honnête.
En fait, c'est un type bien.
Il y a de la sagesse...
Bref, ils ont choisi la date,
tu veux venir avec moi,
qu'on rigole à le voir traverser
l'église pieds nus et en smoking ?
- Bien sûr, c'est quand ?
- Le 1er week-end de novembre.
C'est si terrible
qu'elle t'ait invité au mariage ?
Dans 6 mois, du genre,
"On sera encore ensemble dans 6 mois."
Vous savez ce que dit Barney
sur les projets de couple ?
4e rangée.
Ted, tu violes le continuum du rencard.
Ne jamais planifier plus loin
que le temps déjà passé avec une fille.
2 semaines que tu es avec elle ?
Non, tu l'emmènes pas au concert
de Springsteen en janvier.
D'ici là, tu te souviendras
même plus de cette "Robin".
Mince, j'adore Springsteen.
C'est le Brian Adams américain.
Mais Barney a raison.
Dès qu'elle a parlé du mariage,
j'ai flippé.
Ça a l'air sympa.
Ça va être long d'attendre 6 mois.
2 fois plus long que notre relation.
Je suis sûr que ta fille viendra.
Ce sera comme un voyage en famille.
Notre premier voyage
en tant que gentille petite famille.
C'est excitant.
Oh, la la.
Ils mettent le chauffage ici...
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Faut qu'on parle.
Faut qu'on parle ?
Il y a que 2 situations
où tu dis ça à quelqu'un
et à moins que tu sois enceint,
on dirait que tu casses avec elle.
C'est ce que j'ai fait.
Comment l'a-t-elle pris ?
J'essaie d'être honnête avec toi.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je dois aller bosser.
Est-ce que...
je veux pas que ça se finisse ainsi.
Non, ça va.
C'est bon.
Je sais que ça a l'air dur,
mais Stella est une mère,
je dois être responsable.
Si je ressens ça maintenant,
et que ça continue ?
Et si ça empire,
et dans 6 mois je casse avec elle
à cause du saumon au tofu
au mariage de sa sœur ?
Je peux pas lui faire ça.
Et encore moins à sa fille.
C'est nul, mais j'essaie d'être correct.
C'est le bon choix.
<i>Ce qui me ramène à la course du taxi.</i>
Vous êtes bien Marshall Eriksen ?
Salut !
De la gelée ?
The Legen... dary Team
http://nosvospersos.blogspot.com
Merci d'avoir suivi
cette saison avec nous. ;-))
J'hallucine, tu vas très bien.
Non, pas du tout, j'ai fait
la plus grosse erreur de ma vie.
Je veux récupérer Stella. J'ai laissé 10
messages, mais son portable est coupé.
Elle est aux arcades avec sa fille.
Je vous en prie,
laissez-moi aller aux arcades.
Dis ce que tu voudras, mon pote,
t'auras pas de morphine.
Sérieux, faut que je sorte.
Pas avant d'avoir tes résultats.
Tu peux avoir une hémorragie interne.
Ton cerveau peut être rempli de sang.
Tu crois que c'est bon pour lui ?
Pas vraiment.
- Ça craint.
- Tu te fous de moi ?
Tu es sorti indemne
d'un accident de voiture.
- C'est un miracle.
- Nous y voilà.
Tu le crois pas ?
Ça n'existe pas.
Mars 2006,
au McLarens.
- Ça y est.
- Doucement.
Allons-y.
Bravo. Santé !
Pas possible.
C'est pas vrai.
Je suis mort ?
Miracle.
Un crayon est entré
dans le nez de Barney,
et t'appelles ça un miracle ?
T'as une meilleure explication ?
Un débile bourré
avec une boîte de crayons.
Un débile bourré appelé "Dieu",
et une boîte de crayons appelée
"destin".
En parlant de Barney,
je devrais l'appeler.
Pourquoi ? On n'est plus amis.
T'aimerais savoir si ça lui arrivait.
J'ai un truc à te dire.
Ça alors, nous y voilà.
Je m'y attendais.
Tu as parlé avec Robin,
elle t'a dit ce qu'il y a sous le capot,
et tu veux voir par toi-même.
Même pas si tu le faisais bouillir
dans du détergent.
C'est à propos de Ted.
Mon ex-meilleur ami dont
je ne veux plus entendre parler ?
Il a eu un accident de voiture,
il est à St Anthony, tout...
Je comprends.
Tu as ce truc important.
Bien sûr, je lui dirai que tu l'aimes.
En costard !
Il dit toujours des trucs comme ça.
Il a raccroché, hein ?
Tu vois, on est plus amis.
Mon meilleur ami a besoin de moi !
Il a dit quoi ?
Au 130... quoi ?
J'arrive, Ted.
Qu'est-ce qui t'a fait
changer d'avis pour Stella ?
Quand j'étais dans le taxi,
et que la voiture me fonçait dessus,
on dit qu'on voit toute sa vie défiler.
C'est faux. On voit pas tout.
Juste les trucs qu'on aime.
J'ai réalisé à ce moment-là
que Stella était importante.
Et je dois la récupérer.
- Miracle.
- Charmant.
Très romantique.
Pas un miracle.
Juillet 1999,
aéroport Kennedy.
Alors, vous avez aimé...
Amsterdam ?
Rien d'illégal... juste des tableaux...
OK, Bob Marley, on va discuter un peu.
C'est mon tour de garde.
Amsterdam ?
D'accord.
Peace, mon frère !
Miracle !
Ne va pas vers la lumière,
je te l'interdis...
Mosby, vous avez une visite.
Vous nous laissez une minute ?
Avant toute chose.
- Je t'aime.
- Je t'aime aussi.
- Peut-on oublier...
- C'est oublié.
C'est ta tablette ?
Tout va bien.
Tu peux supporter ça.
Quoi ?
Ce matin, il casse et là,
elle lui saute dessus
sur un lit d'hôpital.
- Miracle.
- Ouais.
Si t'appelles le Vatican, ils te diront
pas que la plupart de leurs miracles
impliquent de se sauter dessus.
Avril 2008,
dans la classe de Lily.
Tu vas les supplier
de te rendre ton job ?
T'es fou, tu détestais ça !
Je sais, mais le marché est saturé.
Les enfants !
Qui veut qu'oncle Marshall
retrouve son boulot ?
Ils crieront à chaque fois
si tu le dis sur ce ton-là.
Les enfants,
Un supertanker a déversé
50 millions de litres de pétrole
sur les côtes d'Alaska ce matin !
Bonjour Marshall.
M. Hewitt, je viens pour m'excuser.
Je vais chercher de la colle,
tu les gardes 2 minutes ?
Bien sûr.
Quitter Jefferson, Hewitt & West
fut une énorme erreur.
Je m'en rends compte.
Qui veut voir le grand type
mettre les petits chapeaux ?
J'ai eu un comportement irrespectueux,
non professionnel.
Je suis un pèlerin.
On pourrait croire
que j'ai un petit chapeau,
mais en vérité,
j'ai juste une tête énorme !
J'étais en période de stress,
en manque de sommeil,
Il y a 87 ans,
j'avais une tête vraiment gigantesque !
J'ai acheté un appartement
où il y avait des problèmes,
je veux pas vous embêter
avec ces détails.
Je ne regrette que de n'avoir
qu'une énorme tête à donner à mon pays.
Monsieur, si vous pouviez me donner
juste une chance, je promets...
Je veux bien vous donner une 2e chance.
Je me souviens de mes premières années
en tant qu'avocat,
je sais pas combien d'heures
j'ai pu passer...
Oh mon Dieu. J'ai des poux.
Ces petits démons m'ont filé des poux.
Ça gratte ! Ne te gratte pas,
t'auras l'air bête.
Il te rendra pas ton job.
Gratte-toi, mais subtilement.
Ça, ça marche pas.
Joli petit coin de table,
que j'aimerais gratter sur toi
mon crâne infesté...
Ça va, Eriksen ?
Oui, ça va.
Ça... va.
Poursuivez...
L'esprit contrôle le corps.
Il n'y a pas de poux sur ma tête,
pondant des œufs, creusant mon crâne,
grignotant la peau jusqu'à mon cerveau !
- J'ai des poux !
- Des poux ?
Des poux ! Sortez de mon bureau !
Alerte aux poux.
Tout le monde évacue le bâtiment.
Si j'avais pas eu de poux,
j'aurais retrouvé mon job
et j'aurais été là quand,
2 semaines plus tard, la commission
sur les échanges a débarqué.
Dieu a envoyé ces poux sur ma tête
comme il a envoyé
les sauterelles en Égypte.
Pour me libérer du joug de l'entreprise.
Miracle.
Je suis si contente
que vous soyez à nouveau ensemble.
Attends,
t'entends quoi par "à nouveau" ?
Tu sais, comme vous avez cassé.
Quoi ?
Oh non, c'était juste une dispute,
pas une séparation.
C'était une séparation ?
C'est ce qu'il pensait ?
Le fils de pute.
C'était une séparation, pas vrai ?
T'as cassé avec moi.
Je savais pas
que c'était une séparation.
Tu rigoles ?
J'ai dit que je me sentais mal,
t'as dit "C'est bon",
et t'es partie.
Oui, j'ai dit "C'est bon"
dans le sens "C'est bon".
Comme quand le serveur nous
demande si on veut plus de muffins,
et on dit "C'est bon".
Exactement.
Et j'ai pris ça dans le sens,
tu ne veux plus de muffin d'amour,
métaphoriquement.
C'est dingue. Oublie tout ça.
Depuis, j'ai eu une révélation
avec mon accident de voiture.
Je t'aime, je veux pas casser.
Mais tu l'as voulu.
Et si t'as ressenti ça une fois,
ça reviendra.
Et ça continuera, et je peux pas
espérer un accident à chaque fois.
Tu veux dire quoi ?
Je dis
que tu voulais une séparation ?
Tu l'as.
- Stella, attends !
- Tu sais quoi Ted ? "C'est bon".
Donc t'as cassé avec elle,
et elle ne le savait pas.
Apparemment.
T'as bien dit :
"Je veux casser".
Bien sûr que non.
Qui dit "Je veux casser" ?
C'est horrible de dire ça.
Pas faux.
- Allo ?
- Ted Mosby ?
Vous êtes listé comme contact d'urgence
pour Barney Stinson.
Quoi ?
<i>Ce qu'il y avait, c'était ça.</i>
J'y suis arrivé, j'y suis arrivé !
Mec, j'arrive pas à croire
que t'aies couru jusqu'ici.
Arrête de t'y croire.
Quel ego ce type.
J'étais pas loin parce que...
j'avais une réunion internationale
très importante.
Si tu viens pour me supplier,
épargne-moi ça.
Je m'en sors très bien sans toi.
Surtout maintenant, je peux jouer
la sympathie avec les filles.
Et... puisqu'on en parle,
il y a un os, en bas,
qui n'est pas cassé.
Tu sais de quoi je parle !
Tope là !
T'es sûr ?
Oui, pourquoi crois-tu
que je l'ai installé comme ça ?
Ça valait le coup.
Barney, tu...
Tu aurais pu mourir.
Je suis désolé d'avoir enfreint le code.
C'est moi qui suis désolé.
On peut être amis à nouveau ?
Barney, on est plus que des amis.
On est des potes.
- T'es mon pote, Ted.
- T'es mon pote, Barney.
T'as entendu, Marshall ?
On est potes.
Marshall est mon pote aussi.
On est tous des potes.
Oui,
mais je suis ton meilleur pote, hein ?
<i>Voilà comment on a enterré
la hache de guerre.</i>
<i>La suite a été mièvre et embarrassante.</i>
<i>Passons</i>.
J'ai détourné le regard,
si j'avais vu ce que les secours
allaient faire,
je me serais évanoui.
Puis, ils ont pris cette lame électrique
et je me disais, c'est pas possible.
C'est pas possible.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils ont coupé ?
Mon costume.
Mon beau costume.
Mais tu es vivant
et Ted est vivant.
C'est incroyable.
Deux miracles en un jour.
Qu'est-ce qui va pas chez toi ?
Comment tu peux être aussi cynique ?
Tu veux le savoir ?
Tu veux vraiment le savoir ?
Bien.
Quand j'étais petite,
j'avais un chien : Sir Scratch I.
Bref,
Sir Scratch I est devenu très vieux
et mes parents ont dû le faire piquer.
Ce fut le jour le plus dur
de ma jeune vie.
Au revoir, Sir Scratch I.
Je t'aime.
Quand ils l'ont emmené chez le véto,
il leur a dit
que ce même jour,
il avait appris un procédé expérimental
appelé "Testudin canin
cérébro-xénographe".
Vous connaissez ?
Ça a sauvé la vie de Sir Scratch I.
- Il a vécu sept ans de plus.
- Un miracle !
Hormis un effet secondaire
assez important.
Sir Scratch I, bon retour.
Il était devenu tortue.
Je sais, c'est bizarre, hein ?
C'est une complication courante
du "Testudin canin cérébro-xénographe".
Et il avait oublié tous ses vieux tours.
Va chercher, Scratchy, va chercher.
Va chercher !
Va chercher, Scratchy.
- Combien de temps avant que...
- Trop pour ma fierté, Lily.
Trop pour ma fierté.
C'est là que j'ai réalisé
que les miracles ne sont pas vrais.
Pardon.
Mosby, vous êtes encore là ?
Vos résultats sont revenus
il y a une heure. Tout va bien.
Pourquoi vous m'avez rien dit ?
Désolé.
J'ai dû être inconvenant en ressuscitant
ce type empalé sur une étagère.
Je dois filer. Barney...
Vas-y.
Cours, Ted.
Cours.
- Si je t'ai appris une chose...
- Il est parti.
Ted a dit qu'avant l'accident,
il a eu un flash
de tout ce qu'il aimait.
Et toi ?
Je sais ce qu'il a vu : des seins.
Du whisky.
- De l'argent.
- Des costumes.
- Des costumes d'argent.
- Des costumes de seins.
Un énorme sein
portant un costume d'argent.
Et le sein donne du whisky.
C'est à peu près tout ce que tu aimes,
hein ?
Oui, à peu près.
<i>Beaucoup de choses bizarres
me sont arrivées.</i>
<i>Cet accident,
je peux dire que c'est un miracle.</i>
<i>Pas pour ce qui s'est passé.</i>
<i>Mais pour la suite.</i>
Je peux te parler ?
Je t'ai pris ce kangourou orange.
Merci.
J'ai réfléchi...
à ce qui a changé entre la rupture
et le moment où je voulais te récupérer.
J'ai compris ce qui s'est passé.
Ton taxi a été plié en deux
par un débile téléphonant au volant ?
J'ai changé.
Je veux te donner ce dont tu as besoin.
J'ai passé 10 minutes
sur la machine à pinces
pour essayer d'avoir
la fausse bague en diamant.
J'ai juste réussi à avoir ce kangourou.
Une bague ?
Veux-tu m'épouser ?
Kids this is the story of the cab ride that changed my life
I know it sounds crazy
before all I know my life would be very different if I've taken,say
that cab,or that cab
God knows what will happen if I got into that cab
I took this cab
and it changed my whole life
But first we need to back up a little
hey any beer in the fridge?
It's 10 in the morning
grab me one
so something bad just happened
stella and I were out having breakfast
so my sister broke up with her boyfriend
I can finally say it
I hated that guy.
everything in his month is I am a vegen,fish feel pain.
I am never constipate.That guy is an idiot
Actually she is marrying him
I just wanna know your honest opinion
He is actually a real nice guy  I think there is a wisdom to catch
 Anyway, they picked a date, so, uh,
you want to come with me,
so that we can laugh our asses off
as we watch him walk barefoot down the aisle
in a hemp tuxedo?
Yeah, sure. When is it?
Uh, first weekend in November.
<i>Is that</i>
the something bad?
That she invited you to a wedding?
Six months from now.
As in we'll be together six months from now.
 Do you guys remember
Barney's whole thing about making plans in a relationship?
 Fourth row.
Ted, no.
You're violating the date-time continuum.
You never make plans with a girl further in the future
than the amount of time you've been going out.
You've been dating this girl for,what,two weeks?
No, you're not taking her to a Springsteen concert in January.
By that time you won't even remember this Robin girl's name.
Ugh, man, I love Springsteen!
He's like the American Bryan Adams.
But Barney had a point.
As soon as she started talking about the wedding,
it freaked me out.
Oh,that sounds like so much fun.
So I get to look  forward to it
for six months.
Which is twice as long as we've been dating.
Uh-oh.
I'm sure  your daughter Lucy'll come
so it'll be like a... a family trip.
Our first trip as our funny little family.
So that... that'll  be super-exciting.
Oh, boy.
Man, they crank up the heat in these places.
What's going on, Ted?
 We need to talk.
Oh. Oh. Oh.
"We need to talk"?
There's only two situations where you say that to someone
and unless you're pregnant,
 it sounds like you  broke up with her.
Yeah, I did.
So how did she take it?
I'm only trying to be honest with you.
You know,Ted. I have to go to work.
Stella, can we just...
I don't want to leave it like this.
No, Ted, it's okay.
 We're good.
Ow!
Look, I know it sounds rough,
but Stella's a mom.
I have to be responsible.
If I'm having these feelings now,
what if they don't go away?
What if they just get worse and worse?
and six months from now, I break up with her
over tofu salmon at her sister's wedding?
 I can't do that to her.
And I definitely can't do that to her daughter.
It sucks, but I'm being the good guy here.
This is the right decision.
<i>Which brings me back</i> <i>to the cab ride.</i>
Hello, may I speak with Marshall Eriksen?
Hey, guys.
Jell-O?


can't believe this you are totally fine.
No, I'm not fine.
I made the biggest mistake of my life.
I want Stella back.
I've left her like ten messages,  but her phone's off.
She's at that arcade Kiddie Funland with her daughter.
Please.
Let me go to Kiddie Funland.
You can say that all you want, buddy,
but you're not getting any morphine.
No, I'm serious. I got to get out of here.
You're not going anywhere until we get the tests back.
You could have internal bleeding.
Your brain could be all full of blood.
Think that's good for it?
It ain't.
This sucks.
This sucks.
-This sucks. This sucks. -Are you...
are you kidding me?
You walked away from a car accident without a scratch.
A miracle took place today.
Oh, here we go.
You don't think this was a miracle?
There's no such thing as miracles.
March 2006, MacLaren's Bar.
That's terrible. Gentle.
That's in! Gentle.
Ow.Here we go.
Hey!
Bravo.
Cheers...
No... way.
That did not just happen.
Am I dead?
Am I dead?
Miracle!
A pencil went up Barney's nose,
 and you call it a miracle.
Well, do you have a better explanation for it?
A drunk jackass with a box of pencils?
A drunk jackass called "God!"
And a box of pencils called "destiny!"
Speaking of Barney, I should give him a call.
Why? We're not friends anymore.
You'd want to know if this happened to him.
Go for Barney.
Hey, Barney.
Listen, I have something to tell you.
Oh, boy, here we go.
I've been waiting for this one.
 You talked to Robin.
She told you what's under the hood
and you want to take it for a spin yourself.
Not even if you boiled it in detergent.
It's about Ted.
Ted?
My former best friend Ted
who I asked you never to mention to me again?
 Yeah.
 He's been in a car accident.
He's at Saint Anthony's hospital.
Everything's...
No, I understand.
You've got that important thing.
Okay.
Oh, of course
I'll tell him you love him.
Okay.
Suit up!
He is always saying stuff like that!
-He hung up, didn't he?  -Yeah.
See, I told you.We're not friends anymore.
My best friend needs me!
What did he say?
Ah, a hundred and thir... What?
You...
I'm coming, Ted.
So, what made you change your mind about Stella?
Well, I was in the cab,and the car was coming at me,
and you know how they say that your whole life flashes
before your eyes in a near-death experience?
It doesn't.
You don't see everything.
Just the things you love.
I realized in that moment
that Stella is the most important thing in my life
and-and I have to get her back.
Miracle!
Very sweet.
Very romantic.
Not a miracle.
July 1999.
Kennedy Airport.
So, did you enjoy...
Amsterdam?
No.
Nothing illegal.
 Paintings.
 All right,  Bob Marley.
Let's have a conversation.
Shift change.
Oh, Amsterdam.
 All right.
 Float on through, brother.
Miracle!
Don't you go into the light!
Don't you do it!
Hey, Mosby,
 you got a visitor.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Can you guys,uh,give us a minute?
 Stella, before you  say anything...
 I love you.
  I love you, too.
 Can we just forget about...
It's forgotten.
Is this your chart?
 Okay.
Everything looks good.
I think you can handle it.
Handle what?
This morning he dumped her
and now she's dry-humping him on a hospital bed.
-Miracle!   -Yeah,
you know, I bet  if you call up the Vatican,
they will tell you that most of their certified miracles
involve dry-humping, so.
April 2008.
Lily's kindergarten classroom.
You're gonna go in there
and beg for your old job back?
That's crazy.
You hated it there.
I-I know, the job market is  just really bad right now.
Hey, kids,
who wants Uncle Marshall to get his old job back?
They'll cheer for anything if you say it like that.
Kids, a super tanker
spilled five million  gallons of oil
off the coast of Alaska this morning!
Hello, Marshall.
Mr. Hewitt,
I came here to apologize.
I'm going to go  grab some more glue.
Will you watch them for a sec?
Of course.
Leaving Nicholson Hewitt,and West was a huge mistake,
and I can see that now.
So...
who wants to see the big guy
put on these tiny hats?
My behavior was disrespectful.
It was unprofessional.
I'm a pilgrim.
I know it looks like  I have a tiny hat,
but in reality, I have an abnormally large head!
I was going through a stressful time.
I wasn't getting enough sleep.
Fourscore and seven years ago,
I had a great, big giant head!
I had just bought an apartment,
and there were some problems.
I-I don't want to bore you with the details.
I only regret that I have but one giant head
to give for my country.
Sir, if you could just see your way into giving me
-one more chance,  I promise...   -Marshall.
I'm willing to give this a second chance.
I remember my first years as an attorney.
Why, I don't know how  many hours I spent.
I don't think  I ever left...
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>I have lice.</i>
<i>Those little bastards</i><i>gave me lice.</i>
<i>God, it itches.</i>
<i>Don't scratch it.</i>
<i>You'll look like a fool.</i>
<i>You'll never get your job back.</i>
<i>Okay, you can scratch,</i><i>but just make it subtle.</i>
<i>Okay, that's not working.</i>
<i>Oh, sweet, sharp corner</i><i>of the desk,</i>
<i>how I long to rub</i> <i>my infested scalp against you.</i>
I was, um... just, uh...
You okay, Eriksen?
Oh! Oh, yes, I'm good.
I am good.
Continue.
<i>Mind over matter.</i>
<i>There are no lice in my hair...</i>
<i>laying eggs,</i>
<i>burrowing into my scalp,</i>
<i>eating their way all the way</i> <i>down to my brain!</i>
I have lice!
"Lice"?! Lice! Get out!
Get out of my office!
We've got lice!
Everybody out of the building.
If it weren't for the lice,
I would have gotten my job back,
and I would have been working there when,
<i>two weeks later,the Securities</i><i>and Exchange Commission</i>
<i>came a-knocking.</i>
God sent those lice to my head
like he sent  the locusts to Egypt:
to liberate me from corporate bondage.
Miracle.
Hey, guys.
Oh, I'm just so glad
-you and Ted are back together.  -Yeah.
Wait, um, what do you mean "back together"?
Well, you know, since you guys broke up.
What? Oh, no.
It was just a small fight.
That wasn't a breakup.
Was that a breakup? Did he think that was a breakup?
What?
Son of a bitch!
That was a breakup. Wasn't it?
You broke up with me.
Yeah.
I didn't know that  that was a breakup.
Are you kidding?
I-I said, "I feel awful."
You said, "We're good."
Then you got up and left.
Yeah, I said, "We're good,"
as in "We're good."
Like when the waiter  comes around and asks
if you want any more muffins,  and you say, "We're good."
Exactly, and I took   that "We're good" to mean
you didn't want any more
metaphorical relationship muffins.
This is crazy.
Forget about all that.
That was a whole life-changing car accident ago.
I love you.
I don't want to break up.
But you did.
You did want to.
And if you had  those feelings once,
then you're going  to have those feelings again,
and you're going to keep on having them.
And I can't count on that car to hit you every time you do.
What are you saying?
I'm saying...
you wanted your breakup,
you got it.
What?! Stella, wait!
No, you know what, Ted?
We're good.
So you broke up with her and she didn't know it.
Apparently.
And you actually said, "I want to break up"?
No, of course not.
Who says "I want to break up"?
That's a horrible thing to say.
Well, that's true.
Hello?
Hi, Ted Mosby?
We have you listed as the emergency contact  for Barney Stinson.
What is it?
What it was was this.
I made it.  I made it!
Dude, I...
I can't believe you ran all the way up here.
Jeez. Flatter yourself much?
What an ego on this guy.
Um, I was up in this part of town
because I had to attend
a very important international business meeting.
If you're here to come crawling back,  just save it.
I'm doing awesome without you.
Even better now,'cause I can play
the sympathy card with the females.
And BTW,
there's one bone downstairs that ain't broken.
Marshall,
you know what I'm talking about.
Up top!
Are you sure?
Yeah, dude. Why do you think I had them set it this way?
Okay.
Worth it.
Barney, you, uh...
You could've died.
Ted, I'm sorry I broke the bro code.
No, I'm-I'm sorry.
Ted, can we be friends again?
Barney, come on, we're... we're more than friends.
We're brothers.
You're my brother, Ted.
You're my brother, Barney.
Did you hear that, Marshall?
We're brothers now.
Marshall's my brother, too.
We're all brothers.
Yeah, but I'm your  best brother, right?
And that's how your Uncle Barney
and I buried the hatchet.
It got pretty mushy and embarrassing after that.
<i>Let's skip ahead.</i>
I had to look away because if I watched
what the paramedics were about to do,
I would have passed out.
Then they took out this
electric blade thing  and I kept thinking,
"This isn't happening. This isn't happening."
Oh, my God. What did they cut?
My suit.
My beautiful suit.
But you're alive,and, and Ted's alive.
This is amazing!
Two miracles in one day.
What is the matter with you?
How can you possibly be this cynical?!
-You want to know?  -Yeah.
-You really want to know?  -Yeah!
Fine.
When I was a kid,
I had this dog, Sir Scratchawan.
Anyway, Sir Scratchawan got really old,
so my parents decided to put him down.
It was the toughest day of my young life.
Good-bye, Sir Scratchawan.
I love you.
And when they took  him to the vet,
he told them that  earlier that very day,
he had learned about   an experimental procedure
called a canine/testudine cerebro-xenograft.
Ever heard of it?
No.
Well, it saved  Sir Scratchawan's life.
He lived another seven years.
-Miracle.   -Except for one...
kind of big side effect   from the surgery.
Sir Scratchawan!
Welcome home!
He turned into a turtle.
I know. It's weird, right?
Apparently, a very common  complication
from canine/testudine  cerebro-xenografts.
And he didn't seem to remember any of his old tricks.
Go get it, Scratchy.
Go get it!
Go get it! Get it!
Go get it, Scratchy.
Go get it.
How long was it before...?
Longer than I'm proud of, Lily.
Longer than I'm proud of.
And that's when I realized
miracles ain't real.
Excuse me.
Mosby, you're still here?
Your tests came back, like, an hour ago. You're fine.
Are you kidding me?Why didn't you tell me?!
I'm sorry.
I guess it was rude of me to keep resuscitating that guy
with a rake sticking out of his chest.
Um, I have to go right now.  Barney, I...
Go.
Run, Ted. Run.
If there's anything I've taught  you over the years, it's...
Barney, he left.
Hey, Ted said that right before the accident,
his life flashed   before his eyes.
You know, all the stuff he loves.
-Did that happen to you? -Oh, yeah.
-I know what he saw: boobs.   -Scotch.
And money.
-Suits. -A suit of money.
A suit of boobs.
A giant boob wearing a suit of money.
And the boob is lactating scotch.
I guess that's pretty much everything you love, right?
Yeah, pretty much.
i>Kids, a lot</i><i>of weird, random things</i>
<i>have happened in my life,</i>
<i>but that car accident</i> <i>is one of the few</i>
I'd call a miracle,</i><i>not because of what happened,</i>
<i>but because</i>  <i>of what happened next.</i>
Can I talk to you?
Okay.
I got you this orange kangaroo.
Uh... thanks.
So I've been thinking  about what changed
from the moment I broke up with you
to the moment I knew  I wanted you back.
And, um, I think I finally  figured out what happened.
Your cab got T-boned by a jackass on a cell phone?
No. I changed.
I'm ready to give you  what you need.
That's why I spent
ten minutes on the damn claw machine
trying to get the big,fake diamond ring.
But all I could get   was this orange kangaroo.
Diamond ring?
Will you marry me?


<i>Les enfants, il y a quelque chose que
j'aurais aimé que mon père me dise.</i>
<i>Le blanc le plus long
que vous vivrez dans votre vie</i>
<i>est celui qui suit la question...</i>
Veux-tu m'épouser ?
<i>Votre cerveau devient suractif,
imaginant chaque réponse possible.</i>
Mon Dieu, non.
Tu veux que j'épouse...
Je suis désolée. Je peux pas.
Mark Johnson, le quarterback
de ton lycée, m'a déjà demandé.
Ça va, Turd ?
C'est Ted !
<i>Mais avec de la chance,</i>
<i>elle pourrait répondre
avec le plus beau mot de notre langue.</i>
Oui.

<i>Stella et moi avons joyeusement
passé cet été de fiançailles.</i>
<i>Marshall faisait toujours
face au chômage.</i>
Vous faites quoi ?
<i>Lily s'est remise à la peinture.</i>
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
<i>Barney se remettait
de son accident de bus.</i>
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
<i>Et Marshalll continuait
de faire face au chômage.</i>
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
<i>Et Robin présentait les nouvelles
hautement journalistiques de Metro News.</i>
Est-ce que votre marque favorite de fil
dentaire empoisonne votre famille ?
Branchez-vous à 11h
pour la choquante
dent.
Je déteste officiellement
mon boulot.
Je ne suis pas une journaliste,
je sers qu'à effrayer les gens la nuit.
Je suis le croque-mitaine
avec un téléprompteur.
"Le croque-mitaine
avec un téléprompteur."
C'est tordant !
Super blague, Robin, super blague.
Barney, sans offenser Robin,
mais c'était pas si drôle que ça.
Tu rigoles ?
C'était une super blague.
C'est intelligent, drôle,
beau, il y a tout.
C'est ce que tu as toujours eu peur
de vouloir.
Dans une blague.
"Le croque-mitaine
avec un téléprompteur."
Un classique.
Qu'est-ce qui est si urgent
pour que tu m'appelles et me supplies
de venir à 7 h 22 du matin ?
Tu sais qu'il se passe quelque chose
avec moi, et tu as raison.
Mais je peux pas te dire ce que c'est.
Je devrais, mais je peux pas !
Il le faut. Non jamais !
Je vais le faire.
Oublions ça. Comment tu vas ?
Barney, dis-le.
Je pense que j'aime Robin.
Lily cherche un cadeau pour
l'enterrement de vie de jeune fille.
Elle aime cuisiner ?
En fait, je sais pas.
Quelle est sa couleur préférée ?
Je sais pas ça non plus.
- Elle a des hobbies ?
- Oui.
C'est exactement le genre
de personnes qui a des hobbies.
Et des centres d'intérêt, aussi.
Je suis un putain de chanceux.
Mec, tu sais absolument rien
sur la femme que t'épouses.
Quoi ?
- T'es fou ! Je sais plein de trucs.
- La couleur de ses yeux ?
La couleur d'un océan
après une tempête.
Qui est ?
Belle.
J'y crois pas.
Je pensais que tu m'avais appelé pour
te détacher encore de ta balançoire,
mais t'es amoureux ?
- C'est tellement mignon !
- C'est pas "mignon."
C'est comme une maladie.
J'ai couché une fois avec Robin
et j'ai attrapé des sentiments.
J'ai attrapé de sales sentiments.
J'ai utilisé des protections et tout.
Tu n'attrapes pas les sentiments,
tu en as.
- Et ils sont bien.
- Ils sont terribles !
Je peux pas manger,
je peux pas dormir.
Je ne pense qu'à elle.
Je ferme mes yeux, je vois Robin.
J'entends une chanson,
elle me rappelle Robin.
Bonjour.
Je couche avec cette nana,
je pense à Robin.
OK, donc je connais pas
chaque détail sur Stella.
Tu veux en venir où ?
Tu l'aimes pas ou quoi ?
Non, Ted, j'aime beaucoup Stella.
- Elle est fan des Mets.
- Vraiment ?
C'est juste que tout a été si vite.
Vous vous connaissez depuis peu.
Tu penses pas que tu devrais
ralentir un petit peu ?
- Pour mieux vous connaître ?
- J'aurai toute ma vie pour ça.
Pour l'instant, je connais
la seule chose importante :
je l'aime.
Tu l'aimes ?
Comment peux-tu être amoureux,
et toujours coucher avec tout
ce qui bouge ?
Je suis désolé, je ne te suis pas.
C'est comme dire :
"Comment une fourmi peut porter
20 fois son poids,
"alors que les fondants
sont toujours délicieux ?"
Les deux sont liés ?
Vraiment ?
Il va falloir que t'arrêtes
de coucher sans arrêt
si tu veux être le copain de Robin.
"Copain" ?
Je ne veux pas être son copain.
Que veux-tu alors ?
Je sais pas.
Je veux juste être avec elle.
Tout le temps.
Je veux qu'elle me parle de sa journée
et lui parler de la mienne.
Je veux lui tenir la main,
sentir ses cheveux.
Mais je veux pas être
son imbécile de copain.
Barney, ce que tu viens de décrire,
c'est une relation entre un petit copain
et une petite copine.
Et une assez exclusive, d'ailleurs.
Bon Lily, tu vas m'aider ou pas ?
Je suis maîtresse d'école.
Je vois un gamin perdu dans un coin
qui mange ses ciseaux de gaucher,
je me dois d'aider ce petit crétin.
Mais seulement si t'arrêtes
de batifoler. Entendu ?
Entendu.
Tout de suite,
votre glacier local ne conduit-il pas
un labo de méth clandestin ?
Restez avec nous
pour le reste de la...
came.
Sérieux ?
Les mecs pensent que c'est pas viril
pour un mec de cuisiner,
mais nous ?
- On trouve ça très sexy.
- Vraiment ?
Tu sais...
Ma grand-mère m'a appris.
- Oh oui, je vois ça.
- Oui.
J'avais du temps après l'école
pour la regarder, car
j'étais nul en sport.
Je suis brûlante, là.
Délicieux. Y a quoi dans ce pesto ?
Le classique :
basilic, ail, huile d'olive,
mais peux-tu deviner
mon ingrédient secret ?
L'arachide.
Oui, comment tu le sais ?
- OK, laisse-moi voir, quoi d'autre ?
- Tu sais quoi ?
Je me suis levée tôt et j'ai eu
une très longue journée de boulot.
Sans oublier que tu as essayé
de me tuer.
On peut pas aller se coucher ?
Non, faut vraiment
que j'en sache plus sur toi.
Prenons les premières.
Premier baiser ?
Dale Harris, en CE1.
Attends, tu veux dire bise sur la joue
ou baiser passionné avec la langue ?
- Avec la langue.
- OK, oui, Dale Harris, en CE1.
Ta première fois.
- Dale Harris, CE...
- Arrête.
Billy Devito,
deuxième année d'université.
Prude.
Molly McKenzie,
en première au lycée.
Traînée.
Robin doit voir
ce nouveau visage chez toi.
- Donc, je dois l'appeler ?
- Appelle-la.
Répondeur.
J'ai laissé un message.
T'as laissé un message,
mais pas très viril.
Je comprends pas.
T'as appelé un million de filles
un million de fois.
Mais c'était juste des plans cul.
Avec un plan cul,
pas la peine de parler.
<i>Vers 21 h 00, tu dis...</i>
Bébé, c'est Barney.
T'es occupée ce soir ? Cool.
On se voit dans 30 minutes ?
J'ai hâte.
<i>Plus le temps passe,
moins les mots sont nécessaires.</i>
Barney. Occupée ? Cool.
<i>Et à 3 h 00 du matin...</i>
Cool.
Un point d'interrogation ?
T'as baisé
avec un point d'interrogation ?
C'est pas pire
que vos codes super évidents.
- Rhinoceros.
- On doit partir.
Super. Il nous faut un nouveau code.
C'est elle, c'est Robin.
Je fais quoi ?
Ravi de t'entendre.
Qu'est-ce qui me vaut le plaisir ?
T'as appelé, fait...
puis raccroché.
Tu veux quoi ?
Aide-moi !
Demande-lui quelque chose.
Comment ça va aujourd'hui ?
Bien.
Un truc personnel.
À quel âge as-tu eu
tes premières règles ?
- Tu m'interroges sur mes règles ?
- Non, pas du tout.
Bon, je suis au boulot, là.
Invite-la.
Robin, je me demandais si...
Rien. Je dois y aller. Bye.
C'était juste une blague.
J'aime pas réellement Robin.
T'aurais dû voir ta tête.
Y a des caméras là, là et là.
Quel canular légendaire
dont on ne parlera plus jamais.
<i>Je rêve.</i>
- Premier film que t'aies vu.
- Benji, 1981.
Je l'ai revu récemment avec Lucy
et je me suis dit,
"Oh, ce chien-là
est mort maintenant."
Et toi ?
Mon père m'a emmené à un vieux drive-in
pour voir le premier Star Wars.
Tu sais quoi,
j'ai jamais vu Star Wars.
Elle a jamais vu Star Wars ?
Les seules personnes dans l'univers
qui n'ont pas vu Star Wars
sont les personnages,
et c'est parce qu'il l'ont vécu.
- Ils ont vécu la Guerre des Étoiles !
- Calme-toi.
Je te l'ai dit.
Tu la connais pas assez bien. Et si...
- tu lui montres et qu'elle aime pas ?
- Mec, c'est juste un film.
Star Wars a toujours été
ton film préféré,
et que Stella aime ou pas,
c'est vraiment important.
C'est comme un test pour voir savoir
si vous êtes compatibles.
C'est juste un film !
<i>121 grandioses minutes plus tard.</i>
Si Stella aime pas ce film,
je peux pas l'épouser.
Non.
- Tu veux le revoir encore ?
- Oui.
Où sont les garçons ?
Je pensais qu'on sortait tous.
J'ai menti. Ils ne viendront pas
et je vais partir.
Pourquoi ?
Parce qu'ils ne sont pas amoureux
de Robin, et moi non plus.
Elle est géniale et adorable.
Je vais pas prétendre
que j'ai pas remarqué son corps,
mais c'est hors sujet.
Bonne chance.
Attends, je peux pas faire ça.
Elle me prendra pas au sérieux.
Pour elle, je suis un gros dragueur.
On sait tous les deux
que t'es plus que ça.
Montre juste à Robin le Barney
que j'ai vu l'autre jour.
Tu veux dire celui qui doute de lui,
la femmelette ultra-sensible
qui rappelait Ted ?
Ted se l'est tapée pendant plus d'un an.
Souhaite-moi bonne chance.
Je pensais qu'on pourrait
regarder un film ce soir,
et comme t'as jamais vu Star Wars,
j'ai pensé "pourquoi pas" ?
Rien de bien méchant.
C'est plutôt pas mal.
Ça a l'air d'un plan.
Je vais prendre une bière.
Tu en veux une ?
Le film a déjà commencé, donc...
C'est que des mots à travers l'espace.
Je vais pas les lire de toute façon.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Mauvais départ.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je m'assure que mon meilleur ami
épouse la bonne femme.
Voilà ce que je fais.
Tu fais quoi caché
derrière ce canapé ?
T'as besoin de trouver du boulot.
Il le faut, hein ?
Donc, Robin...
parle-moi de ta journée,
et pas seulement de ce qui est arrivé,
comment tu as ressenti ça.
- Quoi ?
- Je veux pas résoudre des problèmes,
je veux juste écouter.
- Pourquoi tu agis comme ça ?
- Comme quoi ?
Tu es super gentil. Ça...
me fait flipper. Sois...
grossier, sois incorrect.
Sois Barney.
Je suis Barney,
et je pense que cette soirée va être
dé... attends... licieuse.
Délicieuse.
OK.
Hier, je suis allée
chez le chiropracteur.
Ce gars m'a allongée sur la table
et m'a manipulée pendant une heure.
L'assurance va couvrir ça.
Des fois, elles ne le font pas.
C'est tout.
Aujourd'hui,
j'étais chez le dentiste.
Ce gars m'a fraisée
toute la journée.
Il a fraisé si fort.
Il a plombé tous les trous.
Allez, mec.
- Tes dents sont superbes.
- Qui es-tu ?
Quoi ?
Rien.
Tu me fixais.
T'es vraiment magnifique ce soir.
T'es pas mal non plus, monsieur.
Scène géniale, scène géniale.
Anecdote 7 sur Star Wars...
Lucas a basé la structure du film
sur la "Forteresse Cachée",
de Akira Kurosawa.
Il a aussi une dette envers Campbell
avec la mythologie comparative.
Bon, c'est pas excitant là.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Rien.
Attends, c'est vraiment important
pour toi que j'aime ce film, c'est ça ?
Je ne vais pas l'aimer
si tu me fixes tout le temps.
Va dans ta chambre
et je viendrai quand c'est fini.
File.
Je dois partir aussi ?
Quelle scène, quelle scène ?
Merci.
Rien ?
Même pas un regard ?
Je pensais à écraser un bateau
sur ces mauvais garçons.
Qu'est-ce qui cloche chez toi ?
Je veux pas toujours être ce mec.
Parfois, je veux être quelqu'un d'autre,
avec qui tu peux avoir
une vraie conversation.
Maintenant, dis-moi quelque chose
sur toi que j'ignore encore.
Sérieusement.
Il y a un poste disponible
sur une nouvelle chaîne
qui serait parfait pour moi...
S'occuper des infos mondiales,
interviewer des gens importants,
- mais j'ai décidé de ne pas postuler.
- Pourquoi ?
Je suis une blague.
Je suis la présentatrice qui fait peur,
de la stupide chaîne d'info régionale.
Toi et moi,
on sait que tu vaux plus.
Promets-moi de postuler.
- C'est pas aussi simple...
- Promets-moi de postuler.
Je promets.
Elle en est à la scène
où Luke, Leia, Han et Chewy s'échappent
- du compacteur de l'Étoile de la Mort.
- Super scène.
Super scène !
On aurait dû entendre...
- mais Stella n'a pas bronché.
- Je vais jeter un oeil.
Elle regarde même pas.
Elle écrit un SMS.
- Je lui dis que vous resterez ami.
- Je le crois pas.
Elle sait que c'est important
pour moi. Elle...
"Arrêtez de me regarder,
les débiles."
- Aux opportunités.
- Aux opportunités.
En fait, il y a quelque chose
dont je voudrais te parler.
- Dernier verre.
- Bien sûr.
- Un dernier pour la route ?
- Pourquoi pas.
On en parle après ?
Oui.
- J'ai adoré.
- Oui !
Je vais épouser une femme
qui est non seulement canon,
mais qui aime Star Wars.
C'est le rêve.
C'était quoi ça ?
J'en tapais cinq au moi qui a 15 ans
à travers le continuum espace-temps.
On l'a fait.
On a réussi, petit branleur.
Champagne pour tout le monde.
C'était trop bien.
- T'as détesté, hein ?
- C'est si débile.
D'abord, comment ils comprennent
cet ours qui traîne avec eux ?
- Un Wookiee.
- Il fait...
Et eux répondent :
"T'as raison, l'ours, essayons ça."
C'est un Wookiee et sa race est
plus intelligente qu'elle en a l'air.
C'est le film préféré de Ted.
Il le regarde quand il est malade.
Il le regarde les dimanches pluvieux,
en automne.
Il le regarde la veille de Noël.
Ted regarde Star Wars,
malade ou en bonne santé,
que ça aille bien ou pas.
Tu crois vraiment pouvoir faire semblant
d'aimer un film que tu détestes
pour le restant de ta vie ?
Alors, Ted a de la chance.
Ours.
Alors, voilà le truc.
April, connaissez-vous... Barney ?
Elle vient de finir son service,
elle cherche à relâcher la pression.
Vous nous excusez un instant ?
- Que fais-tu ?
- T'as été si gentil avec moi,
je voulais te rendre la pareille,
copilote style.
Donc, comme je disais,
Barney est le nouveau
deuxième base des Yankees.
Et Barney, April a demandé
si tu pouvais marquer un but pour elle
pendant le match de base-ball.
Ça s'invente pas.
Amusez-vous les enfants.
Alors, t'es nerveux pour le match ?
Ouais, je suis nerveux
pour l'autre équipe
parce que quand je serai
sur le marbre...
Je joue pas pour les Yankees.
D'habitude, j'aurais essayé
de t'en convaincre, mais c'est faux.
Je suis un type amoureux
de la fille qui vient de partir,
et ça sera jamais réciproque.
Donc, je vais y aller.
Et voilà.
Je suis désolé, Barney.
Tu peux pas abandonner.
Ça peut prendre du temps, mais
quand elle verra le nouveau Barney...
Quand ma famille sera au Yankee Stadium,
les tickets sont à ton nom ou au mien ?
Le mien, et dis à tes neveux
d'apporter leur gant.
Ils seront au pays
des balles fautes.
Allez. Mais pour Robin,
tout était vrai.
Nom de Dieu, Barney.
Pour la dernière fois,
tu ne peux pas, tu ne peux pas
être amoureux de Robin et coucher
avec toutes les bimbos de la Terre.
Tu dois choisir maintenant.
- Les bimbos.
- Quoi ?
Les bimbos me rendent heureux,
elles me font me sentir vivant.
Les bimbos me donnent envie de faire
semblant d'être meilleur.
L'histoire avec Robin n'était
qu'une passade, mais au bout du compte,
mon coeur est aux bimbos.
C'est un mécanisme de défense,
parce que tu as peur d'être blessé.
Tu es confus.
Oh, je ne suis pas confus.
Tu sais qui est confus ?
Les bimbos.
Elles sont facilement confuses.
C'est une chose parmi tant d'autres
que j'aime chez elles.
J'aime leur regard vide et naïf,
leur esprit léthargique
et sans histoire,
leur problème paternel non résolu.
Je les aime et elles m'aiment.
Les bimbos ont toujours été là pour moi,
contre vents et marées.
Plutôt le vent. Les mecs à bimbos
aiment pas les thons.
Et ouais !
À plus, Barney.
Kids, there is something
I wish my dad told me.
The longest pause
you will ever experience in your life
is the one that follows
asking the question...
Will you marry me?
Your brain goes into overdrive,
imaging every possible response.
No.
Oh, God, no.
You want me to marry...
No.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ted. I can't.
Mark Johnson,
the quarterback from your high school
football team, already asked me.
What's up, Turd?
It's Ted!
But if you're lucky,
she may answer with the single
greatest word in the English language.
Yes.

Stella and I spent that summer
happily engaged.
Marshall was still coping
with unemployment.
What are you doing?
Lily threw herself
into her painting.
What are you doing?
Barney was rehabilitating
from his bus accident.
What are you doing?
And well, Marshall just kept coping
with unemployment.
What are you doing?
And Robin continued to uphold the high
journalistic standards of Metro News 1.
Is your favorite brand of dental floss
poisoning your entire family?
Tune in at 11:00 for the shocking...
Tooth.
Okay, I officially hate my job.
I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who
shows up at night and scares people.
I'm the bogeyman
with a teleprompter.
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter."
That's hilarious!
Great joke, Robin, great joke.
Barney, no offense to Robin,
but that wasn't that funny.
Are you kidding?
That was a great joke.
It's smart, funny, beautiful,
the whole package.
It's everything you're afraid
to let yourself want.
In a joke.
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter."
Classic.
Okay, what is so urgent
that you called me and begged me
to come over at 7:22 in the morning?
I could tell you knew something
was up with me, and you're right.
But I can't tell you what it is.
I should tell you, but I can't!
I have to. I never will! I'm going to.
Let's just drop it. What's up with you?
Barney, just say it.
I think I'm in love with Robin.
Hey, Lily needs some gift ideas
for Stella's wedding shower.
Does she like to cook?
Actually, I don't know.
What's her favorite color?
Don't know that either.
- Well, does she have any hobbies?
- Yes.
She's exactly the kind of person
who would have hobbies.
And interests, too.
I am one lucky son of a bitch.
Dude,
you don't know anything
about the woman you're marrying.
What?
You're crazy! I know plenty.
What color are her eyes?
The color of the ocean
after a storm.
Which is?
Beautiful.
I don't believe it.
I thought you called me over here
to uncuff you from your sex swing again,
but you're in love?
That is so sweet!
It's not "sweet."
It's like a disease.
I slept with Robin one time
and I caught feelings.
I caught feelings bad.
I used protection and everything.
Barney, you don't "catch" feelings,
you just have them.
- And they're good.
- They're terrible!
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
She's all I think about.
I close my eyes, I see Robin.
I, I hear a song;
it reminds me of Robin.
Morning.
I sleep with that chick,
I'm thinking about Robin.
Okay, so I don't know
every single detail about Stella.
What's really about?
Do you not like her or something?
No, Ted, I like Stella lot.
She's a Mets fan.
Really?
It's just that everything with you
has moved so fast.
You've only known
each other a few months.
Don't you think maybe you should
slow things down a little bit?
- Get to know each other better?
- I'll have a whole life
time to get to know her better.
Right now,
I know the one thing that I have to:
that I love her.
You love her?
Barney, how can you be in love,
and still be sleeping
with anything that moves?
I'm sorry, I don't follow you.
That's like saying,
"How can an ant carry
"20 times its body weight,
but root beer floats
are still delicious?"
Are the two even related?
Really?
Barney, you're going to have
to stop screwing around
if you want to be Robin's boyfriend.
"Boyfriend"?
I don't want to be
Robin's boyfriend.
Well, what do you want, then?
I don't know.
I just want to be with her.
All the time.
I want to hear about her day
and tell her about mine.
I want to hold her hand
and smell her hair.
But I don't want to be
her stupid boyfriend.
Barney, what you just described
is a relationship between
a boyfriend and a girlfriend.
And a pretty clingy one at that.
Look, Lily, are you going to help me out
with this or not?
I'm a kindergarten teacher.
I see a confused, little kid in the
corner trying to eat the lefty scissors,
I gotta help the poor,
little bastard.
But only if you stop
sleeping around.
Deal?
Deal.
Coming up next,
is your local ice cream man actually
driving a roving meth lab on wheels?
Stay tuned for the full...
Scoop.
Really?
I know dudes think it's girlie
for a guy to cook, but us ladies?
- We find it mighty sexy.
- Really?
You know...
My grandma taught me how.
- Oh, yeah, she did.
- Yeah.
I had a lot of time after school
to watch her cook because
I wasn't good at sports.
I'm on fire right now.
Delicious. What's in this pesto?
Oh, you know, the usual:
basil, garlic, olive oil,
but can you guess
my secret ingredient?
Peanuts.
Yes. How did you know that?
- OK, let's my think, what else?
- You know what, sweetie?
I woke up so early
and I had a really long day at work.
And there was that whole thing
where you tried to kill me.
Can we please just go to sleep?
No, I clearly need
to know more about you.
Let's do firsts. First kiss?
Dale Harris, second grade.
You're talking like peck on the cheek
or a full-on passionate making out?
- Passionate making out.
- OK, yeah, Dale Harris, second grade.
First time you had sex.
- Dale Harris, second...
- Stop it.
Billy Devito,
sophomore year of college.
Prude.
Molly McKenzie,
junior year of high school.
Slut.
Robin just needs
to see this new see of you.
- So just call her up?
- Just call her up.
It's...
Hi, Robin.
She wasn't there.
I left a voice mail.
You left a voice,
but it wasn't male.
Barney, I don't get it.
You've called a million girls
a million times.
Yeah,
but those were just booty calls.
On a booty call,
you barely even have to talk.
Around 9:00 p.m., you say...
Hey, baby, it's Barney.
You busy tonight? Sweet.
See you in half an hour? Can't wait.
But the later it gets,
the fewer words you need.
Barney. Busy? Sweet.
And by 3:00 in the morning...
Sweet.
A question mark?
You got laid off a question mark?
It's no worse
than your super-obvious code words.
- Rhinoceros.
- We have to go.
Great. Now we need a new code word.
Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin.
What do I do?
No-no-no-no, aah!
Robin...
Great to hear from you.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
You called, went, and hung up.
What do you want?
Help me!
Just ask her something.
How are you feeling today?
Fine.
Something personal.
At what age
did you first get your period?
Did you just ask me
about about my period?
No, I did not.
Look, Barney, I'm at work right now.
Just ask her out.
Robin, I was wondering if...
Nothing. Gotta go. Bye.
That was just a practical joke.
I'm not really in love with Robin.
You should've seen
the look on your face.
There's cameras right there
and there and there.
What a legendary prank that
we're never going to speak of again.
Gross.
- First movie you ever saw.
- Benji,1981.
I watched it recently
with Lucy and I just thought,
"Oh, that dog is so dead right now."
What about you?
My dad took me to an old drive-in
to see the original Star Wars.
You know,
I've actually never seen Star Wars.
She's never seen Star Wars?!
Ted, the only people in the universe
who haven't seen Star Wars
are the characters,
and that's 'cause they lived them.
- That's 'cause they lived theStar Wars.
- You've got to calm down.
I told you. You didn't know
this girl well enough. What if...
- you show it{\to her}, she doesn't like it?
- Dude, it's just a movie.
Star Warsis your all-time
favorite movie,
and whether or not Stella likes
it is {\actually}important.
It's like, it's a test
of how compatible you guys are.
It's just a movie.
It's just a movie!
<i>121 awesome minutes later</i>
If Stella doesn't like this movie,
- I can't marry her.
- You can't.
- You want to watch it again?
- I do.
Where are the boys?
I thought this was a group thing.
I lied. They're not coming
and I'm about to leave.
Why?
Because...
they're not in love with Robin,
and neither am I.
I mean, she's great and sweet.
I'm not going to pretend
that I haven't noticed her body,
but this is off topic.
Good luck.
Wait, wait, I
can't do this.
She'll never take me seriously.
She thinks I'm some
womanizing idiot.
We both know
you're more than that.
How Robin the Barney
I met the other day.
You mean the insecure,
touchy-feely she-male
who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?
Ted hit that for over a year.
Wish me luck.
I just thought it'd be fun
to watch a movie tonight,
and since you've never seen Star Wars,
I figured why not?
No big deal.
It's pretty good.
Sounds like a plan.
I'm just grab a beer.
You want one?
The movie's already started, so...
It's some words flying through space.
I'm not going to read that anyway.
Oh, my God.
Off to a bad start.
What are you doing down there?
I'm making sure my best friend
is marrying the right woman.
That's what I'm doing.
What are you doing,
hiding behind the couch?
You need to get a job.
I really do, don't I?
So, Robin...
tell me about your day,
and not just what happened,
how you felt about what happened.
- What?
- I'm not looking to problem-solve,
I'm just looking to listen.
- Why are you acting like this?
- Like what?
You're being super nice. It's...
freaking me out. Be...
gross, be inappropriate.
Be Barney.
I'm being Barney,
and I think tonight's going to be
de... wait for it... lightful.
Delightful.
Right.
So I went
to the chiropractor yesterday.
That guy bent me over the table
and pounded me for a good hour.
Is insurance going to cover that?
Sometimes they don't.
That's it?
Today I was at the dentist.
That guy drilled me
all day long.
He drilled me hard.
He filled all of my cavities.
Come on, man.
- Your teeth look fantastic.
- Who are you?
What?
Nothing.
You were staring
at me.
You look really beautiful tonight.
You don't look
so bad yourself, mister.
Great scene, great scene.
Star Wars fun fact number seven...
George Lucas based
the film's structure
on Akira Kurosawa's
The Hidden Fortress.
He also owes a debt to Campbell's work
with comparative mythology.
Yeah, Ted,
I'm losing wood over here.
What's going on?
Nothing.
Wait, it's
really important to you
that I like this movie, isn't it?
I'm not gonna like it with you
staring at me the whole time.
Go to your room
and I will come get you when it's over.
Go.
Should I leave, too?
What part, what part?
Thanks.
Nothing?
Not even a glance?
Even I was thinking about rocking
a motorboat on those bad boys.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I don't always want to be that guy.
Sometimes I want to be someone
you can have
an actual conversation with.
Now, tell me something about you
that I don't know yet.
Seriously.
There's a job opening
at a new cable network
that would be perfect for me...
completely legit world news, interviews
with people who matter...
- but I decided I'm not going to apply.
- Why not?
Because I'm a joke.
I'm just the scary news lady
from some stupid local news channel.
We both know you're more than that.
Promise me you'll apply.
- It's not as easy...
- Promise me you'll apply.
I promise.
She's up to the scene
where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape
- from the Death Star's trash compactor.
- Great scene.
Greatscene?
Okay, we should have just heard...
but Stella didn't make a peep.
I'm gonna take a look.
She's not even watching.
She's texting.
- I'll tell her you {\still}want to be friends.
- I don't believe this.
I believe, she knows this is important
to me. She's blatantly...
"Stop watching me, jackasses."
- To taking chances.
- To taking chances.
You know, Robin, there's {\actually}something,
I do want to talk to you about.
- Last call.
- Of course it is.
- One more for the road?
- Yeah, why not?
Hold that thought?
I will.
- I loved it.
- Yes!
I am marrying a woman
who is not only hot
but loves Star Wars.
That's the dream.
- What was that?
- I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me
through the space-time continuum.
We did it.
We did it,
you masturbating little bastard.
Champagne for everybody.
It was so good.
- You hated it, didn't you?
- It's so stupid. First of all,
how do they understand that walking bear
they hang around with all the time?
- Wookiee.
- He goes...
They're all like,
"That's a good point, Bear,
- "let's try that."
- He's a Wookiee,
and his kind is actually
more intelligent than they appear.
That is Ted's favorite movie
of all time.
He watches it
when he's home sick with the flu.
He watches it on rainy
Sunday afternoons in the fall.
He watches it on Christmas Eve.
Ted watches Star Wars
in sickness and in health,
in good times and in bad.
Do you really think that you can pretend
to like a movie that you actually hate
for the rest of your life?
I do.
Then, Ted's a lucky guy.
Bear.
So, here's the deal.
April, have... you met Barney?
April just finished her shift,
she's looking to blow off some steam.
Would you excuse us for one sec?
- What are you doing?
- You were so nice to me tonight,
I wanted to return the favor,
wingwoman-style.
So, as I was saying,
Barney is the Yankees'
new second-baseman.
And Barney, April asked if tomorrow,
you could hit a goal for her
during the baseball match.
You can't make this stuff up.
So, you two kids have fun.
So are you...
nervous about the game?
Yeah, I'm nervous
for the other team
'cause when I step
up to that plate...
I am not a New York Yankee.
Any other night, I would {\probably}try
to convince you that I am, but I'm not.
I'm just some guy who's in love
with the girl that just left,
and she's never going
to feel the same way.
So I'm just going to go.
And that was it.
I'm so sorry, Barney.
You can't give up.
You know, it may take some time,
but once Robin sees the new you...
When my family gets to Yankee Stadium,
are the tickets under your name or mine?
My name, and tell your
nephews to bring their mitts.
They're going to be
in foul ball country.
Come on.
The Robin stuff was completely true.
Damn it, Barney.
I mean, for the last time,
you can't... you can't
be in love with Robin
and still be sleeping
with every bimbo on the planet.
You have to choose right now.
- I choose bimbos.
- What?
Bimbos make me happy.
Bimbos make me feel alive.
Bimbos make me want
to pretend to be a better man.
This whole thing with Robin was just
a fling, but at the end of the day,
my heart belongs to bimbos.
This is just a defense mechanism,
because
you're afraid of getting hurt.
You're just confused.
Oh, I'm not confused.
You know who is confused?
Bimbos.
They're easily confused.
It's one of the thousand little things
I love about them.
I love their vacant,
trusting stares, their sluggish,
unencumbered minds,
their unresolved daddy issues.
I love them and they love me.
Bimbos have always been there for me,
through thick and thin.
Mostly thin.
B- man don't do thick crust.
What up?
See you, Barney.
<i>Quand je suis arrivť ŗ New York,
c'ťtait crasseux, dťgueulasse,</i>
<i>sale, moche, miteux, puant</i>
<i>et complŤtement terrifiant.</i>
<i>Mais ensuite, malheureusement,</i>
<i>la ville entiŤre s'est amťliorťe.</i>
<i>Les rues sont devenues plus propres,</i>
<i>les locations sont devenues
plus chŤres, et un par un,</i>
<i>les vieux endroits minables que
l'on adorait ont disparu.</i>
<i>The Elbow Room,
un vieux club punk-rock,</i>

<i>McHale's, un lieu de rencontre
pour classes moyennes,</i>

<i>Et Fez, ce bar marocain gťnial

La Goliath National Bank.
Le leader mondial du crťdit

Dieu que j'aime
la Goliath National Bank !
Tout d'abord, tu ressembles
au dernier choix de la draft.
Ensuite, pourquoi tant d'excitation
pour une banque ?
Notre sociťtť les a rachetťs
lors d'une impitoyable OPA.
«a a pris deux mois.
«a a coŻtť 2 000 emplois.
C'ťtait brutal.
Qui veut un T-shirt ?
Marshall, ils engagent
au service juridique.
Je peux t'avoir un boulot.
Barney, Marshall n'a pas quittť
son dernier boulot de rapace
pour travailler dans une banque.
Il sera un avocat environnemental.
<i>C'ťtait le plan, de toute faÁon.</i>
<i>Les semaines suivantes, Marshall
passa beaucoup d'entretiens.</i>
Tu es confiant,
tu es ťnergťtique,
tu es concentrť !
<i>Beaucoup d'entretiens.</i>
Tu es flexible sur le salaire,
tu es prÍt ŗ faire des compromis,
tu ne vas pas pleurer, cette fois.
<i>Trop d'entretiens.</i>
Tu es triste,
tu es abattu,
tu vas supporter Áa,
rentrer ŗ la maison,
te mettre en caleÁon
et faire une sieste.
<i>Ce qui nous amŤne au 29 septembre,</i>
<i>la nuit du burger.</i>
Vous voulez manger quoi ce soir ?
On a un nouveau cuisinier.
Vous devez essayer le burger,
il est gťnial.
- Impeccable, on va en prendre cinq.
- Cinq burgers.
- Vraiment ? Vous voulez manger ici ?
- Ouais, je meurs de faim.
- Je viens de finir 7 jours de mťnage.
- T'as pas commencť hier ?
J'ai fini tŰt, OK†?
- Cinq comme Áa.
- Cinq burgers.
Attendez.
- Des sushis ?
- On en a mangť hier soir.
- Italien.
- J'en ai mangť ŗ midi.
- Je peux revenir.
- Non. On fait toujours Áa.
On dťbat pendant des heures
sur le repas, et on finit toujours ici.
J'ai pas mangť depuis deux jours.
Peut-on, pour l'amour de Dieu,
commander maintenant ?
Chinois ?
- J'aime pas le chinois.
- Indien ?
Je viens de dire
que j'aime pas le chinois.
Indien, c'est pas chinois.
Viande bizarre, drŰle de musique,
toujours du riz. Pourquoi on pinaille ?
Mexicain ?
Je viens de dire que
j'aime pas le chinois.
Mon Dieu.

Robin, le tien arrive tout de suite.
Bien sŻr, c'est le mien en dernier.
Allez-y, commencez sans moi.
T'aurais pas dŻ.
C'est tellement gentil.
Mon Dieu.
Ce burger est si bon.
C'est comme NoŽl dans ma bouche,
NoŽl avec de la viande.
C'est comme si un ange avait
atterri dans la cuisine
de chez MacLaren.
Oý le chef l'a tuť
et l'a passť sur le grill.
J'aime tellement ce burger,
que je me ferais bien recoudre le cul.
Correct.
Tu te fous de moi !
Les gars.
Quand t'as goŻtť au meilleur burger
de NY, tous les autres
ressemblent aux pieds de mon pťpť.
Mais mangez, apprťciez
les pieds de mon grand-pŤre.
Et t'as mangť le meilleur
burger de New York ?
C'ťtait il y a huit ans,
ma premiŤre semaine ŗ New York,
et pour un mŰme du Minnesota,
cette grande ville faisait peur.
Dieu merci, c'est toi.
Tu es ridicule.
- T'es sorti aujourd'hui ?
- Pourquoi Áa ?
Je peux tout me faire livrer,
et le c‚ble de New York est gťnial.
T'as vu cette ťmission locale
avec la vieille juive en bikini ?
C'est dťgoŻtant.
Tu dois te dťbarrasser
de cette paranoÔa.
- Tu vas pas te faire agresser.
- Et si Áa arrivait ?
J'ai pas de cran d'arrÍt,
je connais pas le breakdance
pour gagner le respect des gangs.
C'est bon, tu vas faire un tour.
Allez, vas-y.
Non. Regarde,
la vieille en bikini est de retour.
Je vais juste m'allonger
confortablement.
- Va dehors, allez.
- OK.
Laisse la batte.
D'accord.
<i>Donc je suis allť faire un tour
dans la grande et terrifiante ville.</i>
<i>Et j'ai dťcouvert un truc dingue :
c'ťtait pas du tout terrifiant.</i>
TrŤs bien.
Comment on dit ?
Votre quÍte est finie !
<i>Et juste quand j'ai commencť
ŗ avoir faim,</i>
<i>au coin de la rue...</i>
Il ťtait lŗ.
Le plus petit snack
qu'on ait jamais vu,
coincť entre un taxidermiste
et un sex shop.
Nommez deux endroits
oý on se fait fourrer.
Alors, je suis entrť.
Et j'ai commandť... "le" Burger.
Merci.
Ted, rťveille-toi.
Rťveille...
Oh, mon Dieu.
Je suis dťsolť. «a va ?
«a va.
Ted, je viens de manger le meilleur
burger de ma vie !
C'est un incroyable endroit,
Regis Philbin y mange,
c'est une sorte de repaire ŗ cťlťbritťs.
Mais le burger,
- le burger.
- Mec.
J'en veux un, tout de suite !
- C'est encore ouvert ?
- Je sais pas.
Les boutiques restent ouvertes
ŗ New York aprŤs 9 h 30 ?
Donc on est allťs
chercher des burgers.
Mais aprŤs des heures de recherche...
Putain !
C'est oý ?
- Vous avez pas trouvť ?
- On connaissait pas notre chemin.
Rien que rentrer ŗ l'appart
nous a pris 3 heures
- et une drag queen serviable.
- Penny Noir ťtait une drag queen ?
- Oý tu crois que c'ťtait ?
- Certainement coincť entre ses jambes.
Vous savez ce qui est gai ?
Prendre un crťdit foncier
ŗ la Goliath National Bank.
Je dis Áa...
Enfin, on n'a jamais retrouvť.
Maintenant, huit ans plus tard,
toujours...
pas de burger.
J'ai entendu votre conversation.
OK, allons-y.
- Je connais l'endroit dont vous parlez.
- Faux.
«a s'appelle le Bistro Du Coin.
Super burger.
Oh, le Bistro Du Coin !
Incroyable, j'ai passť
un quart de ma vie
ŗ chercher le meilleur burger
ŗ New York, mais trop bÍte,
Áa m'a jamais effleurť d'essayer
le burger numťro 1 au guide Zagat.
Merci, mec.
Laisse-moi te rendre la pareille.
Tu cherches un bon cafť :
Starbucks.
Donc t'as essayť le Bistro Du Coin.
J'ai testť tous les supposťs
meilleurs burgers
de New York en cherchant ce burger.
Ou du moins essayer de l'oublier.
On se casse.
Mais aucun resto lui arrivait
ŗ la cheville.
Y a eu cette fois oý on a cru Ítre
sur une piste, tu te souviens ?
…coutez Áa. Qui s'entraÓne
ŗ ma salle de sport ?
Regis Philbin.
La photo avec l'autographe.
…videmment, je m'en souviens.
C'est le meilleur burger de ma vie.
Je rÍve encore de ce burger.
De magnifiques, lancinants rÍves !
Je me lŤve la nuit en criant,
"Sors de ma tÍte, burger !
Sors !"
C'est celui-lŗ, M. Philbin.
- Vous vous souvenez de l'endroit ?
- Non ! Je l'avais pas notť.
Mais pas un jour ne passe
sans que je le regrette.
Pourquoi ? Vous savez oý il est ?
Et si vous me dites que c'est le Bistro
Du Coin, je vous pŤte la gueule !
- On sait pas oý c'est.
- …coute, Blondinet !
Dťconne pas avec moi !
Papa a besoin de son steak.
Je sais pas oý c'est Regis,
je le jure !
Et toi, Lurch ?
Et toi alors, grosses-lŤvres ?
C'est mon portable.
Si tu trouves ce burger, tu m'appelles
quelle que soit l'heure.
OK, Regis, on fera Áa.
Vous attendez quoi ?
Trouvez-moi ce burger !
- D'accord.
- Allez-y, tous !
L'histoire s'arrÍte lŗ.
Je suis condamnť ŗ errer sur Terre
pour toujours,
ŗ chercher cette porte verte
et ce nťon rouge indiquant "Burger".
Porte verte, nťon rouge
qui indique "Burger" ?
Je connais cet endroit.
Je suis passťe devant un paquet de fois.
C'est sur la 12e rue, juste aprŤs la 7e.
Je savais que c'ťtait
une rue numťrotťe !
- Enfin.
- Non ! Robin !
Si l'un de nous mange
un burger ce soir,
ce sera le meilleur burger
de New York.
On va en centre-ville†!
Je le crois pas, on va enfin
manger ce burger
Bťbť, je suis si excitťe pour toi.
AprŤs tous ces entretiens,
toutes ces dťsillusions,
tu mťrites un festin
de viande triomphant.
Tu sais ce que c'est aussi
une "bouchťe†" ?
Tout ce charabia que les autres
banques te racontent.
Au Goliath, la satisfaction des clients
est notre plus important investissement.
Je dťteste t'annoncer Áa, mais bosser
pour une banque c'est bancal.
C'est bancal d'avoir les factures
payťes automatiquement†?
C'est bancal d'avoir 3.3 % d'intťrÍts
annuels sur les ťconomies†?
C'est vrai. Je dťteste te faire passer
pour une idiote devant tes amis,
mais tu m'as pas laissť le choix.
- On devrait appeler Regis.
- Reg...
Ce type me fait peur.
Je vais lui envoyer un texto.
Kathy,
votre dernier lancer ťtait pile.
Celui d'avant ťtait face.
Vous avez interrogť le public,
ils sont divisťs, 50/50.
Aucune aide du tout, lŗ.
Donc, pour 258 000 $...
Je dois vous demander, Kathy.
Qu'est-ce que c'est va Ítre : pile...
ou...
Excusez-moi.
Oh, zut. Je dois y aller.
Je dois y aller†!
Porte verte,
enseigne au nťon rouge. Les gars,
c'est ici.
En fait,
- j'ai prťparť quelques mots.
- Je mangerai ta main.
Rentrons alors.
On peut†?
- Merci.
- Le vŰtre arrive.
Allez-y, commencez.
- Taisez-vous et mangez.
- D'accord.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Je ne me brosserai plus les dents
sauf si c'est avec une brosse ŗ dents
faite ŗ partir de ce burger.
Je crois que je viens juste
d'avoir mon premier burg-asme.
Je veux...
emmener ce burger dÓner,
puis peut-Ítre un film,
puis le ramener chez moi,
mettre un petit

et puis je...
batifolerais un peu.
Rien de sťrieux,
y aller doucement, vous voyez†?
- C'est pas lui.
- Quoi†?
C'est pas lui.
Tu voudras peut-Ítre pas
entendre Áa, mais...
c'est possible que ce soit le mÍme
burger que t'aies eu il y a 8 ans,
mais il pourra jamais Ítre
fidŤle ŗ tes attentes absurdes.
- C'est juste un burger.
- Juste un burger†?
C'est beaucoup plus
qu'un simple burger.
Je veux dire,
cette premiŤre bouchťe...
Oh, quel paradis,
cette premiŤre bouchťe.
Le pain, un sťsame avec
des taches de rousseur.
Le sein d'un ange,
reposant lťgŤrement
sur le ketchup
et la moutarde dessous.
Les saveurs mťlangťes
dans un sťduisant <i>pas de deux</i>.
Et puis...
un cornichon
le plus...
badin... petit cornichon,
et puis une rondelle de tomate,
une feuille de laitue, et un...
un p‚tť... de viande hachťe, si...
exquis...
tourbillonnant dans votre bouche,
se dťtachant
et se mťlangeant encore en une fugue
de douceurs et de saveurs si...
dťlicieuses.
C'est pas un simple sandwich
de viande grillťe
et de pain grillť.
C'est Dieu...
qui nous parle
ŗ travers la nourriture.
Et tu as pris nos vúux de mariage
sur internet.
OK, ťcoute, alors, ce n'est pas
le bon endroit.
OK, c'est pas grave.
C'est ailleurs, avec une porte verte
et une enseigne au nťon rouge
qui dit "Burger".
Je vais juste... Je vais appeler
tous les restaurants de Manhattan
et leur demander
de quelle couleur est leur porte.
Pas de problŤme, OK ?
Je vais faire Áa.
Je vais prendre le risque de dire
qu'il s'agit pas que d'un burger.
Marshall ne va pas bien les gars.
Il a vraiment besoin d'un boulot.
- Dis-leur pour les sous-vÍtements.
- Quoi les sous-vÍtements†?
«a a commencť il y a 2 semaines.
Pile !
«a va Ítre pile.
C'est presque toujours pile.
T'as mis un pantalon aujourd'hui†?
Non.
C'ťtait marrant au dťbut,
mais aprŤs,
c'est devenu une habitude.
J'ai pensť, "OK, au moins il ne sort
pas de la maison comme Áa".
Puis, un jour, il a ouvert la porte
et pris le journal.
Le jour d'aprŤs,
il est descendu pour le courrier.
Tout le monde a une zone de caleÁon.
Pour la plupart, Áa va
de la chambre ŗ la salle de bain,
mais ŗ mesure
que l'estime de soi diminue,
votre zone de caleÁon
devient plus grande.
De quelle taille est
la zone de caleÁon de Marshall ?
On se casse.
Allez Lily, il va finir
par trouver un boulot.
Tu sais, quand les temps sont durs,
j'aime me rappeler des mots ťdifiants
de ma chanson prťfťrťe.
"On sera ŗ tes cŰtťs
quand tu auras besoin d'un ami
"Contre vents et marťes
tu peux toujours compter
"Sur le numťro un de la banque

On doit trouver ce burger
pour Marshall.
- On est tous en train de le manger.
- Pas moi.
Si Marshall dit
que c'est pas le bon,
c'est pas le bon.
- Enfin.
- Excusez-moi.
Vous avez changť
de cuistot ou quoi ?
Mon mari est venu y a quelques annťes,
et le burger ťtait diffťrent.
On nous le dit souvent.
Cet endroit est la rťplique
d'un snack des quartiers chics,
avec la mÍme porte et le mÍme nťon.
- Les quartiers chics ? Oý Áa ?
- 106e et Manhattan Avenue.
Merde !
106, une rue avec des numťros.
Bien sŻr.
Barney, oý Ítes-vous ?
Pardon, mais vous Ítes... ?
Regis. Je suis devant.
Bien sŻr. Dťsolť, j'ai oubliť
de vous prťvenir. C'est pas lŗ.
C'est sur la 106e
et Manhattan Avenue.
- On est en route.
- Quoi ? Les quartiers chics ?
Bien, bien, j'y serai dans 20 min.
Si vous y Ítes en premier,
- cuit ŗ point.
- Oignons ?
- Oignons ?
- OK, pas d'oignons.
ArrÍtez le taxi !
Attendez.
C'est lŗ.
Votre quÍte est terminťe.
On a des filles qui se dťshabillent.
C'est ici.
Un des 9 000 emplacements pratiques.
C'ťtait...
C'ťtait juste lŗ, juste...
ŗ cet endroit.
Je comprends pas.
Oý est le snack ?
C'est plus un snack, c'est
un distributeur Goliath National Bank.
C'est bon. On a qu'ŗ manger ici.
On peut pas. C'est un distributeur.
Mais... manger.
- Mais que...
- C'est ta faute,
toi et ta stupide banque.
- C'est toi qu'as fait Áa.
- C'est pas ma... ArrÍte, OK.
ArrÍte Áa, Lily.
J'utiliserai jamais plus
de distributeur Goliath.
La Goliath National Bank pue !
C'est la pire banque
du monde entier.
Votre attention, New Yorkais,
cette banque craint !
Ils craignent !
- Ils craignent, craignent !
- Tu vas lui dire ŗ la fin ?
Me dire quoi ?
Me dire quoi ?
J'ai un travail.
Quoi ? Oý ?
Goliath National Bank.
C'est pour Áa que Barney arrÍte pas
de dire combien Goliath est gťniale.
Il voulait que tu t'enthousiasmes
pour moi comme on va bosser ensemble.
Techniquement, pas ensemble.
T'auras pas accŤs ŗ mon ťtage.
Mais tu voulais Ítre
avocat pour l'environnement.
Et je veux aussi Ítre un Harlem
Globetrotter et Ítre payť en bonbons.
En attendant,
j'ai besoin d'un boulot,
et c'est un trŤs bon boulot.
«a paye bien
et il y a plein d'avantages,
et pour Ítre honnÍte,
«a me donne une raison
de mettre un pantalon le matin.
J'ai toute ma vie pour sauver
la planŤte, mais pour l'instant
je suis tout excitť ŗ l'idťe
de remettre des pantalons.
Tu as de super pantalons.
- Je t'aime.
- Je t'aime.
- Ils sont pas ouverts.
- Donne.
- C'est au barbecue.
- Donne !
Dťsolť que t'aies pas eu ton burger.
C'est idiot. Je repense
ŗ cette premiŤre semaine ici.
Tu vois ?
J'avais 22 ans.
Mon futur ťtait devant moi.
J'imagine que je pensais qu'en mangeant
ce burger une derniŤre fois,
je ressentirais Áa une fois de plus,
je serais capable
de rayer Áa de ma liste,
et de grandir,
travailler pour une banque dťbile,
et juste... Ítre heureux.
Vous savez, ce snack n'a pas disparu.
Il a juste dťmťnagť.
Et je vous dis oý pour 100 billets.
100 billets ?
C'est dingue.
- Payons-le.
- J'ai payť pour le taxi.
- J'ai pas de liquide.
- J'ai pas bossť depuis Mars.
Si seulement il y avait
un moyen facile, pratique
de retirer du liquide tout de suite.
Membre du FDIC.
<i>Alors, on a payť ce type,
et 20 min plus tard...</i>
Merci.
Marshall, rappelle-toi : Il se peut
que Áa n'ait pas le mÍme goŻt.
Cet endroit a changť,
tu as changť, New York a changť.
Mets pas la barre trop haute, OK†?
- «a y est.
- Oui !
C'est exactement le mÍme.
C'est le meilleur burger
de New York.
Allez, mangez, mangez.
<i>Et donc, aprŤs avoir enfin retrouvť
le burger qu'il dťsirait</i>
<i>depuis de longues annťes,</i>
<i>Marshall s'est levť le lendemain,
a mis un pantalon,</i>
<i>et est allť travailler,</i>
<i>et ne se retourna pas.</i>
Je veux des petits draps
pour ce burger, et juste...
ramper dans ce pain,
m'y mettre ŗ l'aise, et y mourir.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Je te veux en moi.
C'est tellement bon.
J'ai peur de mettre
ce burger enceinte.
Si ce burger est enceinte,
j'ai des droits
sur les dťlicieux bťbťs burger.
- C'est pas le bon.
- Quoi ?
Allez.
- C'est scandaleux.
- C'est incroyable.
Attendez.
C'est le bon !
- Vous vous fichiez de nous.
- Non, vraiment.
<i>When I first moved to New York,
it was dingy, disgusting,</i>
<i>dirty, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky</i>
<i>and altogether terrifying,</i>
<i>but then, sadly.</i>
<i>The whole city started to go uphill.</i>
<i>The streets got a little cleaner,</i>
<i>the rents got a little higher,
and one by one,</i>
<i>the crappy old places we loved
began to disappear.</i>
<i>The Elbow Room,
an old punk rock club,</i>
<i>became a drugstore.</i>
<i>McHale's,
a working-class watering hole,</i>

<i>And Fez, a Moroccan-themed lounge,</i>
<i>became a bank.</i>
<i>And not just any bank.</i>
Goliath National Bank.
The world leader
in credit and banking.
God, I love Goliath National Bank!
Okay, first of all, you look like
the last pick in the draft.
And, second, why are you so excited
about some bank?
Our company just bought them
out in a ruthless takeover.
Took two months.
Cost 2,000 jobs.
It was brutal.
Who wants a T-shirt?
Hey, Marshall, they're hiring
in the legal department.
I could get you a job.
Barney, Marshall didn't quit his
last soul-sucking corporate job
just to go work at a bank.
He's gonna be
an environmental lawyer.
<i>That was the plan, anyway.</i>
<i>Over the next few weeks, Marshall
went on a lot of interviews.</i>
You are confident,
you are energetic,
you are focused!
<i>A lot of interviews.</i>
You are flexible on salary,
you're willing to compromise,
you're not gonna cry this time.
<i>Too many interviews.</i>
You are sad,
you are beaten down,
you will get through this,
come home,
get in your big underpants
and take a nap.
<i>Which brings us to September 29,</i>
<i>the night of the burger.</i>
So, what do you guys
want to do for dinner?
Oh, we just got a new cook.
You have to try the burger,
it's amazing.
- Great, we'll take five of those.
- Five burgers.
- Really? You want to eat here?
- Yeah, I'm freaking starving.
- I just finished a seven-day cleanse.
- I thought you started that yesterday.
I finished early, OK?
- Five of those.
- Five burgers.
Wait.
- What about sushi?
- We had sushi last night.
- Italian.
- I had Italian for lunch.
- I can come back.
- No. We always do this.
We spend an hour arguing about
where to eat,
and we end up here anyway.
I haven't eaten for two days.
Can we please, for the love of God,
just order something now?
Chinese?
- I don't like Chinese.
- Indian?
I just said I don't like Chinese.
Indian isn't Chinese.
Weird meats, funny music,
side of rice.
Why are we splitting hairs?
Mexican?
I just said I don't like Chinese.
God.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
Robin, yours will be right out.
Of course, mine comes last.
Go ahead, start without me.
Sweet! You shouldn't have.
That's so kind of you.
My God.
This burger is so good.
It's like Christmas in my mouth,
meat Christmas.
It's like an angel from heaven
landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's.
Where the chef killed it and ran
it through the meat grinder.
I love this burger so much,
I want to sew my ass shut.
It's okay.
Are you kidding me?
Guys, guys, guys.
When you've had the best burger
in NY, every other burger
tastes like my grandpa's feet.
But you guys eat up,
enjoy my grandpa's feet.
And you've had the
best burger in New York.
It was eight years ago,
my first week in New York,
and for a kid from Minnesota,
the big city was a scary place.
Oh, thank God it's just you.
You are being ridiculous.
- {\Tell me}You left the apartment today?
- Why would I have to leave?
I can have anything I want delivered,
and New York City cable is awesome.
Have you seen this public access show
with the old Jewish lady in a bikini?
It's disgusting.
Marshall, you have to
get over this paranoia.
- You are not gonna get mugged.
- What if I do, Ted
I don't have a switchblade.
I don't know how to break-dance
and win the begrudging respect
of a street gang.
That's it, you're taking a walk.
Come on, go.
No. Look, the old lady
in a bikini is back on.
I'm just gonna lie back
and get comfortable.
- Go outside, go, go.
- Okay.
Leave the bat.
Fine.
So I went for a walk
in the big, scary city.
And I discovered something amazing:
it wasn't scary at all.
All right.
What's the word?
Your search is over!
<i>And then, right when I started
to get a little hungry,</i>
<i>I turned a corner...</i>
And there it was.
The tiniest little
burger joint you ever saw,
tucked between a taxidermist
and a triple-X bookstore.
Name two places
where things get stuffed.
So, I went inside.
And I ordered the burger.
Thank you.
Ted, you got to wake up.
Wake...
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
I'm all right.
Ted, I've just had the most
amazing burger of my life!
It's this awesome little place,
Regis Philbin eats there,
so it's sort of like
a celebrity hot spot. But the burger,
- The burger.
- Dude.
I want one of those
burgers right now!
- Do you think they're still open?
- I don't know.
Does stuff in New York
stay open past... 9:30?
So we went out
to get another burger.
But after hours of searching...
Damn it!
Where is this place?
- You couldn't find it?
- We didn't know our way around.
Just getting back to the apartment
took us three hours
- and one very helpful drag queen.
- Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen?
- Where do you think it was?
- Probably tucked between her legs.
You know what's not a drag?
Getting a home equity loan
at Goliath National Bank.
I'm just saying.
Anyways, we never found the place.
Now, eight years
have passed, still...
No burger.
I couldn't help but overhear.
Okay, here we go.
- I know the place you're talking about.
- No, you don't.
It's a place
called the Corner Bistro.
Greatburger.
Oh, the Corner Bistro!
It's amazing, I spent
a quarter of my life
searching for the best burger
in New York City, but silly me,
it never occurred to me to check
the highest-rated burger
in the Zagat guide.
Wow, thanks a lot, guy.
Let me return the favor.
Great cup of coffee:
Starbucks.
So I take it you've
tried the Corner Bistro.
I've tried every
so-called best burger
in New York City
trying to find that burger.
Or at least forget about her.
We're going.
But none of those places
even came close.
There was that one time we thought
we had a break in the case, remember?
Get this.
- You know who works out at my gym?
- Regis Philbin.
The autographed picture.
Of course I remember the place.
It was the best burger I ever had.
I still have dreams
about this burger.
Beautiful, haunting dreams!
I wake up at night screaming,
"Get out of my head, burger!
Get out!"
That's the one, Mr. Philbin.
- Do you rember where it is?
- No! I never wrote it down.
But not a day goes by
that I don't regret it.
Why? Why? Do you know where it is?
- No.
- And if you tell me
it's at the Corner Bistro, I'm gonna
smack you right in the face!
- We don't know where it is.
- Listen, Blondie!
Don't mess with me!
Daddy needs his meat.
I don't know where it is,
Regis, I swear!
What about you, Lurch?
And what about you, satchel-mouth?
This is my cell.
You find that burger,
you call me day or night.
OK, Regis, we will, we will.
What are you waiting for?
Get out and find the burger!
- All right.
- Let's go, all of you!
That's where my story ends.
Now I'm doomed to walk the earth
forever searching
for that green door
and that red neon sign
that says "Burger."
Green door, red neon sign
that says "Burger?"
I know that place.
I've walked by it a million times.
It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.
I knew it was on a numbered street!
- Finally.
- No! Robin!
If any of us is gonna
eat a burger tonight,
it's gonna be
the best burger in New York.
We're going downtown!
No...
I cannot believe we're finally
gonna have this burger
Honey, I'm so excited for you.
After all these interviews,
after all these disappointments,
you deserve a triumphant
mouth full of meat.
You know what else is a mouthful?
All that double-talk other banks
give you. At Goliath,
customer satisfaction
is our most important investment.
I hate to break this to you,
but working for a bank's kind of lame.
How lame
is free automatic bill pay?
How lame is 3.3% APY
online savings?
That's right. Hate to make you
look stupid in front of your friends,
but you left me no choice.
- We should probably call Regis.
- Reg...
That guy scares me.
I think I'll leave him a text.
Now, Kathy,
your last flip was heads.
The one before that was tails.
You polled the audience,
they came out split, 50/50.
No help at all there.
So, for $258,000...
I have to ask you, Kathy,
what's it gonna be: heads...
or...
Excuse me.
Oh, boy. I've got to go.
I've got to go!
Green door,
red neon sign. Guys,
this is the place.
I've actually,
- I prepared a few words.
- I will eat your hand.
Let's just go inside then.
Shall we?
- Thank you.
- Yours will be right out.
Please, go ahead, start.
- Just shut up and eat.
- All right.
Oh, my God.
I'm never brushing my teeth again
unless it's with a toothbrush
made from this burger.
I think I just had
my first burg-asm.
I want...
to take this burger out to dinner,
then maybe a movie,
then take it back to my place,
put on a little
Terence Trent D'arby,
and then I would just...
fool around a little bit.
Nothing serious,
just take it slow, you know?
- This isn't it.
- What?
It's not it.
Marshall, you might not
want to hear this, but...
is it at all possible this is the same
burger you had eight years ago,
only it could never live up
to your ridiculously high expectations?
- I mean, it is just a burger.
- Just a burger?
It's so much more
than just a burger.
I mean,
that first bite...
Oh, what heaven
that first bite is.
The bun, like a sesame-freckled
breast of an angel, resting gently
on the ketchup
and mustard below. Flavors
mingling in a seductive <i>pas de deux</i>.
And then...
a pickle
the most...
playful... little pickle,
and then a slice of tomato,
a leaf of lettuce, and a...
a patty... of ground beef, so...
exquisite...
swirling in your mouth,
breaking apart
and combining again in a fugue
of sweets and savories so...
delightful.
This is no mere sandwich
of grilled meat
and toasted bread.
This is God...
speaking to us through food.
And you got our wedding vows
off the Internet.
Okay, look, so, so this,
this isn't the place.
All right, it's no big deal.
It's another place with a green door
and a red neon sign
that says "Burger. "
I'll just... I'll call
every restaurant in Manhattan
and ask 'em
what color their door is.
No big deal, right?
Let's do this.
I'm going to go out on a limb here
and say this isn't just about a burger.
Marshall's not doing
so well, guys.
He really needs to get a job.
- Tell them about the underpants.
- What about the underpants?
It started a couple
of weeks ago.
Heads!
It's going to be heads.
It's almost usually heads.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey!
Did you put on pants today?
Nope.
It was funny at first,
but then it became a daily thing.
I thought, "Okay, well, at least
he's not leaving the house like that. "
Then, one day, he opened
the door to get the paper.
Day after that,
went downstairs to get the mail.
Everyone's got
an underpants radius.
For most of us, it's the distance
from the bedroom to the bathroom,
but as your self-esteem
gets smaller,
your underpants radius gets bigger.
How big is
Marshall's underpants radius?
We're going.
Come on, Lily,
he'll find a job eventually.
You know, Lil,
when times are tough,
I like to remember the uplifting words
of my favorite song.
"We'll be on your side
when you need a friend
"Through thick and thin
You can always depend
"On the world leaders
In credit and banking
"Goliath National Bank."
Member FDIC.
We've got to find
Marshall that burger.
- I think we're all eating that burger.
- I'm not eating that burger.
No, if Marshall says
this isn't the burger,
this isn't it.
- Finally.
- Excuse me.
Did you guys change
cooks or something?
Because my husband was here 5 years ago,
he's sure he had a different burger.
Yeah, we get this a lot.
This place is modeled
after this other place uptown with
the same green door and "Burger" sign.
- What? Uptown? Where?
- 106th and Manhattan Avenue.
Damn it.
106. A numbered street. Of course.
Barney, where the hell are you?
I'm sorry, this is...?
Regis. I'm at the place.
Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot
to call you. That's not the place.
The real place is on 106th
and Manhattan Avenue.
- We're headed there right now.
- What? Uptown?
Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20.
If you get there first,
- medium rare.
- Onions?
- Onions?
- Okay, no onions.
Stop the cab!
Wait.
This is it.
Your search is over.
We got girls taking
off their clothes.
This is it.
One of 9,000 convenient locations.
It was ri...
it was right here. It was...
it was right on this very spot.
I don't understand.
Where is the burger place?
It's not a burger place anymore,
it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.
That's fine. Let's just eat here.
We can't eat here. It's an ATM.
But... food.
What the...
This is your fault,
you and your stupid bank.
- You did this.
- It's not my... Stop, okay.
Stop that, Lily.
I will never use
a Goliath ATM ever again.
Goliath National Bank sucks.
It's the worst bank
on the face of the earth.
Attention, New Yorkers,
this bank sucks!
- They suck!
- Geez.
- They suck, suck!
- Will you just tell her already?
Tell me what?
Tell me what?
I got a job.
What? Where?
Goliath National Bank.
That's why Barney's been going on
and on about how, how great Goliath is.
He wanted you to be excited for me
since we will to working together.
Well, technically not together.
You won't have access to my floor.
But you want to be
an environmental lawyer.
Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem
Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but
in the meantime,
I need a job, and this is,
this is a really good one.
It's great pay and
there's good benefits,
and to be honest,
it gives me a reason to put
on pants in the morning.
You know, I have my whole life
to save the planet, but right now
I'm kind of really excited
to wear pants again.
You've got great pants.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- They're unopened.
- Give it.
- They're barbecue.
- Give it!
I'm sorry you didn't get
your burger.
It's stupid. I think about that
first week in New York.
You know?
I was 22 years old.
I had my whole future ahead of me.
I guess I just kind of thought that if
I could have that burger one more time
and feel that way
for one more night,
that I might be able to
check that off the list,
and grow up,
go work for the stupid bank,
and just... be happy.
You know, that burger place isn't gone.
It just moved to a new location.
And I can tell you where that is
for a hundred bucks.
A hundred bucks?
That's crazy.
- Let's pay the man.
- I paid for the cab.
- I have any cash.
- I haven't worked since March.
If only there were an easy,
convenient way
to get some cash right now.
Member FDIC.
<i>So we paid the guy,
and 20 minutes later...</i>
Thank you.
All right, Marshall, remember.
It might not taste as good.
This place has changed,
you've changed, New York has changed.
Just... don't get
your hopes up too high, okay?
- This is it.
- Yes!
It's exactly the same.
It's the best burger in New York.
Go ahead, eat up, eat up.
<i>And so, after finally tasting again
the burger he'd craved</i>
<i>for so many years,</i>
<i>Marshall got up the next morning,
put on some pants,</i>
<i>and went to work,</i>
<i>and he never looked back.</i>
I want to get tiny fitted sheets
for this burger, and just...
crawl into this bun,
get all cozy, and die there.
Oh, my God.
I just want you inside of me.
This feels so good.
I'm worried I'm gonna get
this burger pregnant.
If he does get
that burger pregnant,
I have dibs
on the delicious burger babies.
- This isn't it.
- What?
Come on.
- That's outrageous.
- That is unbelievable.
Wait.
This is it!
- You were just freakin' teasing us.
- No, really.
<i>Pendant l'automne 2008,
j'avais un petit problème.</i>
Bon, il faut que j'aille
chez Stella.
Ce soir, c'est le grand soir.
J'ai essayé avant, j'ai toujours failli.
Cette fois, je vais réussir.
Ce soir...
je me fais une lesbienne.
Robin, ton rouge à levres.
Oh, non !
- Prenez des photos, d'accord ?
- Salut, Ted.
<i>Je vivais à NY,</i>
<i>mais Stella vivait de l'autre côté</i>
<i>de la rivière, dans le New Jersey...</i>
Oh, non !
<i>... donc je prenais
tout le temps le train.</i>
- Quoi de neuf, Ted ?
- Salut, Matisse.
- T-Diddy !
- Theodore !
- T'as loupé ça.
- Robin a eu le job de présentatrice.
Et on a une bouteille
de champagne gratuite.
Mais elle est vide maintenant.
Oh, non !
<i>Du coup, c'était comme si</i>
<i>je ratais toujours tout.</i>
Désolée, on a pas pu attendre.
Ça refroidissait.
Oh, non !
- Hé, gros.
- Quoi de neuf, G ?
- Ça va ?
- Ouais, ça va. C'est juste que...
Tu sais, je veux passer du temps
avec vous, avec mes amis.
J'ai l'impression de passer
ma vie dans le train.
Justement, pourquoi t'invites pas
tes amis à venir ici ?
C'est une super idée.
Tu veux qu'on aille dans le New Jersey ?
Oh, c'est grandiose.
- Pourquoi ?
- Pour commencer,
je n'ai plus mes médaillons en or.
Je les ai vendus quand
ils se sont démodés, il y a 400 ans.
- Lily ?
- Désolée, Ted.
Je suis une New Yorkaise pur jus.
Je suis programmée
pour mépriser et détester
le New Jersey et tout
ce qu'il représente.
Pourquoi je te dis ça ?
Tu le détestes plus que quiconque.
Quoi ? J'aime le New Jersey.
Pourquoi tu dis ça ?
Et là, il me passe devant.
Je hais qu'on respecte pas les files
d'attente plus que le New Jersey.
En fait, c'est faux. Y a rien
que je haïsse plus que le New Jersey.
Génial, hein ?
- On t'attend ?
- Non, ça va prendre un moment.
Je dois lâcher un New Jersey massif.
Donc le New Jersey
est pas mon endroit favori.
Mais quand on sera mariés,
et qu'elles auront emménagé avec moi,
je n'y remettrai jamais les pieds.
Sauf si je vais voir les Giants
ou que j'évacue New York
ou que je me débarrasse d'un corps.
Ted, si tu m'assassines et
m'enterres dans le New Jersey,
je te hanterai à tout jamais.
Et si je t'assassine
et t'enterre ailleurs ?
Je te laisserai tranquille.
Je suis sûre que t'avais tes raisons.

<i>Les enfants, votre tante Robin
en avait marre de son boulot,</i>
<i>marre de la production minable...</i>
Je suis Robin Scherbatsky,
et vous regardez...
Etro News One à 23 h.
Et encore à 1 h.
<i>... marre des histoires
qu'elle devait annoncer.</i>
Donc dépechez-vous de voter pour
le chien le plus mignon de New York.
<i>... et plus que tout,
marre des jeux de mots stupides.</i>
Quatre ouvriers ont été électrocutés
quand un métro a déraillé.
Restez ici pour plus de...
dé-rails choquants.
Joel, des gens sont morts.
<i>Donc, quand elle a su qu'elle était
présentatrice nationale,</i>
<i>elle a enfin pu dire les mots</i>
<i>qu'elle rêvait de dire
depuis des années...</i>
<i>Ce soir sera ma dernière émission.</i>
<i>Je suis arrivée à Metro News One
comme une petite chenille.</i>
<i>Et pendant quatre ans,
ce bureau a été mon cocon.</i>
<i>Mais ce soir,</i>
<i>j'ai mué en un ambitieux papillon.</i>
Pourquoi elle a l'air idiote ?
Elle a eu une attaque ?
Ouais, une attaque de génie.
Ce discours est vraiment bon.
<i>Avec un oeil sur l'horizon,</i>
<i>un oeil sur la vérité,</i>
<i>et un oeil sur vous tous.</i>
C'est toi qui l'as écrit, non ?
C'est une version modifiée
de celui que j'ai fait
quand j'ai quitté l'équipe de natation
à cause d'un problème d'oreille.
- Tu portais les serviettes.
- Ça fait partie de l'équipe.
<i>Ce samedi quand Robin est partie
pour son premier jour,</i>
<i>on a traversé la rivière pour vivre</i>
<i>les folles nuits du New Jersey.</i>
Stella a pas trouvé de baby-sitter,
on est coincés. À la place,
on va tous rester ici
et ça va être génial.
Bien, on a des jeux de société,
on a des films.
Et il doit rester de la bière
dans le garage.
C'est pathétique.
C'est samedi soir.
On devrait se soûler dans un bar.
Je sais que ça a l'air déprimant,
presque tragique, mais c'est un fait.
Ouais, et je veux un autre verre
pour cette nana, Doris.
Je sais que je peux poser
cet avion lesbien.
Pas de serpents dans cet avion.
Allez les gars, vous avez promis.
On reste là et on essaye
de s'amuser.
On est tous là. Être entre amis.
C'est pas ça le principal ?
Avec le prochain train,
on peut être au MacLaren's à 23 h.
- On peut y être à 22 h.
- Non, je dois me changer.
J'y vais pas
en sentant le New Jersey.
Vous détestez vraiment ce coin.
Quoi ? Non !
Non je comprends, vous êtes
New Yorkais, il vous faut un bar.
Vous pourriez aller
au bar le plus cool de l'état,
qui se trouve si près
que vous n'allez pas y croire.
Et badaboum, voilà.
Le bar le plus cool du New Jersey.
Ouais, probablement.
C'est génial !
On a des fléchettes.
Une moitié de table de ping-pong.
Un aquarium.
Regardez comme ça devient
une soirée géniale comme prévu.
On pourrait verser de l'appât
et les regarder se battre.
Non merci.
Je joue pas avec les aquariums
sauf s'ils ont mes 2 animaux préférés :
le poisson-pilote et la tor<i>turlute</i>.
T'as vu !
Pour tor<i>turlute</i> ? T'as raison.
- Marshall.
- Tu vaux mieux que ça.
Pas assez bon.
Désolée.
Je baisse pas le bras tant
qu'on me fait pas le respect
des phalanges d'une autre personne
frôlant les miennes
de façon douce, mais virile.
Petit, petit...
Petit, petit...
Petit... C'est qui le petit bébé ?
Sachez que tant qu'il n'a pas
ce qu'il veut.
Non, mérite.
Ce poing ne fléchira pas.
Il ne...
fléchira...
pas.
- Qui veut jouer au Scrabble ?
- Oui, pourquoi pas.
Écoutez, la lettre "X"
est un peu difficile à lire,
car il y a quelques années,
elle a cheminé dans mon chien.
Tu sais, on devrait prendre un chien
quand tu viendras vivre ici.
Quand je quoi ?
Super. Voilà Robin.
Je croyais qu'elles venaient
vivre chez toi.
Moi aussi.
Mon Dieu,
je déménage au New Jersey ?
Les mecs, je suis sûr
que le chien devait planer
après avoir avalé son comprimé X.
Trop bon !
Allez !
- Je peux pas vivre ici.
- C'est pas si mal.
Tu peux mettre un mini frigo, là,
et peut-être un Air Hockey.
Air Hockey. Bien joué mon gros.
Je parle du New Jersey
en général, pas de ce sous-sol.
Elle veut que j'emménage ?
Je pige pas.
On en a discuté y a des mois.
Je pensais qu'après le mariage,
Lucy et toi pourriez
vous installer ici.
Ouais, elle pourrait jouer
dans l'escalier de secours,
être copine avec le type qui dort
sur un canapé dans l'allée,
faire du vélo sur Broadway.
Super idée, Ted.
Je comprends pas
qu'on veuille vivre dans le New Jersey
quand on peut vivre à Manhattan ?
Je pensais que mon appart était
une de ses raisons pour m'épouser.
Sérieux, je pensais
que c'était la seule. Trop fort !
T'es resplendissante.
- Tape le Barnacle.
- Stella m'a déjà prévenue.
- Alors, ton premier jour ?
- Ça l'était pas.
- Quoi ?
- C'était pas mon 1er jour.
Je suis arrivée
et il y avait 20 personnes.
En fait, j'ai pas vraiment eu le boulot.
J'ai juste eu un entretien.
- Comment ça ?
- Je sais pas.
Il m'a dit que je l'avais eu.
Je l'ai eu ?
Je l'ai eu !
<i>Soyons clairs,
quand je dis "vous l'avez,"</i>
<i>je parle de l'entretien.</i>
<i>Vous avez l'entretien.</i>
<i>Je ne veux pas
qu'il y ait confusion.</i>
<i>Vous avez seulement l'entretien.</i>
<i>Pas le job.</i>
Merci ! Merci !
Je vais appeler et supplier Joel
de me redonner mon job.
- Non !
- Tu détestes ce job.
C'était pas si mal.
Comment ils t'ont fait appeler
le cyclone Hector
quand il pleuvait des cordes ?
Un cycorde.
- T'es dans l'oeil du cycorde.
- Merci.
Méchant.
C'est nul, mais je peux faire quoi ?
Je vais pas avoir l'autre job.
Vous auriez vu
les autres femmes à l'entretien.
Elles étaient toutes
plus expérimentées,
plus "ethniques".
Il y avait une fille noire
aux yeux bleus.
- Comment je peux rivaliser ?
- Tu peux pas.
Tu peux rivaliser
avec n'importe qui.
T'es Robin Scherbatsky.
Confiante, forte, grande.
Avec des jambes super longues
qui sont superbes dans un short.
J'appelle Joel.
Si tu l'appelles maintenant,
tu le regretteras.
J'ai couché avec plein de femmes
qui m'ont ensuite envoyé paître
puis déguerpi.
Et parfois,
elles prennent le téléphone
et elles m'appellent et on remet ça.
Et quand on a fini,
je vois ce regard sur leur visage,
ce regard qui dit
qu'elles se détestent
et qu'elles voudraient
n'avoir jamais appelé.
Mais si tu pouvais voir ce regard...
En fait, tu peux voir ce regard,
il y a une vidéo, www...
Arrête. Je n'appellerai pas.
Buvez pas la bière !
Je me rappelle quand je l'ai achetée.
C'était avant de tomber
enceinte de Lucy.
Tu peux aller en prendre à PriceCo ?
Pendant que t'y seras,
fais-toi une carte.
T'iras sûrement là-bas
tout le temps.
C'est le regard.
Je peux pas habiter ici.
Je déteste être ici.
Je me tuerais.
Le New Jersey n'est pas si mal.
Stella a une pelouse.
Tu pourrais avoir une tondeuse à gazon.
Ils en vendent là-bas.
J'en ai vu avec un porte-tasse.
J'ai vu une chaise longue
avec un porte-tasse.
J'ai même vu un hamac
avec un porte-tasse.
Tu vis dans le New Jersey,
tu n'auras plus à tenir une tasse.
Ça me pose pas de problème
de tenir une tasse, contrairement à toi.
Je te donnerai
100 $ pour frapper mon poing.
200 $.
Baisse-le, Barney.
Ton bras doit te faire souffrir.
10 000 $.
Tu seras de l'autre côté de la rivière.
Tu seras à New York tout le temps.
Excusez-moi.
- Vous êtes de New York ?
- On habitait Manhattan.
- Allez-vous en ville ?
- Tout le temps.
- Tu vois ? Tout le temps.
- C'était quand la dernière fois ?
On a dîné chez O'Rourke.
C'est fermé depuis six ans.
Ça fait un moment.
Marrant, ça nous manque pas.
Je suppose qu'on est
des New Jersey-iens, maintenant.
Chérie, regarde,
des t-shirts avec des chiens.
Je peux pas faire ça.
Je vais dire à Stella
qu'elle et Lucy doivent venir
en ville et c'est tout.
Vous en pensez quoi les gars ?
Beagle ou Boston terrier ?
C'est des larmes ?
Ce sont de grandioses...
larmes viriles de douleur.
Elles ne sont pas émotionnelles.
Elles sont un peu émotionnelles.
Où est Robin ?
Shirley, c'est Robin.
J'appelle Joel.
Robin, raccroche.
Ne fais pas ça.
Désolée, je sais, OK ?
- Si tu raccroches pas...
- Arrêtez !
Joel, c'est Robin.
Alors, Mme Papillon veut
revenir dans son cocon.
Je suis désolée
d'avoir dit tous ces trucs.
Tu peux mettre tes excuses
avec tes chaussettes,
car tu as déjà été remplacée.
Brian est au maquillage
et il est on ne peut plus excité.
Je peux pas faire ça.
Je peux pas faire ça.
Écoute, bien que je veuille voir
ce collégien se faire dessus
devant la caméra,
si tu peux être ici pour le 23 h,
tu pourras récupérer ton boulot.
OK, j'ai une demi-heure
pour arriver au studio.
Tu pourras jamais
être en ville en 30 min.
Fais pas ça.
C'est effrayant de parier sur soi,
si tu le fais pas, personne le fera.
Je dis pas ça pour qu'on tape mon poing.
Même si, un coup de poing
serait génial. Je le pense vraiment.
Je parie sur moi.
Je parie que je peux y être pour 23 h.
- T'as la bière ?
- Ouais, j'ai pris un pack de 144.
Le reste est dans le coffre.
Et tu t'es inscrit ?
- Pourquoi ?
- Y avait la queue pour les photos,
mes cheveux sont en l'air...
Je veux pas vivre dans le New Jersey.
Quoi ?
Je peux pas.
Et je vois aucune raison à ce que
vous ne veniez pas à New York.
Ma fille va à l'école ici.
Tous ses amis sont ici.
J'ai vécu ici toute ma vie.
Toute ma famille est ici.
C'est ma maison. Je suis à l'APE.
Et depuis le 1e juin,
je suis le maire adjoint.
Oui, mais mon appartement
est tout près du métro.
On déménage pas,
fin de la discussion.
Comment ça "fin de la discussion" ?
On en a jamais eu.
C'est ça d'être un parent.
Je veux pas déraciner Lucy.
Des gens avec des enfants
déménagent tout le temps.
Ce serait super pour Lucy de grandir
dans la plus grande ville du monde.
On y est. New York est la plus grande
ville dans le monde entier.
Où les rêves se réalisent et la merde
de pigeons a un goût de tapioca.
Tu veux un petit secret ?
Le New Jersey...
est mieux que New York.
Mieux que... ?
Tu penses... ? Je...
L'Empire State Buil...
H et H Bage...
Le centre Linco... Les Zabar...
Papaya King.
New York est le centre intellectuel
et culturel de la planète.
New York est plein de cinglés,
de snobs et de gens méchants.
Tu sais qu'une fois une vieille femme
m'a traitée de salope
et m'a jeté un chat à la figure ?
Et tu veux savoir
si c'est pareil dans le New Jersey ?
86e et Lex, juste en face
de ton cher petit Papaya King.
Les gens du New Jersey sont sympa.
C'est le genre d'endroit
où tu connais tes voisins.
Hé, je connais mes voisins !
Oui, genre qui ?
À l'autre bout du hall, il y a...
Clax... pa... mon.
- Claxpamon ?
- Il s'appelle Paxton.
J'adore ce type.
Pardon, je suis pressée. Je vais
à l'avant, je descends la première.
Ne renversez pas Matisse.
OK, c'est dingue.
Tu peux pas penser que le New Jersey
est mieux que New York.
À New York, il y a Broadway.
Pas la peine d'en dire plus.
Oh que si.
Tape par sécurité.
- On a Atlantic City.
- On peut pas battre A.C.
Pitié ! Personne ne doit savoir.
- New York a Greenwich Village.
- New Jersey a la côte.
Les chroniques de la lauréate
d'un Oscar sur les névrosées urbaines.
Tape !
- Bruce Springsteen.
- Sinatra.
Il est d'Hoboken... New Jersey.
Mais quelle ville il chante ?
C'est pas "Secaucus, Secaucus."
<i>Les enfants, croyez-le ou pas,</i>
<i>mais Tante Robin jure
que ça s'est passé comme ça...</i>
Écoute, Stella, je comprends
que venant du New Jersey,
tu penses ne pas aimer New York,
mais crois-moi,
Marshall n'y croyait pas non plus,
et maintenant, il déménagerait
pour rien au monde.
Je hais New York !
Désolé, mais c'est vrai.
Aujourd'hui, je passais
devant PriceCo.
Vous y avez déjà été ?
C'est énorme.
Les magasins de New York sont exigus.
Quand je me tourne, je renverse un truc.
Je suis comme un gros monstre sorti
de l'océan pour détruire des bodegas.
- Mais, Marshall, tu aimes New York.
- Oui, sauf que je la déteste.
Je suis trop grand pour New York !
Je m'efforce de tenir
dans les sièges exigus du métro
ou de me baisser sous des portes
de plus de 150 ans.
Les gens sont plus grands,
faites des portes plus grandes.
- C'est quoi, votre problème ?
- Petite ville, grands hommes, tope-là.
C'est trop bruyant, tout le temps.
Oui, c'est la ville qui ne dort jamais.
Eh bien moi, j'aimerais bien dormir.
Je suis fatigué depuis 8 ans.
Fatigué et effrayé, avec des marques
noires et bleues sur mes coudes
à essayer de tenir entre
les portes d'entrée pour elfes.
Le New Jersey est génial.
Il y a de grands magasins,
et des pelouses et tu n'as plus
à porter de tasse.
Pour le reste de ta vie.
Je n'ai pas peur de le dire.
J'aime le New Jersey.
Je plaisante.
J'ai compris, OK ?
Je vois ce que tu veux dire.
J'imagine...
qu'on pourrait vivre à Brooklyn.
Tu sais quoi, Ted...
Vis où tu veux. Je m'en fiche.
Silence gêné. Tope-là.
Hé, Lucy.
Que fais-tu debout ?
Il y avait du bruit à la cave.
Désolé.
- Retourne te coucher.
- Je peux pas dormir sans une histoire.
- OK, je vais chercher ta maman...
- Pourquoi tu m'en lis pas une ?
Allons-y.
J'emménage ici.
Vraiment ?
Vraiment.
Le New Jersey gagne.
Oh, merci !
Attendez.
Bonsoir, New York.
Regardez, elle l'a fait.
Notre histoire de ce soir,
le bébé panda du zoo de Central Park
a fait sa première dent aujourd'hui.
Je pense que ça fait de lui un...
ours molaire.
Ours molaire.
Ours molaire.
Vous savez quoi ?
C'est vraiment fini pour moi.
Bonne nuit, New York.
Elle arrête vraiment.
Tu penses qu'on y est
pour quelque chose ?
Je pense que oui.
Bon boulot, Barney.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Merci !
Oh, ça m'a tué le bras.
Mon bras n'a jamais été
aussi endolori depuis mes 13 ans
le jour où j'ai su comment fermer
la salle de bain. Cool !
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- J'ai officiellement pas eu le job.
- Désolé.
- Ça va.
Ils m'en proposent un autre.
- C'est super. C'est pour faire quoi ?
- Correspondant à l'étranger.
Je...
déménage au Japon.
<i>Kids, in a fall of 2008,
I had a little problem</i>
All right, I got to get to Stella's.
Tonight's the night. I've tried it
before, I've failed every time.
This time, I am gonna do it.
Tonight...
I pick up a lesbian.
Robin, I need your lipstick.
Oh, man!
- Take pictures, all right?
- Bye, Ted.
<i>I lived in NY,</i>
<i>but Stella lived across</i>
<i>the river, in New Jersey...</i>
Oh, man!
<i>...which meant I was always
taking the train.</i>
- What's up, Ted?
- Hey, Matisse.
- Hey, T-Diddy!
- Theodore!
- You missed it.
- Robin got that national anchor job.
And we got a free
bottle of champagne.
But it's empty now.
Oh, man!
<i>And as result, it seemed like</i>
<i>I was missing out on everything.</i>
Sorry, we couldn't wait.
It was getting cold.
Oh, man!
- Hey, big guy.
- What's up, G?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. It's just...
You know, I want to hang out
with you guys, with my friends.
I just feel like I'm spending
all my time on the train.
OK, how about this, why don't you ask
your friends to come out here sometime?
That's a great idea.
You want us to go to New Jersey?
Oh, that is rich.
- Why?
- Well, for starters,
I don't have any
of my gold medallions anymore.
I sold them when they went
out of style 400 years ago.
- Lily?
- Oh, sorry, Ted.
I'm a born and raised New Yorker.
I'm programmed
to despise and loathe
New Jersey and all
that it stands for.
Why am I telling you this?
You hate New Jersey more than anyone.
What? I don't hate New Jersey.
Why would you think that?
And then he cut in front of me.
God, I hate line cutters
more than I hate New Jersey.
That's not true. There's nothing
I hate more than New Jersey.
Right?
- You want us to wait for you?
- No, I might be awhile.
I got a drop a massive New Jersey.
Okay, so New Jersey's
not my favorite place.
But once Stella and I get married
and she and Lucy move in with me,
I'll never set foot
in New Jersey again.
Unless I'm going to see
a Giants game or flying out of Newark
or God forbid, disposing of a body.
Ted, if you murder me and
bury me in New Jersey,
I'll haunt you forever.
But if I murder you and
bury you somewhere else?
I'll leave you alone.
I'm sure you had your reasons.

<i>Kids, your Aunt Robin was sick
of her job at Metro News One.</i>
<i>She was sick of the low
production value...</i>
I'm Robin Scherbatsky,
and you're watching...
Etro News One at 11:00.
And again at 1:00.
<i>...sick of the stories
she had to report...</i>
So hurry up and get your votes in
for New York's cutest doggie.
<i>...and most of all, she was sick of
all the stupid puns.</i>
Four transit workers were electrocuted
when a subway train jumped the tracks.
Stay tuned for the...
Shocking derails.
Joel, people died.
<i>So when the call came in that she got
the big national anchor job,</i>
<i>she finally got to say the words</i>
<i>she'd been dreaming of saying
for years...</i>
<i>Tonight will be my last broadcast.</i>
<i>I came to Metro News One
as a little caterpillar.</i>
<i>And for four years,
this desk has been my cocoon.</i>
<i>But tonight,</i>
I emerge an ambitious butterfly.
Why does she sound like an idiot?
Did she have a stroke?
Yeah. A stroke of genius.
This speech is really good.
<i>With one eye on the horizon,</i>
<i>one eye on the truth,</i>
<i>and one eye on all of you.</i>
You wrote it for her, didn't you?
It's a modified version
of the speech I gave
when I had to leave the swim team
`cause of a chronic inner ear situation.
- I thought you were the towel boy.
- It's part of the team.
<i>So that Saturday as Robin went off
for her first day at her new job,</i>
<i>we all headed across the river
to experience</i>
<i>some of that crazy
New Jersey nightlife.</i>
Okay, Stella couldn't find a sitter,
so we can't go out. Instead...
We're all gonna hang out here
and it's gonna be just as awesome.
Right, we got board games,
we got movies.
And I think there may be
some beer out in the garage.
Ted, this is pathetic.
It's Saturday night.
We should be out at a bar.
Drinking alcohol.
Now I know that sounds depressing,
bordering on tragic, but it's a fact.
Yeah, and I want another crack
at that chick, Doris.
I know I can land
that lesbian plane.
No snakes on that plane.
Okay, guys. Come on, you promised.
Let's just hang out here,
try to have fun.
I mean, we're all together,
friends hanging out.
Isn't that what really matters?
If we take the next train,
we can be at MacLaren's by 11:00.
- We can be there by 10:00.
- No, I have to change first.
I'm not walking into MacLaren's
smelling like New Jersey.
You guys really hate it here?
What? No!
Stels...
I get it, you guys are New Yorkers.
You need to go hang out at a bar.
Well, you could just hang out
at the coolest bar in the state,
which is so close
it will blow your mind.
And boom goes the dynamite.
The coolest bar in New Jersey.
Yeah, it probably is.
This is great!
We got darts.
Half a ping-pong table.
A fish bowl.
Look what turned out to be
an awesome night as promised.
Maybe we can drop some
Bac-O's in here and make them fight.
No, thanks. I don't mess
with fish bowls unless
they have my two favorite fish:
the sucker fish and the blow fish.
What up!
For "blow fish"? I don't think so.
Marshall. You're better than that.
Not good enough.
Sorry.
I am not lowering this until
someone gives me the respect
of another person's knuckles
tapping against mine
in a light but decisive manner.
Pretty, pretty...
Pretty, pretty...
Who's a pretty baby?
Then know this...
Until it gets what it wants,
nay, deserves,
this fist will not yield.
It will
not
yield.
- So who wants to play Scrabble?
- Sure, whatever.
Heads up, the "X" tile
is a little hard to read
because a couple years ago,
it went all the way through my dog.
You know, maybe we should get
a dog again when you move in.
When I what?
Oh, great. There's Robin.
I thought they were
moving in with you.
So did I.
God, am I moving to New Jersey?
Hey, guys, I bet that dog was
really flying high
after it swallowed a little "X."
Nailed it!
Come on!
I can't live here.
It wouldn't be that bad.
You could put a mini-fridge over there
and maybe some knock hockey.
Knock hockey. Nice one, Big Mon.
I meant New Jersey in general,
not this basement.
She wants me to move here?
I don't get it.
We discussed this months ago.
So I was thinking
after the wedding,
you and Lucy could move in here.
Yeah, she could play out
on the fire escape,
maybe make friends with that guy
who sleeps on that couch in the alley,
ride her bike up and down Broadway.
It's a great idea, Ted.
I don't understand why you'd
want to live in New Jersey
when you have a chance
to live in Manhattan?
I thought having a rent-controlled
apartment on the West Side
was why she agreed to marry me.
Really, I thought it was
the whole reason. What is up?
Looking good.
- Bump the Barnacle.
- Stella already told me not to.
- How was your first day?
- It wasn't.
- What?
- It wasn't my first day.
I showed up and there
were 20 other people.
It turns out,
I didn't actually get the job.
I only got an audition.
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.
He told me that I got it.
I got it?
I got it!
<i>And just to be clear,
when I say "you got it,"</i>
<i>I mean an audition.</i>
<i>You got an audition.</i>
<i>I don't want there to be
any confusion.</i>
<i>You have an audition only.</i>
<i>Not the job.</i>
Thank you! Thank you!
OK, I'm going to call and beg
Joel to give me my job back.
- You hated that job.
- I don't konw, it wasn't so bad.
What did they make you
call Tropical Storm Hector
when it was raining cats and dogs?
A furricane.
Hey, Ted.
- Rock me like a furricane.
- Thanks.
Mean.
Okay,  it sucks, but what can I do?
I'm not going to get that other job.
You should have seen
the other women at this audition.
They all had more experience
than me, were more ethnic than me.
There was an African-American
chick with blue eyes,
- how can I compete with that?
- you can't.
No, you can compete with anyone.
You're Robin Scherbatsky.
Confident, strong, tall,
with crazy long legs
that look great in shorts.
I'm calling Joel.
No, if you call him right now,
you will hate yourself.
Look, I have slept
with lots of women
who afterwards told me off
and stormed out.
And sometimes,
they'd pick up the phone
and they'd call me
and then we'd hook up again.
And when we were finished,
I could see that look on their faces,
that look that says
they hate themselves
and they wish they'd never called.
But if you could see that look...
Actually, you can see that look,
there's a video, www...
Stop, okay?
I won't call.
Don't drink the beer!
I just remembered when I bought it.
It was right before
I got pregnant with Lucy.
Would you mind running
to PriceCo and picking some up?
While you're there,
maybe you could sign up for a card.
You'll probably end up
going there all the time.
That's the look.
I can't move here.
I hate it here.
I would kill myself.
Maybe New Jersey's not that bad.
Stella has a lawn.
You could get a riding lawn mower.
They sell them over there.
I saw one with a cup holder.
I saw a recliner with
a built-in cup holder.
I even saw a hammock
with a cup holder.
You live in New Jersey,
you never have to hold a cup again.
I don't have as big a problem
holding cups as you do.
I will give you
$100 to fist pump me.
$200.
Just put it down, Barney.
Your arm must be killing you by now.
$10,000.
You'll be right across the river.
You'll be in New York all the time.
Excuse me.
- You guys are from New York?
- We moved here from Manhattan.
- Do you ever get into the city?
- All the time.
- See? All the time.
- When was the last time ?
We just had dinner at O'Rourke's.
That's been closed for six years.
It has been awhile.
Funny, we don't miss it.
I guess we're New Jersey-ians now.
Honey, look, dog shirts.
I can't do it.
I'm just going to tell Stella
she and Lucy have to move
into the city and that's that.
What do you guys think?
Beagle or Boston terrier?
Are those tears?
They're awesome...
manly pain tears.
They're not emotional.
They're a little bit emotional.
Where's Robin?
Hey, Shirley,
it's Robin calling for Joel.
Robin, hang up the phone.
Don't do this.
Sorry, I know, okay?
- If you don't hang up right now...
- Stop.
Hey, Joel, it's Robin.
So Madam Butterfly wants
to come back to the cocoon.
I'm sorry I said all that stuff.
You can stick your sorries
in your sock drawer,
'cause you've already been replaced.
I've got Brian in makeup
and he couldn't be more excited.
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
Okay, look, as much as
I want to see college boy here
wet himself on camera,
if you can get here in time
to read the 11:00 news,
you can have your old job back.
Okay, I have a half hour
to make it to the studio.
There's no way you can make it
to the city in a half hour.
Don't do this. I know it's scary
to bet on yourself,
but if you don't, nobody else will.
I'm not saying that to get a fist bump.
Although, come on, a fist bump
would be great. But I really mean it.
I am betting on myself. I am betting
that I can make it there by 11:00.
- Hey, did you get the beer?
- Yeah, I got 144-pack.
The rest is in the trunk.
And did you sign up
for the membership?
- Why not?
- There was a line for the photos,
my hair's a mess... I don't want
to move to New Jersey.
What?
I can't do it.
And I can't see any reason why you
and Lucy shouldn't move to New York.
My daughter goes to school here.
All of her friends are here.
I've lived here my whole life.
My whole family is here.
This is my house. I'm on the PTA.
And as of June 1,
I'm the deputy mayor.
Yes, but my apartment
is really close to the subway.
We're not moving, end of discussion.
How can it be end of discussion
if there's never been a discussion?
This is part of being a parent.
I can't just uproot Lucy.
People with kids move all the time.
It would be great for Lucy to grow up
in the greatest city in the world.
Here we go. New York's the greatest city
in the whole wide world.
It's where dreams come true
and pigeon poop tastes like tapioca.
Want to know a little secret?
New Jersey...
is better than New York.
Better than...?
You think...? I...
The Empire State Buil...
H and H Bage...
Lincoln Ce... Zabar's...
Papaya King.
New York is the intellectual
and cultural hub of the planet.
New York is full of weirdoes,
and snobs and mean people.
Do you know that once, an old lady
actually called me a bitch
and threw a cat in my face?
And you want to know
if that happened in New Jersey?
86th and Lex, right in front
of your beloved little Papaya King.
People are nice in New Jersey.
It's the kind of place
where you know your neighbors.
Hey, I know my neighbors.
Yeah? Like who?
Right across the hall, I got...
Clax... pa... mon...
- Claxpamon?
- His name is Paxton.
Love that dude.
Sorry, in a hurry. Got to get
to the front. Got to get off first.
Don't run over Matisse.
Okay, this is crazy.
You can't actually think
that New Jersey is better than New York.
New York has Broadway.
We win right there.
No, she did not.
Knuckle up for safety.
- We have Atlantic City.
- Can't beat the A.C.
Pretty please?
No one has to know.
- New York has Greenwich Village.
- New Jersey has The Shore.
Oscar-winning chronicler
of urban neuroses.
Bump it!
- Bruce Springsteen.
- Sinatra.
He's from Hoboken... New Jersey.
But what city is he singing about?
It's not "Secaucus, Secaucus."
<i>Now you kids can either
believe this or not,</i>
<i>but this is how your Aunt Robin
swears it happened.</i>
Look, Stella, I understand
that coming from New Jersey
you don't picture
yourself loving New York,
but trust me,
Marshall didn't expect to,
and now he wouldn't think
of living anywhere else.
I hate New York!
I'm sorry, but it's true.
Today I was walking around PriceCo.
Have you ever been there?
It's huge.
All the stores in New York
are so cramped. Every time I turn,
I knock something over.
I'm like some huge monster
that came out of the ocean
to destroy bodegas.
- But, Marshall, you love New York.
- I do, except that I hate it.
I'm too big for New York.
I'm always trying to fit into
cramped little subway seats
or duck under doorways
that were built 150 years ago.
Guess what? People are bigger now.
Build bigger doorways.
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Small city, big man, give it up.
It's so loud, all the time.
Yes, it's the city that never sleeps.
Guess what, I like to sleep.
I've been tired for eight years.
Tired and scared with black
and blue marks on my elbows
from trying to fit through
all these tiny elf doorways.
New Jersey's great.
It's got huge stores,
and lawns and you never have
to carry a cup again.
Not for the rest of your life.
I'm not afraid to say it...
I love New Jersey.
I'm just kidding.
I get it, okay?
I see what you're saying.
I guess...
we could live in Brooklyn.
You know what, Ted...
live wherever you want.
I don't care.
Awkward silence. Tap it.
What are you doing up?
There was some loud noises
in the basement.
Sorry about that.
- Why don't you got back to bed?
- I can't go to sleep without a story.
- Okay, I'll just get your mom...
- Why don't you read it to me?
Come on.
I'm moving here.
Really?
Really.
New Jersey wins.
Oh, thank you!
Wait.
Good evening, New York.
Hey, look, she made it.
Our top story tonight,
the newborn panda at the Central Park
Zoo got its first tooth today.
I guess that makes her a...
molar bear.
Molar bear.
Molar bear.
You know what?
I really am done.
Good night, New York.
She really quit.
You think we had anything
to do with that?
I think we did.
Nice job, Barney.
Oh, my God!
Thank you!
Oh, that was killing my arm.
My arm hasn't been this sore
since I was 13 years old
and figured out how to lock a bathroom.
Up top!
- What's wrong?
- I officially didn't get that job.
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.
- They offered me another one.
- That's great.
- What are you going to be doing?
- Foreign correspondent.
I'm...
moving to Japan.
Barney est fou s'il pense
que ça va marcher.
- Je crois que ça va marcher
- J'espère pas.
Le voilà.
Toi là, c'est quoi ton nom ?
- Excusez-moi ?
- Ton nom, femme, c'est quoi ton nom ?
Je le savais.
Tu es "la" Cindy,
celle qui peut tout changer
ou nous mener à notre perte.
Écoute-moi, Cindy.
Je suis Barney Stinson,
et j'ai une mission urgente
- venant du futur.
- Le futur ?
Le futur, et je peux te le prouver.
Dans exactement 4 s, la femme
à cette table va gifler cet homme.
Tu fais quoi ?
Dans quelques minutes,
le jeune moi de ton époque
va entrer par cette porte.
Je sais que ça a l'air dingue,
mais pour sauver la planète,
tu dois coucher avec lui, ce soir.
- Quoi ? Je...
- Couche avec Barney Stinson, ce soir,
fais tout ce qu'il veut,
ou il ne trouvera pas de solution
au réchauffement climatique
qui sauverait la race humaine.
- Vous parlez de quoi ?
- J'ai pas le temps d'expliquer.
Il faut que je retourne
à l'accélérateur de réalité
avant que le vortex se referme.
Seule toi peux nous sauver, Cindy.
Je dois partir !
Bon, les déménageurs
arrivent dans 14 heures.
Il faut qu'on remonte
finir les cartons.
Vous avez pas fini ?
Pourquoi c'est aussi long ?
Les meilleurs souvenirs
de nos 20 ans ont eu lieu dedans.
C'est pas que jeter des trucs
dans une boîte. Tu repenses au passé.
Pas moi. La clé ? Jeter les trucs
et ne pas se retourner.
Je pars au Japon.
Ça m'a pris une demi-heure.
- Une demi-heure ?
- J'aurais pu mettre 20 min,
mais un ami m'a appelée en pleurs.
Déménager, c'est très émouvant.
Mais ça l'est. Enfin, tout change.
Je vais vivre avec Stella,
vous serez dans votre nouvel appart.
Tu débutes
un nouveau boulot à Tokyo.
C'est la fin d'une ère.
On devrait porter un toast,
mais pas avec la merde habituelle.
Ta bouteille de Scotch
la plus chère.
C'est un Glen McKenna de 50 ans,
et c'est 2,500$.
Excellent. Une bouteille de ça
avec des bières,
et vous en pensez quoi,
on annule le scotch ?
Vive la Vodka.
- Ça marchera pas.
- Mon Dieu,
tu es... ho, mon Dieu !
Je vous offre un verre ?
Je suppose que j'ai le temps
pour un verre
et de 45 min à une heure
pour d'autres activités,
mais après ça,
je dois retourner
sur le projet de recherche top-secret
sur lequel je travaille.
- Le réchauffement climatique ?
- Mon Dieu !
Comment vous savez ça ?
Synchro : ShalimarFox, Arrow

Venusia, Tactactac

Regardez ça.
Une photo du jour
où l'on a emménagé.
Tant de bons souvenirs.
Voilà, c'est exactement
ce genre de merdes qu'il faut jeter.
Donc tu gardes pas de photos ?
C'est comme les lettres d'amour,
les annuaires ou les cendres des gens.
Ils prennent de la place.
En plus, elle te laissera pas
garder la moitié de ton bordel.
Pourquoi pas ?
Oh, chéri.
Voilà ce que les mecs savent qu'après
avoir emménagé avec une femme.
Tous vos trucs sont idiots.
Comme quoi ?
Comme tout ce que tu as acheté
aux fêtes médiévales.
Il y a pas assez de breuvages dans
le monde pour que je lâche mon fléau.
Comme on va pas
récupérer la caution,
je pensais que tu pourrais
me rembourser ma moitié.
Attends, pourquoi je paierais plus ?
Parce que t'as traité cet appart
comme John Bonham a traité
son système nerveux.
C'est pas vrai.
Preuve A.
- C'est quoi ?
- Une encyclopédie "World Book" de 1986.
C'est avec celle-là que j'ai grandi.
Encyclopédie ?
Tu penses qu'on doit dire
encyclo-pè-die.
C'est une erreur courante. Mais si tu
regardes le sens de la barre sur le "e".
Le symbole sur cette encyclopédie,
tu sauras que c'est un diacritique
dont le but est de modifier...
Tu sais, il va falloir
que tu "paies-dia" pour ça.
Mais tu l'as jamais fait.
Ensuite, la preuve B.
Bonjour, braves sujets.
Regardez ce que
j'ai gagné au festival.
T'es aussi responsable des dégâts
de Robin quand c'était ta copine.
Quels dégâts j'ai fait ?
Tu te souviens la fois
où t'as bu le pack de bières
et t'es devenue Super Canadienne ?
Stanley Cup, match six ?
Les Rangers vont regretter
d'avoir rencontré les Canucks.
20$ si t'arrives
à le lancer par la porte.
T'es plus incroyable qu'un donut
de chez Tim Hortons.
Timmy Ho !
Ça suffit. File-moi la crosse.
J'vais te donner les dents du bonheur.
Un peu par ci, un peu par là.
Donne-moi la crosse.
Casse-toi,
- bouseuse.
- C'est parti !
- Attrapez-la, les mecs !
- Je te briserai !
- Les filles, arrêtez !
- Pour l'Amérique.
C'est bon, ça suffit !
On n'arrête jamais
un combat entre filles !
Jamais !
Entièrement la faute de Barney.
Comme la grosse brûlure
sur la cheminée, d'ailleurs.
<i>Les enfants, pour comprendre
l'histoire de la brûlure,</i>
<i>je dois vous raconter l'histoire de
l'intervention pour notre ami, Stewart.</i>
Que se passe-t-il ?
Ceci est une intervention.
L'alcool t'a changé, Stewart.
On te reconnaît plus.
Et j'aime l'homme que j'ai épousé.
Merci.
C'est le coup de pouce
dont j'ai besoin.
Je vous aime tous.
Voilà l'homme de la soirée.
C'est l'heure de laisser sortir
le monstre de sa cage !
Allez, mec.
Les gens veulent pas voir
Bruce Banner.
Ils veulent Hulk.
Quoi ?
C'est ça d'avoir
survolé l'invitation.
<i>Ce soir-là, on célébra
notre première intervention réussie.</i>
Je suis vraiment fière
qu'on ait aidé Stewart.
Oui, quel moment incroyable
de sincérité humaine.
C'est vrai. Vive nous.
Tu vas sérieusement continuer
à porter ce chapeau ?
Oui, ça fait deux semaines.
Deux magnifiques semaines...
et oh que oui,
je vais continuer à le porter.
<i>Le jour suivant</i>
Ceci est une intervention.
À propos du chapeau.
Je me contrôle.
Je peux l'enlever quand je veux.
"Cher Marshall,
"je n'aime pas ce stupide chapeau.
"Je veux le découper avec une faux.
"Ou alors, le tailler au burin,
"car tu as l'air d'un vrai crétin."
<i>Après ça, les interventions
sont devenues fréquentes à l'appart.</i>
Oh mon Dieu.
C'est une p'tain d'bonne surprise.
C'est à propos d'quoi ?
C'est à propos de l'accent
anglais exagéré.
P'tain.
Autobronzant ?
Ils t'appâtent avec une réduc,
et après on devient vite accro.
On sait, chérie, on sait.
C'est un gilet tout neuf.
Quoi ?
- Les tours de magie.
- Spécialement, ceux avec du feu.
Les tours de magie ?
Les mecs, les interventions
sont censées aider les gens,
pas s'attaquer à chaque aspect
qu'on n'aime pas.
Désolé, mais ça m'échauffe.
Ça me fait bouillir !
Je veux dire, je suis empli
d'une rage brûlante !
Merci !
- Oh, merde.
- Ça sent le cheveu !
<i>Et voilà l'histoire de la brûlure.</i>
C'est bizarre. En rangeant le placard,
j'ai cru voir la bannière.
Et ?
Et la bannière avait brûlé.
Pourquoi une nouvelle ?
Et il y a des lettres de vous tous,
avec "Ted" écrit dessus.
Vous prépariez
une intervention pour moi ?
Ça, c'était stupide.
Oui, oublie ça.
C'était pourquoi ? Les sandales ?
- Les produits pour cheveux ?
- Pas Stella.
Mon Dieu, c'était pour Stella.
Je viens de dire "Pas Stella."
C'était peut-être pour
tes problèmes d'audition.
- Quoi ?
- Ça devient sérieux. Tu vois ?
Vous pensez que je devrais pas
épouser Stella.
Vous pensez
que je devrais pas l'épouser.
On le veut. On est tous
vraiment contents pour toi.
Comme je disais, c'était stupide.
À l'évidence, ça l'était pas,
on s'était mis d'accord
pour plus faire d'interventions stupides
à l'intervention sur les interventions.
On fait trop d'interventions.
Quel était votre gros problème
avec moi et Stella ?
Oui ! Dans la gueule !
Vous disiez que le "Barney du futur"
marcherait pas.
Vous m'avez dit que j'étais fou.
Mon psy m'a dit que j'étais fou.
Qui est le narcissique avec de graves
troubles affectifs, Dr Grossbard ?
Une banderole d'intervention ?
C'est pour quoi ?
- "Je ne peux pas rester impassible..."
- Tu gardais ça sur toi ?
S'il te plaît.
"Je ne peux pas rester impassible
pendant que tu fais
"la plus grosse erreur qu'un homme
puisse faire... te marier.
"Retiens mes mots, tout cela
va partir en..."
flammes !
Oh, merde !
J'ai envoyé la flamme trop tôt.
J'avais tant de choses
importantes à dire, et...
Le fait est, Ted,
le mariage, c'est stupide.
Chaque année,
il y a un million de filles
de 22 ans, sexy,
qui vont dans les bars,
et m'appellent, "verre à demi plein",
mais je pense
qu'elles deviennent bêtes.
Même toi, tu ne rencontreras plus de
filles de 22 ans quand t'en auras 80.
- Je relève ce défi.
- Quel défi ?
Te prouver
que je serai
tout aussi génial à 80 ans.
Je sortirai avec
une fille de 22 ans
avec mon maquillage de vieil homme.
Je ne t'ai pas défié.
J'aimerais vraiment voir ça,
mais je ne t'ai pas défié.
- Je veux entendre les autres lettres.
- C'est ridicule.
- On a changé d'avis.
- Et si vous changiez encore ?
Allez Lily, écoutons la tienne.
"Les capacités de Gilbert en lecture
se sont considérablement améliorées..."
C'est une lettre que je devais
donner à un de mes élèves.
Les choses vont-elles trop vite
entre toi et une fille nommée Stella ?
J'aimerais.
Je peux entendre la tienne ?
"Cher Ted, c'est encyclo-pé-die,
pas encyclo-pè-die",
"Pourquoi tu veux toujours dire
les choses de manière prétentieuse."
"On dirait un crétin,
et c'est "cr-é-tin" et non cr-ay-tin".
Tu l'as déjà lu à l'intervention
sur ma prononciation.
- Où est la lettre sur Stella ?
- J'en ai pas écrit.
Je suis ton ex. Je me suis dit que tout
ce que je dirais serait blessant.
En plus, je suis plus sexy qu'elle,
alors qui s'en soucie ?
- De l'eau a coulé sous les ponts...
- Allez.
"Cher Ted,
"Stella semble être merveilleuse.
"Mais tu la connais pas assez
pour te marier.
"Tu ne la connais
sans doute pas assez
"pour t'engager à élever
une fillette avec elle.
"Tu ne lui rends pas service,
ni à son enfant
"ni à toi-même en te précipitant
comme ça.
"Prends juste un peu plus de temps".
C'était il y a des mois, OK ?
C'était avant qu'on connaisse Stella
et qu'on voie comme elle est géniale
et quel couple super vous formez.
C'est pour ça qu'on a décidé
de pas faire cette intervention.
Merci. Parce que j'ai vraiment besoin
de vous pour gérer ça.
- Et on est là.
- Et on espère que t'es pas fâché.
Bien sûr que non.
C'est pas comme si
ce que vous avez dit était insensé.
Vous vous faisiez du souci.
Mais des soucis
qu'on a complètement chassés.
Mais vous marquez un point.
Tout ça s'est passé très vite.
Vous savez quoi ?
C'est peut-être parce que...
quand c'est la bonne, on le sait.
Je suppose, mais on est encore,
au stade où on cherche
à se connaître.
Et Lily, tu as peut-être raison.
Stella n'aimera pas mes affaires.
Comme le robot pot à gâteaux.
C'est le 1er truc qu'on a acheté
pour ici, vous vous rappelez ?
Bien sûr que oui.
Mes capteurs indiquent
que tes niveaux de sablés
sont dangereusement bas.
Ma collection de James Bond.
Vous savez, on les a regardés
dans l'ordre, et...
Lily parlait avec cet accent anglais
bizarre, jusqu'au mois suivant ?
C'était sophistiqué.
Mes crampons signés
par Bernie Kosar.
Ma lampe éléphant.
La cabine téléphonique anglaise.
Mon sombrero !
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Je déballe.
Je quitterai jamais
cet appartement !
Ted, arrête de déballer.
T'es en train de flipper.
Je suis pas prêt pour cette
responsabilité, encore moins
à être le beau-père
d'une fille de 7 ans.
Si je me marie
et déménage en banlieue,
en un clin d'oeil,
je me change en vieux !
Bonsoir, jeune demoiselle.
Vous voulez un caramel ?
Qu'entendez-vous par,
"rien en commun" ?
On est tous les deux âgés.
Vous êtes mignon.
- Quel âge avez-vous ?
- 83 ans.
- Quel âge avez-vous ?
- 31 ans.
Ted a pété les plombs.
Les déménageurs arrivent
dans 10 heures.
Sa fiancée l'attend dans le New Jersey.
On doit faire quelque chose.
Je m'en occupe.
- Hé, mec ?
- Hé.
- Viens voir une minute.
- Quoi ?
Sache que c'est tout à fait normal.
Les grands changements
peuvent faire peur, et avoir peur...
ça en fait partie.
Alors...
pourquoi tu me donnerais pas
le couteau ? Donne-le-moi.
Allez.
Comme ça, je peux déballer aussi.
Je resterai avec toi pour toujours !
On a eu une chouette vie, ici.
C'est pour ça
qu'on repoussait l'emballage.
Parce qu'inconsciemment, on sait tous
que ce serait débile de partir.
C'est chaud et sans danger, ici.
Il y a en bar en bas,
un robot à cookie dans la cuisine.
C'est ma maison
et je partirai jamais !
Écoute-toi !
Tu parles comme ce gros bêta en colo.
"Maman, papa, je veux rentrer.
"Les garçons cool jouent
à cache-cache avec mon inhalateur."
J'en reviens pas que mon père ait lu
cette lettre à notre mariage.
Tu peux pas faire ça à Lily.
Votre nouvel appart
a quelques problèmes,
avec le plancher pas droit et
la station d'épuration d'à côté,
mais vous ferez une super maison.
Dis-lui, Lily.
C'est le trou noir
où vont mourir les rêves.
- Je déménage pas, non plus.
- Allez.
Les gars, finissez de déballer.
Je vais faire des cookies
pour remplir R2-dodu.
Mon Dieu, quelle bande
de trouillards !
Effrayés par le moindre
petit changement.
Terrifiés par tout
ce qui est nouveau.
Désespérés au point de s'accrocher
à votre petit confort.
Je peux pas partir au Japon.
À quoi je pensais ?
C'est tellement loin.
Je parle pas la langue.
J'ai même pas
de bonnes photos de vous.
Oh, chérie.
Tout le monde dit que
c'est bien de changer, non ?
Mais ça a quoi de bien ?
Qui veut aller au même vieux bar,
s'asseoir à la même place
et boire la même chose ?
La même chose ! Ma préférée !
Oh, mon Dieu.
Je crois que quelqu'un
me doit 200 $.
Barney, c'était pas un pari.
Personne...
Ça prouve que je serai aussi génial
que ça quand j'aurai 80 ans.
Tope mon arthrite.
- Je déménage dans le New Jersey.
- Quoi ?
Et vous devriez emménager
dans le nouvel appart,
- et Robin devrait aller au Japon.
- Pourquoi ?
Parce qu'on va vieillir
qu'on le veuille ou non,
alors, la vraie question, c'est :
est-ce qu'on veut avancer
ou s'accrocher désespérément
au passé et finir comme ça ?
Tu veux dire génial ?
J'ai 80 ans, mec,
et j'emballe une nana de 22 ans.
Emmène-moi chez toi, <i>chéri</i>.
Je veux voir tes médailles
de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale.
Dans un instant <i>mon petite</i>.
Très bien, ça compte pas.
Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
Elle est française, c'est comme
jouer au tennis sans filet.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je m'occupe de la garantie.
Ça me fait plaisir,
car chaque trou dans cet appartement
est un souvenir que j'oublierai jamais.
Mais à une condition :
on met tous 10 billets de côté
chaque semaine pour l'année prochaine,
et on revient ici et on achète
ce scotch de 50 ans d'âge,
et on porte un toast à l'incroyable
année pleine de changement qu'on a eue.
Dégagez de notre place.
Ma nouvelle famille et moi, Marshall
et Lily, dans leur appart et Robin
en numéro un des journalistes de
langue anglaise dans l'Ouest Pacifique,
se retrouvant ici, à New York
pour célébrer ce jour...
Le jour où on a fermé
un chapitre incroyable de nos vies,
pour en ouvrir un nouveau.
- J'ai dû laisser mon portable...
- Dégagez d'ici.
<i>Et un an plus tard,
c'est exactement ce qu'on a fait.</i>
Alors, levons nos verres de scotch
à 2 500 $,
pour une année d'enfer.
Étonnant.
C'est incroyable.
C'est fumé, avec un soupçon
de vieux cèdre et...
Vous voyez la différence
entre ça et du scotch à 10 $ ?
- Pas du tout.
- Je mettrais bien du Red Bull.
Wendy, tu peux prendre une photo ?
<i>Beaucoup de choses
ont changé cette année,</i>
<i>mais certaines
sont restées les mêmes.</i>
Alors, si on continuait
la soirée là-haut ?
- Ouais.
- Bonne idée.
J'ai le scotch.
Qu'est-ce...?
Barney, c'est une intervention.
Désolé, je vous entends pas.
Ça suffit, le truc du "vieux".
Le truc du milieu ?
Laisse tomber.
"Laisse bébé" ?
J'adore cette vieille comptine !
Je vais chercher mon fléau.
Tu vas chercher ton bateau ?
Barney is crazy if he thinks
this is gonna work.
- I think it's gonna work.
- I hope it doesn't work.
Here he comes.
You there, what's your name?
- Excuse me?
- Your name, woman, what's your name?
Cindy.
I knew it.
You're the Cindy,
the one who can change everything,
or spell our inevitable doom.
Now listen to me, Cindy.
I am Barney Stinson,
and I am on an urgent mission
- from the future.
- The future?
The future,
and I can prove it to you.
In exactly four seconds,
the woman at that booth
is going to slap that man.
What the hell?
In a few minutes,
the young me from your time
is going to come through that door.
Now, Cindy,
I know this sounds insane,
but in order to save the planet,
you need to sleep with him tonight.
- What? I...
- Sleep with Barney Stinson tonight,
in whatever way he wants it,
or he won't be able to find
the solution to global warming
that saves the human race.
- What are you talking about?
- I have no time to explain.
I have to get back to the reality
accelerator before the vortex closes.
Only you can save us, Cindy.
I must away!
Okay, guys,
the movers are coming in 14 hours.
We gotta get back upstairs
and finish packing.
You guys aren't finished packing?
How is this taking so long?
All the great memories of our 20s
took place in that apartment.
It's not like throwing stuff in a box.
You start to reminisce.
Not me. The key?
Throw stuff out and never look back.
I'm moving to Japan.
It took me a half hour to pack.
- A half hour?
- It would have taken me 20 minutes,
but a friend called me in tears.
Moving is really emotional.
It is.
I mean, everything is changing.
I'm gonna be living in New Jersey with
Stella, you will be in your new place.
You're starting a new job in Tokyo.
It's the end of an era.
I think we should have a toast,
but not our usual crap.
Your most expensive bottle
of scotch.
That's 50-year-old Glen McKenna,
and it's $2,500.
Excellent.
A bottle of that with beer chasers,
and what do you think,
cancel the scotch?
Vodka rocks.
- It's not gonna work.
- Oh, my God,
You're... Oh, my God!
Can I buy you a drink?
I suppose I have time
for one drink and...
45 minutes to an hour
of some other activity,
but after that,
I have to get back to
a top-secret research project
I'm working on.
Global warming?
My God,
how did you know that?
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
Look at this.
A photo from the first day
we moved into this place.
So many great memories.
See? That is exactly the type of crap
you should be trashing.
So you don't keep any photos?
No, they're like love letters
or yearbooks or someone's ashes.
They just take up space.
Besides, Stella's not gonna let you
keep half of this junk.
Why wouldn't she?
Oh, sweetie.
Okay, here's the thing that guys only
learn after they move in with a woman.
All of your stuff is stupid.
Like what?
Like anything you bought
at a Renaissance Faire.
There's not enough mead in the world
to make me get rid of my flail.
Oh, hey, Ted, since we're clearly
not getting our security deposit back,
I thought maybe
you could reimburse me for my half.
Wait a second, why should I have
to pay more than you?
Because
you treated this apartment the way
John Bonham treated
his central nervous system.
That's not true.
Exhibit A.
- What's that?
- A 1986 World Book encyclopaedia.
It's exactly the one I grew up with.
Encyclopaedia?
You think it should be pronounced
encyclo-pee-dia.
It's a common mistake. But if you look
at that squished together "ae"
symbol in this here encyclopaedia,
you'll learn
that it's a ligature derived
from the Anglo-Saxon rune ash...
You know,
you're gonna have to paedia for that.
But you never did.
And then there's Exhibit B.
Good morrow, fair gentles.
Look what I won
at the Renaissance Faire.
You're also responsible for any damage
Robin did when she was your girlfriend.
What damage did I cause?
Do you remember that night when you
drank the 12'er of Molson, you got all
super Canadian?
Stanley Cup, game six?
The Rangers are about to be sorry
they ever played shinny
with the Canucks.
I'll give you 20$ if you
shoot it on this front door.
You're nuttier than
a Tim Horton's maple log.
Timmy Ho!
That's it. Give me the stick.
I'll give you summer teeth.
Some are here, some are there.
Robin, give me the stick.
Take off,
hoser.
That's it!
- Get her, boys, get her!
- I'll scrap!
- Guys, come on!
- For America.
Break it, break it up!
You never break up a girl fight!
Never!
Entirely Barney's fault.
As, by the way, is the big
scorch mark over the fireplace.
<i>Kids, to understand
the story of the scorch mark,</i>
<i>I first need to tell you the story of
the intervention for our friend Stewart.</i>
What's going on?
This is an intervention.
The alcohol changes you.
It makes you a different person.
And I'm in love
with the man that I married.
Thank you.
This is just the push I need.
I love you guys.
There's the birthday boy.
Time to let the party monster
out of its cage, Stewie!
Come on, buddy.
People don't want to see
Bruce Banner, dude.
They want to see the Hulk.
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk... What?
That's what I get
for skimming the E-vite.
<i>Later that day, we celebrated
our first successful intervention.</i>
I am really proud of us
for helping Stewart.
What an amazing honest,
human moment.
I agree. Yay us.
Marshall, are you really
gonna keep wearing that hat?
It's been two weeks.
Two awesome weeks...
and heck, yeah,
I'm gonna keep wearing it.
This is an intervention.
It's about the hat.
I have it under control, okay?
I can take it off
whenever I want to.
"Dear Marshall,
"I do not like that stupid hat.
"I want to beat it with a bat.
"Or maybe stab it with a fork.
"It makes you look
like such a dork."
<i>After that, interventions became</i>
<i>a pretty regular thing
around our apartment.</i>
Cor blimey.
This is a nice bloody surprise.
What's this about then?
It's about the weird
fake English accent.
Bollocks.
Spray tan?
They reel you in with a coupon,
and then you just get hooked.
We know, sweetie, we know.
This is a new sweater.
What?
- The magic tricks.
- Specifically, those involving fire.
Magic tricks?
Guys, interventions
are supposed to help people,
not attack every little thing
you don't like about them.
I'm sorry,
but that really steams me.
That really burns me up!
I mean, I am filled
with a white-hot rage!
Thank you.
- Oh, shoot.
- I smell hair! I smell hair!
<i>And that's the story
of the scorch mark.</i>
That's weird.
When I was going through the closet,
I thought I saw the intervention banner.
So?
The banner burned up.
Why is there a new one?
And there are sealed letters here
from all of you that say "Ted."
Were you guys planning
an intervention for me?
Oh, that, that was stupid.
Just forget about that.
What was it for? The Crocs?
- The hair product?
- Not Stella.
Oh, my God, this was about Stella.
I just said... "Not Stella."
So maybe it was about
your poor listening skills.
- What?
- It's out of control. See?
You guys don't think
I should marry Stella.
You guys don't think
I should marry Stella.
Ted, we do.
We're all really happy for you.
Yeah. Like I said, it was stupid.
Obviously, it wasn't,
because we agreed not to have
any more stupid interventions
at our intervention intervention.
We're having too many interventions.
So, what was your big serious problem
with me and Stella?
Yes!
Yes! In everyone's face!
You all said the "future Barney" thing
wouldn't work.
You told me I was crazy.
My shrink told me I was crazy.
Who's the narcissist with severe
attachment disorder now, Dr. Grossbard?
Intervention banner?
What's that for?
- "Ted, I cannot stand idly by..."
- You've just been carrying that around?
Please, Ted?
"I cannot stand idly by
while you make
"the biggest mistake any man
can make... getting married.
"Mark my words, this whole thing
"is gonna go up in...
"flames!"
Oh, damn!
I put the flame cue too early.
I had so many more
important things to say, and...
The point is, Ted,
marriage... is stupid.
Every year, there are
a million new hot 22-year-olds
walking into bars,
and call me "glass half full,"
but I think they're getting dumber.
Come on, even you aren't still gonna be
hitting on 22-year-olds when you're 80.
- I accept that challenge.
- What challenge?
To prove to you
that I will be exactly this awesome
when I'm 80, I will hook up
with a 22-year-old
while in my old-man makeup.
I didn't remotely
challenge you to that.
I mean, I definitely want to see it.
I didn't remotely challenge you to that.
- I want to hear the other letters.
- Ted, this is ridiculous.
- We changed our minds.
- And suppose you change them back?
Lily, come on, let's hear yours.
"Gilbert's reading skills have
improved drastically since..."
Wait, this is a letter I meant to send
home with one of my kindergarteners.
Are things moving too fast
between you and a girl named Stella?
I wish.
Robin, could I hear yours?
"Dear Ted, it's "encyclo-pee-dia",
not encyclo-pay-dia".
"Why do you always say things
in the most pretentious way possible?
"It makes you sound douchey,
and that's "douchey", not "douch-ay"."
Yeah, you already read that one
at my pronunciation intervention.
- Where's the letter about Stella?
- I didn't write one.
I'm your ex{\-girlfriend}. I figured anything
I said on the subject would sound catty.
Plus, I'm hotter than her,
so who cares?
- Dude, it's water under the bridge...
- Please.
"Dear Ted,
"Stella seems
like a wonderful person.
"But you don't know her
well enough to get married.
"You certainly don't know her
well enough
"to commit to raising
a seven-year-old with her.
"You're not doing her, her child
"or yourself any favors
by rushing into this.
"Just give it some more time."
Dude, that was months ago,
all right?
That was before we got
to know Stella
and see how awesome she is
and what a great couple you guys are.
That's why we decided not
to even have that intervention.
Thank you. Because I really need
you guys to be on board with this.
- And we are.
- And we hope you're not mad at us.
Course not.
It's not like
what you said was crazy.
You had a lot of valid concerns.
But concerns we have
completely moved on from.
But you had a point. I mean,
this whole thing has moved pretty fast.
You know what?
Maybe that's because...
when it's right, you just know.
Yeah, I guess, but we are still,
you know,
getting to know each other.
And, Lily, maybe you're right.
Maybe Stella won't like any of my stuff.
Like the robot cookie jar.
This was, like, the first thing
we bought for this place, remember?
Of course I do.
My sensors indicate
that your pecan sandy levels
are dangerously low.
My collection of James Bond movies.
Remember? We watched them
all in order, an then...
Lily spoke in that weird English accent
for, like, the next month?
It was sophisticated.
My signed Bernie Kosar cleats.
My elephant lamp.
The English phone booth.
My sombrero!
- What are you doing?
- Unpacking.
I am never leaving this apartment!
No, Ted, stop unpacking.
You're just freaking out.
I'm not ready for{\ all the} responsibility.
And I'm certainly not ready to be
a step-dad to a seven-year-old.
I mean, if I get married
and move to the suburbs,
in the blink of an eye,
I've become an old man!
Hello, young lady.
You want a butterscotch candy?
What do you mean,
"nothing in common"?
We're both seniors.
You're cute.
- How old are you?
- 83.
- How old are you?
- 31.
Ted has officially snapped.
There are moving men
coming in ten hours.
His fiancée is waiting for him
in New Jersey. We have to do something.
I got this.
- Hey, bud?
- Hey.
- Why don't you come here for a minute.
- What?
I want you to know
this is all totally normal.
Big transitions can be scary,
and cold feet...
they're just part of the deal.
So...
How about you give me the knife?
Give me the knife.
Come on.
I can start unpacking, too. I'm staying
here right by your side forever, buddy!
Our lives have been good here.
That's why we've been putting off
packing. Because subconsciously,
we both know that it would be stupid
to leave. It's safe and warm here.
There's a bar downstairs,
and a cookie robot in the kitchen.
This is my home,
and I'm never leaving!
Listen to you!
You sound like that
fat dweeby kid at camp.
"Mom, Dad, I want to come home.
"The cool kids are playing
keep-away with my inhaler."
I can't believe my dad read that letter
at our wedding.
You can't do this to Lily.
I know your new place
has had some problems,
with the slanted floors
and the nearby sewage treatment plant,
but you're gonna turn it
into a great home.
Tell him, Lily.
It's a black hole
where dreams go to die.
- I'm not moving, either.
- Come on.
You guys finish unpacking.
I'm gonna go bake some cookies
to fill R2-Sweet Tooth.
Oh, my God, look at you cowards!
So afraid of any kind of change.
So terrified of anything new.
So desperate to cling
to anything comfortable and familiar.
I can't move to Japan.
What was I thinking?
It's so far away.
I don't speak the language.
I didn't even have any good pictures
- of you guys.
- Oh, sweetie.
Everybody says
change is so great, right?
- But what's so great about change?
- Who wants to walk down
to our same old bar,
sit in our regular booth
and order the usual?
The usual! My favorite!
Oh, my God.
I believe someone owes me $200.
Barney, this was never a bet.
Nobody...
This proves that I will be
this awesome when I'm 80.
Arthritis five.
- I'm moving to New Jersey.
- What?
You and Marshall should move
to your new place,
- and Robin should go to Japan.
- Why?
Because we're gonna get older
whether we like it or not,
so the only question is
whether we want
to get on with our lives
or desperately cling to the past
and end up like that.
You mean awesome?
I'm 80, dude,
and I'm making out
with a 22-year-old.
Take me to your place, <i>chéri</i>.
I want to see
your World War II medals.
In a minute, <i>mon petite</i>.
All right, so that doesn't count.
What? Why?
She's French that's like
playing tennis with the net down.
You know what?
I'll cover the security deposit.
I'm glad to, because...
every dent in that place represents
a memory that I'll cherish forever.
But on one condition:
we all put aside ten bucks
every week for the next year,
and we come back here and we
buy that 50-year-old scotch,
and we toast the incredible
life-changing year we've all had.
Get out of our booth.
Me with my new family,
Marshall and Lily,
in their new apartment, and Robin
as the number one English-speaking
journalist in the Pacific Rim,
visiting us here in New York
to celebrate this day...
The day we closed
an incredible chapter in our lives,
only to open up a new one.
- I think I left my cell...
- Get out of here.
<i>And one year later,
that's exactly what we did.</i>
And so let's raise a glass
of $2,500 scotch
to one hell of a year.
Amazing.
That's unbelievable.
It's kind of smoky,
with a hint of aged cedar and...
Do you guys taste the difference
and ten-dollar scotch?
- No difference.
- I want to cut mine with Red Bull.
Oh, Wendy, can you take a picture?
<i>A lot of things
did change that year,</i>
<i>but some things stayed the same.</i>
So... what do you say we move
this party upstairs to the apartment?
- Yeah.
- Great idea.
I got the scotch.
What the...?
Barney, this is an intervention.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Enough with the "old man" bit.
What about the old sand pit?
Let it go.
"Let It Snow"?
I love that old ditty!
I'm getting my flail.
You're setting sail?
- Salut.
- Salut, comment ça va ?
Je vais juste finir ça.
On vient de dîner
avec la soeur de Stella et son fiancé.
- Ils se marient avant nous.
- Tu sais, tu rêves
du mariage parfait depuis
que t'es une petite fille.
- Ouais.
- Carrément.
Ma soeur vole mon mariage de rêve.
Jusqu'à chaque petit détail,
sur Shelter Island,
au coucher du soleil,
... près de la plage
à la vieille maison de famille.
C'est mon mariage de rêve.
Je vais finir ça.
Il paraît que l'agneau
est super ici.
Je suis végétalienne. J'aimerais
pouvoir faire taire cette voix en moi
qui dit que manger
un animal est un meurtre,
mais j'imagine que je suis pas
aussi forte que toi.
T'as besoin de protéines.
Je prends l'agneau.
Nouvel objectif :
Notre mariage doit
botter le cul du sien.
Notre mariage doit prendre la tête
du sien, la presser dans les toilettes,
et tirer la chasse 20 fois.
Ted, au lycée,
c'était toi son mariage, non ?
Tu sais, elle veut
toujours me dépasser.
Je l'aime,
mais il y a une part en moi
qui aimerait que tout ça s'écroule.
Je le déteste !
Je le hais.
Dieu, ce steak est bon !
4 jours avant et il fuit avec
une consultante de Whole Foods ?
Je ne me maquille plus, pour lui.
Je ne me douche plus, pour lui.
Je me rase plus
les aisselles, pour lui.
Difficile de savoir
où est le problème.
Maintenant, si près du mariage...
Y a du bacon ou autre chose
dans la sauce. J'adore ça.
Je serai pas remboursée.
Je vais perdre
des milliers de dollars.
<i>Les enfants, dans une relation,</i>
<i>vous développez comme une télépathie
avec votre partenaire.</i>
<i>T'en penses quoi ?</i>
<i>On pourrait l'aider.</i>
<i>Non, Stella,</i>
<i>on devrait l'aider.</i>
<i>Payons le dîner.</i>
T'inquiète pas.
On s'en occupe.
C'est vrai.
On récupère ton mariage,
on te rembourse
tout ce que t'as payé.
Ted et moi, on se marie dimanche.

HIMYM - Saison 4 Épisode 5
Version 1.01
On se marie dimanche ?
On est sûrs d'être prêts pour ça ?
J'ai perdu des années
à attendre que le père de Lucy
se décide à être "prêt" pour ça,
mais il l'a jamais été. C'est pour ça
qu'on s'est jamais mariés.
Allez, faut être spontané,
je rêvais que Tony
soit spontané comme ça.
J'suis partant.
Et je suis aussi... spontané.
J'aurais pas dû faire ça.
<i>Les enfants, la morale arrive
souvent à la fin de l'histoire,</i>
<i>mais celle-là est trop importante,
je vais la dire maintenant :</i>
<i>Ne jamais, jamais,
inviter d'ex à votre mariage.</i>
<i>Si on m'avait donné ce conseil,
ça aurait tout changé.</i>
Il faut que tu viennes,
c'est mon mariage.
Je peux pas. Je suis à Tokyo.
C'est ma première semaine.
Je peux pas partir comme ça.
En plus, je fais enfin
des infos sérieuses.
<i>Robin faisait des infos sérieuses.</i>
C'était la première chaîne
d'info anglaise au Japon.
<i>Bien sûr, les infos
étaient un peu différentes là-bas.</i>
Le conseil de la Fed a voté
de ne pas changer les...
taux directeurs.
C'est mon mariage.
Tu dois y être.
OK, j'y serai.
Je dois y aller.
Bonne soirée.
Et je suis Robin Scherbatsky.
Les pourparlers ont encore été
arrêtés au Moyen-Orient.
Malgré des débuts prometteurs
dans les dernières négociations,
les discussions ont buté
sur la sécurité.
Elle vient.
Bon, enterrement de vie de garçon.
Ce soir, j'ai trois des danseuses
exotiques les plus souples
physiquement et moralement
que t'as jamais vues...
- Pas le temps.
- Je te raconterai.
Faut vraiment qu'on loue
les voitures pour demain.
- Quoi ?
- Pas de "Te marie pas, Ted" ?
Pas de "Tu fais une
grave erreur, Ted" ?
Avez-vous arrêté
la lutte contre le mariage ?
Non, je reconnais une cause perdue,
quand je la vois.
C'est pour ça que je recycle pas.
En plus, Ted qui se marie,
c'est dans mon intérêt.
Tu sais...
<i>j'ai travaillé sur un problème
de la plus haute importance.</i>
<i>J'avoue que j'étais déconcerté.</i>
<i>Jusqu'à ce que je décide de prendre
le taureau par les cornes.</i>
<i>Puis, enfin,</i>
<i>je décryptais le code.</i>
<i>LA FAIRE BOIRE AU MARIAGE DE TED</i>
- Donc, tu reviens sur Robin.
- Espérons.
Ce week-end est ma meilleure chance
de recommencer avec elle.
T'y arriveras jamais.
Trop d'opportunités.
À la première demoiselle
d'honneur bourrée,
t'auras la tête sous sa robe
comme un photographe d'antan.
Lily, plaisante pas.
Je veux pas avoir l'air
gnangnan et romantique,
mais ce week-end, Robin
sera l'unique nana que je tirerai.
<i>Et le jour avant le mariage,</i>
<i>Stella et moi fîmes le voyage
à Shelter Island.</i>
<i>Avec les autres pas très loin.</i>
C'est pas vraiment l'endroit que
j'imaginais pour le mariage de Ted.
"Le Collectif Yoga
et Méditation Namasté."
Je sais pas pour vous, mais je vais pas
namaster ici trop longtemps.
Chéri, va voir la hippie sale
pour la réservation là-bas,
nous, on va prendre à boire.
Vous avez quoi comme scotch ?
Au Centre, nous avons
une politique anti-alcool stricte.
Super, les repas sont compris, non ?
Oui, et ils sont tous
100% végétaliens.
J'ai besoin d'alcool.
Je vais pas me faire Robin
avec ces trucs.
Regarde ça.
Cocktail de baies,
revitalisant pour méninges.
Je rêve, ces boissons pourraient
rendre une fille plus intelligente.
Dans quel enfer Ted nous a amenés ?
- Y a pas de viande.
- Y a pas d'alcool.
Pire encore, je suis
sûr à 90% que ce type
à qui tu parlais était
le chanteur des Spin Doctors.
Les gars,
Stella et moi
avons un petit problème.
Les programmes sont super.
C'est pas nos noms dessus,
mais sinon, c'est très joli.
Au fait, j'ai parlé à Robin.
Elle est un peu en retard,
mais elle sera là à temps.
- T'as invité Robin ?
- Oui, bien sûr.
Tu m'as pas prévenue.
Je sais pas trop quoi en penser.
Je peux t'aider ?
T'es contente.
- Tu l'aimes bien.
- Oui, mais c'est ton ex petite amie.
- C'est bizarre.
- Mais non.
C'est bizarre.
T'imagines pas ce que c'est de voir
l'ex de son mec au mariage.
Ton nouveau mari me démontait
bien trois fois par jour.
Quand les ex sont présents,
je sais pas, ça fait ressurgir...
des choses non résolues.
Avec ton ex pas loin, qui te dit
que la flamme se rallumera pas ?
Allez, on est amis. En plus,
on a déjà eu notre rechute
au dernier Thanksgiving,
c'est pas vieux.
T'as parié de l'argent contre toi
dans cette querelle ?
Elle a déjà son billet.
C'est important pour moi.
J'aurais jamais invité le père de Lucy.
Ça m'aurait pas dérangé.
Tony est super. Invitons-le aussi.
Non, Tony est la dernière personne
que je veux voir ici, OK ?
Et, Robin est l'avant-dernière.
Robin va pas tarder
à embarquer dans l'avion.
En plus, elle a lâché
un travail important pour ça.
Dopées par les inquiétudes sur
l'environnement et les prix du pétrole,
les ventes de véhicules hybrides
ont augmenté de 11%
au cours de l'année dernière.
- Qu'est-ce que je dois faire ?
- Je sais pas.
Je comprends son truc "pas d'ex".
Pourquoi vouloir qu'une histoire ratée
vienne en voir une réussie ?
C'est comme inviter les Mariners
de Seattle aux World Series.
C'est gênant pour tout le monde.
Quoi ? Non. Robin doit venir.
C'est vrai, c'est ma meilleure amie.
Amie fille.
Ma meilleure amie fille.
Je m'en fous, pourquoi faire genre.
- Mec, Robin doit être là.
- Elle doit pas venir.
- De quoi tu parl...
- Justice Aldrin, le dernier mot.
OK, ce serait bizarre sans Robin.
Mais on contredit pas la mariée.
- Je vais lui dire de pas venir.
- C'est la bonne décision.
Ça va être la pire conversation
téléphonique de tous les temps.
Co-témoin, je m'en occupe.
- Allo ?
- Robin, t'es où ?
Je pars à l'aéroport.
OK, à dans quelques heures.
Bon vol.
Mauvaise nouvelle.
J'arrive pas à l'avoir.
Robin est déjà partie.
OK, Robin arrive.
Vous savez, ça me va.
Les ex devraient pouvoir
aller aux mariages.
Je vais dire à Stella de faire avec.
Tu devrais être plus délicat
avec Stella à propos de Robin.
- Tu veux dire quoi par "délicat" ?
- Les mariées sont très stressées
avant un mariage.
Bon, bien sûr, moi,
j'étais sous contrôle.
Tu te souviens pas ?
Le fleuriste m'a dit que les roses
sont plus rose moyen pâle
que rose moyen.
Rose moyen pâle !
Tout est fichu.
Notre salle de mariage
utilise une chaudière
au lieu d'un chauffage à air pulsé.
C'est la chose qui me préoccupait.
Pourquoi on se marie toujours ?
Après un moment,
c'est que du blabla.
Pauvre Stella qui doit faire
les folies d'un mois en 3 jours.
- Je fais quoi ?
- Tu attends la prochaine crise,
tu la règles, tu es un héros.
Après, t'abordes le sujet de Robin,
mais cette fois-ci, elle dira oui.
Et s'il n'y a pas d'autres crises ?
C'est une mariée.
Il y aura une autre crise.
Quatre minutes plus tard.
- Il y a une nouvelle crise.
- Génial ! C'est quoi ?
Ma fille, ma propre fille
ne vient pas à notre mariage.
Quoi ?
Tony devait la conduire ici, demain,
mais il encaisse mal mon mariage,
et il veut pas l'emmener.
Ça fait 5 ans.
Pourquoi ne pas tourner la page ?
Donc première chose demain,
j'y vais pour lui parler,
le convaincre de me laisser emmener
Lucy, puis boum, crise résolue.
Stella est contente.
Robin vient au mariage.
- Tu es Barney ?
- Oui.
J'ai entendu dire que tu étais
un vrai salop, alors écoute.
Demain soir, je veux faire des choses
si cochonnes et dépravées
que j'en oublierai que c'était
censé être mon mariage.
Je suis ici avec quelqu'un.
Amène-la.
Tu vas jamais y arriver.
<i>Donc, le matin de mon mariage,
j'ai fait le chemin</i>
<i>jusqu'à chez Tony,</i>
<i>pour prendre Lucy.</i>
On fait un peu de karaté ?
Désolé, désolé mec.
Tu as activé mon alarme de défense.
Tu dois retenir ces choses.
- Reste vigilant, reste en vie.
- OK.
Qu'est-ce qui t'amène ?
Je pensais que tu serais
dans une suite nuptiale
avec ma femme.
Pas encore. Bientôt.
C'est vrai,
ce soir est le grand soir.
Oh, mec,
tu vas faire l'amour
à la mère de ma fille.
En fait, je lui ai déjà fait
l'amour plein de fois.
Pourquoi je corrige
toujours les gens ?
Toi et Stella.
Tu as de la chance.
Je pourrais juste...
Je suis très content pour vous.
Écoute, voilà le truc...
- Tu ne peux pas la prendre.
- Tony, arrête.
C'est aussi un grand jour pour Lucy.
Tu vas devoir mettre
tes problèmes de côté
et penser à ce qui est le mieux
pour elle. Que ça te plaise ou non,
elle devrait vraiment être
au mariage de sa mère.
J'emmène Lucy avec moi.
Tu as raison, mec.
Tu as raison.
Je suis désolé. Je suis désolé.
C'est juste...
Vous voir ensemble...
m'a fait réaliser
tout ce que j'avais.
Arrêtons les câlins.
Je suis désolé.
Lucy est tout pour moi.
Je vais la perdre avec cette famille,
dont je ne fais pas partie.
- Mais tu en fais partie.
- J'ai pas été invité au mariage.
Tu l'es maintenant.
"Road Trip"
OK ?
"Road Trip 2, Retour
Dans La Voiture".
C'est le grand jour.
Tu t'hydrates ?
Chère femme, merci de l'intérêt
que tu as pour Barney Stinson...
Ton dos va ressembler
à un Jackson Pollock.
J'ai le regret de vous informer
qu'à ce moment...
J'ai été végétalienne pendant 2 ans.
J'ai besoin de viande.
Il n'y a actuellement
aucun poste disponible.
Je suis prof de yoga.
Toutes les positions sont possibles.
Ta chambre, dans 20 minutes.
Pas de préliminaires.
- Je vais pas le faire, hein ?
- Aucune chance.
- Laisse-moi parler à Stella d'abord.
- Maman !
Ted a invité papa !
Salut, mon cœur.
Tu m'as manquée.
Juste une seconde, OK ?
T'as invité Tony ?
À notre mariage ?
On en a discuté.
Pas d'ex à notre mariage.
Pourquoi t'as fait ça ?
Qu'a fait Ted cette fois-ci ?
Que fait Robin ici ?
Je pensais avoir été claire.
Pas d'ex à notre mariage.
Pour être juste...
- ton ex est ici.
- Tu l'as invité !
- Allez, c'est pas bizarre.
- C'est bizarre.
C'est comme si c'était pas fini
entre vous.
Et Tony...
Je peux pas m'occuper de lui.
Tu veux bien lui dire de partir ?
Tu peux dire que c'est de ma faute.
J'irai parler à Robin,
qu'elle sache que c'est pas personnel.
<i>Les enfants, si j'avais laissé
Stella parler à Robin,</i>
<i>cette histoire se serait
finie autrement.</i>
Je comprends.
Pigé.
<i>Pour la première fois,
Ted et Stella Mosby.</i>
<i>Et voilà, comment
j'ai rencontré votre mère.</i>
Votre père a enfin fini de radoter ?
Qui veut de la glace ?
<i>Mais, je l'ai pas fait.</i>
Tu peux parler à Tony ?
Robin a fait le voyage depuis Tokyo.
Je devrais lui parler.
Bien sûr.
- Désolé d'avoir fui comme ça.
- Ça va.
T'imagines pas
le voyage que j'ai fait.
J'étais dans l'avion,
un jour entier.
Mais ça valait le coup de te voir
te marier. Comment rater ça...
- Tu peux pas venir.
- Dieu merci !
Quoi ?
- C'est bizarre.
- C'est pas bizarre.
C'est bizarre. Tu sais ce que ça fait
d'être l'ex d'un des mariés ?
Prends ça, salope ! J'ai gagné !
On a rompu, il y a plus d'un an.
Oui, mais ça fait pas
si longtemps que ça.
Te voir épouser une autre femme
est pas vraiment un truc
que j'attends impatiemment.
Je pensais juste que
si je changeais d'avis
pour le mariage et les enfants,
c'était bien de savoir
que tu étais là.
Donc, j'étais ton plan de secours.
C'est flatteur.
- C'est pas ça. C'est juste...
- Pourquoi tu parles de ça ?
- Il y a plus rien entre nous.
- Peut-être que si.
Je veux dire, bien sûr que si.
Le genre de truc
qui part pas d'un seul coup.
Je suis pas une invitée de plus.
C'est vrai. On sortait
ensemble, mais...
on est passé à autre chose.
Et on a eu ce qu'on voulait.
Je me marie, tu as le job
de tes rêves à Tokyo.
- Et ils vécurent heureux...
- J'ai quitté mon boulot.
- Tu quoi ?
- Je reviens à New York.
Je pensais vouloir
ce boulot, mais...
Je veux revenir à ma vraie vie.
Et tu devrais retourner à la tienne.
Ça veut dire quoi ?
Te marie pas.
Écoute, c'est précipité.
C'est comme si tu commençais
un livre par la fin.
Tu es le plus romantique.
Tu as volé un cor bleu pour moi.
T'as tenté de faire de la pluie.
- J'ai fait de la pluie.
- C'était une coïncidence.
Après tout ça, voilà comment
ta quête romantique touche à sa fin ?
Tu te caches
dans le mariage d'un autre,
dans sa maison, dans sa vie,
sans y réfléchir à deux fois.
Ce n'est pas la fin
spectaculaire que tu mérites.
Ce n'est pas Ted Mosby.
J'aime Stella.
C'est la bonne.
Si tu ressens tout ça...
je pense que c'est une bonne chose
que tu viennes pas au mariage.
- Grosse dispute ?
- Oui.
Voilà.
C'est pour moi.
Vous arrêtez pas.
Mon Dieu, si, arrêtez-vous.
Je passe une très mauvaise journée.
J'ai piqué du scotch au duty free.
Ça te dit ?
Allons dans ta chambre.
Très loin de celle-ci.
- Et on peut se la siffler.
- J'ai pas de chambre.
En fait, je pensais pouvoir
rester avec toi.
Pas de problème.
Je dois juste ranger un peu.
Des fringues par terre et...
Et une fille nue,
attachée à ton lit.
Des serviettes dans la salle de bain,
un vrai foutoir.
Alors, donne-moi 10 minutes...
- pour remettre de l'ordre...
- À plus, Barney.
OK, allons-y.
C'est qui, ça ?
La fille de la réception.
<i>Les enfants, parfois
vous pensez vivre une histoire,</i>
<i>mais la vérité s'avère être
tout à fait différente.</i>
<i>En ce temps-là, je pensais que</i>
<i>ça ne concernait que
la présence de Robin au mariage.</i>
<i>Si seulement j'avais compris
de quoi il était question.</i>
Avoir ses ex à proximité...
ça révèle
des problèmes non résolus.
Avec ton ex pas loin, qui te dit
que la flamme se rallumera pas ?
C'est comme si c'était pas fini
entre vous
J'ai perdu des années
à attendre que le père de Lucy
se décide à être "prêt" pour ça.
Vous voir ensemble...
m'a fait réaliser
tout ce que j'avais.
Je rêvais que Tony
soit spontané comme ça.
<i>Sérieusement, les enfants,</i>
<i>n'invitez jamais vos ex</i>
<i>à votre mariage.</i>
- Hey.
- Hey, guys, how's it going?
I'm gonna finish this.
We had dinner
with Stella's sister and her fiancé?
- They're getting married before us.
- How you've dreamt
about your perfect wedding day
when you were a little girl?
- Yeah.
- Totally.
My sister is stealing
my dream wedding.
Down to every last detail
on Shelter Island, at sunset...
... just down the beach
from our family's old summer house.
It's my dream wedding.
I'm gonna finish this.
- The lamb here is supposed to be great.
- I'm a vegan.
I wish I could tune out
that moral voice
inside me
that says eating animals is murder,
but I guess I'm just not
as strong as you are.
That's 'cause you need protein.
I'll have the lamb.
Okay, new goal:
I want our wedding
to kick her wedding's ass.
I want our wedding
to take her wedding's head
and shove it in the toilet
and flush it, like,20 times.
Ted, in high school,
you were her wedding, weren't you?
You know,she's always trying
to one-up me. I mean, I love her, but,
there's a part of me that kinda wishes
this whole thing would just fall apart.
I hate him. I hate him!
I hate him.
God, this steak is so good!
Four days to go and he just runs off
with the vitamin consultant
from Whole Foods?
I gave up makeup for him.
I gave up showering for him.
I gave up shaving my armpits for him.
Hard to imagine
where it all went wrong.
Now it's so close to the wedding...
There's like bacon or something
in this dipping sauce. I love it.
I can't get any refunds.
I'm gonna be out
thousands of dollars.
<i>Kids, when you're in a relationship,</i>
<i>you develop a kind
of telepathy with your partner.</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>
<i>We could help her out.</i>
<i>No, Stella,</i>
<i>we should help her out.</i>
<i>Let's pay for dinner.</i>
Nora. Don't worry.
We got this.
That's right.
We'll take over your wedding,
pay you back
for everything you spent.
Ted and I will get married
this Sunday.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
We're getting married this Sunday?
Are we sure we're ready for this?
Ted, I wasted years
trying to get Lucy's dad
to decide he was "ready" for this,
but he never got ready for this.
That's why we never got married.
Come on, let's just be spontaneous.
I used to dream that Tony
would be spontaneous like this.
Okay, I'm in.
And I'm also... spontaneous.
I wish I hadn't done that.
<i>Kids, morals usually
come at the end of stories,</i>
<i>but this one is so important,
I'm gonna tell you now:</i>
<i>Don't ever, ever
invite an ex to your wedding.</i>
<i>If someone had given me that advice,
well, it'd've changed everything.</i>
Come on, you've got to come,
it's my wedding.
I can't. I'm in Tokyo.
It's my first week on the job.
I can't just take off.
Plus, I'm finally
doing serious news.
<i>Robin was doing serious news.</i>
<i>It was the number one
English news network in Japan.</i>
<i>Of course, the news was
a little different over there.</i>
The Federal Reserve Board voted
to leave interest...
rates unchanged.
It's my wedding.
You have to be there.
Okay. I'll be there.
I gotta go.
Good evening.
And I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
Peace talks were stalled once again
in the Middle East.
Despite a promising start
in the latest negotiations,
talks foundered on security issues.
She's in.
All right,
your bachelor party, tonight.
I have got three of the most
physically and morally
flexible exotic dancers
you've ever seen...
- There's no time.
- I'll let you know how it goes.
We should really rent
the cars for tomorrow?
- What?
- No, "Don't get married, Ted"?
No, "You're making
a big mistake, Ted"?
Barney Stinson...
are you no longer committed
to the war on marriage?
No, I just know
a hopeless cause when I see it.
It's the same reason
I don't recycle.
Plus, Ted getting married
is in my best interest.
You see...
Lately I've been working on a problem
of the utmost importance.
I confess I was stumped.
Until one night I decided
to tackle it once and for all.
Then, at last,
I cracked the code.
- So you're back on Robin.
- Hopefully.
I mean, this weekend is the best chance
ever to hook up with her again.
You'll never pull it off.
There's too many distractions.
The first drunk bridesmaid you see,
you'll have your head under her dress
like an old-time photographer.
Lily, don't cheapen this.
I don't want to sound all
mushy-gushy and romantic,
but this weekend,
Robin is the only woman I'm banging.
<i>And so, the day before our wedding,</i>
<i>Stella and I made the trip up
to Shelter Island.</i>
<i>With everyone else not far behind.</i>
- Zitch dog.
- Z... Zog...
This isn't exactly
where I pictured Ted getting married.
"The Namaste Yoga
and Meditation Collective."
I don't know about you, but Nama-stay
here any longer than I have to.
Sweetie,
go check in with that dirty hippie
over there
and we'll get some drinks.
What scotches you got?
Here at the center,
we have a very strict no-alcohol policy.
Great, and all the meals
are included, right?
And they're all 100% vegan.
I need alcohol.
I'm not gonna get Robin
with this stuff.
Look at this.
Berry Blaster Brain Revitalizer.
My God, some of these drinks
could actually make a girl smarter.
What sort of hell
has Ted brought us to?
- There's no meat.
- There's no alcohol.
It gets worse:
I'm 90% sure that guy
you were talking with used to be
lead singer of the Spin Doctors.
Hey, guys,
Stella and I have a little problem.
The programs look great.
I mean, it's not our names on the front,
but otherwise, really nice.
I talked to Robin.
She's running a little bit late,
but she'll be here just under the wire.
- You invited Robin?
- Yeah, of course.
You never told me that.
I'm not sure how I feel about that.
Can I help?
You feel glad.
- You like Robin.
- Yeah, but
she's your ex-girlfriend.
- It's weird.
- It's not weird.
It's weird.
You don't get what it's like for a bride
to see her groom's ex at their wedding.
Your new husband used to nail me,
like, three times a day.
Having exes around,
I don't know, it brings up...
unresolved things.
How do you know that spark won't come
back with your ex sitting out there?
Come on, we're just friends. Plus,
Robin and I already had our backslide
last Thanksgiving,
not even that long ago.
Did you place a large bet
against yourself in this argument?
She already got her ticket.
It's important to me.
I would never invite Lucy's dad.
I wouldn't care if you did.
Tony's great. Let's invite him, too.
Tony is the last person
I want at our wedding, okay?
And Robin is a close second.
Robin's probably
about to get on the plane.
Plus, she left
a really important job for this.
Spurred by environmental concerns
and high gasoline prices,
sales of hybrid vehicles have risen
11% over the previous year.
What should I do?
I don't know.
I kinda get the no exes thing.
Why ask a failed romance to come
and watch your successful one?
It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners
to a World Series game.
It's weird for everyone.
What? Robin has to come.
Right, she's, like, my best friend.
Female friend.
My best female friend.
I don't care, why fake it.
- Dude, Robin has to be here.
- She shouldn't come.
- What are you talk...
- Justice Aldrin, tie-breaking vote.
Wouldn't feel right without Robin.
But you don't mess with the bride.
- I'm gonna tell her not to come.
- It's the right decision, Ted.
This is gonna be, like, the worst
phone conversation of all time.
Co-best man, I'm on it.
- Hello?
- Where are you?
Just heading to the airport.
We'll see you soon.
Have a great flight.
Bad news.
I couldn't reach her.
Robin's already on her way.
Robin's on her way.
You know what, I'm glad.
Exes should be allowed
to come to weddings.
I'll just tell Stella
she's got to deal with it.
You need to be more delicate with Stella
about this whole Robin thing.
- What do you mean by delicate?
- Brides are under a lot of stress
before a wedding.
I mean, of course,
I held it together pretty well.
You don't remember?
The florist just told me
the roses are more light medium-pink
than medium-pink.
Light medium-pink!
Everything's ruined.
Our wedding site uses
a gravity furnace
instead of forced-air heating.
That's the one thing I cared about.
Why are we even getting married?
After a while, it's all noise.
Poor Stella's had to jam months
of crazy into just three days.
- So what do I do?
- You wait for the next crisis,
you solve it, you're a hero.
Then you bring up the Robin thing,
but this time she'll say yes.
But what if there's no next crisis?
She's a bride.
There will be a next crisis.
- There's an next crisis.
- Awesome! What is it?
My daughter, my own daughter
isn't coming to our wedding.
What?
Tony's supposed to drive her up
tomorrow, but now he's being all petty
about me getting married,
and he won't do it.
It's been five years.
Why can't we just move on already?
So first thing tomorrow,
I drive down, talk to him,
get him to let me drive Lucy up,
then, boom, crisis solved.
Stella's happy.
Robin comes to the wedding.
- You Barney?
- Yes.
I hear you're a real man whore,
so listen up.
Tomorrow night, I want to do things
so dirty and so depraved
that I forget that this was supposed
to be my wedding.
I'm kind of here with someone.
Bring her.
You're never gonna make it.
<i>So, the morning of my wedding day
I made the trip back</i>
<i>to Tony's house</i>
<i>to get Lucy.</i>
Doing a little karate?
Sorry, sorry, man.
You set off my internal defense alarm.
You got to watch these things.
- Stay alert, stay alive.
- Right.
So what brings you here?
I thought you'd be off
in some honeymoon suite
with my woman right now.
Not yet. Soon.
That's right, tonight's the night.
Oh, man,
you are going to be sticking it
to the mother of my child.
Actually, I've already stuck it
to her plenty of times.
Why do I always have
to correct people?
You and Stella.
You lucky dog. I could just...
I'm so happy for you, guys.
Listen, here's the thing...
- You can't take her.
- Tony, stop.
This is a big day for Lucy, too.
You're going to have
to put aside your own issues
and think about what's best for her,
here. Whether you like it or not,
she really should be at
her mother's wedding.
I'm taking Lucy with me.
You're right, man.
You're right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just...
seeing you guys...
has made me realize
everything I had.
Let's stop hugging.
I'm sorry.
Lucy means the world to me.
I feel like I'm losing her to this new
family, a family I'm not even a part of.
- Come on, sure you are.
- I wasn't even invited to the wedding.
You are now.
Road trip.
Right?
"Road Trip 2. Back in the Car".
Today's the day. You hydrating?
Dear female, thank you
for your interest in Barney Stinson...
Your back is going to look like
a Jackson Pollock.
I regret to inform you
that at this time...
I was a vegan for two years.
I need meat.
There are currently
no positions available.
I'm a yoga instructor.
Every position is available.
Your room, 20 minutes.
No foreplay.
- I'm not going to make it, am I?
- Not a chance.
- Remember, let me talk to Stella first.
- Mommy!
Ted invited Daddy!
Hi, sweetie. I missed you.
Give me just a sec, okay?
You invited Tony?
To our wedding?
We talked about this.
No exes at our wedding.
- Why would you do this?
- Oh, boy.
What did Ted do this time?
What is Robin doing here?
I thought I made myself clear.
No exes at our wedding.
To be fair...
- your ex is here.
- You invited him!
- Come on, it's not weird.
- It is weird.
It's like things are not finished
between you two.
And Tony...
I can't deal with Tony now.
Can you please go out there
and tell him to leave?
You can make me the bad guy.
I'll go talk to Robin,
so she knows it's nothing personal.
<i>And, kids, if I had just let
Stella talk to Robin,</i>
<i>this whole story might have
ended differently.</i>
I understand.
I get it.
<i>For the first time,
Ted and Stella Mosby.</i>
<i>And that's how I met your mother.</i>
Is your dad finally done yakking?
Now, come on, who wants ice cream?
<i>But I didn't.</i>
Can you talk to Tony?
Robin flew all the way here from Tokyo.
I should talk to her.
Sure.
- Sorry about running off like that.
- It's okay.
You would not believe the trip I had.
I was on a plane for almost a full day.
It's worth it to see you get married.
How could I not be here...?
- You can't come to the wedding.
- Thank God!
What?
- It's weird.
- It's not weird.
It is weird. Do you know how it feels
to be somebody's ex at their wedding?
Suck it, bitch! I win!
We broke up over a year ago.
Yeah, but that's not that long ago.
Watching your marry another woman
isn't exactly something
I was looking forward to.
I don't know, I just thought
if I ever changed my mind about
marriage and kids, it was...
it was nice to know
that you were there.
So, I was your safety school.
How flattering.
- That's not it. It's just that...
- Why are you bringing any of this up?
- There's nothing between us anymore.
- Maybe there is.
I mean, of course there is.
That kind of stuff
doesn't disappear without a trace.
I'm not just another guest here.
Right. We used to date, but...
we both moved on.
And, look, we got what we wanted.
I'm getting married,
you got your dream job in Tokyo.
- And they all lived happily ever...
- I quit my job.
- You what?
- I'm moving back to New York.
I thought I wanted that job, but...
I want to come back to my real life.
And I think you should
go back to yours.
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't get married.
Look, you're rushing into this.
It's like you're trying to skip ahead
to the end of the book.
You're the most romantic guy I know.
You stole a blue French horn for me.
You tried to make it rain.
- I did make it rain.
- It was a coincidence.
But after all that, this is how your
great romantic quest comes to an end?
You're just disappearing
into someone else's wedding,
someone else's house, someone
else's life without a second thought.
That's not the amazing ending
that you deserve.
That's not Ted Mosby.
I love Stella.
She's the one.
If you really feel that way...
I guess it's a good thing you're not
coming to the wedding after all.
- Big fight?
- Yeah.
Here...
It's on the house.
Just keep 'em coming.
God, do not keep them coming.
I am having a horrible day.
I snuck some scotch in from the duty
free store. You want to join me?
Let's go to your room.
Far away from this room.
- And we can knock it back.
- They didn't get me a room.
I was actually hoping
I could stay with you.
No problem.
I just have to straighten up
a little bit.
I've got some clothes
on the floor, and...
And a naked girl tied
to your headboard.
Towels all over the bathroom.
It's a mess.
So, anyway...
Give me ten minutes
- to get the place in order...
- See ya, Barney.
Okay, let's do this.
Who the hell is that?
It's the girl from the front desk.
<i>Kids, sometimes you think
you're living out one story,</i>
<i>but the truth turns out
to be something else entirely.</i>
<i>At the time I thought the story</i>
<i>was about whether Robin should be
at the wedding.</i>
<i>If only I'd understood
what the real story was.</i>
Having exes around...
I don't know, it brings up
unresolved things.
How do you know that spark won't come
back with your ex sitting out there?
Like things are not finished
between you two.
I wasted years trying to get
Lucy's dad to decide
if he was ready for this.
Seeing you guys...
It's made me realize
everything I had.
I used to dream that Tony would be
spontaneous like this.
<i>Seriously, kids,</i>
<i>never invite an ex</i>
<i>to your wedding.</i>
<i>Les enfants, le jour de votre mariage
doit être le plus beau de votre vie,</i>
<i>l'aboutissement
d'une parfaite histoire d'amour.</i>
<i>Mon mariage, du moins le premier</i>
<i>ne s'est pas si bien passé.</i>
C'est drôle quand j'y repense.
J'étais sûr que Stella
était la bonne.
Quand elle m'a quitté,
j'étais si dévasté.
Mais vous m'avez aidé à dépasser ça.
Maintenant, le plus dur est passé.
J'en suis sorti un peu plus fort.
Vous savez, je ne pense
presque plus à elle.
C'est l'oeuvre du temps, j'imagine.
Ted, le mariage était hier.
Ça fait 24 heures.
Je sais.
C'est tout moi, j'avance.
Un nouveau chapitre de ma vie
s'ouvre aujourd'hui,
et on va fêter ça.
Là, on a besoin de deux choses.
On a besoin de Kool, et du Gang.
C'est l'heure du jukebox !
Je regarde ce jeune homme
en train de danser près du jukebox,
et je ne peux m'empêcher
de penser...
Stella a peut-être fait
le bon choix.
- Aïe.
- Comment il peut danser, là ?
Il devrait être en train de défoncer
la voiture de Stella avec une massue.
Supposition.
Il fait pas semblant d'être heureux.
Ted est vraiment heureux. Il ne voulait
pas se marier dès le départ.
Ted a réalisé la meilleure esquive
de train depuis <i>Stand by Me.</i>
Bon, pas le premier gamin,
mais les autres.
Non, il est dans un sale état.
Ça gaze ?
Un sale état.
Et on se doit d'être là pour lui.
<i>Mais autant mes amis
voulaient être là pour moi,</i>
<i>que j'allais, en apparence, bien.</i>
- Hé, mec.
- Tu veux traîner ?
Les filles, je vais bien.
- Hé mec, on se fait une partie ?
- Je vais bien.
Hé, petit.
Barney, je vais bien !
C'est pas nécessaire,
et c'est plutôt malsain.
Désolé, mesdames.
Je ne savais pas que tu serais là.
Les filles, cage d'escalier.

<i>Finalement, après deux semaines,
les émotions ont fini par déborder.</i>
- Vous voulez quoi pour dîner ?
- Oh, ferme la.
Je suis désolée,
c'est que t'as vécu
quelque chose de traumatisant,
et on essaye d'être là pour toi,
mais tu nous laisses pas faire,
et ça nous énerve,
petite pute égoïste.
Désolée.
On est préoccupés que t'affrontes pas
ce qui s'est passé avec Stella.
Tu te souviens quand Lily m'a quitté ?
Comment j'ai enfoui mes émotions ?
Elle... me... manque tellement.
Ouais mec, t'as été un roc.
J'aurais dû être pire, OK ?
J'aurais dû m'énerver,
suivre ton conseil
et brûler les affaires de Lily.
Super. Merci, Ted.
Je l'ai pas fait, et c'est pour ça
que j'ai mis si longtemps
à aller mieux. Donc Ted,
Je veux que t'exploses.
Libère ta rage.
Prêt ?
Maintenant !
Ça va.
Les mecs, lâchez-le.
Il est heureux.
Écoutez, si Ted était marié, là,
il serait marié,
il vivrait dans le New Jersey,
et, il serait marié.
Il va bien.
Bon, allons manger.
- Disons Flat Michael's ?
- C'est entre la 44e et Lex. Impossible.
- Pourquoi ?
- C'est près de la gym de Stella.
On pourrait la croiser.
Partout ailleurs, ça va.
OK, pourquoi pas Hurley's ?
Pile entre son bureau
et son teinturier. Désolé.
Disons, Le Pain de Viande
de Charlie ?
À deux rues du coiffeur de sa mère.
D'accord Ted, y a-t'il un endroit
dans Manhattan où on puisse dîner ?
Évidemment.
Regardez ça.
- C'est quoi ce truc ?
- Une carte référence que j'ai faite.
Un guide des endroits
où l'on peut croiser Stella Zinman.
Les zones rouges : à éviter.
Le blanc : OK.
Le bleu : la mer.
- C'est ridicule.
- La mer, c'est bleu.
Tu peux pas vivre comme ça.
Elle te quitte sur l'autel,
et c'est toi qui l'évites ?
Oui, je l'évite.
Quel est le problème ?
On fait comme ça.
C'est qui "on", des petites bites ?
Non, "on", ce sont les gens
du grand État d'Ohio.
Quand la vie est dure, nous prenons
la douleur et nous l'enfouissons.
Et si la douleur remonte, on enfouit
une autre douleur par dessus.
Pourquoi affronter
quand on peut éviter ?
Tout ce que j'ai à faire
c'est de jamais la revoir,
et j'aurai une longue vie heureuse.
- Alors, qui veut manger ?
- Quelqu'un m'a parlé
d'un bar à tapas
situé en zone blanche.
Super. Allons-y.
- Vous avez choisi ?
- Pas encore.
Peut-on avoir des amandes
pour la table ?
Certainement.
Bien joué, Lily.
Cet endroit a l'air cool.
Qui t'en a parlé ?
En fait, je m'en souviens pas.
Quoi ?
Je me souviens.
Oh mon Dieu !
Oh mon Dieu !
OK, restez cool.
On va juste devoir gérer ça.
Tout le monde...
suivez-moi.
- Oh, tu rigoles.
- Il est sérieux ?
Je vais pas sous cette table.
Éventuellement, sous celle-là.
Elle se retourne.
Réfléchis, réfléchis.
Les gars, restez-là.
Je vais jeter un coup d'œil.
Marshall, va regarder.
- Vous voulez des couverts ?
- Non, je rentre chez moi.
Elle a pris à emporter.
Elle a l'air heureuse ?
Elle a parlé de moi ?
Je m'en fous. Où sont ces amandes ?
Où peuvent bien être
les noix de Ted ?
Tu devrais vérifier
dans l'étau du garage de Stella.
Va l'engueuler.
T'es peut-être de l'Ohio,
mais tu vis à New York, maintenant.
On n'enfouit pas
nos émotions à New York.
On prend nos émotions et on les envoie
dans la face des autres !
Lâche-moi. Tu ferais pareil
si t'étais dans cette situation.
Je rêve !
Y a pas une personne sur Terre pour qui
je me cacherais sous une table.
Vraiment, pas une seule ?
Pas même...
Gazeur ?
Comment oses-tu prononcer
ce nom devant moi ?
Qui est Gazeur ?
C'est la dernière personne
que je voudrais voir ici.
Michael Sasseur. C'est un mec
avec qui j'étais au lycée.
<i>Michael était à côté de moi
en biologie.</i>
<i>C'était un raté
pendant tout le collège,</i>
<i>mais l'été précédant la 3e</i>
<i>il a grandi de 30 cm
et a rejoint l'équipe de baseball.</i>
<i>Il était en train de devenir
un mec cool.</i>
<i>Jusqu'au jour...</i>
Lily, on est tous passés par-là.
Quand on en lâche un,
c'est pas joli.
- Tu as fait quoi ?
- Tu plaisantes ?
C'était la 3e.
Je n'avais qu'un choix.
Oh, mon Dieu, Sasseur !
Ça gaze ?
C'était pas moi. C'était elle.
Bien sûr, Sasseur.
Ou plutôt Gazeur.
Gazeur !
Je suis dans l'équipe de baseball.
Je suis cool.
Le surnom de Gazeur est resté.
Il a eu tellement de moqueries,
qu'il a dû changer d'école.
- Les enfants sont géniaux.
- Ça m'a toujours culpabilisée.
Mais si Gazeur... Michael...
entrait maintenant,
aussi dur que ça puisse être,
j'irais vers Gazeur... Michael...
- et je réglerais les choses entre nous.
- Purifier l'air, comme avant.
Oh, mec.
Ça n'arrive pas souvent.
Vous êtes les bienvenus.
Ça va les gars ?
On va juste manger ici,
si c'est possible.
- Voilà vos amandes.
- Merci. Vous avez un plat du jour ?
Ted, c'est ridicule.
Je suis une personne qui...
Bien, faisons face.
Il y a un tas de gens
que je ne veux pas voir...
comme le groupe
des "nanas que j'ai sautées"...
mais si l'une d'elles entrait ici,
je resterais là, et je les regarderais
droit dans les yeux.
Pour certaines,
ce serait la première fois.
Vraiment, tu te cacherais
de personne ?
Même pas de...
Becca Delucci ?
Fils de pute.
- Qui est Becca Delucci ?
- Vous permettez ?
Qui est Becca Delucci ?
Becca est cette fille
qui vit au nord.
Je la voyais de temps à autre.
Où exactement au nord, Barney ?
Pénitencier fédéral
de Bedford Hills.
<i>Et oui, les visites
étaient de nature conjugale.</i>
C'est pas vrai ?
Vraiment.
Et ce que j'ai eu avec Becca
était une relation parfaite.
Elle n'était autorisée à m'appeler,
qu'une fois par semaine.
Si elle devenait trop collante,
les gardes armés la stoppaient.
J'ai jamais eu à payer le dîner.
En fait, c'est faux.
Je paye des impôts.
Je suppose qu'on a tous payé
pour le dîner. Merci, les gars.
En tout cas, à la dernière visite,
j'ai tout bousillé.
Je sais que c'est dur, bébé,
mais je suis dans une prison aussi.
Emprisonné dans mon coeur.
Cette chambre est prête ou quoi ?
On peut...?
Tu es la seule chose
qui me fait tenir, ici.
C'est pour ça que je suis là, bébé.
Je suis ta force.
Je suis... Oh, mon Dieu.
Salut, étrangère.
Barney Stinson, avocat.
- Parlons de votre sortie.
- Putain, non !
Maintenant, j'ai des lettres de Becca
qui disent,
"Je vais venir te voir
le jour où je sors d'ici.
"Je vais accrocher tes yeux
à mon rétroviseur."
Les femmes, hein ?
Tu vois ?
T'as peur de Becca.
Lily a peur de Gazeur.
On reste sous la table.
On a pas besoin. Stella est partie.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Voilà, c'est fait,
et c'est ça, le style Ohio.
Le problème s'est manifesté.
On l'a évité. Il est parti.
- Là, on peut dîner en paix...
- Elle revient.
On pense tous que tu as besoin...
Attendez, où est Barney ?
- On pense que tu dois lui parler.
- Pas moi.
- Quoi ?
- Si la dernière personne
que je voulais voir, entrait,
je voudrais pas lui parler.
- Vraiment ?
- C'est qui ?
Mon père.
Les gars,
cette autre table est sûre.
- De quoi on parlait ?
- Du père de Robin.
J'ai pas parlé de lui en 3 ans
et je veux pas commencer maintenant.
Pourquoi ?
<i>Ça remonte à ma naissance.</i>
Allez, donne-moi mon fils. Pousse.
Il voulait un fils et le fait
que je sois une fille n'a rien changé.
Comment ça ?
Mon nom complet est
Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr.
Et ça n'a fait qu'empirer.
<i>À 8 ans, il m'a emmenée
chasser pour la première fois.</i>
Je veux pas tirer sur un cerf.
Baliverne, R.J.
Tirer sur un cerf
est le plus noble des objectifs.
Mais ils sont mignons.
Tu as dit la même chose
de nos lapins.
Tu te souviens
comme ils étaient délicieux ?
- Mon corps a commencé à changer...
- Attends une seconde.
Désolé, continue.
C'était de plus en plus dur pour lui
de faire comme si j'étais un garçon.
<i>Le pire moment est arrivé
à mes 14 ans.</i>
<i>Mon équipe de hockey junior venait
de gagner le "Squamish Invitational".</i>
<i>Et tout le monde est venu
chez moi pour le fêter.</i>
Les gars, vous vous êtes comportés
splendidement là-bas sur la glace.
Splendidement.
Vous allez dehors. Je reviens
avec des boissons non alcoolisées,
et des bretzels.
J'en reviens pas que t'aies raté
le dernier coup, idiote.
- Tu es l'idiot.
- Non, c'est toi, l'idiote.
Que faites-vous ?
Vous êtes coéquipiers,
des joueurs de hockey.
Des coéquipiers
ne s'embrassent pas !
Les joueurs de Hockey
ne s'embrassent pas !
Oh, mon Dieu.
Je n'ai pas de fils.
Ma pauvre.
Être obligée de grandir au Canada
avec l'Amérique, juste à côté.
C'est triste pour ton père, Robin,
mais félicitations pour ce match.
Et Kyle et moi,
on faisait rien de grave.
- On a été qu'à la ligne bleue.
- La ligne bleue ?
Tu sais quand t'es gamin,
tu donnes des termes de hockey à tout ?
La ligne bleue, c'est le baiser,
la rouge, c'est être nu,
et je pense que "la zone de but"
parle d'elle-même.
Après ça, ma relation
avec mon père s'est refroidie.
J'ai emménagé avec ma mère,
laissé pousser mes cheveux,
été une pop star canadienne.
Des trucs de jeunes normaux.
Tu crois pas que tu te sentirais mieux
si tu lui en parlais ?
C'est justement ça.
Ça servirait à rien.
C'est du passé, c'est fait.
Je lui dirais quoi ? "J'aurais aimé
ne pas être élevée comme un garçon
"que tu m'apprennes pas à chasser,
"à pêcher et à fumer des cigares
et boire du scotch
"parce que les filles
ne font pas ça.
"Et tu sais pourquoi je lance comme
une fille ? Parce que j'en suis une."
Tu gardais ça
depuis pas mal de temps, hein ?
Ça t'a retournée.
- Désolé.
- C'est chaud.
<i>Et j'ai réalisé...</i>
<i>que tous mes amis étaient hantés,</i>
<i>mais il y avait une différence
entre mes fantômes et les leurs.</i>
<i>Il n'était pas trop tard pour moi.</i>
Je vais lui parler.
Elle est partie.
- Je vais la rattraper.
- Va, va.
La voilà !
Je la vois. Elle est deux taxis devant,
à droite. La perdez pas, OK ?
Enfin. Enfin, tu le fais.
Tu vas la confronter.
Je vais l'affronter.
- C'est si excitant.
- Carrément.
- Tu vas dire quoi ?
- Je vais dire,
"Désolé que ça n'ait pas marché."
On va en parler en adulte.
Elle va me dire son point de vue et...
je vais l'écouter.
Ce que j'aurais plus dû faire avant.
Vous pouvez foncer dans le réverbère ?
Bouclez vos ceintures ! Pas toi, Ted.
Tu dois te mettre en colère.
Vas-y. Cherche bien.
Voyons. Il est pas question
de bouger les bras,
trépigner des pieds et se mettre en
colère. Il s'agit de Stella et moi
communiquant enfin.
Clairement, c'était...
Stella a détesté Star Wars.
Elle t'a menti.
Cherche tes sentiments.
Tu sais que c'est vrai.
- C'est son problème.
- Voyons, Ted.
Elle t'a laissé sur l'autel.
Je comprends pas !
- Au nom de tout ce qui est sacré...
- Attendez, attendez !
Où elle va ? Son taxi a raté
la sortie pour le Lincoln Tunnel.
Pourquoi prendre à emporter
pour le ramener dans le New Jersey,
de toute façon ?
- Peut-être qu'elle va à son bureau.
- Non.
Le serveur lui a demandé :
"Vous voulez des couverts ?"
Et elle a dit :
"Je rentre chez moi."
Si elle va chez elle,
pourquoi on va vers... ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
Tony habite en centre-ville.
"Chez elle",
c'est l'appartement de Tony.
Elle allait me faire emménager
dans le New Jersey
et elle emménage
en ville, avec Tony ?
La salope !
Enfin. Enfin, mon pote.
- J'ai trop les boules !
- Je sais et j'adore ça !
C'est génial !
Monsieur, on payera avec plaisir
la poignée qui vient d'être cassée.
J'adore Ted en colère !
Moi aussi !
- Laisse sortir, mec, laisse sortir.
- Elle s'arrête.
- Ça y est. Ça y est !
- Oui, Ted.
- Vas-y, mon pote !
- Débarrasse-toi de tes démons !
- J'ai des fourmis dans la jambe !
- OK, attends.
- Attends...
- Tu fais quoi ?
Attendez.
Écoute, Ted, c'est génial
- que tu sois en colère...
- Bien sûr.
et que tu affrontes tout ça, mais...
tu n'as qu'une chance.
Prenons un moment,
et pensons à ce que tu vas dire.
Je sais exactement
ce que je vais dire.
Tu as choisi le mauvais gars.
Tu as choisi le mauvais gars.
Tu as fait un très,
très,
très mauvais choix.
À quoi tu pensais ?
Ce mec ?
Tu te fiches de moi ?
T'as rien appris
ces 8 dernières années ?
Tu vas le regretter.
Tu le sais, ça ?
Tu vas le regretter,
et tu peux plus rien y faire
parce qu'il est trop tard.
Tout ce que tu peux faire,
c'est monter commencer ta vie
minable et décevante
qui sera jamais aussi heureuse
qu'elle aurait pu l'être avec moi.
Au revoir.
- Ted, attends.
- Écoute,
je suis pas là pour te récupérer.
Je suis là
parce que je dois savoir que tu sais
que t'as fait la pire
erreur de ta vie.
Je sais.
Bien.
C'est ce que je vais dire.
Ça tue !
- Du sang-froid.
- C'est bon, va lui dire ça.
Merci.
<i>Alors, je suis sorti du taxi,
prêt à lui dire tout ça,</i>
<i>prêt à exploser</i>
<i>mais alors...</i>
Maman !
<i>C'est parti d'un seul coup.</i>
<i>Et c'était fini.</i>
<i>À cet instant,
je n'étais plus en colère.</i>
<i>Je voyais qu'elle était faite
pour être avec lui.</i>
<i>Les enfants, vous pourriez penser que
les seuls choix sont : ravaler sa colère</i>
<i>ou tout balancer à quelqu'un.</i>
<i>Il y a une autre option :</i>
<i>vous pouvez laisser couler,</i>
<i>et quand on fait ça,
on peut oublier et aller de l'avant.</i>
<i>Et ça, c'était la fin parfaite
d'une histoire d'amour parfaite.</i>
<i>C'était juste pas la mienne.</i>
<i>La mienne était toujours là,
à m'attendre.</i>
<i>Kids, the day you get married's supposed
to be the happiest day of your life,</i>
<i>the perfect ending
to a perfect love story.</i>
<i>My wedding...
at least my first wedding...</i>
<i>didn't go so well.</i>
It's funny looking back on it now.
I was so sure Stella was the one.
And when she left me,
I was so devastated.
But you guys got me through it.
And now the painful part's over.
I've come out the other side
a little bit stronger.
You know, I hardly
even think about her anymore.
That's what time does, I guess.
Ted, the wedding was yesterday.
It's been 24 hours.
I know.
And this is me, moving on.
A great new chapter
of my life began today,
and we're gonna celebrate.
Right now, we need two things.
We need Kool, and we need the Gang.
It's jukebox time!
I look at that young man popping
and locking his way over to the jukebox,
and I think to myself, you know...
maybe Stella made the right call.
- Pain.
- How is he dancing right now?
He should... he should be smashing up
Stella's car with a sledgehammer.
Hypothetical.
Ted isn't pretending to be happy.
Ted really is happy. He never wanted
to get married in the first place.
Ted just pulled off the greatest train
dodge since <i>Stand by Me.</i>
Well, not the first kid,
but the other kids.
No, he is in bad shape.
What's up?
Really bad shape.
And we need to be there for him.
<i>But as much as my friends wanted
to be there for me,</i>
<i>I was, by all appearances, fine.</i>
- Hey, buddy.
- Want to hang out?
Guys, I'm fine.
- Hey, pal, you want to have a catch?
- I'm fine.
Hey, kiddo.
Barney, I'm fine.
This is not necessary,
and it's actually kind of weird.
No offense, ladies.
I did not realize you'd be home.
Ladies, to the stairwell.
Synchro: Arrow et mpm
<i>Finally, after two weeks,
the inevitable emotions boiled over.</i>
- You guys want to get some dinner?
- Oh, shut up.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
It's just, Ted, you've been through
something traumatic,
and we're trying to be there for you
as friends, but you're not letting us,
and it's pissing us off,
you selfish bitch.
Sorry.
We're worried that you're not dealing
with this whole Stella thing.
Do you remember when Lily left me?
You remember how I held in my feelings?
I... miss... her so much.
Yeah, dude, you were a rock.
I should have been even worse, okay?
I should have gotten mad.
I should have taken your advice
and set all of Lily's stuff on fire.
Oh, nice... thanks, Ted.
But I didn't,
and I think that that's why
it took me so long to get better.
So, now, Ted...
I want you to explode.
Release the berserker.
Ready?
Now!
I'm good.
Guys, get off his back.
He's happy.
Listen, if Ted were
married right now,
he'd be married,
he'd be living in New Jersey,
and he'd be married.
He's fine.
Now, let's eat.
- How about Flat Michael's?
- No, that's 44th and Lex. Can't do it.
- Why not?
- It's too close to Stella's gym.
Might run into her.
Anywhere else, though.
Okay, how about Hurley's?
Right between Stella's office
and her dry cleaners. No, sir.
Well, what about Meatloaf Charlie's?
Two blocks from Stella's
mother's hairdressers.
Well, geez, Ted, is there anywhere
in Manhattan we can go to dinner?
Of course.
Check this out.
- What you got there, Ted?
- A reference map I made for myself.
A New York guide to places you
might run into Stella Zinman.
Red areas are places to avoid.
White areas are safe.
Blue is water.
- That is just ridiculous.
- Well, water <i>is</i> blue.
You can't live that way.
She leaves you at the altar,
and you're the one avoiding her?
Yes, I'm avoiding her.
What's the big deal?
That's how we do it.
Who's we, gutless weenies?
No, "we" is people
from the great state of Ohio.
When life gives us pain, we Buckeyes
take that pain and we push it down.
And if the pain starts to come up again,
we push more pain down on top of it.
Why confront something
when you can avoid it, right?
All I have to do
is never see Stella again,
and I'll live a long, happy life.
- Who wants to get something to eat?
- Somebody just told me
about a tapas place
that's in the white zone.
Great. Let's go there.
- You ready to order?
- Not quite yet.
Can we get some of those
almonds for the table?
Certainly.
Nice call, Lily.
This place looks great.
Who told you about it?
You know, I don't remember.
What?
I just remember.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Okay, just be cool.
We're just gonna have to deal with this.
Everyone...
follow my lead.
- Oh, you're kidding.
- Is he serious?
I am not getting under this table.
I'd maybe get under that table.
She's turning around.
Think, hink, think.
Everyone, just stay here.
I'm gonna go take a look.
Marshall, go take a look.
- And will you need utensils?
- No, I'm just going straight home.
She's placing an order to go.
Did she seem happy? Did
she say anything about me?
I don't even care.
Where are those almonds?
Gosh, where would Ted's nuts be?
Why don't you check
the vise in Stella's garage.
Go yell at her.
Ted, you may be from Ohio,
but you live in New York now.
We don't push down
our feelings in New York.
We take our feelings and we shove them
in somebody else's face!
Spare me, Lily. You'd be doing the same
thing if you were in this situation.
That's outrageous.
There is not a person on Earth
I would hide under a table from.
Oh, really, not a single person?
Not even...
Gasser?
How dare you
mention that name to me.
Who's Gasser?
He's the last person I'd want
to see walk through that door.
Michael Sasser. He's a guy I went
to high school with.
<i>Michael sat next to me
in freshman biology.</i>
<i>He had been a bit of a loser
all through middle school,</i>
<i>but the summer before ninth grade,</i>
<i>he grew 12 inches
and joined the baseball team.</i>
<i>He was right on the precipice
of becoming one of the cool kids.</i>
<i>Until one day...</i>
Lily, we've all been there.
When you've ripped one,
it's not pretty.
- What did you do?
- Are you kidding?
This was ninth grade.
I only had one choice.
Oh, my God, Sasser.
Fart much?
No, it wasn't me.
It was her.
As if, Sasser.
More like Gasser.
Gasser!
I'm on the baseball team.
I'm cool.
The nickname Gasser stuck.
He got teased so much,
eventually he had to change schools.
- Kids are awesome.
- I've always felt awful about that.
But if Gasser... Michael...
walked in right now,
as hard as it would be,
I would go up to Gasser... Michael...
and I would resolve
things between us.
Right, clear the air, as it were.
Oh, man.
Those don't come around often.
Y'all are welcome.
Are you guys okay?
We're just gonna be eating
down here if that's okay.
- Here's your almonds.
- Thanks. You have any specials today?
Ted, this is ludicrous.
I am a person who...
well, let's just face it.
There are a lot of people
I don't want to see...
people of the
"chicks I banged" persuasion...
but if any of them
were to walk in here,
I would stand up, and I would look them
right in the eye.
Some of them
for the very first time.
Really, you wouldn't
hide from anyone?
Not even, say...
Becca Delucci?
You son of a bitch.
- Who's Becca Delucci?
- Do you mind?
So, who is Becca Delucci?
Becca is just this girl
who lives upstate.
I used to visit her now and again.
Where exactly upstate, Barney?
Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary.
<i>And yes, the visits
were of a conjugal nature.</i>
No way, really?
Really.
And what I had with Becca
was a perfect relationship.
She was only allowed, by law,
to call me once a week.
If she ever got clingy,
the armed guards stopped her.
And I never had to pay for dinner.
Well, that's not true.
I pay taxes.
Then again, I guess we all paid
for dinner. Thanks a lot, guys.
Anyway, the last time I visited,
I kind of screwed things up.
I know it's hard, baby,
but I'm in a prison, too.
A prison of my own heart.
Is that room ready yet or what?
Can we...?
You're the only thing
that's keeping me going here.
That's what I'm here for, baby.
I'm your rock.
I'm... Oh, my God.
Hello, strange.
Barney Stinson, attorney at law.
- Let's talk about getting you off.
- Hell, no!
Now I get letters from Becca
and she's all,
"I'm coming to get you
the day I get out of here.
I'm gonna hang your eyes
from my rearview mirror."
Women, huh?
See?
You're scared of Becca.
Lily's scared of Gasser.
We're staying under the table.
We don't have to.
Stella's gone.
Oh, my gosh.
There, all done,
and that's how we do it Ohio style.
Problem showed up.
We avoided it. It went away.
- Now we can enjoy our meal in peace...
- She's back.
We all think that you need...
Wait, where's Barney?
- We {\all}think {\that}you need to go talk to her.
- I don't.
- What?
- If the lastperson
I wanted to see walked through the door,
I wouldn't say a {\damn}word.
- Really?
- And who's that?
My father.
You guys,
that other table is off the hook.
- What are we talking about?
- Robin's dad.
I haven't spoken to him in three years
and I don't intend to start now.
Why?
<i>It goes back to the day I was born.</i>
You give me my son now. Push.
He wanted a son and the fact that I was
a girl didn't change his plan.
What do you mean?
My full legal name is
Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr.
And it only gets worse from there.
<i>When I was eight,
he took me hunting for the first time.</i>
I don't want to shoot a deer.
Nonsense, R.J.
Shooting deer is
the noblest of pursuits.
But they're cute.
You said the same thing
about our rabbits.
Remember how delicious they were?
Over the years,
as my body developed...
Hold on a sec.
Sorry, go on.
It became harder and harder
for him to pretend I was a boy.
<i>The lowest moment came
when I turned 14.</i>
<i>My peewee hockey team had just
won the Squamish Invitational</i>
<i>and everyone came back
to my house to celebrate.</i>
You lads availed yourself splendidly
out there on the ice.
Splendidly.
You go on outside. I'll come back
with an assortment of soft drinks
and American pretzels.
I can't believe you missed
that last empty-netter, you hoser.
- You're the hoser.
- No, you're the hoser.
What are you doing?
You're teammates, hockey players.
Teammates don't kiss!
Hockey players don't kiss!
Oh, my God.
I have no son.
You poor thing.
To have to grow up in Canada
with America right there.
That sucks about your dad, Robin,
but congratulations on that game.
And Kyle and I weren't even
doing anything serious.
- We only went to the blue line.
- The blue line?
You know how when you're a kid,
you put everything into hockey terms?
The blue line is kissing;
the red line is getting naked;
and I think "in the crease"
speaks for itself.
Anyway, after that, my relationship
with my dad pretty much went north.
I moved in with my mom,
grew my hair out,
became a Canadian pop star.
You know, normal teen stuff.
Don't you think it would feel better
to talk to him about all this?
That's the point.
It wouldn't solve anything.
It's in the past. It's done.
I mean, what would I even say to him?
"I wish you hadn't raised me as a boy"?
"I wish you hadn't taught me
how to hunt
"and fish and smoke cigars
and drink Scotch
"because that's not what girls do.
"And you know the reason I throw like
a girl, Dad, is because I am a girl."
You held onto that
for a long time, huh?
It really messed you up.
- I'm sorry.
- That's hot.
<i>And then I realized...</i>
<i>all of my friends were haunted,</i>
<i>but there was a difference
between my ghost and theirs.</i>
<i>It wasn't too late for me.</i>
I'm gonna go talk to her.
She's gone.
- I'm going after her.
- Go, go.
There she goes!
I see her. She's two cabs ahead
on the right. Just stay with her, okay?
Finally. Finally, you're doing this.
You're going to confront her.
I am going to confront her.
- This is so exciting.
- Totally.
- What are you going to say?
- I'm gonna say,
"I'm sorry things didn't work out."
We're gonna talk about this like adults.
She can tell me her side and...
I'm going to listen. Probably should
have done a little more of that before.
Driver, can you run us into the nearest
lamppost? Everyone, buckle up. Not you.
You got to get mad right now.
Come on. Dig deep.
Dude, come on. This isn't
about me waving my arms,
stamping my feet and getting really mad.
This is about Stella and I
finally communicating.
I mean, clearly, that was...
Stella hated Star Wars.
She lied to you.
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.
That's her business.
Come on, Ted.
She left you at the altar.
I don't understand!
- In the name of all that is sacred...
- Wait, wait!
Where is she going? Her cab just missed
the turn for the Lincoln Tunnel.
Why would anybody buy takeout food
and bring it all the way back
to New Jersey anyway?
- Maybe she's going to her office.
- No.
The waiter asked her,
"Will you need utensils?"
Then she said,
"I'm just going straight home."
But if she's going home,
why are we still heading...?
Oh, my God.
Tony lives downtown.
"Home"
is Tony's apartment.
She was going to make me
move to New Jersey
and then she moves
into the city with Tony?
Son of a bitch!
Finally. Finally, buddy.
- I am so angry right now!
- I know, and I love it!
That is awesome!
Sir, we'd be happy to cover
the cost of that window crank.
I love angry Ted!
So do I!
- Get it out, baby. Let it out.
- She's stopping.
- It is on. It is on!
- Yes, Ted.
- Go get her, buddy!
- Go get rid of your demons!
- My leg is asleep!
- Okay, wait.
- Wait...
- What are you doing?
Hold on.
Look, Ted, it's great
- it's great that you're angry {\right}now.
- It sure is.
And that you're finally dealing
with this, but...
you only get one shot here.
Let's just take a beat,
and think about what
you're going to say.
I know exactly what I'm gonna say.
You picked the wrong guy.
You picked the wrong guy.
You made a really,
really,
really bad choice.
What were you thinking?
That guy?
Are you kidding me?
Have you learned nothing
in the last eight years?
You're just gonna regret this.
You know that, right?
You are going to regret this,
and now there is nothing you can do
about it because it's too late.
All you can do now is go up there
and start your crappy,
disappointing life
that will never be nearly as happy
as the one you could have had with me.
Good-bye.
- Ted, wait.
- Look,
I am not here to win you back.
I am here because I need to know
that you know
you made the biggest mistake
of your life.
I know.
Good.
That's what I'm gonna say.
Dag!
- Cold-blooded.
- That's good. Go say that.
Thanks.
<i>So I got out of the cab,
ready to say all of that stuff,</i>
<i>ready to explode</i>
<i>but then...</i>
Mommy!
<i>It all just went away.</i>
<i>And that was it.</i>
<i>In that moment,
I wasn't angry anymore.</i>
<i>I could see Stella was meant
to be with Tony.</i>
<i>Kids, you may think your only choices
are to swallow your anger</i>
<i>or throw it in someone's face.</i>
<i>There's a third option:</i>
<i>you can just let it go,</i>
<i>and only when you do that is it
really gone, and you can move forward.</i>
<i>And that, kids, was the perfect
ending to a perfect love story.</i>
<i>It just wasn't mine.</i>
<i>Mine was still out there
waiting for me.</i>
Il n'y a pas vraiment
de belles filles ici ce soir.
Et plus je bois,
moins elles m'attirent.
Je suis à un whisky coca de la scène
de la Cantina dans Star Wars.*
Et ces filles là-bas,
elles sont sexy.
- Elles ne sont pas sexy.
- Tu te fous de moi ?
Je les ai détesté à la minute où
je les ai vu, donc elles sont sexy.
En fait, je les déteste presque autant
que Robin quand on s'est rencontré.
- Tu me détestais ?
- Grave.
Barney, elles sont sexy.
Oh, j'ai tant à vous apprendre.
Vous venez juste d'être victime de...
l'Effet Cheerleader.
Heureux que tu demandes.
L'Effet Cheerleader c'est quand
un groupe de femme a l'air sexy,
mais seulement,
en tant que groupe.
Comme avec les cheerleaders.
Elles ont l'air sexy,
mais prend-les chacune
d'elle individuellement ?
Des chiennes de traîneau.
C'est insensé.
Regardez bien chacune de ces filles.
Individuellement.
Je sais pas.
La dernière à droite
est plutôt mignonne.
Ouais, carrément.
Et ça, mes amis,
c'est l'Effet Cheerleader.
Aussi connu comme
le Paradoxe de la Demoiselle d'Honneur,
le Syndrome des Filles de Fraternité,
et pendant un bref moment
dans les années 90,
le Complot des Spice Girls.
Des filles qui font peur,
en effet.
Barney Stinson.
Oh, salut.
Compris.
Génial, on se tient au courant.
Quoi ?
Apparemment
je vais être papa.

<i>How I Met Your Mother
4x04 - Intervention</i>
<i>par la "Have You Met Team"
pour www.forom.com</i>
Comment ça tu va être papa ?
Comment, comment c'est arrivé ?
C'était juste une fille avec qui
j'ai couché il y a quelques semaines.
Elle n'est pas sûre. Elle va voir
son médecin dans la matinée.
C'est peut-être une fausse alarme.
Elle n'est peut-être pas enceinte.
Lily,
aucune partie de Barney Stinson
ne donne moins de 110%.
Si un de mes petits
Michael Phelpses s'est échappé,
il nage pour la médaille d'or.
C'est un cauchemar.
Je ne veux pas d'enfants.
Qui serait sain d'esprit
et voudrait un gosse ?
<i>Quand vous avez 30 ans
et que vous êtes en couple,</i>
<i>une chose étrange se produit.</i>
<i>Vous commencez
à voir des bébés partout.</i>
Oh, voyons.
<i>Oui, Marshall et Lily avaient
attrapé la fièvre des bébés.</i>
<i>Et leur nouvelle
voisine ne les aidait pas.</i>
Tu as perdu une chaussette,
petit gars ?
C'est sans aucun doute
la chose la plus mignonne
que j'ai jamais vu.
C'est ma petite cacahuète.
<i>Cette nuit, ils se sont assis
pour discuter sérieusement</i>
<i>du fait d'avoir des enfants.</i>
Alors, si on a un bébé,
tu penses pourvoir
faire moins d'heures ?
C'est pas important, il sera si mignon,
que je le mangerai dès le premier jour.
Et pour l'argent ?
On a toujours des tonnes de crédits.
Oh, eh bien, on comptera nos factures
impayées sur ses petits doigts riquiqui.
Faisons un bébé.
Oh, oh, maintenant ?
Oh, d'accord.
<i>Il y avait juste une petite
chose sur leur chemin.</i>
Poussez-vous.
J'ai enregistré The View.*
<i>Et cette chose était sans emplois
et dormait sur leur canapé.</i>
Alors, Robin,
t'en es où dans ta recherche
de travail et d'appartement ?
T'es pas au courant ?
Je suis présentatrice en chef à CNN.*
Et j'ai un appartement de luxe
tout en or avec vue sur Central Park.
Sors-toi la tête du cul, Marshall.
<i>Ils ont réalisé que s'ils voulaient
fonder une famille</i>
<i>ils devaient le planifier à l'avance.</i>
Ça te dérangerait pas de dormir
chez Ted demain soir ?
Je, heu, cuisine,
un dîner spécial pour Marshall.
Juste un dîner.
C'est tout. Rien d'autre.
D'accord.
Mais t'as pas intérêt à être
aussi coincé que ces deux idiots
sur le fait que je tire sur
des cannettes de bière sur le toit.
"Ça fait mal aux oreilles.
Les voisins ont appelé les flics.
Tu m'a presque tiré dessus."
Bon courage, Ted. Elle est vraiment
super sympa en ce moment.
Dieu ?
C'est moi.
Barney
Quoi de neuf ?
Je sais qu'on ne parle pas beaucoup,
bien que pas mal de filles
crient ton nom grâce à moi.
Génial.
Mais, Dieu...
si tu pouvais,
me sortir de là,
je jure
que plus jamais
jamais, jamais, jamais,
jamais, jamais, jamais, ja...
Oh, quitte pas, frangin.
Vous parlez à Barney.
Vraiment ?
Marshall,
super nouvelle !
Je ne suis pas papa !
Félicitation, mon pote.
C'est le moment le plus
heureux de ma vie, Marshall.
Ce que je ressens du fait
de ne pas avoir d'enfants ?
Je n'ai jamais pensé pourvoir
aimer un truc autant que ça.
C'est pourquoi
je crée un jour spécial.
À partir de maintenant, aujourd'hui sera
le jour de la "Fête des Non Pères".
Tu crées un jour spécial ?
Ouais, pourquoi pas ?
Tout le monde à déjà un jour,
les Mères, les Pères, la Bastille.
Pourquoi pas un jour pour les
célibataires qui veulent le rester ?
Maintenant on dirait que tu es la fille
potelée du jour de la Saint Valentin.
- Bonjour, Stinson.
- Hé, Nolan. Comment vont les enfants ?
Vous êtes prêt pour ce soir, Eriksen ?
Une sacrée fusion.
Eh bien, c'est entre ma femme
et moi, monsieur.
Non. La réunion avec M. Li.
Ce soir.
Je pensais que c'était
une réunion au déjeuner.
Ça l'est. Déjeuner en Chine. On fait
une téléconférence avec les chinois.
Je compte sur vous, fils.
Marshall ?
Hé, bébé.
- C'est l'heure du déjeuner en Chine.
- Ouais, ça l'est.
C'est pas un euphémisme.
Ecoute, je...
- Attends, ça veut dire quoi ?
- Je sais pas,
des petits pains chauds, du porc épicé ?
Il doit bien y avoir un truc.
Tu ne rentres pas à la maison
ce soir, n'est-ce pas ?
Tu secoues la tête
pour dire "non" ?
C'est bien ce que je croyais.
Oh, merci vous deux,
d'être venu ici aussi rapidement.
Tu vas bien ? T'avais l'air
bouleversée au téléphone.
Marshall et moi avons pris
cette grande décision de faire...
un dîner.
Et je pensais que
j'étais prête pour faire...
un dîner.
Mais il a appelé
et annulé, et...
ça m'a fait réfléchir. Est-ce que c'est
trop tôt pour nous de faire...
un dîner ?
J'ai déjeuné pas très tard,
donc je suis prêt pour le dîner.
- Le dîner c'est un bébé !
- Lily, c'est horrible !
Non, non, je...
j'ai besoin que vous m'aidiez.
Quoi ?
Est-ce que Marshall et moi
sommes prêts à avoir un bébé ?
Donc, Est-ce que Marshall et moi
sommes prêts à avoir un bébé ou pas ?
Lily, on ne peut pas prendre
cette décision pour toi. C'est géant.
Tu sais quoi d'autre est géant ?
La tête de Marshall.
Cette chose a la taille d'une
pastèque de la fin août.
Sortir le bébé de Marshall ?
Qu'en pense Marshall ?
Sûrement plein de choses avec sa tête
grosse comme un casque spatial de 1950.
Marshall est très excité.
Mais je pense qu'il ne voit
que les bons côtés d'un bébé,
et pas les mauvais.
<i>Comme l'autre jour, pendant
que Marshall jouait avec Jérémy,</i>
<i>je parlais avec sa mère.</i>
Je te remercie de nous avoir invités.
J'ai pas parlé à un adulte
depuis des semaines.
Excepté mon mari.
Mais "c'est à ton tour de
le changer" et "fais-le taire"
ne compte pas comme
une conversation.
Désolée, je divague. Je n'ai pas fait
l'amour depuis sept mois.
Oh, je viens de recommencer.
Manque de sommeil !
Oh, attends voir,
je ne pleure pas, hein ?
Je pleure tout le temps.
C'est pas pour me plaindre.
Maintenant je me sens coupable.
Oh, c'est ma petite cacahuète !
Oh, je t'aime tellement.
Je vais être aussi
crevée que Charlotte.
Et même pire.
Au moins son mari
travaille à la maison.
C'est un dealer d'herbe, mais il
s'investit beaucoup en tant que parent.
Marshall sera un père génial.
Marshall est toujours au bureau,
et j'ai peur que si
on a un bébé maintenant,
tout le travail va
me retomber dessus.
Tu paniques et tu te concentres
sur les points négatifs.
Je pense que Lily est réaliste.
Voyez, c'est bien. C'est pour ça que
je vous aie fait venir tous les deux.
Ted, tu es pro-enfants.
Robin, tu es contre.
Maîtres,
vos dépositions préliminaires.
Ok, je sais que tu as peur
de ne pas être prête.
Mais personne
ne pense jamais être prêt.
Tu vas devoir faire le pas.
Etre parent viendra naturellement.
Bien sur que tu penses
que ça viendra naturellement.
T'es déjà presque un papa.
Tu es un vrai papa.
De quoi vous parlez ?
Ted, réfléchis.
<i>Tu racontes des blagues débiles de père.</i>
Paf le chien !*
Oh, mec !
Paf le chien.
<i>Tu nous fais la leçon. Comme quand
on a cassé ton bateau embouteillé.</i>
Je ne suis pas en colère.
Je suis juste déçu.
- C'est elle !
- Ta gueule !
<i>Et tu fais ce que tous les pères
font avec les serveuses.</i>
Hé, je suis Lori.
Je serai votre serveuse ce soir.
Hé Lori, je suis Ted.
Je serai votre client ce soir.
Lori, avant d'y aller, dites-moi,
Qu'est-ce qu'on a quand on croise
un canari et un une tondeuse ?
Pas d'indices.
Pas d'indices.
Elle a raison. Ted, tu es peut être
célibataire et sans enfants,
mais tu es déjà
un père embarrassant.
Je ne pense pas que j'aime ce ton,
jeune fille.
Marshall, la Fête Des Non Pèress
est un succès !
Laraby et Finklestein m'aident
à la célébrer. Regarde-moi ça.
La tasse
"Meilleur Non Pères Du Monde"
Il y a, euh... ha !
Le T-shirt "Qui N'est Pas Ton Père ?"
Tous deux disponibles sur
Fête Des Non-Pères.com*
Oh, regarde un peu les
cartes de voeux.
"Pour tout ce que tu as fait
pour toi même,
Pour tout le scotch
sur ton étagère,
Ta Porsche Carrera règne sur
l'autoroute, On te souhaite
une partie à trois toute la nuit.
Heureuse Fête Des Non Pèress."
Regarde l'illustration.
On dirait une sorte
de prostituée asiatique.
Oui.
Parce que à la Fête Des Non Pèress,
on t'offre une Thaï que tu peux vraiment
mettre. Les cinq du jeu de mot !*
Elle te botte le cul, là, Mosby.
Ton seul espoir est
de devenir méchant.
OK.
Je vais te dire pourquoi
ma concurrente te dit tout ça.
Trois mots,
- peur des bébés.
- Quoi ?
- C'est dingue. J'en ai pas peur.
- Ah ouais ?
<i>Tu te souviens quand tu as rencontré
ma cousine et sa fille ?</i>
Elle est tellement mignonne !
Oh, tu veux la prendre ?
<i>Ou à la baby shower que Lily
a organisé pour son amie Erika ?</i>
Tu laisses ce bébé te sentir ?
Je n'ai pas envie
de me faire mordre.
<i>Et n'oublie pas...</i>
- La pub du bébé qui parle ?
- La pub du bébé qui parle.
Tu n'es pas comme ça, Lily. Tu adores
les enfants et les enfants t'adorent.
Ouais, je suis adorable, jolie et sage,
mais est-ce assez ?
Ecoute, tout ça renvient
à un seul mot, toi.
Es tu prête à laisser
tomber tes rêves ?
Le second cycle, devenir
professeur d'art à l'université ?
Tu dois te concentrer
sur le Projet Lily
avant de commencer
le Projet Bébé.
Si tu ne le fais pas,
tu le regretteras toujours.
Et ce ne serait pas juste
pour toi ou le bébé.
Qu'est ce que c'est ?
C'est la chaussette de Jérémy.
Je vais avoir un bébé.
Mais, et toutes les choses
que je viens de dire ?
Mais, mais chaussette.
Mais, et Marshal
qui travaille tout le temps ?
Mais chaussette.
Mais, Projet Lily !
Petits poissons dessus.
On a argumenté,
et une chaussette
t'aide à prendre ta décision ?
Je pense que c'était le coup
qui te met chaussette, hein Robin ?*
- Ta gueule, papa.
- Ta gueule, haïsseuse de bébés.
Les bébés font peur, OK ?
Ils ont des yeux géants.
Et puis, voyons,
l'endroit tout mou ?
S'il doit y avoir
un bouton d'autodestruction,
au moins cachez-le quelque part où
on n'appuiera pas dessus par accident.
Où est Lily ?
- Hé, as tu bu de cette bouteille ?
- Pas une goutte.
Moi non plus.
Eriksen, réunion dans cinq minutes.
Et vous avez intérêt à sortir
le grand jeu pour M. Li.
Ce gars hante mes cauchemars.
Enfin, amuse-toi bien là-bas.
Mets un bébé en moi, Marshall.
Je suis prête.
Lily... Lily,
qu'est ce que tu fais ici ?
Je suis prête, Marshall.
C'est le bon soir.
Mets ta progéniture à tête de pastèque
dans mon ventre.
- Quoi ?
- Ouais !
Allez, là maintenant.
Mets-moi un bébé. Je suis prête.
Hé, regarde.
Les gars de l'immeuble d'en face
me font des signes.
Hello, gentlemen !
On va faire un bébé !
Je ne peux pas croire
qu'on l'ait perdue.
Tu vois, c'est la raison pourquoi
je n'aurais jamais d'enfants.
Tu ne peux pas les quitter des yeux,
même pour une seconde.
Je ne trouve pas mon dossier.
J'ai tout sorti de "A" à "G".
Ah ! Aaaaaggg!
Ils sont assis là
avec leurs biberons stupides.
Ils pleurent.
Ils crachent.
Et c'est pour ça que les enfants,
c'est nul.
C'est une bonne chose
que nous ayons rompu.
J'ai oublié à quel point
tu es dingue à propos des enfants.
Je suis dingue ?
A chaque fois que tu ne fais même
qu'entendre le mot "enfants",
tu as deux traces de lactation
sur ton t-shirt.
Je remercie Dieu que tu ne sois pas
mère. Tu es une vraie reine de glace.
Si tu donnais naissance à un enfant,
il aurait le cerveau congelé.
Hé, je ne suis pas un monstre
même si je veux rester indépendante.
Plein de gens normaux
ne veulent pas avoir d'enfants.
Mon frère, pose ta main sur cette boîte
de préservatifs et répète après moi.
Moi, donne le faux nom
que tu utilises avec les femmes.
Moi, Johnny Banane.
Jure de choisir les t-shirts mouillés
plutôt que les couches mouillées.
- Jure de toujours...
- Ouais, tu es en super compagnie là.
Je vais chercher Lily
dans les toilettes.
Pendant que j'y suis,
je te prends un tampon ?
Super, et quand tu auras fini
de te la secouer à l'urinoir,
peut être que tu pourrais demander
au Magicien de te donner un coeur.*
Tu sais quoi ? Peut être que je devrais
trouver ailleurs où dormir ce week-end.
- Pas de réticences de mon côté.
- Très bien.
Super.
Bienvenue
à la fraternité de la non paternité.
Il est l'un des nôtres.
Messieurs,
M. Li,
si vous voulez bien
ouvrir à la page cinq
de vos documents
sur la fusion.
Je pense que vous...
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, Eriksen?
Rien.
Je pense juste que vous êtes...
très beau aujourd'hui.
Qu'est-ce que vous regardez ?
Je regarde vers le futur...
de nos deux compagnies, et
ça a l'air très...
nu.
Pourriez-vous m'excuser
pour un bref instant ?
Est-ce que quelqu'un d'autre
a vu la nana bourrée ?
Hé, les gars il ne fallait pas...
C'est une photo de moi
sans enfants.
Et il y a des macaronis
collés sur le cadre.
Les gars, je l'adore.
Eh bien, Lily n'est pas ici.
Ton téléphone sonnait. J'ai répondu.
J'espère que ça te dérange pas.
- Marshall a Lily. Elle va bien.
- Oh, Dieu merci.
Quoi ?
Quand j'ai remis ton téléphone
en place, et...
- J'ai trouvé un truc dans ton sac.
- J'ai un permis pour ça.
- Et l'autre truc était un cadeau.
- Non.
Ça.
Tu as volé la chaussette
de Jérémy.
Non, c'est pas vrai.
Je ne sais pas comment c'est arrivé là.
Ça a dû tomber dedans. Bizarre !
- "Tomber dedans"?
- Ou Lily l'a mis dedans pour blaguer.
Cette salope étant bourrée.
OK, je l'ai prise.
C'est juste...
si mignon.
Une chaussette.
Robin Scherbatsky, est-ce que tu
te fais à l'idée d'avoir des enfants ?
Non.
Je ne sais pas.
Peut-être un jour.
Quand j'aurais, genre, 70 ans.
La science sera au point.
Ecoute, je suis juste...
Je suis confuse en ce moment. Je suis
au chômage. Je vis sur un canapé.
Ouais.
Ça a été deux mois
difficiles pour nous.
Hé, j'ai une chambre inutilisée.
Pourquoi tu resterais pas chez moi
le temps de trouver un appartement ?
- Vraiment ?
- Ouais.
Merci, Ted. J'ai déjà quelques pistes,
ça sera pour une semaine, deux maximum.
<i>Et c'est comme ça que votre tante Robin
a emménagé avec moi.</i>
Je m'ennuie.
Allons danser.
- Allons braquer une boutique d'alcool !
- Lily, on ne va aller nulle part, OK ?
A chaque fois qu'on va quelque part
quand t'es bourrée,
tu t'endors toujours dès
qu'on entre dans...
On va danser !
On va faire la fête
toute la nuit !
Vous pouvez faire le tour
du quartier quelques fois
pour s'assurer qu'elle
est vraiment endormie ?
Pas de problème.
Dernier résultat du brainstorming
de la Fêtes des Non Pères,
un test de grossesse,
mais à la place
d'une petite ligne bleue,
il y a un petit, Barney bleu
faisant ça.
Barney, la Fête des Non Pères est naze.
C'est un jour férié pour looser.
De quoi... ?
De quoi tu parles ?
C'est un excellent
groupe de potes.
Barney,
c'est l'effet Cheerleader.
Non, Ted. Ça marche
seulement pour les nanas.
Regarde bien chacun de ces gars
individuellement.
Ces génies n'ont pas choisi de
ne pas avoir d'enfants, mon ami.
- Bonne nuit, Barney
- Bonne nuit.
Une chaussette.
Est-ce que je sens des pancakes
avec des morceaux de chocolat?
Tu sens des pancakes
"aux morceaux de chocolat
je suis désolé d'avoir été
une idiote bourrée".
Y'a du bacon "j'aurais aimé
ne pas avoir vomi sur ta chemise" ?
Bien sûr.
Bébé...
Je suis si désolée pour hier soir.
Je sais que j'ai mis le bordel. Je...
J'ai juste commencé à flipper à propos
de savoir si on est prêt à être parents.
Mais tu as si bien
pris soin de moi.
Je sais que tu seras
un bon père.
Je ne veux pas
être père maintenant.
Quoi ?
La nuit dernière,
j'étais juste...
entre le boulot et
bébé Lily bourrée,
c'était trop.
Je ne fais que commencé
dans ce boulot,
et je fais tellement d'heures,
je veux dire...
Ecoute, je t'aime.
Et je veux absolument avoir des
enfants un jour. Je veux juste...
Je veux être prêt pour ça.
Moi aussi.
Et dès qu'on sera prêt,
je sais que tu seras excellent.
Toi aussi.
Tu veux qu'on fasse l'amour
complètement protégé tout de suite ?
Ouais.
Tu veux finir
ton bacon d'abord ?
Tu es la femme parfaite.

I am not impressed with the talent in here tonight.
And the more I drink, the less attractive they get.
I'm one scotch and soda away
from the Cantina scene in Star Wars.
What about those girls over there?They're hot.
They're not hot.
Are you kidding?
I hated their guts the second I saw them.
Which means they're hot.
In fact, I hated them almost as much as
I hated Robin when I first met her.
You hated me? A lot.
Barney, they're hot.
Oh, there is so much to teach you all.
You have just become victims of...The Cheerleader effect.
Glad you asked.
The Cheerleader Effect
is when group of women seems hot
but only as a group.
Just like with cheerleaders.
They seem hot,
but take each one of them individually?
Sled dogs.
That's insane.
Take a good, hard look
at each one of those girls.
Individually.
I don't know.
The one on the end is kind of cute.
Yeah, she really is.
And that, my friends, is "The Cheerleader Effect."
Also known as the Bridesmaid Paradox,
Sorority Girl Syndrome,
and for a brief window in the mid-'90s,
the Spice Girls Conspiracy.
Scary Spice indeed.
Barney Stinson.
Oh, hi.
Okay.
Got it.
Great, we'll be in touch.
What?
Apparently, I'm gonna be a dad.
What do you mean you're gonna be a dad?
How did, how did this happen?
It was just some girl I hook up with a few weeks back.
She's not sure.
She's gonna go to the doctor in the morning.
Maybe it's a false alarm.
Maybe she's not pregnant.
Lily,
no part of Barney Stinson does anything less than 110%.
If one of my little Michael Phelpses got loose,
he's swimming for the gold.
Oh, this is a nightmare.
I don't want kids.
Who in their right mind would ever want kids?
Now, when you turn 30
and you're in a couple, a strange thing happens.
You start to see babies everywhere.
Oh, come on.
Yes, Marshall and Lily were coming down with baby fever.
And their new neighbor weren't helping.
Did you lose a sock there, little dude?
That is without a doubt the cutest little thing
I've ever seen.
There's my little peanut.
That night they sat down to have a serious
practical discussion about having kids.
So, if we have a baby,
do you think you could work fewer hours?
Doesn't matter--he's gonna be so cute,
I'm gonna eat him up on the first day.
Okay.
But, but what about money?
We're still in a ton of debt.
Oh, well, we'll count our overdue bills
on his teenie tiny fingers.
Let's have a baby.
Oh, oh, right now?
Oh, okay.
There was just one thing in their way.
And that thing happened to be unemployed
and sleeping on their couch.
So, Robin, um,
how's the job and apartment search going?
Oh, you didn't hear?
I'm the lead anchor on CNN.
And I got a penthouse
overlooking Central Park made of gold.
Get your head out of your ass, Marshall.
They realized if they were going to start a family
they had to plan ahead.
So, Robin,would you mind crashing at Ted's tomorrow night?
I'm, uh, cooking Marshall a special dinner.
Just dinner. That's it.Nothing else.
Fine.
But you'd better not be as uptight as these idiots
about me shooting beer cans on the roof.
"it hurt my ears.
"The neighbors called the cops.
You almost hit me."
Enjoy her, Ted. She's in a real good place right now.
God? It's me.
Barney.
What up?
I know we don't talk much,
though a lot of girls call out your name because of me.
Awesome.
But, God...
if you could get me out of this,
I swear I will never ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever...
I...
Ooh, hang on, bro.
Go for Barney.
Really?
Marshall,
great news!
I'm not a father!
Congratulations, buddy.
This is the happiest moment of my life, Marshall.
The way I feel about not having kids?
I never knew I could love something this much.
That's why I'm creating a holiday.
From now on, today will be known
as "Not a Father's Day."
You're creating a holiday?
Yeah, why not?
Everyone else gets a day:
Mothers, Fathers, Bastilles.
Why can't there be a day
for people who are single and like it that way?
Well, now you just sound like the chubby girl on Valentine's Day.
-Hello,Stinson. -Hey, Nolan.
How are the kids?
You ready for tonight, Eriksen?
Big merger.
Well, that's between me and my wife, sir.
No. The meeting with Mr. Li. Tonight.
I thought, I thought that was a breakfast meeting.
It is. Breakfast in China.
We're teleconferencing with the Chinese.
I'm counting on you, kid.
Marshall?
Hey, babe.
It's breakfast time in China.
Yeah, it is.
Not a euphemism.
Look, I...
Wait, what would that even mean?
I don't know, hot buns, spicy pork?
There's something there.
You're not coming home tonight, are you?
Are you shaking your head "no?"
I thought so.
Oh, thank you, guys, for coming over so fast.
Are you all right?
You sounded upset on the phone.
Marshall and I made this big decision
to have... dinner.
And I thought I was ready to-to have... dinner.
But then he called and canceled, and it got me thinking.
Is it too early for us to have... dinner?
Well, I had an early lunch, so I'm ready for dinner.
Dinner is a baby!
Lily, that's horrible!
No, no, I,I need you guys to figure something out for me.
What?
Are Marshall and I ready to have a baby?
So are Marshall and I ready to have a baby or not?
Lily, we can't make this decision for you.
-It's huge. -You know what else is huge?
Marshall's head.
That thing's the size of a late August watermelon.
Marshall's baby coming through there?
Yowza!
What does Marshall think?
Probably a lot in that 1950s space helmet
of a head he's walking around with.
Marshall really excited.
But I think he only sees what's cute about having a baby,
not what's hard about it.
Like the other day,
while Marshall was playing with baby Jeremy,
I was talking to Jeremy's mom.
Thanks so much for inviting us over.
I have not talked to another adult in, like, weeks.
Well, besides my husband.
But "It's your turn to change him"
and "Make him shut up" really doesn't count as conversation.
Sorry, I'm rambling.
I haven't gotten laid in seven months.
Oh, I just did it again!
Sleep deprivation!
Oh, wait, I'm not crying, am I?
I usually am.
I don't mean to complain.
Oh, now I feel bad!
there's my little peanut!
Oh, I love you so much!
I'm going to be as strung out as Charlotte.
Worse actually.
At least her husband works from home.
I mean, he's a pot dealer, but he's a very involved parent.
Marshall will be a great dad.
Marshall's always at the office,
and, and I'm afraid that if we have a baby now,
all the work will fall on me.
You're just panicing and focusing on the downside.
I think Lily's just being realistic.
See, this is good.
This is why I called you guys both over here.
Ted, you're pro kids.
Robin, you're against.
Counselors, opening statements.
Okay, I know you're afraid that you're not ready.
But no one ever thinks they're ready.
You-you just have to take the leap.
Parenthood will come naturally.
Well, of course you think it comes naturally.
You're basically a dad already.
You're a total dad.
What are you talking about?
Ted,think about it.
You tell super corny dad jokes.
Shredded tweet!
Oh, man!
Shredded tweet.
You lecture us.
Like when we broke your stupid ship in a bottle.
I'm not angry.
I'm just disappointed.
She did it!
Shut up!
And you do that thing all dads do with waitresses.
Hi, I'm Lori.
I'll be your waitress this evening.
Hi, Lori, I'm Ted.
I'll be your customer this evening.
Hey, Lori,before you go,tell me,
what do you getwhen you cross a canary with a lawn mower?
No hints.No hints.
She's right.
Ted, you maybe single
and childless, but you're totally a dorky dad.
I don't think I like your tone, young lady.
Marshall, Not a Father's Day is a hit!
Laraby and Finklestein are helping me celebrate. Check it.
"World's Greatest Not A Dad" mugs.
There's, uh... ha!
"Who's Not Your Daddy?" T-shirts.
Both available at Not A Father's Day.Com.
Oh, check out the greeting cards.
"For everything you do for yourself,
"For all the scotch upon your shelf,
"Your Porsche Carrera rules the freeway,
"Here's wishing you an all night three-way.
Happy Not a Father's Day."
Check out the illustration.
No, no.
It appears to be some sort of Asian hooker.
Yes.
Because on Not a Father's Day,
you get a Thai you'd actually wear.
Wordplay five!
She's really kicking your ass here, Mosby.
Your only hope is to go negative.
Okay.
I'll tell you why my opponent is saying all this.
Three words:
sced of babies.
What?
That is crazy.
- I am not. - Oh, yeah?
Remember that time you met my cousin and her kid?
Oh, she is so cute!
Oh, do you want to hold her?
Or the baby shower Lily threw for her friend Erika?
Are you leting that baby sniff you?
I don't want to get bitten.
And don'forget about...
Talking baby commercial?
Talking baby commercial.
But you're not like that, Lily.
You love kids and they love you.
Yes, I'm loveable,
pretty and wise, but is it enough?
Look, it all comes down to one word: you.
Are you ready to put
your own dreams on the back burner?
Grad school,
teaching art at the college evel?
Look, you need to focus
on Project Lily before you can start Project Baby.
If you don't, you'll always regret it.
And that wouldn't be fair to you or the baby.
What's that?
It's Jeremy's sock.
I'm having a baby.
But what about all the things I just said?
But, but sock.
But what about Marshall working all the time?
But sock.
But, but Project Lily!
Little fishies on it.
We made all of these arguments,
and a sock is what makes your decision for you?
I guess that was the sock-out punch, huh, Robin?
Shut up, Dad.
You shut up, baby hater.
Babies are scary, okay?
They have giant eyes.
And then, come on, the soft spot?
If there's gonna be a self-destruct button,
at least hide it somewhere it won't accidentally get pressed.
Where's Lily?
Hey, did you drink any of this?
Not a drop.
Me, neither.
Eriksen, meeting in five minutes.
And you'd better bring your A-game for Mr. Li.
That guy haunts my nightmares.
Anyway, have fun out there, kid.
Put a baby in me, Marshall. I'm ready.
Lily... Lily, what are you doing here?
I'm ready, Marshall.
Tonight's the night.
Put your melon-headed spawn in my belly.
What?
Come on, right now.
Baby me. I am ready.
Oh, hey, look.
The guys in the next building are waving at me.
Hello, gentlemen!
We're going to make a baby!
I can't believe we lost her.
See, this is exactly why I'm never having kids.
You can't let them out of your sight
for even a second.
I can't find my file.
I pulled out "A" through "G."
They just sit there with their stupid bottles.
They cry.
They spit up.
And that's why kids suck.
Wow, it is a good thing we broke up.
I forgot how totally psycho you are on the kids thing.
I'm psycho?
Any time you even hear the word "kids,"
you get two little lactation stains on your shirt.
Thank God you're not a mom.
You are such an ice queen.
Any baby nursing from you would get brain freeze.
Look, don't paint me as some sort
of a freak for wanting to remain independent.
There are plenty of normal people out there who don't want to have kids.
Brother, lay your hand on this
box of condoms and repeat after me.
I, state the fake name you give to women.
I, Johnny Banana.
Vow to always choose wet T-shirts over wet diapers.
Vow to always...
Yeah, you're in great company there.
I'm gonna look for Lily in the bathroom.
-While I'm in there, I'll grab you a tampon. -Great.
Great, and when you're done shaking off at the urinal,
maybe you could ask the wizard to give you a heart.
You know what?
Maybe I should find somewhere else to stay this weekend.
-No argument here. -Fine.
Great.
Welcome to our fraternity of non-paternity.
He is one of us.
Gentlemen, Mr. Li,
if you would all
please open to page five of your merger documents.
I think the...
What is it, Eriksen?
Nothing.
I justhink that you look...
very nice today.
What are you looking at?
I am looking at the future...
of our two companies, and it looks
very... naked.
Would you excuse me just
for a brief second?
Did anyone else see the drunk chick?
Hey, you guys didn't have to...
It's a picture of me with no kids.
And there's macaroni glued on the frame.
Guys, I love it.
Well, Lily's not in there.
Your phone rang.
I answered it. I hope you don't mind.
Marshall's got Lily.
-She's fine. -Oh, thank God.
What?
When I was putting your phone back,
and, uh, I found something in your bag.
I have a permit for that.
And the other thing was a gift.
No.
This.
You stole Jeremy's sock.
No, I didn't.
I don't know how that got in there.
It must've fallen in. Weird!
 "Fallen in"?
Or Lily put it in there as a joke.
That bitch be drunk.
Okay, I took it.
It's just...
so cute.
Sock.
Robin Scherbatsky,
are you warming to the idea of having children?
No.
I don't know.
Maybe someday.
When I'm, like, 70.
Scienc will catch up.
Look, I'm just...
I'm confused lately.
I'm unemployed.
I'm living on a couch.
Yeah. It's been a rough couple of months
for both of us.
Hey, I have a spare bedroom.
Why don't you stay with me while you look for a place?
-Really? -Yeah.
Thanks, Ted.
I already have some leads,
so it'll be one week, two weeks tops.
And that's how your Aunt Robin moved in with me.
I'm bored.
Let's go dancing.
Oh, let's rob a liquor store!
Lily, we're not going anywhere, okay?
Whenever we go somewhere when you're drunk,
you always fall asleep as soon as we get in the...
We're going dancing!
We're gonna party all night long!
Hey, can you circle the block a couple times
just to make sure she's really down?
Sure thing.
Latest Not A Father's Day brainstorm:
a pregnancy test, but instead of a little, blue line,
there's a little, blue Barney going like this.
Barney, Not A Father's Day is lame.
It's a holiday for losers.
What are you...? What're you talking about?
That's a great group of bros.
Barney, it's the Cheerleader Effect.
Uh, no, Ted.
That only works for chicks.
Take a good look at each one of thoseuys individually.
These geniuses are not childless by choice, my friend.
Good night, Barney.
Good night.
Sock.
Do I smell chocolate chip pancakes?
No, you smell "Chocolate chip
I'm sorry I was such a drunk idiot" pancakes.
Oh, is there any "Wish I hadn't puked on your shirt" bacon?
There sure is.
Baby...
I'm so sorry about last night.
I know I was a mess.
I... I just started freaking out
about whether we're ready to be parents.
But you took such good care of me.
I know you're gonna be a great dad.
I don't want to be a dad right now.
What?
Last night, it was just...
Between balancing work and drunk Baby Lily,
it was too much.
I'm just getting started at this job,
and I'm working such long hours, I mean...
Look, I love you.
And I absolutely want to have kids someday.
I just... I want to be ready for it.
Me, too.
And whenever we are ready,
I know you're going to be amazing.
You, too.
Hey, do you want to go have
completely protected sex right now?
I do.
Do you want to finish your bacon first?
You are the perfect woman.

<i>Les enfants, fin 2008,</i>
<i>votre tante Robin était
au chômage et un peu à la dérive,</i>
<i>donc son amitié avec Lily
était plus importante que jamais.</i>
Alors, il paraît que Marshall
doit travailler tard, vendredi.
Tu sais ce que ça veut dire,
soirée filles.
En fait, une maîtresse de mon école,
Jillian, fête son anniversaire.
- Quoi ?
- C'est juste que...
j'ai jamais entendu parler
de cette Jillian avant,
et d'un coup, c'est ta meilleure amie.
T'arrêtes pas de parler d'elle.
Sois pas jalouse.
On traîne tout le temps ensemble.
Ouais, mais Marshall est toujours là.
On a pas beaucoup de temps pour parler,
- juste nous deux.
- C'est faux.
C'est là que l'histoire
devient vraiment bien.
- Donc, on va au...
- Salut.
... lieu. Et puis ce...
mec parle de cette chose
avec le truc
dont je t'ai parlé
l'autre fois sur cet endroit.
Enfin, bref...
ça s'est produit.
Mon Dieu.
Toi et le gars du bureau du maire
l'avez fait à l'ONU sous le bureau
de l'ambassadeur du Zaïre ? Cool.
J'aimerais qu'on ait
du temps entre filles.
J'aime Marshall,
mais je ne suis pas libre de m'exprimer.
Viens avec moi et Jillian, alors.
OK, mais je veux pas rester
trop tard parce que...
Tu te souviens de...
ce truc le mois dernier
après être allée là-bas ?
Tu sais qui a dit que ça allait,
mais elle m'a donné des trucs.
T'as toujours des mycoses ?

- Je veux qu'on profite de cet instant.
- Lequel ?
Le dernier instant
où toi et moi sommes à peine
en compétition pour le titre
de meilleur ami de Ted.
- Marshall est mon meilleur ami.
- Parfaitement. Match nul.
Mais tout ça est
sur le point de changer.
Est-ce correct
que tu es un architecte ?
Mon meilleur ami saurait ça,
mais continue.
Tu dessines quoi en ce moment ?
En fait, on rénove
la bibliothèque de Nouillorc.
C'est génial !
Non, pas la bibliothèque
de New York.
C'est la bibliothèque
de Nouillorc, dans le Dakota.
Leurs livres sont dans deux parties :
pêche et pas pêche.
Je crois que tu vas adorer
ce qui s'est passé au boulot.
Tandis que la corruption
a déstabilisé le régime
et causé la mort
de la plupart de la famille royale,
ça a permis de relâcher
la régulation bancaire à Rangoon.
Bon pour nous.
Dernier ordre de la réunion,
on a décidé
de continuer sur le projet
du nouveau siège en ville
de la Goliath National Bank.
- Qui va le dessiner ?
- C'était ma première question.
- Qui va le dessiner ?
- On a approché une société.
Ce collectif architectural
suédois appelé Sven.
<i>Sven était ce collectif
architectural suédois</i>
<i>vénéré pour leurs audacieux,
designs innovants.</i>
<i>Je les détestais.</i>
Je les déteste.
Collectif architectural suédois.
- Nul.
- Prétentieux.
"On est pas une société.
On est un collectif."
Je sais. "On est suédois.
"On est trop cool avec nos baguettes
et notre tour Eiffel."
La Suède, c'est pas la France.
Tu sais ça ?
C'est la France.
Peu importe, j'ai dit à Bilson...
Bilson, sauf votre respect...
Non, je me lève,
et je dis à Bilson...
Bilson, sauf votre respect...
Musique.
Imagine une musique patriotique.
Sauf votre respect,
ça serait terrible
si un boulot qui conviendrait
à des architectes américains
compétents
allait à une bande de Français.
Où est notre patriotisme ?
L'amour du pays ?
- Notre amour de tout ce...
- Écoutez, Stinson,
personne ne déteste autant
les autres pays du monde que moi,
- mais vous avez des arguments ?
- Oui.
Je connais un fantastique architecte
américain qui serait parfait.
Tout ce que tu dois faire,
c'est venir, présenter ton dessin,
je m'occupe du conseil,
le projet est à toi.
Tu réalises quel héros je serais
si j'amenais ce projet à ma boîte ?
C'est pas le meilleur.
Nous 3, on travaillera ensemble.
- Ted pourra venir en téléconférence.
- Oui, carrément.
C'est quoi ?
Ça marche comme ça : un de nous
va dans le bureau de l'autre et dit...
Marshall, la téléconférence
commence bientôt.
Désolé, je dois y aller.
<i>Et puis on monte
sur le toit du bâtiment...</i>
<i>et on boit des bières.</i>
C'est génial.
Boire au boulot.
En gros, on est des "Mad Men".
Oui ! On est trop des "Mad Men" !
Je vais fesser une secrétaire.
C'est exactement ce qu'ils feraient
dans cette série.
Quelle série ?
Et après,
on lance les cadavres
de canettes sur les pigeons.
- Je fais pas ça.
- J'adorerais faire ça.
- Je vais réaliser ton rêve.
- Sérieusement, Barney,
après ce que j'ai vécu avec Stella,
m'avoir cette opportunité...
ça me touche.
<i>C'était vrai.
Vous voyez, les enfants,</i>
<i>quand je suis devenu architecte,
j'avais un rêve...</i>
<i>contribuer à un building
du panorama de New York.</i>
<i>Je voulais pouvoir pointer
l'un de ces bâtiments et dire, </i>
<i>"Tu vois celui-là ?
Celui juste là ?</i>
<i>"C'est le mien."</i>
<i>Ce job était l'opportunité
de réaliser ça.</i>
Ton amie a son anniversaire ici ?
Elle a quoi, 19 ans ?
Non. Crois-moi, c'est pas son genre.
Elle devait pas savoir
quel type d'endroit c'est.
On est là, ma petite pute sexy !
On vient de se faire servir !
Oh, mon Dieu.
À l'école, elle est si calme et normale.
Je pensais pas qu'elle était...
une Woo.
<i>Qu'est-ce qu'une Woo ?
Je vous explique.</i>
<i>Une Woo est un genre de jeune femme,</i>
<i>qui, comme le coucou
ou le rossignol,</i>
<i>tire son nom du son singulier
qu'elle produit.</i>
<i>Aussi, un Woo peut être déclenché
de différentes façons.</i>
<i>D'une chanson particulière
sur le juke-box...</i>
Mon Dieu, cette chanson,
c'est trop mon histoire.
<i>... jusqu'à un shooter pas cher.</i>
<i>D'un tour sur
un taureau mécanique...</i>
<i>... jusqu'à, tout et n'importe quoi.</i>
Oh mon Dieu, j'avais peur
de pas avoir nourri le chat,
puis je me suis rappelé
que je l'avais fait.
Je te jure, à l'école,
Jillian est tellement
pas Woo.
Elle a pas l'air d'une Woo.
Peut-être qu'elle le fait
que les jours fériés,
comme mardi gras et le jour de l'an.
Peut-être que c'est
une Woo conjoncturelle.
Bon, sois cool avec moi.
C'est une première mouture.
Ted, c'est incroyable.
Le détail. Les ombres.
La vivacité des lignes.
C'est exactement à ça que
Princesse Leia aurait l'air, seins nus.
Ma façon de dire merci.
Bon, tu veux voir
mes designs pour le building ?
Non, ça va.
Écoutez ça.
Lily m'a envoyé un texto.
Elle est à ce bar, le Giddy Ups
avec plein de Woos.
Mon Dieu, les filles, mon sein
vient de sortir de mon top au bar.
Et non ! Je l'ai sorti
pour un verre gratos !
Alors, Jillian, il paraît que
quand tu flashes pas les barmen,
tu es maîtresse de CE1.
C'est comment ?
Si gratifiant.
Je sais pas si tu connais
la méthode RIE,
mais elle dérive de la philosophie
d'éducation progressive de Steiner
le fondateur de l'école Waldorf,
qui est...
Oh mon Dieu, j'adore cette chanson !
Allez les pétasses, on va danser !
Vous aussi, mes salopes.
Non merci...
traînée ignorante.
Lily Aldrin, petite cachottière.
Des années que je dis que notre gang
a besoin d'une Woo,
et tu m'en as caché
un troupeau entier.
On n'a pas besoin d'une Woo.
Personne n'en a besoin.
Attention, Lily.
Le monde a absolument besoin
des Woos.
S'il n'y avait pas les Woos,
il n'y aurait pas les <i>Girls Gone Wild</i>,
pas d'enterrements
de vie de jeune fille,
pas de bar de la piscine
à Las Vegas...
toutes les choses qui te sont chères
n'existeraient pas.
- Aucun de ces trucs...
- L'industrie des shooters souvenirs
s'effondrerait.
Tout comme celle
des paillettes corporelles
et celle des limousines Hummer.
Les mini chapeaux de cowboy
ne seraient portés
que par des petits cowboys.
Et quand "Brown Eyed Girl"
passerait sur un juke-box,
tu n'entendrais...
que le silence.
Et "Brown Eyed Girl."
Mais qui ferait woo, Lily ?
Qui ferait woo ?
Tu le ferais ?
Tu ferais...
woo ?
Qui veut nommer mes nichons ?
Bon vous m'excusez, j'ai un rencard
avec Bataille et Fontaine.
<i>Les semaines qui suivirent,
je me plongeais dans le travail.</i>
<i>C'était génial d'être sur un projet
qui me tenait vraiment à coeur.</i>
<i>Finalement, le matin
de la présentation arriva.</i>
Et nous pensons
que ce design hors du temps
fera rayonner la puissance
et la stabilité
de la Goliath National Bank.
Merci, messieurs.
<i>Je suis sorti assez confiant
sur mes chances.</i>
<i>Ce soir-là, j'ai croisé Barney.</i>
Hé, Barney !
Donne-moi la bonne nouvelle.
Tu l'as pas eu.
Quoi ?
Le conseil...
a décidé de choisir Sven.
Je peux pas croire
que je l'ai pas eu.
Je pensais avoir tapé dans le mille.
Pourquoi ont-ils choisi Sven ?
J'ai tout fait
pour qu'ils changent d'avis.
Mais ils n'ont pas bronché.
Je suis désolé.
C'est vraiment nul.
Après la façon dont ces derniers mois
se sont écoulés...
j'imagine que j'en avais plus besoin
que je le croyais.
Tu veux aller jusqu'à l'actuel immeuble
de GNB et juste...
Je sais pas,
juste pisser un peu dessus ?
Je crois que j'en ai besoin.
Finis ta bière.
Remplis la machine.
- Il s'est passé quoi ?
- Ted n'a pas eu le boulot.
Mais c'est pas
la plus grande déception du jour.
- Quoi ?
- On t'a vu faire woo.
- Vu qui, faire woo ?
- Toi qui faisais woo ?
- J'ai pas fait woo.
- Oh que si.
- C'est pas vrai.
- Ton nez s'allonge.
T'es devenue la meilleure amie
de Jillian maintenant ?
C'est juste...
Tu es mariée,
je suis encore célibataire.
Chaque fois que je suis avec vous,
je suis en général la 3e roue.
Parfois, c'est sympa de sortir
avec d'autres célibataires
- et faire des trucs que tu fais pas.
- Comme quoi ?
Comme faire woo, Lily.
- Comme faire woo.
- Je peux faire woo.
- C'est pas vrai.
- Mais si.
C'est pas toi, ça.
Je veux juste te dire, que je sais
que vous avez choisi Sven, mais...
Ted Mosby est extrêmement
talentueux, et...
- il aurait fait un sacré boulot.
- C'est vrai. J'ai voté pour lui.
C'est d'accord.
Tous les retraits au DAB sont gratuits.
Téléconférence. Maintenant.
- Tu veux me dire quelque chose ?
- Bon sang.
J'ai dit à Heather de tout remettre
comme c'était sur ton bureau.
Bilson m'a dit qu'il voulait
donner le boulot à Ted.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Bien.
... fera rayonner la puissance
et la stabilité
de la Goliath National Bank.
Merci, messieurs.
Alors ?
C'était super. J'aime ça.
On dirait qu'on a notre homme.
Je crois pas qu'on ait besoin de voir...
Je suis Sven Jorgensen.
Avec moi, il y a Sven Pilsen
et Sven Johanssen, et on est...
Sven !
Vous êtes la Goliath National Bank.
Vous êtes à la pointe.
Vous êtes nouveaux et frais.
Les femmes veulent être avec vous,
les hommes désirent vous nuire,
mais l'imbécile qui ose
vous défier sera écrasé !
Votre siège social montrera
au monde ces faits.
Et encore une chose...
Ne regardez pas maintenant !
Qui est Barney Stinson,
le chef du comité de recherches ?
Oh, mon Dieu. C'est moi !
Vous, Barney Stinson,
êtes un homme de pouvoir et de virilité.
Votre bureau sera ici,
dans la tête du Tyrannosaure.
Je l'ai jamais reconnu jusqu'ici,
mais j'en ai toujours rêvé.
Sur votre bureau de bois de rose
du Honduras, il y aura ce bouton.
- Que fait ce bouton ?
- Appuyez ! Appuyez pour la gloire !
C'est l'immeuble le plus génial
de l'univers.
Il ne pourrait pas être plus génial.
Il y a un club de strip-tease
dans la lettre "N".
C'est quoi, ton problème ?
C'est la grande rupture de Ted !
Tu l'as trahi pour travailler
dans le cerveau d'un Tyrannosaure,
qui, au passage,
si tu connaissais les dinosaures,
est très, très petit.
Il ne s'agit pas de mon bureau.
L'immeuble de Ted était bien.
Celui de Sven était meilleur.
Et je laisserai pas le fait
que je sois le meilleur ami de Ted
influencer les affaires.
T'as pas choisi celui de Sven
parce qu'il était mieux.
- Tu voulais un bureau dinosaure.
- C'est un mensonge !
Je l'ai choisi parce qu'il...
Il crache du feu, Marshall.
"Feu Marshall".
- J'ai même pas fait attention.
- Comment tu as pu faire ça à Ted
après tout
ce qui s'est passé avec Stella ?
Tu es un égoïste.
Je n'aurais jamais fait
un choix professionnel par égoïsme.
Je suis un professionnel.
Allez.
Passons une bonne journée, ivres,
et jetons les cadavres aux pigeons.
Pour 2 raisons.
Un, les pigeons sont
plus intelligents que tu penses.
Ils sont rancuniers. Et, deux,
c'est notre dernière téléconférence,
M. Stinson.
Il y a des répercussions
à rouler un ami.
- Comme, quoi ?
- Comme, ça.
Mon Dieu, les filles. Hier, on a récolté
10 000 $ pour mon oeuvre de charité
qui combat l'illettrisme des enfants.
C'est un vrai problème.
Quelqu'un a gagné un voyage
les fesses les premières
jusqu'au dance floor
du canyon de la fessée !
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Les mêmes choses marrantes
que font les célibataires.
C'est pour quoi,
le casque de pompier ?
J'avais pas de chapeau de cowboy,
et c'était le jour
de la sécurité incendie à l'école...
Mon Dieu, salope.
C'est notre thème.
Vraiment ? Qui chante ça ?
LL Cool J sort toujours des trucs ?
C'est génial, Svens.
Vous êtes tellement
plus cool que Marshall.
Il a même pas de combinaison.
Qui veut une mousse ?
Je ne comprends pas.
Où est la téléconférence ?
C'est la téléconférence. Pigé ?
En Amérique,
quand on travaille tard,
on ment sur une téléconférence,
et on monte ici boire quelques bières.
C'est génial.
C'est une perte de temps.
Pompes !
Misty, tu es une vraie pouffiasse.
On se fait un autre shot.
C'est toi, la poufiasse, traînée.
C'est toi qui payes.
Non, salope, c'est toi qui payes.
T'es trop une pute.
Vous êtes une bande de prostituées.
Vous devez avoir des MST.
Allons danser.
Lily, ça marche pas.
Tu devrais pas être là.
J'ai pigé.
Parce que je suis heureuse en mariage,
je suis une nase ?
Au contraire.
Pourquoi tu crois que
les Woos doivent faire woo
quand elles gagnent
à un jeu de boisson ?
Ou quand un mec canon
enlève son T-shirt ?
Parce que c'est tout
ce que la vie leur apporte.
Ce sont...
des gens vraiment tristes.
Et quand elles sortent avec quelqu'un
qui a tout compris,
quelqu'un comme toi, ça les déçoit.
Ça enlève leur woo.
Tu dis ça pour que je me sente pas
comme une vieille mariée.
Regarde ces filles.
Regarde-les et écoute
ce que veulent dire leur woo.
"Je pleure sous la douche !"
"J'ai jamais eu de 2e rendez-vous !"
"Et si j'étais jamais maman ?"
"Je suis secrètement amoureuse
de Jillian !"
"Ma carrière et ma vie amoureuse
ne mènent nulle part !"
Les pauvres filles...
et Ted.
J'ai envie de leur faire un câlin.
Actuellement, je suis comme eux.
J'ai pas de boulot, pas de copain,
je suis un peu perdu.
Alors... de temps en temps,
j'ai besoin de faire woo,
mais quand j'ai besoin de parler
de quelque chose de concret,
c'est vers toi que je me tourne.
- Tu es ma meilleure amie.
- Et toi, la mienne.
Et je te promets de nous consacrer
plus de temps.
Marshall n'a pas besoin de nous coller
dès qu'on fait quelque chose.
Vous avez testé ces shots violets
dans les tubes à essai ?
J'en ai pris cinq. Je crois pas
qu'il y ait de l'alcool dedans.
- Où t'as eu ce chapeau ?
- Quel chapeau ?
- On a viré Sven.
- Quoi ?
Ces gars étaient débiles.
Bien sûr, ils avaient
des idées cool...
des idées vraiment cool.
En fait, je me demande
si c'est pas trop tard...
Le fait est :
tu as le boulot.
Vraiment ?
Le comité a réalisé
qu'il avait commis une erreur.
En plus, tu comptes beaucoup pour eux
et ils veulent que tu sois heureux.
C'est bizarre.
Tes plans étaient les meilleurs
et tu le mérites.
Tu dois savoir une chose sur le fait
que tu n'aies pas eu
le boulot au début.
- Tu vois, Ted...
- C'était Bilson.
Bilson voulait avoir un bureau
dans la tête de dinosaure,
mais Barney l'a convaincu
que c'était vraiment, vraiment stupide.
Tu sais...
Merci, Barney.
J'y crois pas. J'ai rapporté à ma boîte
le plus gros contrat qu'elle ait eu.
"Maintenant, seule ma vie amoureuse
est un désastre !"
La prochaine est pour moi.
Pourquoi tu m'as aidé ?
Tu as fait ce qu'il fallait.
T'as bien mérité un coup de pouce.
Et puis, ça aurait déçu Ted,
et il est finalement...
très content pour le moment.
Tu es vraiment
le meilleur ami de Ted.
Et moi aussi. Ex aequo.
Merci, Marshall.
<i>Marshall finit par craquer
et m'avoua la vérité sur Barney,</i>
<i>genre, dix minutes plus tard,</i>
<i>au point qu'on a attaché oncle Barney
au taureau mécanique,</i>
<i>réglé sur la position
"Mélange de peinture"</i>
<i>et on est rentré.</i>
- Je t'aime, mec.
- Moi aussi, mon pote.
Tu montes sur le taureau ?
Non, même si tu me payes.
J'ai un problème d'oreille interne.
<i>Ce fut une nuit plutôt géniale.</i>
3 heures. C'est le record du bar.
C'est ça, les filles.
Tu sais ce qui serait vraiment dingue,
marrant et stupide à faire ce soir ?
Si toi et moi, on trouvait
un mec pour le faire à trois.
Peut-être...
si on trouve le bon mec.
Oui, et...
si on trouve pas le bon mec,
toutes les deux, on pourrait juste...
Tu sais qui est plutôt mignon ?
Ce gars, Ted.
Allons le chercher.
Kids, in the fall of 2008,
Your aunt robin was unemployed and a little bit adrift,
So she valued her friendship with lily more than ever.
Hey, so I hear marshall has to work late on friday.
You know what that means-- ladies' night.
Oh, actually one of the teachers at my school, jillian,
Is having a birthday party.
Oh. okay.
What?
It's just I've never even heard
Of this jillian person before
And suddenly she's, like, your best friend.
You can't shut up about her.
Don't be jealous.
You and I hang out all the time.
Yeah, but marshall's always there.
We don't get a lot of quality time to talk,
Just the two of us.
That's not true.
So that's when the story gets really good.
So, we go to the, uh... hey.
...place.
And then that...
Guy asks about that thing with the stuff
That I told you about at that place that time.
Long story short--
Events transpired.
Oh, my god.
You and the guy from the mayor's office
Did it in the un building under the desk
Of the ambassador from zaire?
Nice.
I just wish we could have some girl time.
I love marshall, but he's always talk-blocking me.
So come out with me and jillian then.
Okay, but I don't want to stay out too late because...
Remember that, um, thing
Last month after I went to the place?
Well, you know who said it's fine,
But she gave me some stuff.
You still got that yeast infection, huh?
Marshall,
I want you to enjoy this moment.
What moment?
The last moment of you and I being even slightly
In competition for the title of ted's best friend.
Marshall's my best friend.
Exactly. it's a tie.
But all of that is about to change.
Ted, am I correct that you are an architect?
My best friend would really know that, but go on.
And what are you currently designing?
Actually, we're renovating the new york public library.
Wow, ted, that's huge!
No, not the new york public library.
It's the new public library in york, north dakota.
Their books are in 2 sections
Fishin' and non-fishin'.
Then I think you are going to really like
What happened at work today.
And so, while those bribes
Did destabilize the regime and caused the death
Of most of the royal family,
It did lead to looser banking regulations in rangoon.
So yay us.
Okay, last order of business.
It's been decided we're going to move forward
With plans for goliath national bank's
New downtown headquarters.
Who's gonna design it?
Was my first question.
Who's gonna design it?
We've already approached one firm about it.
This swedish architecture collective called sven.
Sven?
Sven?!
Sven was this swedish architecture collective
Revered for their bold, innovative designs.
I hated those guys.
I hate those guys.
Swedish architecture collective.
Lame.
Pretentious.
"we're not a company. we're a collective."
I know.
"we are swedish.
"we are so cool with our baguettes
And our eiffel tower."
Dude, sweden's not france. you know that, right?
Oh, it's france.
So anyway, I say to bilson...
Bilson, with all due respect...
No, I stand up, and I say to bilson...
Bilson, with all due respect...
Music. imagine patriotic music playing.
Bilson, with all due respect,
It would be terrible
If a job that could go
To a hard-working american
Architecture firm went to a bunch of french guys.
Where is our patriotism?
Our sense of country?
Our love of all that is...
Look, stinson,
No one hates every other country in the world as much as I do,
But you better have a point.
I do.
I know a fantastic
American architect who would be perfect for the job.
Ted mosby.
So, all you gotta do is come in, pitch your design,
I get the board to approve it, and the job is yours.
Do you realize what a hero I would be
If I brought this project to my firm?
And that's not even the best part.
All three of us are gonna be working together.
Ted can be on the conference call.
He can totally be on the conference call. what's the conference call?
The way it works is, one of us will duck
Into the other's office and say...
Marshall, the conference call's about to start.
I'm sorry, guys, I gotta go.
And then we go up to the roof of the building...
And drink beer.
This is awesome. mm.
Drinking at work.
We're basically mad men.
We are! we're such mad men!
I'm gonna go smack a secretary on the ass.
That's totally what they would do on that show.
What show?
And then, we throw crumpled up beer cans at pigeons.
I don't do that.
I totally want to do that.
Well, I am gonna make that happen.
Seriously, barney,
After everything I went through with stella,
Getting me this opportunity...
It really means a lot.
It really did. you see, kids,
When I became an architect, I had one dream--
To contribute a building to the skyline of new york city.
I wanted to be able to point to one of those buildings
And say, see that one? that one right there?
That's mine.
This job was my opportunity to do just that.
Wow. your friend's having her birthday here?
What's she turning, 19?
No. believe me, this isn't her scene.
She probably just didn't know what kind of place this was.
Lily! over here,
You sexy bitch!
We've got bottle service!
At school, she's so quiet and normal.
I had no idea she's...
She's a woo girl.
What's a woo girl?
Let me explain.
A woo girl is a type of young woman,
Who, like the cuckoo bird or the whip-poor-will,
Gets her name from the signature sound she makes.
Now, a woo can be elicited in many different ways.
From a certain song coming on the jukebox...
Oh, my god, this song is totally about me.
...to half-priced shots.
From a ride on a mechanical bull...
...to, well, pretty much anything.
Oh, my god, I was worried that I didn't feed the cat,
But then I remembered that I did.
I swear, at school jillian seems so un-woo-y.
Yeah, she doesn't look wooish.
Maybe she only observes
The high holidays, like mardi gras and spring break.
Maybe she's just a cultural woo.
Now, uh, go easy on me.
It's a work in progress.
Ted, this is amazing.
The detail.
The shading.
The playfulness of the lines.
This is exactly what princess leia would look like topless.
My way of saying thanks.
So, uh, you want to see my designs for the building?
Nah, I'm good.
So get this.
Lily just texted me.
She's at that bar giddyups with a bunch of woo girls.
Oh, my god, you guys,
My boob just fell out of my top at the bar.
Trick! I pulled it out for a free drink!
So, jillian, I hear when you're not flashing bartenders,
You teach the second grade.
What's that like?
So rewarding.
I don't know if you're familiar with the rie technique,
But it derives from the progressive educational
Philosophy of rudolf steiner,
Who founded the waldorf school, which...
Oh, my god. I love this song!
Come on, you lazy skanks, let's dance!
You, too, you dumb whores.
No, thank you...
Ya ignorant hussy.
Why, lily aldrin,
You sly minx.
I've been saying for years
That our gang needed a woo girl,
And here you've been hiding a whole batch of them from me.
We do not need a woo girl.
No one needs a woo girl.
Be careful, lily.
The world absolutely needs woo girls.
If there were no woo girls,
There'd be no girls gone wild,
No bachelorette parties, no las vegas poolside bars...
All the things that you hold dearest, lily, would be gone.
Those are none of the things...
The souvenir shot glass industry would collapse.
So would the body glitter industry
And the stretch hummer rental industry.
Tiny cowboy hats would be worn
Only by tiny cowboys.
And when
"brown eyed girl" would come up on the jukebox,
All you would hear...
Would be silence.
And "brown eyed girl."
But who would woo, lily?
Who would woo?
Would you?
Would you...
Who wants to name my boobs?!
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date with hannity and colmes.
Over the next couple of weeks, I dove into work.
It felt great to be working on something
That I really cared about.
Finally, the morning of the presentation arrived.
And we believe this timeless design
Will radiate the strength and stability
That is goliath national bank.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I left there feeling pretty good about my chances.
Later that night, we ran into barney.
Hey, barney!
Give me the good news.
You didn't get it.
What?
The board decided to go with sven.
I can't believe I didn't get it.
I really thought I nailed the pitch.
Why would they go with sven?
I did everything I could to change their minds.
But they wouldn't budge.
I'm sorry.
Wow, this really sucks.
After the way these last couple of months have gone...
I guess I needed this more than I thought I did.
You want to go down to the current gnb building
And just, like... I don't know,
Just pee on it a little bit?
Yeah, I think I need that.
Finish your beer. fill your tank.
What happened?
Oh, ted didn't get that job.
But that's not
The biggest disappointment of the day.
What?
We saw you woo.
Saw who woo?
Saw you woo.
I didn't woo.
You did, too.
That's not true.
Your nose just grew.
You're, like, best friends with jillian now?
No. it's just...
You're married, lily, but I'm still single.
Whenever I hang out with you,
I'm usually the third wheel to you and marshall.
Sometimes, it's fun to go out with other single women
And do stuff that you don't want to.
Like what?
Like woo, lily.
Like woo.
I can woo.
That's not true.
I can, too.
It's just not you.
Bilson.
Yeah? hey. look, I just...
I just want to say, I know you guys went with sven,
But ted mosby is tremendously talented,
And I think he would have done a hell of a job.
I agree. that's why I voted for him.
So, then, it's agreed. from now on,
All atm fees are now called freedom charges.
Conference call. now.
You got something you want to tell me?
Oh, damn it.
I told heather to put everything
Back on your desk the way it was.
Bilson told me he wanted to give the job to ted.
So what happened?
Okay, fine.
...will radiate the strength
And stability that is goliath national bank.
Thank you, gentlemen.
So?
That was great. I love it.
Yes!
Looks like we got our guy.
I don't think we even need to meet with, uh...
I am sven jorgensen.
With me are sven pilsen and sven johanssen, and we are...
Sven!
You are goliath national bank.
You are cutting edge. you are new. you are fresh.
Women want to be with you, men wish to harm you,
But the fool who dares challenge you shall be crushed!
Your headquarters will tell the world of these facts.
Oh, and one more thing... don't look now!
Which of you is barney stinson, head of the search committee?
Oh, my god. that's me!
You, barney stinson, are a man of power and virility.
Your office shall be here,
In the head of a tyrannosaurus rex.
I never knew it till now, but I've always dreamed of that.
On your large desk of honduran rosewood
Shall be this button.
What does the button do?
Press it! press it for glory!
Yes!
This is the most awesome building in the universe.
There is no way this building could be more awesome.
There is a strip club in the letter "n."
What the hell is the matter with you?!
This is ted's big break!
And then you sold him out because you wanted
To work in the brain of a tyrannosaurus rex,
Which, incidentally,
If you knew anything about dinosaurs,
Is really, really small.
Marshall, this isn't about my office.
Ted's building was good.
Sven's was better.
And I am not going to let the fact that I am ted's best friend
Be a factor in business.
You didn't pick sven's building because it was better.
You picked it because you wanted to work
In a cool dinosaur office.
That's a lie!
I picked it because it-it...
It breathes fire, marshall.
"fire marshall."
Oh. I didn't even notice.
How could you do this to ted
After everything he's been through with stella?!
You're just being selfish.
Marshall, I would never
Make a business decision for selfish reasons.
I am a professional. now, come on.
Let's get a nice daytime drunk going,
And throw empties at pigeons.
No. no. for two reasons.
One, pigeons are smarter than you think.
They hold grudges.
And, two, this is our last conference call, mr. stinson.
There are repercussions to screwing over a friend.
Like what?
Like this.
Oh, my god, you guys. last night,
We raised $10,000 for my charity
To help combat childhood illiteracy.
It's a really serious issue.
Someone just earned herself an ass-first ride
Down the dance floor spank canyon!
Lily, what are you doing here?
Oh, just doing the fun things you single girls do.
What's with the plastic fireman's hat?
Oh, I didn't have a cowboy hat,
And today was fire safety day at school, so...
Oh, my god, bitch.
This is our anthem.
Really? who sings this?
Is ll cool j still doing things?
This is great, svens.
You guys are so much cooler than marshall.
He doesn't even own a unitard.
Who wants a brew?
I don't understand.
Where is the conference call?
This is the conference call. get it?
In america,
When we work late,
We lie about a conference call,
And we come up here and we drink a few beers.
It's awesome.
This is a waste of time. push-ups!
Misty, you are such a slut.
Let's do another shot.
You're the slut, you skank.
Shots are on you.
No, bitch, shots are on you.
You're such a whore.
You're all a bunch of prostitutes.
You probably have stds.
Um... let's go dance.
Lily,
This isn't working. you shouldn't be here.
Oh, I get it.
Because I'm happily married,
I'm some kind of loser?
Exactly the opposite.
Lily, why do you think the woo girls have to woo
When they win a game of beer pong,
Or when a hot guy takes his shirt off?
It's because that is as good as life gets for them.
They're really sad people.
And, when they hang out
With someone who's got it all figured out--
Someone like you-- it bums them out.
It takes away their woo
You're just saying that
So I don't feel like an old married lady.
Look at those girls, lily.
Look at them and listen
To what their woo's are really saying.
i cry in the shower!
I've never been on a second date
What if i never get to be a Mom?
I'm secretly in love with Jillian!
My career and love life are heading nowhere
Oh, those poor girls... a-and ted.
I-i just want to go give them all a hug.
Lily, right now I'm like them.
I'm unemployed, I'm single, I'm a little lost.
So every once in a while, I need to woo,
But when I need to talk about something real,
You're the one I turn to.
You're my best friend.
And you're mine.
And I promise I'll make more time for just us.
Marshall doesn't have to tag along to everything we do.
Hey, have you guys tried these purple hooter test tube shots?
I've had, like, five of 'em.
I don't even think there's alcohol in here.
Where'd you get that hat?
What hat?
We fired sven. what?
Yeah, those guys were idiots.
I mean, sure, they had some cool ideas--
Some really cool ideas.
Actually, I wonder if it's not too late to...
No!
The point is
You got the job.
Really? yeah.
The search committee realized they made the wrong decision.
Plus, you really mean a lot to them
And they want you to be happy.
That's weird.
Look, ted, your design was the best,
And you deserve it.
There's also something that you should know
About why you didn't get the job in the first place.
You see, ted... it was bilson.
Bilson just wanted to have an office in a dinosaur head,
But barney convinced him that it was really, really stupid.
Well, you know.
Thank you, barney.
I can't believe this.
I-i-i just got our firm
The biggest account we've ever had.
Now only my love life's a disaster.
Next round's on me.
Why'd you let me off the hook?
You did the right thing.
Seemed like you deserved a bye.
Plus, it would have really
Bummed ted out, and he's-he's finally...
Happy right now.
You really are ted's best friend.
And so am i.
It's a tie.
Thanks, marshall.
Marshall wound up caving
And telling me the truth about barney,
Like, ten minutes later,
At which point we tied uncle barney to the mechanical bull,
Cranked it up to a setting called "paint mixer"
woo! and went home.
I love you, man.
Love you, too, buddy.
Whew. hey, you going to ride the bull tonight?
No, not if you paid me.
I have an inner ear thing.
that was a pretty great night
Three hours.
That's a bar record.
That's right, ladies.
Jillian, you know what'd be really crazy
And funny and stupid to do tonight?
If you and me
Find a guy and have a three-way.
Maybe... if we found the right guy.
Yeah, and...
If we don't find the right guy, maybe you and I could just...
You know who was pretty cute?
That guy ted.
Let's go find him.

<i>Les enfants, on croit tous savoir</i>
<i>le temps qu'il faut

La moitié du temps de la relation.

Exactement 10 000 verres.
Peu importe le temps que ça prend.

Ça se fait pas à pas.
De son lit à la porte d'entrée.
Bam ! T'es dehors. Suivante !

Je l'ai juste regardée.
Enfin, c'est une vieille
qui fait du break dance.
Et elle est bonne.
Je lui donnerai un dollar,
la prochaine fois.
Faisons comme si j'avais dit ça :
Ces voyages en ascenseur
ont été le moment fort de ma semaine,
et j'aimerais vous revoir
vendredi soir.
Pas dans l'ascenseur.
Au restaurant, un sympa.
Vous en pensez quoi ?

<i>Les enfants, j'ai vu
un tas de trucs fous en rentrant</i>
<i>dans l'appart toutes ces années.</i>
Désolée les gars.
Je vais juste faire une coupe de fruits.
Ça fait 12 minutes !
- Pose-la !
- Toi d'abord !
Pourquoi tu me vises, Ike ?
- Dis pas mon nom !
- Posez vos armes !
<i>Mais l'un des trucs
les plus fous que j'ai vu</i>
<i>s'est produit quand j'étais
coloc avec votre tante Robin.</i>
T'es qui ?
Mitch.
- Tu fais quoi, Mitch ?
- Tu dois être le colocataire.
Je suis avec Robin.
Elle est sortie
pour prendre un appel.
Je crois que son portable
passe pas ici.
Robin a pas utilisé
le signal super secret.
On met ce vieux menu sur la poignée.
Ce restau a dû fermer.
M. Popol...
Pas besoin d'expliquer
pourquoi c'est drôle.
Je file.
En partant, prends le coussin avec toi.
C'est un déchet maintenant.
Je pense être plus que qualifiée
pour ce boulot.
Mes faiblesses ?
Je dirais trop attentionnée,
travaille trop,
et je fais passer
ma carrière en premier.
Oups ! Le dernier est vrai.
Quoi ?
Apparemment, notre douce, innocente,
petite Robin a amené un amant.
Un jeune maigrichon du nom de Mitch.
Son truc arrangé ? Un vrai désastre.
Elle m'a envoyé des textos
toute la soirée.
Elle l'a juste laissé monter
pour utiliser la salle de bain.
Excusez-moi, une minute.
Mec, tu m'énerves.
Je suis en pleine action, là.
Quelle action ?
C'est ma technique.
Ça s'appelle, "Le Mec à Poil".
"Le Mec à Poil" ?
Voilà le truc. T'es au premier rencard,
t'as bu quelques verres,
<i>tu sors une excuse
pour aller chez la fille.</i>
La salle de bain est là.
Tu sais quoi, je vais répondre.
<i>Puis, quand elle part,</i>
<i>tu te déshabilles et t'attends.</i>
<i>Quand elle revient,</i>
<i>elle rit.</i>
<i>Elle est si séduite par ton assurance,
et ta bravade qu'elle couche avec toi.</i>
- Aucune chance que ça marche !
- Deux fois sur trois.
Deux fois sur trois ?
Deux fois sur trois.
Faut juste choisir son moment.
"Le Mec à Poil" marche
surtout en dernier recours,
le dernier recours
au 1er rendez-vous
quand tu sais
qu'il n'y en aura pas de second.
Comment tu sais ça ?
- Regarde-moi.
- Je préfère pas.
Robin n'est pas dans ma division.
Je suis pas futé,
drôle ou beau gosse.
Comme tu peux le voir, y a rien
d'impressionnant nulle part par là.
Ma seule chance avec une fille
comme Robin, c'est la surprise.
Et, soyons honnête,
un peu de pitié.
C'est choc et "ohhh."
- Ça marche pas vraiment.
- Deux fois sur trois.
Garanti.
Sans dec'.
Deux fois sur trois.
- Il m'a garanti.
- Sérieux.
Aucune chance
que ça marche sur Robin.
Elle va entrer, jeter un coup d'œil
à cet idiot et l'enverra bouler.
Elle va lui casser la gueule, oui.
Elle va prendre son flingue
et lui tirer dessus.
Mon Dieu !
Ça a marché.
Les affaires reprennent
pour M. Popol.
"Le Mec à Poil" marche !
Ça va révolutionner
les coups d'un soir !
C'est comme la passe en avant
au football américain.
Le dunk au basket.
Ce truc de coiffeur où ils tiennent
la mèche et coupent au-dessus.
Ça change la donne !
Barney, ce type a couché avec Robin,
dont tu dis être amoureux.
Comment ça peut t'exciter ?
"Le Mec à Poil" est plus important
que moi et Robin.
Toutes ces années,
je me suis cassé le cul,
avec mes identités secrètes
mes tours et mes gadgets.
Je veux dire, je suis Batman.
Mais ce type, c'est Superman.
Il déchire ses vêtements et c'est parti.
De quel genre de gadgets tu parles ?
Alors, ça va être ça,
la colocation ?
Je rentre, et des types avec qui tu sors
seront assis sur le canapé, à poil.
Je voudrais pouvoir te dire non.
Je peux pas croire
que "Le Mec à Poil" ait marché sur toi.
Comment te dire ?
Je suis entrée et il était à poil.
C'était drôle.
J'ai rigolé, il a rigolé.
Et puis, ça s'est passé.
Je sais pas.
- Je dis salope !
- Salope ?
Pardon ?
Désolé Robin,
mais niquer avec ce type
fait penser que tout ce qui te sépare
du sexe, c'est les vêtements.
J'ai pas couché avec Mitch
parce qu'il était à poil.
- Alors, pourquoi t'as couché ?
- Parce que...
Il...
Il... parce que j'apprécie Mitch.
Beaucoup.
Il y avait une... connexion,
de spécificité.
De spécificité et de sentiments.
Parce qu'il était à poil.
Désolé, mais je suis pas d'accord.
Il y a une seule raison
de coucher avec quelqu'un,
et c'est "l'amour."
Marshall est une grande fille
parce qu'il croit en l'amour
et a lu "Et Si C'était Vrai",
car les secrétaires l'ont forcé
à joindre le club de lecture d'Oprah.
Mais vous savez que j'ai raison.
Marshall, je t'aime,
mais y a plein de raisons de coucher.
- Cite-m'en une.
- Je t'en cite 50.
- Tu pourras pas.
- Numéro une : jeudi dernier.
- Marshall, tu veux le faire ?
- Je suis là.
Tu as souillé le lit marital
parce que tu pouvais pas dormir ?
C'est toi qui as dit,
"Cette ombre au plafond,
"on dirait un affreux clown édenté.
Bonne nuit, Lily."
D'accord ! Ça en fait une.
Mais je te mets au défi de...
Je vais t'en donner 50.
Y a le sexe de réconciliation...
le sexe de rupture,
et le sexe "un pote t'a parlé
d'une nouvelle position".
De rien.
Il y a aussi "vengeance",
"rebondir",
"parachutage."
Quand t'es en voyage,
mais au lieu d'aller à l'hôtel,
tu vas direct dans un bar trouver
une fille pour avoir un pied à terre.
- Oh, ça, "la baise pour un toit."
- Salope !
Je le fais pas.
Ma coloc à la fac l'a fait.
Non, Robin,
c'est juste une mauvaise toux.
J'ai pas vraiment une mauvaise toux.
On sait tous que la "coloc à la fac",
c'est toi, salope !
Personne n'a un Strepsil ?
Oh, j'en ai un.
Le sexe "que dalle à la télévision".
Le sexe "chambre d'hôtel".
"Curiosité," du style,
"Me suis toujours demandé comment c'est
de le faire avec une fille très grande".
Pas une fille balèze,
simplement grande.
Comme...
si une fille normale
faisait 2,10 m, 2,25 m de hauteur
et... portait une minijupe en jean.
J'aimerais savoir comment c'est.
Le sexe "Il dit qu'il t'aime,
mais tu veux pas lui dire pareil".
43.
"Le copilote qui saute
sur la grenade d'un ami".
44.
- "Les capotes vont se périmer".
- 45.
- Ça devient un peu dur.
- 46 !
Encore 4.
"Tu fais tomber une chips sur ses genoux
et quand tu la ramasses,
"il pense que c'est une approche,
et ça se passe".
Merci de gâcher le souvenir
de l'anniversaire de nos 6 mois.
Tu m'as donné des chips.
On peut arrêter
avec cette stupide liste ?
- Vous me rendez triste.
- Non, je m'amuse.
Mec, ce truc de "un partenaire",
c'est nul parfois.
Je parle toujours de toi.
Je peux pas jouer au "j'ai jamais",
car tout le monde saura toutes les
bizarreries que je te laisse faire.
La seule bizarrerie que j'ai faite
était d'ouvrir mon coeur et mon âme
alors que j'avais qu'à me mettre à poil
quand la pièce était vide.
J'ai pas couché avec Mitch
parce qu'il était nu !
Mitch et moi avons un truc spécial.
Je croise les doigts.
C'est peut-être le bon.
- Le bon ?
- Mitch ? Le Mec à Poil ?
Tu veux dire le génie à poil.
Tout ce temps, j'ai porté un costume
alors que j'aurais dû l'enlever.
C'est tout.
Je fais "Le Mec à Poil", ce soir.
- Et toi aussi.
- Quoi ?
Avec la fille de l'ascenseur.
T'es avec elle ce soir ? "Mec à Poil" !
C'est la première fille que j'ai eu
le courage d'inviter, depuis Stella.
"Mec à Poil" !
C'est la 8e tenue
que j'essaie ce soir !
J'ai coupé mes cheveux 3 fois !
Je suis à bout !
T'es maquillé ?
C'est pas du maquillage !
C'est une crème solaire
avec une teinte subtile de...
C'est pour les hommes.
C'est bon,
je veux que mes yeux ressortent.
"Mec à Poil" !
Non, Barney, j'aime bien Vicky.
Ça pourrait être sérieux.
Je veux rien faire de stupide
qui compromette ça.
J'aime vraiment...
cette fille, mais...
je l'avais pas vue de dos.
J'aime vraiment...
cette fille.
Et je veux bien compromettre notre futur
pour une nuit de gloire.
"Mec à Poil" !
<i>Ce soir-là, on avait tous
quelque chose à prouver.</i>
<i>Robin voulait défendre son honneur.</i>
Mitch, bébé, c'est moi.
Tu veux prendre quelque chose
à manger pour ce soir ?
Parce que t'es mon petit ami !
<i>Lily avait besoin de prouver
qu'elle pouvait finir sa liste.</i>
Je suis bloquée.
Je trouve pas les 2 dernières.
Raison 48 :
"Pour conforter les bonnes conduites,
comme le rasage ou l'hygiène dentaire".
Maintenant tu me conditionnes ?
Super !
Voilà pourquoi j'ai une érection
quand je passe du fil dentaire.
<i>J'ai dû prouver qu'aussi effrayant
que ça puisse être de ressortir,</i>
<i>j'avais oublié Stella
et j'étais prêt à revenir.</i>
Et Barney devait prouver que lui aussi
pouvait être "Le Mec à Poil".
Merci de me laisser voir
ton aquarium.
- Tu me sauves la vie.
- Bien sûr, pas de problème.
Je dois juste aller aux toilettes
et je me sauve.
Ted, je le fais.
Je fais "Le Mec à Poil" !
Moi aussi !
Tu...
Je le fais.
Je fais "Le Mec à Poil" !
C'est super !
Pourquoi t'as changé d'avis ?
La soirée a bien commencé, mais...
pas aussi bien que j'espérais.
Oh mon Dieu !
Ted, tu es si marrant !
Et je peux te dire
que tu as des yeux magnifiques.
Quoi, ces vieux trucs ?
- Bien joué, tête brûlée.
- Je suis désolé.
Arrêtez ! Allez dire au directeur
qu'il nous doit une entrée.
Une de celles avec des crevettes !
De rien. Tu disais ?
Et puis sa canne
a raté la dernière marche,
et il est tombé, pendant,
je te jure, au moins 2 min.
Bon Dieu,
j'aime les vieux.
Quand j'ai réalisé qu'il n'y avait
aucun futur dans cette relation,
- j'ai décidé de le faire.
- Génial ! OK, question importante :
Quelle pose aura ton "Mec à Poil" ?
C'est une bonne question.
J'y ai pas vraiment pensé.
Je pensais à "Superman".
Et le "Capitaine Morgan" ?
Et "Oups, je ne t'avais pas vu" ?
Le Penseur ?
Et le Heisman ?
M. Propre ?
Le "Burt Reynolds".
C'est un plaisir de te revoir.
J'ai vraiment passé
un bon moment, hier soir.
Alors, ça fait quoi
de tenir un Pizza Hut ?
Qui a eu l'idée de mettre
un ananas dans le...
OK, ça suffit.
Je sais ce que c'est.
J'ai déjà donné. C'est le rencard
"je suis pas une salope".
Quoi ? C'est dingue.
D'habitude, tu vois clair dans mon jeu,
mais là tu te trompes.
Allez, Robin.
L'un de nous a passé un bon moment,
et on sait que c'est moi.
Mitchell...
Truc, c'est... pas vrai !
- Vraiment ? C'était comment le sexe ?
- J'ai pas détesté.
Tu as vu ma technique.
C'est tout.
Je n'ai plus rien à t'offrir.
Je suis ruiné,
je sue quand je mange,
et je suis dans 5 ligues
de football imaginaire.
Je parle que de ça.
- Crois-moi, tu veux pas en être.
- Quoi ? Bien sûr que si !
Je n'ai pas couché avec toi
juste parce que tu étais nu.
Mais si.
Et maintenant, tu fais semblant
que c'était plus pour te sentir mieux.
Dis ce que tu veux,
au moins "Le Mec à Poil"
est honnête.
Que penses-tu
du bon vieux "Bébé Cadum" ?
Le gymnaste olympique
qui réussit son atterrissage.
- Je dois y aller.
- "Mec à Poil" !
C'est chouette chez toi !
Merci, de ta part,
c'est un vrai compliment.
J'adore que tu sois architecte,
c'est fascinant.
Je pourrais t'écouter parler
de design des structures toute la nuit.
<i>C'est là que j'ai vu,
posé sur la table,</i>
<i>un livre de poèmes d'amour
de Pablo Neruda.</i>
<i>La même édition
que j'avais à la fac.</i>
<i>Et le marque-page était
à mon poème préféré.</i>
<i>Peut-être que je me trompais
sur cette fille.</i>
<i>On avait peut-être un avenir.</i>
Merde !
Et voilà.
Pablo Neruda.
Ouais, ce livre est une merde.
Un crétin avec qui je suis sorti
l'a laissé là. C'est en mexicain.
Tu sais qui écrit de bons poèmes ?
Jewel. Elle a les dents pourris
et elle vit dans une voiture.
Elle a des trucs à raconter.
"Le Mec à Poil" marche !
Je viens de coucher
avec une horrible personne.
- Je suis de retour !
- Félicitations, mon pote.
T'es pas le seul
à avoir assuré en "Mec à Poil".
Tu veux juste le faire
pour changer de sujet.
Hé, c'est le 49 !
Ça a marché ?
Comme si je venais
de passer le fil dentaire.
Je t'aime.
Ça fait 50.
- Joli ! T'as fait quelle pose ?
- Celle du "J'ai des seins".
En plein dans le mille.
Mon Dieu ! Les gars, les gars !
C'est lui !
- C'est "Le Mec à Poil" !
- Ted, son nom est Mitch.
Et... c'est mon copain. Alors...
C'est bon,
je te traiterai plus de salope.
- OK. Tu peux y aller. C'est fini.
- Merci.
Attends, Mitch,
je dois te remercier.
On a tous essayé
"Le Mec à Poil", ce soir.
On devrait voir ce qu'a fait Barney.
Salut, Barney est là ?
Mon Dieu.
C'est quoi, ton problème ?
- Vire !
- Je dois prendre mon costume.
- Il est cher. Juste la cravate...
- Dégage, tout de suite !
- Dégage, espèce de sale détraqué !
- Appelle-moi.
Et si je le revois,
j'appelle les flics.
Deux fois sur trois.
Je veux que tu saches, cette nuit,
aussi folle qu'elle ait été,
- m'a fait sortir de ma coquille.
- C'est toute la beauté du "Mec à Poil".
Ça te donne juste ce qu'il te faut.
Ni plus,
ni moins.
Si vous m'excusez,
je dois remettre en place l'épaule
d'un de mes quarterbacks
de foot imaginaire.
Il s'est déboîté l'épaule !
Un toast...
à Mitch.
La somme de ses parties
ne fait de lui qu'un homme.
Mais quand il se sert de ses parties,
il devient bien plus.
<i>Il ne correspond pas
à la définition du héros,</i>
<i>mais il est celui
dont j'avais besoin.</i>
<i>Le héros qui m'a aidé
à me remettre de la catastrophe</i>
<i>de l'échec de mon presque-mariage
et m'a remis en selle.</i>
<i>Il vit dans l'ombre.
Est-ce un rêve ?</i>
<i>La vérité ? Une fiction ?
La damnation ? Le salut ?</i>
<i>Il est tout ça et aussi,
rien du tout.</i>
<i>Car il est...</i>
<i>"Le Mec à Poil".</i>
Mon Dieu !
COSTUMES À VENDRE
Dieu merci.
<i>Kids, everyone has an opinion</i>
<i>on how long it takes
to recover from a breakup.</i>
Half the length of the relationship.
One week for every month
you were together.
Exactly 10,000 drinks.
However long that takes.
You can't measure something
like this in time.
There's a series of steps.
From her bed to the front door.
Bam! Out of there. Next!
<i>But I think you start to recover</i>
<i>the moment you meet that person
who gets you back in the game.</i>
<i>This is the story of
how I met that person.</i>
<i>Now, kids, if you want
to go swimming, you don't just dive in.</i>
<i>First, you dip your toe
in the water.</i>
<i>You check the temperature.
See how it feels.</i>
I'm Ted.
Vicky.
<i>And then you slowly wade in.</i>
I got left at the altar a month ago.
<i>Or, you know, cannonball.</i>
It was a complete disaster
and ever since then,
I haven't been able to even
look at another woman.
Except for the old lady on the subway
who break-dances for nickels.
I don't look at her that way.
I just look at her.
I mean,
it's an old lady break-dancing.
And she is good.
I'm going to give her
a dollar next time.
Hey, let's pretend I just said this:
These elevator rides have been
the highlight of my week,
and I'd love to see you
again Friday night.
Not in the elevator.
At restaurant, a nice one.
What do you say?
Yes.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
<i>I walked in on a lot of crazy stuff
at the old apartment over the years.</i>
Sorry, guys. I'm just going
to go with a bowl of fruit.
It's been 12 minutes!
- Drop it!
- You first!
Why are you pointing your gun at me?
- Don't use my name!
- Put the guns down, now!
<i>But one of the craziest things
I ever walked in on</i>
<i>happened when I was roommates
with your Aunt Robin.</i>
Who are you?
Mitch.
- What you doing, Mitch?
- Oh, you must be the roommate.
I'm on a date with Robin.
She had to step outside
to take a call.
I guess her cell phone
doesn't work in here.
Oh, Robin didn't use
the super secret signal.
We put this old takeout menu
on the doorknob.
Place went out of business.
Mr. Wang's...
Guess I don't have to explain
why that's funny.
I'm gonna go.
When you leave, take the seat cushion
with you. That's trash now.
I think that I am more
than qualified for the job.
My weaknesses?
I would say caring too much,
working too hard,
and putting my career
in front of my love life.
That last one was real.
What?
Well, it appears our sweet,
innocent, little Robin
has taken a lover.
A young blade by the name of Mitch.
Her blind date? Total bust.
She's been sending me
text messages all night.
She just let him go upstairs
to use the bathroom a second ago.
Excuse me a minute.
Buddy, you are killing me.
I'm in the middle of something here.
Middle of what?
This is my move.
It's called, "The Naked Man."
"The Naked Man"?
Goes like this:
you're on a first date,
you've had a few drinks,
<i>You make an excuse to go up
to the girl's apartment.</i>
The bathroom's right there.
You know what,
I'm going to grab this.
<i>Then, once she leaves the room,</i>
<i>you strip down naked and wait.</i>
<i>When she comes back,</i>
<i>she laughs.</i>
<i>She's so charmed
by your confidence and bravado,</i>
<i>she sleeps with you. Boom!</i>
- There is no way that works!
- Two out of three times.
Two out of three times?
Two out of three times.
You just have to pick your spot.
"The Naked Man" is best used
as a last resort,
kind of a Hail Mary on a first date
when you know there's not
going to be a second one.
How do you know that?
- Ted, look at me.
- I'd rather not.
Robin is way out of my league.
I'm not smart, funny or handsome.
As you can plainly see,
there's nothing impressive
going on anywhere around here.
My only shot with a girl like Robin
is the element of surprise.
And, let's be honest,
a little pity.
It's shock and "aw".
- This doesn't really work.
- Two out of three times.
Guaranteed.
No way.
Two out of three times.
- He guaranteed it.
- Oh, come on.
There is no way
that's gonna work on Robin.
She's going to walk in there,
take one look at that idiot
- and send him packing.
- She might kick his ass first.
Yeah, she might get
her gun and shoot him.
Go, go!
My God!
It worked.
Mr. Wang's is back to business.
"The Naked Man" works!
This is gonna revolutionize
the one-night stand!
This is like the forward pass
in football.
The slam dunk in basketball.
The haircutting technique
where they hold it
between their fingers and cut right
above it. It's a total game changer!
Barney, this guy slept with Robin,
who you claim to be in love with.
How can you be excited about this?
"The Naked Man"
is bigger than me and Robin.
All these years,
I have been busting my hump,
with my secret identities
and my tricks and my gadgets.
I mean, I'm like Batman.
But this Mitch fellow,
he's Superman.
He rips off his clothes
and he's good to go.
What kind of gadgets
are we talking about?
This is what it's gonna be like,
us living together? I come home,
and guys you're dating are just gonna
be sitting on the couch, naked.
I wish I could say no.
I still cannot believe
the "Naked Man" worked on you.
What can I say?
Okay, I went in there,
and he was naked.
It was funny.
I laughed, he laughed.
And then it just kind of happened.
I don't know.
- I call "slut!"
- Slut?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, Robin, but you
hooking up with this guy
makes it seem like the only thing
standing between you and sex is clothes.
I didn't just sleep with
Mitch because he was naked.
- Then why did you sleep with him?
- Because...
He...
He... because I care about Mitch.
A lot.
There was a... connection
of specialness.
Specialness and feelings.
It was because he was naked.
And I'm sorry, but I don't approve.
There is only one reason
to sleep with somebody,
and that is "love."
Marshall's a big girl
because he believes in true love
and finished reading "The Notebook"
`cause the secretaries bullied him
into joining Oprah's Book Club.
But you know I'm right.
I love you, but there's
lots of reasons to have sex.
- Name one.
- I can name 50.
- No, you can't.
- Number one: last Thursday.
- Hey, Marshall, want to do it?
- I'm up.
You befouled our marital bed
because you couldn't get to sleep?
You're the one who said,
"That shadow on the ceiling
"looks like a scary toothless clown.
Good night, Lily."
Fine! That's one.
But I defy you to name...
I'm going to name 50.
There's "makeup" sex...
"breakup" sex,
and "your friend just told you
about a new-position" sex.
You're welcome.
There's also "revenge",
"rebound", "paratrooping."
When you go out of
town but instead of getting
a hotel room, you go straight
to a bar with the intention
of hooking up with a girl
so you have a place to stay.
- Oh, you mean "banging for roof".
- Slut!
I don't do it.
My college roommate did it.
No, Robin, I just have a bad cough.
I don't really have a bad cough.
We all know
"college roommate" means you, slut!
Does anyone have a lozenge?
I've got one.
"Nothing good on television" sex.
"Hotel room" sex.
"Curiosity",
as in...
"I've always wondered what it's like
to have sex with a really tall girl."
Not a big girl,
just a tall girl.
Like...
if a normal girl
were seven,
seven-and-a-half-feet tall
and... wore a denim miniskirt.
I would have to know
what that is like.
"He said he loved you, but you're not
ready to say it back yet" sex.
Forty-three.
"Wingman diving on
the friend grenade."
Forty-four.
- "The condoms are about to expire."
- Forty-five.
- This is getting a little hard.
- Forty-six!
Okay, four more to go.
"You dropped a Cheeto on his lap
and when you reached for it,
"he thought you were making a move,
so you just went with it."
Thank you for ruing the memory
of our six-month anniversary.
You got me Cheetos.
Look, can we just stop
with this stupid list?
- Okay, you guys are making me sad.
- No, I'm having fun.
Man, this whole "one-partner"
thing sucks sometimes.
I'm always talking about you.
I can't play "I never"
because then everyone would know
all the weird stuff I let you do to me.
The only weird thing
I ever did to you
was open up my heart and soul
when all I had to do
was strip naked
while you were out of the room.
I didn't sleep with Mitch
because he was naked!
Mitch and I have something special.
I mean, fingers crossed, guys.
He may be the one.
- The one?
- Mitch? The Naked Man?
You mean the naked genius.
All these years I've been suiting up
when I should have been suiting down.
That's it.
I am doing "The Naked Man" tonight.
- So are you.
- What?
With the elevator girl. You're going out
with her tonight, right? "Naked Man!"
Come on, this is the first girl
I've had the courage
to ask out since Stella.
"Naked Man"!
This is the eighth outfit
I tried on tonight!
I got my hair cut three times!
I'm a nervous wreck!
Are you wearing makeup?
It's not makeup!
Okay, it's a sunscreen
with a subtle tint of...
It's made for men.
Sue me, I want my eyes to pop.
"Naked Man"!
No, Barney, I like Vicky.
This could actually go somewhere.
I don't want to do anything
stupid to jeopardize it.
Well, I really like...
that girl, but...
I didn't see her from the back.
I really like...
that girl.
And I'm willing to jeopardize our
future together for one night of glory.
Naked Man!
<i>So, that night we all set
out to prove something.</i>
<i>Robin wanted to defend her honor.</i>
Mitch, hey, baby, it's me.
Do you want to grab
some dinner tonight?
Because you're basically
my boyfriend!
<i>Lily needed to prove
that she could finish her list.</i>
I'm stuck.
I can't think of the last two.
Reason number 48:
"To reinforce good behaviors
such as shaving and dental hygiene."
Now you're conditioning me? Great!
That explains why I always get
an erection when I floss.
<i>I had to prove that as scary
as it was to be dating again,</i>
<i>I was over Stella
and ready to get back out there.</i>
And Barney needed to prove that he, too,
could pull off "The Naked Man."
Thank you for letting me
look at your aquarium.
- You're a real life saver.
- Sure, no problem.
I just need to use the bathroom
and I'll be on my way.
Ted, I'm doing it.
I'm doing the "Naked Man"!
Me, too!
You...
I'm doing it!
I'm doing The Naked Man!
That's great!
What made you change your mind?
The date with Vicky started off okay,
but... it didn't go as well as I hoped.
Oh, my God!
Ted, you are so funny!
And can I just say,
you have amazing eyes.
What, these old things?
- Oh! Nice job, hot shot.
- I'm sorry.
Save it! Go tell the manager
he owes us an appetizer.
One of the ones with shrimp!
You're welcome.
You were saying?
And then his cane
missed the top step,
and he was falling, for,
I swear, like two minutes.
Oh, God, I love old people.
Once I realized there was
no possible future in this relationship,
- I just decided to go for it.
- Awesome! Okay, big question:
What pose will you display
your "Naked Man" in?
That is a big question.
I hadn't really thought about it.
I was thinking the "Superman".
What about the "Captain Morgan"?
How about the
"Oops, I didn't see you there"?
The Thinker?
What about the Heisman?
Mr. Clean?
The Burt Reynolds.
It's so great to see you again.
I really had a great time
last night.
So, what is it like
managing a C.P.K.?
I mean, who's idea was it
to put a pineapple in the...
Okay, stop right there.
I know what this is.
I've been on this date before.
This is the "I'm not a slut" date.
What? That's crazy.
Usually you read me so well,
but this time you're wrong.
Come on, Robin.
One of us had a good time last night,
and we both know it was me.
Oh, Mitchell... Something,
that is, that is just not true!
- Really? How was the sex?
- I didn't hate it.
Robin, you've seen my move.
That's it.
I have nothing else to offer you.
I'm broke, I sweat when I eat,
and I'm in, like,
5 different fantasy football leagues.
It's all I talk about.
Trust me,
you don't wanna be around that.
What? Yes, I do!
Look, I didn't just sleep
with you because you were naked.
Yeah, you did.
And now you're trying to pretend
it was something more
to make yourself feel better.
Say what you will,
at least "The Naked Man" is honest.
What about the ol'
"Coppertone Baby"?
The Olympic gymnast
who stuck the landing.
- Yeah, I got to go.
- Naked Man!
You have a really nice place!
Oh, thanks! Coming from you,
that's a real compliment.
I just love that you're an architect,
it's so fascinating.
I could listen to you talk
about structural design all night.
<i>And then I noticed,
lying on her end table,</i>
<i>a book of love poems
by Pablo Neruda.</i>
<i>The same edition
I'd had since college.</i>
<i>And it was bookmarked
to my favorite poem.</i>
<i>Maybe I was all wrong
about this girl.</i>
<i>Maybe there was a future for us.</i>
Crap!
Here we go.
Pablo Neruda.
Oh, yeah, that book's a turd.
Some douchey guy I hooked up
with left it here. It's all in Mexican.
You know who writes good poems?
Jewel. Her teeth are crooked
and she lived in a car.
So, she has stuff to write about.
"The Naked Man" works!
I just had decent sex
with an awful human being.
- I am back!
- Congratulations, buddy.
You're not the only one who
rocked "The Naked Man" tonight.
You just want to do it
to change the subject.
Hey, that's number 49!
Did it work?
It's like I just flossed.
I love you.
That's 50.
- Nice! What pose did you go with?
- I went with "I've got boobs".
And she nailed it.
Oh, my God! Guys, guys, guys!
This is him!
- This is "The Naked Man"!
- Ted, his name is Mitch.
And... he's my boyfriend. So...
It's okay, Robin.
I no longer call "slut".
- Okay. You can go. We're done.
- Thanks.
Hold on, Mitch, Mitch,
I have to thank you.
We all tried
"The Naked Man" tonight.
We should see how Barney did.
Hi, is... Is Barney there?
Oh, my God!
What's the matter with you?
- Get out!
- I have to grab my suit.
- It's very expensive. The tie alone...
- Get out of here right now!
- Get out, you sick son of a bitch!
- Call me.
And if I see him again,
I'm calling the cops.
Two out of three times.
I want you to know, this night,
crazy as it was,
- it got me out of my shell.
- That's the beauty of "The Naked Man".
It gives you exactly what you need.
No more,
no less.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to replace
one of my fantasy football
quarterbacks.
He separated his shoulder!
A toast...
to Mitch.
By the sum of his parts,
he is just a man.
What he does with those parts,
he becomes so much more.
<i>He may not fit society's
definition of a hero,</i>
<i>but he is the hero I needed.</i>
<i>The hero who helped me
recover from the disaster</i>
<i>of my failed almost-marriage
and get back into the game.</i>
<i>He lives in the shadows.
Is he a dream?</i>
<i>Truth? Fiction?</i>
<i>Damnation? Salvation?</i>
<i>He is all these things
and none of them.</i>
<i>For he is...</i>
<i>"The Naked Man".</i>
My God!
Oh, thank God.
<i>Pourquoi se bat-on ?</i>
<i>Quelle est cette chose
enfouie en nous </i>
<i>qui nous pousse ŗ rťgler
les dťsaccords avec nos poings ?</i>
<i>Quoi que ce soit,
c'est lŗ depuis le dťbut.</i>
ArrÍtez de vous battre !
Pourquoi ?
C'est stupide et puťril.
On a 6 ans.
On est stupides et puťrils.
<i>Les enfants, je me suis battu
une seule fois dans ma vie.</i>
<i>Et voilŗ comment c'est arrivť.</i>
<i>Vous savez que j'ai rťcemment ťtť
abandonnť devant l'autel.</i>
<i>Et le pire quand Áa nous arrive,</i>
<i>ŗ part le fait d'Ítre
abandonnť devant l'autel,</i>
<i>est ce qui arrive aprŤs.</i>
<i>Un flot constant, persistant
et insoutenable de pitiť.</i>
Vodka canneberge, gin tonic.
Scotch et soda.
Merci.
- Puis-je voir le menu ?
- Ted,
je vais te chercher un menu...
mais je te promets,
je reviendrai.
On va devoir aller ailleurs.
Dans ce bar, je serai toujours
le mec abandonnť devant l'autel.
C'est nul !
<i>Le bon temps</i>.
- On a perdu Barney.
- Quoi ?
Il y a une fille lŗ-bas
dans un pull moulant.
Il n'ťcoute pas un mot
de ce qu'on raconte. Hein, Barney ?
<i>Laissez-moi tranquille !</i>
Il a compris, il y a peu de temps,
qu'il pouvait tenir une conversation
juste avec les titres de sitcoms "noirs"
des annťes 70 et 80.
- <i>Que se passe-t-il ?</i>
- Barney,
tu veux monter et me faire des trucs
que Marshall ne fait pas ?
<i>Arnold et Willy.</i>
C'est quoi, Áa ?
<i>Je vous ai parlť de Doug,
les enfants ?</i>
<i>Non ? Eh bien...</i>
<i>Doug Martin ťtait barman
chez MacLaren.</i>
<i>Il ťtait toujours dans le coin.</i>
- Vous... connaissez Ted ?
- On joue pas au "Vous connaissez Ted".
Je suis mort ?
Je suis mort ?
Ce soir...
je me fais une lesbienne.
<i>Il y a 3 choses ŗ savoir sur Doug.</i>
<i>La premiŤre est que Doug
est un peu violent.</i>
... effondrť, donc il est ŗ terre.
Et on le frappe !
Il fait cette grimace, en tremblant.
Ce qu'on a fait,
c'est qu'on l'a laissť lŗ.
Je vous ressers ?
<i>La seconde est qu'il ťtait bizarre
ŗ propos de ses cheveux...</i>
- Quoi ?
- Quoi ?
Tu regardes mes cheveux ?
Non, monsieur. Pas du tout.
C'est un postiche.
C'est marrant ? Vous voulez
vous moquer†? C'est marrant ?
Pourquoi tu ne l'arraches pas ?
- Pardon ?
- Vas-y, arrache-le de ma tÍte.
Vas-y.
Tu veux pas l'arracher ? Allez.
Allez, vas-y et arrache-le.
Tu veux l'arracher de ma tÍte ?
Arrache mon postiche de ma tÍte.
Je vous aime bien, les gars !
<i>Mais la troisiŤme est qu'il ťtait
trŤs fidŤle avec ses habituťs.</i>
Les voilŗ !
Vous voulez votre table ?
- On sera bien par lŗ.
- Oui ? Oui ?
<i>Peut-Ítre un peu trop fidŤle.</i>
Non, Áa va, Áa va.
Les insťparables ! Mettons Áa ailleurs,
cette table est rťservťe.
On y va ! Maintenant ! Allez !
On se bouge, mon PŤre.
On y va.
OK, les gars, voilŗ !
<i>Donc, voilŗ Doug.</i>
- C'est quoi, Áa ?
- Des mecs sont assis ŗ notre table.
Mais tu sais, c'est bon.
Allons-y, je m'occupe de Áa.
Mince, il y va.
Mesdames, si vous voulez bien
rejoindre votre table.
Messieurs, j'ai besoin
de votre aide dehors.
Notre aide ?
On va aller dans l'allťe
et se battre avec ces mecs.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Synchro : ShalimarFox, Arrow
Adaptation : Venusia, thiste,
ZeK, tactactac
Relecture : mpm, Arrow
- Pardon, tu viens de dire...
- Ces mecs sont sans-gÍne.
Donc, on va dehors
et on leur rentre dedans, OK ?
«a va Ítre marrant !
Il veut qu'on se batte ?
Comme, avec nos mains et tout ?
Et les pieds peut-Ítre ?
Je ne connais pas les rŤgles.
Un combat.
- On doit y aller ?
- Non,
je ne me battrais que pour 3 choses,
la fermeture obstinťe
d'un soutien-gorge,
accusations de harcŤlement sexuel...
9 sur 9 !
et l'envie de vomir
quand je vois une personne portant
des chaussures marron
avec un costume noir.
Les bagarres, c'est pour les nuls.
On est des gens civilisťs,
les gens civilisťs se battent pas.
Sauf avec un sabre laser, mais Áa,
c'est pour dans 3 ŗ 5 ans...
- C'est pas vrai.
- Je suis sur les forums tous les jours.
Dans 3 ŗ 5 Thanksgivings,
je dťcouperai la dinde
avec mon sabre vert.
Non, je dis qu'il y a plein
de raisons lťgitimes de se battre,
c'est peut-Ítre pas beau, mais parfois,
tu dois faire ce que tu as ŗ faire.
Oui, j'oubliais.
Elle trouve les bagarres sexy.
Non, c'est faux !
J'adore !
J'ai une culture de hockeyeurs.
Si un type est bagarreur,
c'est plutŰt trŤs sexy.
Et les cicatrices, sťrieux !
Si un type en a une, il a une Robin.
Et s'il lui manque une dent,
Je perds ma culotte.
J'ai perdu ma dent de sagesse.
Sans chirurgie.
Anesthťsie locale.
Franchement, c'est rien.
On devrait y aller.
J'ai du mal ŗ croire
qu'on ait cette discussion.
Ted, t'as 30 ans, t'es trop vieux
pour agir comme Áa.
<i>J'avais 30 ans. Et sur ces 30 ans,
j'avais ťtť frappť une seule fois.</i>
Il y a une explication trŤs simp...
<i>Il y avait eu ce truc en colo.</i>
Aujourd'hui, on va tresser
des bracelets de l'amitiť.
<i>ņ la fac, j'avais ťtudiť le kung-fu.</i>
<i>Et puis, quelques autres trucs.</i>
<i>Pour la chŤvre, ce serait
quelques mois aprŤs.</i>
<i>L'idťe est
que je ne m'ťtais jamais battu.</i>
- J'y vais.
- Non !
…coute-moi, fais-moi confiance,
je me suis beaucoup battu.
Il n'y a aucune fiertť ŗ en tirer.
Avec qui tu t'es battu ?
Mes frŤres.
Ouais, c'ťtait sŻrement le chahut
dans la salle de jeu des Eriksen.
J'adore les chamailles entre frŤres !
- Voilŗ le monstre des guilis !
- Patrouille des cocos !
Attendez !
Pouce ! Pouce !
Pause cacao.
Pause cacao.
OK, c'est l'heure de la baston.
Ted, fais pas Áa, t'es un mec bien.
C'est ta plus grande qualitť.
Ah oui ?
Je crois me souvenir de ce mec bien
s'est fait plaquer par sa fiancťe
pour un prof de taekwondo.
«a peut paraÓtre fou, mais...
j'ai besoin de Áa. Je crois que c'est
une expťrience que je dois faire.
J'y vais.
Moi aussi !
Les gars...
regardez bien ce visage.
La prochaine fois que vous le verrez,
il sera dťfigurť de la faÁon
la plus sexy possible.
Parce que c'est ce que je suis :
un vrai mec.
J'aime me battre
et en dťcoudre dans la crasse.
Tu me trouves
un cintre en bois pour Áa ?
- Il s'est passť quoi ?
- Je sais, hein !
Qui ne lorgne plus
mon postiche maintenant ?
- Regardez ce qu'on leur a fait !
- "On" ?
Oui, "on".
Allez, on fait une super ťquipe.
Bien vu les gars !
On l'a fait !
Non, tu l'as fait.
On a rien fait, nous.
OK, oui, c'est clair,
j'ai tabassť trois types tout seul.
Toi et toi,
boissons gratuites ŗ vie.
- Il pense qu'on s'est battu avec lui.
- On s'est battu avec lui.
Alors, on va rentrer
et raconter ŗ tout le monde
la lťgendaire histoire
de comment on a tabassť des types.
Et tout le monde va trouver Áa gťnial
et tout le monde va recoucher avec moi.
Allez mec, personne ne va croire
qu'on s'est battu, regarde nous.
Oh, c'est bon...
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Ce que j'aurais dŻ faire y a un bail.
- Quoi ?
- Je sais pas, je me suis tapť l'oeil !
Je sais mÍme pas ce que je dis !
J'ai une super droite, d'ailleurs.
- T'es prÍt ?
- Pour rentrer ?
Non, pour Áa.
Tu m'as frappť dans le nez !
- Tu pleures ?
- Oui, je pleure !
Tu m'as frappť dans le nez !
«a va gonfler ŗ mort.
Tu vas ressembler ŗ Owen Wilson.
- Allez, on rentre.
- OK, mais on n'en rajoute pas trop.
Je veux pas
que Áa prenne des proportions.
Puis Ted arrive, enlŤve sa chaussure,
le frappe ŗ la bouche...
Ah, les voilŗ !
Les mecs qui m'ont soutenu !
Alors, vous vous Ítes battus.
Sťrieux.
Non, Barney nous a frappťs ŗ la tÍte
pour faire comme si.
Sans dec', Marshall !
Regarde-moi cet oeil.
T'as l'air d'un bad boy.
Je savais pas que t'avais Áa en moi.
Toi. Que t'avais Áa en toi.
Tu...
veux le toucher ?
Mon Dieu, c'est chaud !
Le pot de la victoire !
Gratos ! Gratos !
Gratos !
7 dollars 50.
- Pourquoi je dois payer ?
- Parce que tu ne m'as pas soutenu.
- Eux m'ont soutenu.
- Tu sais quoi, Doug ?
Je vais payer avec plaisir.
Et pourquoi ? Car les adultes le font.
Ils paient leur verre,
et ils se battent pas.
Vous savez ce que je faisais,
quand vous faisiez les gamins ?
- Voilŗ ce que je faisais.
- Tes ongles ?
- Je faisais...
- Le quiz de l'amour
- dans le dernier <i>Gala</i> ?
- Non. Je faisais...
De ton mieux pour pas pleurer
quand Big est venu pour Carrie
ŗ la fin du film <i>Sex and the City</i> ?
Tu spoiles ? Non.
Je vais vous dire ce que je faisais...
Des trucs au capitaine de l'ťquipe
de foot, car il t'a donnť sa bague
et t'ťtais si mignonne
dans ta robe de soirťe ?
Pardon.
Je les dťteste !
Ils se comportent comme les mecs
les plus virils de l'univers,
comme Crocodile Dundee
et David Hasselhoff.
C'est les mecs les plus virils
de l'univers ?
Je sais pas pourquoi on leur donne
toute cette attention. En fait,
- c'est moi, le vrai hťros.
- Ouais, c'est toi.
Je suis sťrieux, femme.
Remets Áa dans ta culotte.
T'es l'homme que chaque garÁon
devrait devenir
et que chaque fille devrait marier.
Tu sais quoi ?
J'ai deux garÁons en cours
qui n'arrÍtent pas de se battre.
Si tu viens ŗ l'ťcole demain
pour leur raconter ton histoire
du choix du chemin de la non-violence,
Áa pourrait les recadrer.
Et m'ťviter de me lever tŰt
pour prťparer les leÁons.
D'accord.
OK. Je les recadrerai.
Mauviette !
Quoi ? Non !
Le panda Mahatma et le koala Luther King
vous racontent
- cette histoire pour montrer...
- montrer que t'es une mauviette ?
Pourquoi tu les as pas tabassťs ?
T'avais peur ?
Quoi ?
J'avais pas peur !
- J'ai fait plein de bagarres, OK ?
- T'es gťant !
Tu dois peser presque 500 kilos.
D'abord,
je porte un pull large,
qui a des rayures horizontales.
Et j'ai aussi... J'ai mangť salť...
Donc je...
Tu sais quoi ? Ferme-la !
Mauviette ! Mauviette !
Donc,
vous les avez juste tabassťs ?
Juste ?
Amanda, ťtait-ce si simple ?
Tu sais,
le combat en corps ŗ corps,
c'est bien plus qu'utiliser
- la force contre son opposant, hein B ?
- Exactement !
C'est un art.
Le noble art, comme qui dirait.
Mais, je comprends pas,
ils ont fait quoi pour mťriter Áa ?
«a peut sembler insignifiant,
- mais ils se sont mis ŗ notre table.
- ņ notre table.
- Et personne...
- Personne.
ne s'assied ŗ notre table.
Vous allez les tabasser ?
On va les tabasser. Ted, viens.
Vous deux. Notre table.
Partez. Maintenant !
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Relax, on a Doug.
- Doug nous soutient.
- Il est pas lŗ, ce soir.
Je vous offre quoi ? Un verre ?
De l'argent ? Ces deux filles lŗ-bas ?
C'est toi, Ted Mosby ?
- Oui.
- Et tu es Barney Stinson ?
Ils savent qui on est.
C'est bon, les gars.
On vous laisse partir
sans vous botter le cul.
Cette fois.
D'accord ?
- C'est... c'est quoi ?
- Vous Ítes convoquťs.
Vous Ítes poursuivis pour agression.
Profitez-en.
C'ťtait pas loin.
Agression !
Ils nous poursuivent pour agression !
Quelle est la peine pour une agression ?
Je vais avoir une amende ?
Ramasser des dťchets sur l'autoroute ?
Parce que j'ai dťjŗ fait Áa.
Je sais pas.
<i>En fait, il savait bien qu'on risquait
qu'un petit travail d'intťrÍt gťnťral,</i>
<i>sŻrement aucune charge criminelle.</i>
<i>Mais il ťtait furieux contre nous.</i>
Vous pourriez passer
un bon moment en prison.
- La prison ?
- Je peux pas aller en prison !
Je pourrais lire un tas de livres,
ťcrire des nouvelles.
M'entraÓner tout le temps.
Sťrieux, si j'en sors pas
- vraiment baraquť...
- On ne peut pas aller en prison !
Ils se font crever
dans les couloirs !
Et les repas sont vraiment lourds.
Vous auriez dŻ y penser
avant de les tabasser.
Et si on l'a pas fait ?
- Pas quoi ?
- Tabassťs.
Et si Doug les avait tabassťs tout seul
et qu'on avait rien fait ?
Je le savais !
Vous avez mÍme pas donnť
un seul coup.
J'ai frappť Ted ainsi que moi,
donc...
Qui est la mauviette maintenant ?
Rťponse : vous.
Tu peux nous filer un coup de main ?
Tu connais le vieux dicton :
"Si tu ne peux assumer,
"ne fais pas semblant de l'avoir fait,
ne ris pas et refuse des verres gratos
"et dťfends pas ton ami,
qui, comme par hasard,
"a vťcu plein de bagarres
avec ses frŤres."
Tu dois nous aider, Marshall.
On est les Trois Mousquetaires !
Si je l‚che Ted,
j'ai combien de temps ?
Je te cherchais.
J'ai des billets pour le match
de hockey de ce soir. C'est bÍte.
Tu veux y aller ?
«a peut se finir tard,
on pourrait aller boire
un verre, aprŤs.
…coute Áa.
Tu sais, cette bagarre ?
Les gars faisaient semblant.
Oh, j'oubliais !
Ce soir, c'est pas possible.
Je peux pas aller au hockey,
ce soir, j'ai ce...
Cette...
Cette...
Bonne nouvelle, j'ai parlť aux gars.
- Quels gars ?
- Ceux que t'as pas battus.
Ils n'iront pas au procŤs.
- Avocat.
- Quoi ? Ils ont laissť tomber ?
Oui, je leur ai juste dit
que vous ťtiez des mauviettes.
«a nous a bien fait marrer.
Une bonne poilade, en fait.
J'ai dit que tu te faisais manucurer
tous les mois.
Semaines, Wolverine...
Certains font attention.
Et que tu jouais de la cithare
dans le club de danse
de la prť-Rťforme ŗ la fac.
Tu leur as au moins dit qu'on ťtait
un des meilleurs groupe de
musique mťdiťvale de l'acadťmie ?
Bien sŻr.
On ťtait tous d'accord sur le fait que
c'ťtait un mec qui les avait tabassťs
et que vous n'aviez
rien ŗ voir lŗ-dedans...
Attends, alors...
- ils attaquent Doug.
- Affirmatif.
Le furieux, l'irrationnel,
le violent Doug, qui sait maintenant,
qu'on l'a poussť sous un bus.
Ils ont quoi ?
- On peut t'expliquer...
- Expliquer quoi ?
Comment vous m'avez poignardť
dans le dos juste sous mes yeux ?
- Robin, j'ai peur.
- Ouais, Doug voit quelqu'un ?
Tu consultes ?
Tu devrais vraiment.
…coute, tu ne comprends pas,
tu as battu ces mecs
ŗ toi tout seul.
C'est vrai.
Ils ont rien ŗ voir lŗ-dedans.
Regarde-les.
C'est de la faute de Ted !
- Regarde-le.
- Oui, regarde-moi !
- Il tiendrait pas 5 minutes en combat.
- Je pourrais tenir au moins 5...
Il est mou comme un spaghetti.
Oui, des spaghettis
avec des boulettes... Mate Áa.
- Regarde !
- Non.
OK, peut-Ítre que c'ťtait...
que moi. En fait, c'est logique.
J'ai beaucoup de trous noirs.
Bref, je vous ai toujours soutenus.
J'en attendais autant de votre part.
Et vous avez fait quoi ?
Rien.
On peut pas compter sur vous.
Pas ťtonnant
que ta fiancťe t'ait larguť.
<i>Et la voilŗ, les enfants,
la seule bagarre que j'ai jamais eue.</i>
<i>Que puis-je en dire ?</i>
<i>Pour commencer,
un coup de poing au visage,</i>
<i>Áa fait mal...</i>
<i>trŤs mal.</i>
<i>Et qu'est-ce qui fait
encore plus mal ?</i>
<i>«a.</i>
<i>Tout ce dont je me souviens,
c'est le rťveil.</i>
OK, je suis chaud.
Allons-y.
Une bagarre n'ťtait pas
une si bonne idťe, en fait.
Et voilŗ mon histoire.
Et qu'as-tu appris ?
J'ai appris
que c'est pas bien de se battre
et faut jamais le faire.
Des questions ?
- Oý vous les trouvez ?
- Je sais !
Y avait une grosse vente
au marchť des mauviettes ?
Mauviette ! Mauviette !
<i>Je leur ai pas dit
ce qu'il s'ťtait vraiment passť.</i>
OK, je suis chaud.
Allons-y.
Que s'est-il passť ?
«a.
Merde !
<i>Apparemment, oncle Marshall
et ses frŤres</i>
<i>faisaient plus que se battre.</i>
Pause cacao !
Marshall a l'air en forme.
Il a perdu du poids ?
Salope, n'y pense mÍme pas.
<i>Les enfants, j'aimerais vous dire
que se battre, c'est mal</i>
<i>et qu'il faut pas le faire,
mais c'est inutile.</i>
<i>Alors, je vous dis ceci :</i>
<i>ne vous battez jamais
avec oncle Marshall.</i>
<i>C'est un gros tarť.</i>
C'est si bon d'Ítre chez soi.
Maman, Lily, bon boulot.
"Bonne viande, bonne bouffe,
bon Dieu, ŗ la bouffe." Non ?
OK, allons-y.
Mettez vos lunettes.
TrŤs bien, passez-moi les assiettes.
- Lily, viande blanche ou rouge ?
- Rouge !
Chťri, fais attention.
why do we fight?
what is that thing deep within each of us,
that compels us to settle this disagreements with our fists?
<i>Whatever it is,it's there</i> <i>right from the beginning.</i>
Okay,okay,okay.Stop fighting!
Why?
Because it's stupid  and juvenile.
We're six. We are stupid and juvenile.
<i>Kids,I've only been</i> <i>in one fight in my life.</i>
<i>And this is the story</i> <i>of how it happened.</i>
<i>Now,as you know,I recently</i> <i>had been left at the altar.</i>
<i>And the worst thing about</i> <i>getting left at e altar?</i>
<i>I mean,aside from actually</i> <i>getting left at the altar,</i>
<i>was what came next.</i>
<i>A steady unrelenting</i> <i>unbearable stream of pity.</i>
Vodka cranberry. Gin and tonic.
Scotch and soda.
Um,thank you.
Could I see a menu?
Ted,I'm going to go get you a menu...
but I promise you i will come back.
Okay,we have to start  going someplace else.
At this bar,I'm always going to be the guy who got left at the altar.
That sucks!
Good times.
Uh-oh. We lost Barney.
What do you mean?
There's a girl over there in a tight red sweater.
So he's not listening  to a word anyone's saying.
Right,Barney?
Give me a break!
See,he out a while back
he could fake an entire  conversation just by saying
titles of black sitcoms from the 70's and 80's.
What's happening?
Hey,Barney,
want to go upstairs  and do stuff to me
that I won't even let Marshall do?
Huh-- different strokes.
What the hell is this?!
<i>I've told you kids </i> <i>about Doug,right?</i>
<i>I haven't? Oh,well...</i>
<i>Doug Martin was a</i> <i>bartender at MacLaren's.</i>
<i>He was always</i> <i>kind of around.</i>
Have... you met Ted?
What? No,no,no. We're not  playing "Have you met Ted?"
Am I dead?
Am I dead?
Tonight...
I pick up a lesbian.
<i>Anyway，three things you</i> <i>need to know about Doug.</i>
<i>The first thing is that Doug</i>,  <i>had a bit of a violent streak.</i>
...just crumbled,so he's on the ground,right?
And we're just kicking him!
He's making that face,all shaking.
So,anyway,what we did was we left him there.
Top you off?
<i>The second thing is that</i> <i>he was weird about his hair.</i>
What?
What?
Are you looking at my hair?
Uh,no,sir. I-I was not.
It's a toupee.
Is that funny? You want to laugh it up?
Is it funny,guy? Is it?
I'll tell you what,why don't you,why don't you grab it?
-Excuse me? -Go ahead,grab it.
Grab it right off my head. Go ahead.
Huh,you don't want grab it? come on.
Come on,go ahead and grab it
Want to grab it off my head?
Grab my toupee right off my head.
I like you guys!
<i>But the third thing is that he</i> <i>was very loyal to his regulars.</i>
Hey-hey! There they are!
Hey,you guys want your booth?
Oh,no. We're fine over here.
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah.
<i>Maybe a little too loyal.</i>
Oh,no,it's fine,it's fine.
Okay,you two lovebirds!
Let's take this somewhere else, this booth's reserved.
Let's go! Now! Come on!
Let's see some hustle,Father.up you get.
Okay,guys, here we are
<i>So,that's Doug.</i>
What the hell is this?!
Oh,um,well,some guys are sitting in our booth.
But you know what? this is fine.
Let's go, i'll take care of it.
Oh,boy,there he goes.
Ladies,if you'll please adjourn to your usual booth.
Gentlemen,I will require your assistance outside.
Our assistance with what?
We're going to go out in the  alley and fight those guys.
What's happening now?
I'm sorry,did you just  say we were gonna...
Look,those guys are being inconsiderate,okay?
So we're going to go outside
and cave in their skulls,okay?
This will be fun!
He wants us to fight? like,with our hands and stuff?
And feet maybe? I don't know what the rules are.
wow,a fight.should we go out there?
Come on,Ted.
There's only three things you'll ever see me fight
the stubborn clasp of a bra,
Sexual harassment charges-- nine for nine--
And the urge to vomit when I see someone wearing
brown shoes with a black suit.
Marshall?
Dude,fighting is for losers
We're civilized guys.
Civilized guys don't fight.
Unless it's with lightsabers.
But that's l to five years away,so...
Well,that not true.
Robin,I'm on the forums every day.
Three to five Thanksgiving from now,
I'm going to be carving the turkey with Old Green.
No,I'm saying there are  plenty of legitimate reasons to get in a fight
It might not be pretty,but in certain situations,
you gotta do what you gotta do.
Right,I forgot.she thinks fighting's sexy.
No,I do not! a lot...
Look,I come from a culture of hockey players.
If a guy can throw down,it's somewhat way hot.
And scars,hello!
If a guy's got a scar, he's got a Robin.
And if he's missing teeth?  I'm missing my pants.
I'm missing my wisdom teeth.
Outpatient procedure.
Local anesthesia.
Whatever.It ain't a thing.
Look,maybe we should  go out there.
I can't believe we're even having this discussion.
Ted you're 30, you're too old to act like this.
I was 30 and in those 30 years  I'd been punched once.
There's a very simple explana...
There was that thing at camp.
Today we're going to braid friendship bracelets.
In college I studied some Kung Fu.
And well there  was some other stuff.
The thing with the goat wasn't for another few months.
The point is I had never been in a fight.
I'm going out there.
No!
Listen to me,please trust me
I've been in plenty of fights.
It's really nothing to be proud of.
Who did you get in a fight with?
My brothers.
Yes I'm sure that was quite a rumble
in the Eriksen rums room.
I love brotherly horseplay!
Here comes the tickle monster!
Noogie patrol!
Wait,wait,wait! Timesies! Timesies!
Cocoa break.
Oh,cocoa break.
Okay it's clobbering time.
Ted don't do this, you're a nice guy.
That's your best quality.
Is it?
'Cause I seem to remember this nice guy
getting dumped by his fiance for a Tae Kwon Do instructor.
Look this may sound crazy but I think I need to do this.
I-I think this is an experience I need to have.
I'm going.
Me too!
Guys...
take a good look at this face
because the next time you see it
it will be disfigured in the hottest possible way.
Because that's who I am, I'm a man.
I like to fight and mix it up and get all dirty.
Can you find a wood hanger for this?
Whoa, what happened here?
I know, right?
Who's not looking at my toupee now huh?!
Look what we did to these guys!
-"We?"  -Yeah  "we."
Come on, man. we're a good team.
Nice work boys! We did it!
No, no, no, you did it.
We didn't do anything.
Okay, yeah, yeah, sure. I just beat up three guys by myself.
You guys. That's good.
You and you--
free drinks for life.
He thinks we were in this fight with him.
We were, in this fight with him.
And now we are going to go in there and tell everyone
the legendary tale of how we beat up some guys.
And everyone is going to think it's great
and everyone is going to sleep with me again.
Dude come on,no one is gonna
believe we were in a fight-- look at us.
Oh that's a good...
What are you doing?!
What I should've done a long time ago.
What?
I don't know I just hit myself in the eye!
I don't even know what I'm saying
I throw an awesome right hook by the way.
Okay are you ready?
To go back in?
No,for this.
God! You just punched me in the nose!
Are you crying?
Yes I'm crying! You just punched me in the nose!
Oh that's going to swell up real good.
You're going to look like Owen Wilson.
Okay let's get back in there.
but just let's just play this down, okay?
I don't want this to turn into a big thing.
And Ted comes and takes his shoe off!
Hits him in the mouth...
Hey there they are! The guys that got my back!
You two got in a fight.
Really?
Uh, no, Barney punched me and himself in the face
to make it look like we got in a fight.
Come on, Marshall!
Wow look at your eye. you look like a badass.
I'm surprised to see you had it in me.
You. Had it in you.
Do you... want to touch it?
Oh my God, it's warm!
Hey! Victory drinks!  Huh?
Free! Free! Free! Free!
$7.50.
Why do I have to pay?
'Cause you don't got my back.
These guys got my back.
You know what Doug? I will gladly pay.
And you know why? Because that's what grownups do.
They pay for their drinks and they don't get into fights.
You know what I was doing while you guys
were out there being immature?
I'll tell you what I was doing.
Your nails?
No. I was doing...
The relationship quiz in this month's Cosmo?
No. I was doing...
Your best not to cry when Big came back for Carrie
at the end of the  Sex and the City movie?
No. Spoilers much? No.
I'll tell you what I was doing--
The captain of the football team
Because he gave you his promise ring and you
looking so pretty in your open back homecoming dress?
Sorry.
I hate those guys!
Acting like they're the manliest guys in the universe
like they're Crocodile Dundee and David Hasselhoff.
Those are the manliest guys in the universe?
I don't understand why they're getting all this attention.
I mean I'm threal hero here.
yeah, you are.
I'm serious woman.Put it back in your pants.
Marshall u're the man every  boy should grow up to become
and every girl should marry.
You know what?
I have two kids in my class who won't stop fighting.
If you come to school tomorrow and tell them your story
of choosing the path of nonviolence
it might really set them straight.
And save me having to get up early to make a lesson plan.
All right.
Okay. I'll set them straight.
You're a wuss.
What? No!
Mahatma Panda and Martin Luther Koala are telling you kids
this story to illustrate...
To illustrate that you're a wuss?
Why didn't you just fight those guys?
Were you scared?
What?
No! I wasn't scared!
I've been in plenty of fights okay?
You're huge! You must weigh like a thousand pounds.
Okay. First of all, I'm wearing a baggy sweater
and it has horizontal stripes.
And I also-- and I had a salty lunch...
And so I'm retain...You know what? Shut up!
Wuss! Wuss! Wuss!
Wuss! Wuss! Wuss!
Wow. So you just beat those guys up?
Just?
Oh, Amanda were it so simple.
You see, hand to hand combat is about so much more than just
administering brute force on your opponent, right B?
You know it!
It's a science.
The sweet science as it were.
Wait. I'm confused what did those guys do to deserve it?
Well. this may sound petty
-but they sat in our booth. -They sat in our booth.
- And nobody...   - Nobody.
sits in our booth.
Are you going to beat those guys up?
Yes ,we are going to beat those guys up.
Ted, come on.
You two.
Our booth.
Get out. Now!
-What are you doing? -Relax. we got Doug.
Big Doug's got our backs.
Yeah. But Doug's not here tonight
Can I get you guys something?
Drinks? Cash? Those two girls over there?
Are you Ted Mosby?
um,yeah,I am.
And u're Barney Stinson?
They've heard of us.
It's cool,guys.
I let you leave with your asses unkicked.
This time.
What's, uh, what's this?
You've been served.
You're being sued for assault.
Enjoy your booth.
That was close.
Assault!
They're suing us for assault!
Okay well. What's the penalty for assault?
What do I have to pay a fine?
Pick up trash on the highway?
'Cause I've done that before know what I mean?
I don't know.
Actually he did know that the worst we we looking at
was a small civil settlement
and probably no criminal charges.
But he was really pissed at us.
I mean you guys could be looking at
some serious prison time.
-Prison?! -I can't go to prison!
I mean I could get a lot of reading done
finally write some short stories.
Work out all the time.
Seriously if I don't come out of there completely ripped--
Ted, we can't go to prison!
People get shivved in the joint!
Plus the meals are really starchy.
Well,you guys should have thought of that
before you beat up those guys.
What if we didn't?
Didn't what, Ted?
Didn't beat up those guys .
What if Doug beat up those guys all by himself
and we didn't do anything?
I knew it! I knew it!  I knew it! I knew it!
You guys didn't throw a single punch.
Well. I hit Ted and myself so...
Well, who's the wuss now?
Answer: You guys.
Look, can you just help us get out of this?
You know the old expression:
If you're not prepared to do the time
don't pretend to do the crime
and laugh and get free drinks
and not stand up for your friend
who incidentally,has been in plenty of fights with his brothers.
Look you've got to help us out. Marshall.
We're the Three Musketeers!
If I give up Ted, how much time am I looking at?
Hey guys!
Barney, I've been looking for you.
I got, uh, tickets to this hockey game tonight.
It's stupid. You want to go?
It might go kind of late
so maybe after the game we can grab a drink.
Oh, hey, Robin. get this.
You know that fight?
These guys faked the whole thing.
Oh, I forgot! Tonight is no good.
I,uh, I can't go to that hockey game tonight. I got that  uh...
That uh... that uh...
That uh...
That uh...
That uh...
Good news..I talked to the guys.
-What guys? -The guys you didn't beat up.
They agreed to drop the lawsuit.
Boom! Lawyered.
What? They agreed to drop it?
Yeah. I just explained that you two are wusses.
We had a good laugh about that.
A good long laugh actually.
I explained how you get a mani/pedi once a month.
Weekly Wolverine-- some of us care.
And how you played the hammer dulcimer
in the Pre-Reformation Dance Society at Wesleyan.
Did you at least tell them we were one of
the premier Medieval chamber groups in the Little Ivies?
Oh, I did.
And we all agreed it was much more likely that
one guy beat up the three of them
than that you two had anything to do with it so...
Wait so... so now they're only suing Doug.
Affirmative.
Angry, irrational, violent Doug
who now knows we were the ones who threw him under the bus.
They what?!
Look, Doug we can explain...
Explain what?
Explain how you stabbed me in the back right to my face?
Robin,i'm scared.
Yeah,is Doug seeing anyone?
Are you seeing anyone? you really should.
Doug, look,you don't understand
you beat up those guys all by yourself.
It's true,all right?
They had nothing to do with it.
I mean,look at these two.
It was all Ted!
Look at this guy.
Yeah,look at me!
He wouldn't last five minutes in a fight.
Well,I think I could  last at least five
He's got the muscle definition of linguini.
Yeah  linguini with meatballs maybe, check it.
-Ted, Ted, don't. -Look!
Okay,you know what?
maybe it was just me.
Actually,you know what that makes a lot of sense.
I tend to black out a lot.
Anyway,look,i always got your back.
All I ask in return is that you got mine.
But you know what? you don't.
You can't be counted on.
No wonder your fiance left you.
And here it is,kids
the only fight I've ever been in.
So what can I share about the experience?
Well,for starters,when you punch someone in the face,
it hurts your hand...
a lot.
But what hurts even more than that?
This.
And the next thing i remember was waking up.
Okay,i'm all warmed up.
Let's do this thing.
Turns out getting in a fight was a terrible idea.
And that's my story.
And what did you learn?
Well,i learned that fighting is bad
and you shouldn't do it ever.
Any questions?
Yeah,where do you find these people?
I know! Was there a big sale at the wuss market?
Wuss! Wuss! Wuss!
Of course,I didn't tell those kids what really happened.
Okay,I'm all warmed up.
Let's do this thing.
What happened?
This happened.
Holy crap!
Yeah,turns out Uncle Marshall and his brothers
did a little more than just roughhouse.
Cocoa break!
Marshall looks good.
Has he lost weight?
Bitch,don't even.
Kids,I'd love to leave you with the message
that figing is bad and you shouldn't do it
but I know that's pointless.
So i'll leave you with this
don't ever get in a fight with Uncle Marshall.
That guy's freaking crazy.
It is so good to be home.
Mom,Lily,fantastic job.
"Good food ,good meat,good God ,let's eat." Right?
Okay,here we go.
Goggles on.
All right,so you guys pass the plates.
Lily,you want white or dark meat?
Dark! Honey,please be careful.


- Salut !
- Salut.
Il gèle dehors. Où est ta veste ?
Je suis canadienne. Pas besoin de veste.
Ce genre de temps me fait pas peur.
On dirait un jour de printemps
dans le Minnesota,
s'il n'y avait pas tous ces taxis,
ces grattes-ciel et ces Noirs.
- Il y a pas de Noirs ?
- Pas si Prince est en tournée.

L'avion de ma soeur est arrivé
il y a une heure,
ou comme dirait un météorologiste,
l'ouragan Heather entre sur les terres.
Allez. Elle est pas comme ça.
Voilà l'historique de Heater.
Elle a mis six ans
et fait trois lycées pour avoir son bac.
Elle en a profité
pour ruiner deux voitures,
être mariée pendant 5 jours,
et a vécu 9 semaines dans un arbre
pour s'apercevoir
que personne n'avait l'intention
de l'abattre.
Et là, Heather dit
qu'elle déménage à New York.
- Grande nouvelle.
- Elle s'en sortira pas.
Souvenez-vous
quand elle parlait d'aller en fac ici ?
Et puis, le jour des admissions...
Où sont ma télé et mon canapé ?
Je les ai vendus pour des places
du concert de Nine Inch Nails.
Rien que la télé vaut 2 000 balles.
Un vol de dernière minute
coûte cher.
- Attends. T'es où ?
- Quelque part en Espagne.
J'y vais. Chanson calme.
Merde.
- C'est Barney.
- Et ?
Depuis le temps que Heather
passe à New York,
- Ted a jamais laissé Barney la voir.
- Je le ferai jamais.
Tous les ans, quand la carte de voeux
des Mosby arrive...
<i>Baisse ton pantalon</i>
<i>Arrache le mien</i>
<i>Sous le bouquet de gui</i>
<i>Je vais faire gémir ta soeur</i>
<i>Oh ! Chère Heather, chère Heather,
on va le faire dans tous les sens...</i>
<i>Si je pouvais la voir à poil</i>
<i>Si je pouvais la voir à poil</i>
<i>Si je pouvais la voir à poil.
Et à quatre pattes</i>
<i>Ted a une petite soeur
Qui est plus coquine chaque jour</i>
<i>Et si je la rencontre
Avec ses seins, je vais jouer !</i>
<i>P'tite soeur, p'tite soeur !</i>
Quoi ?
Je peux aussi fêter Hanoukka.
C'est encore lui.
Je devrais répondre.
- Salut, Barney.
<i>- Salut. Tu fais quoi ce soir ?</i>
On va chez Marshall et Lily
se faire une intégrale Kathy Bates,
sauf Misery. Tu veux venir ?
Il a raccroché.
Ça fait plaisir de te voir.
Salut gamine. Ça a l'air d'aller.
Comment ça va à la maison ?
J'ai pris ta chambre.
Tu savais qu'on voit la chambre
de Mlle Gottwald d'en face ?
Je suis au courant.
Elle a l'air bien ?
- Ted, elle a 62 ans.
- Réponds.
Incroyablement gaie.
Mec, il caille dehors.
Pourquoi, bonjour.
Je vous attendais.
Une seconde.
C'est pas notre fauteuil.
Tu l'as apporté toi-même ?
Il m'en fallait un qui tourne.
Comment tu savais
que Heather arrivait ?
Ne me dis jamais rien !
Tu sais que je peux pas garder
des secrets si près de Noël !
Robin t'offre un iPod !
Je peux te parler
une seconde dans la cuisine ?
Touchez pas au fauteuil.
Je le loue.
Je peux pas croire que tu m'aies
caché ta soeur toutes ces années.
Vraiment ?
T'es comme "Weird Al" Yankovic
qui écrirait que des chansons
sur comment sauter ma soeur.
D'abord, je suis flatté.
Ensuite, C'est juste des blagues.
Un ami peut blaguer
sur la soeur d'un ami.
Ça veut pas dire que je vais agir.
J'aime ma soeur,
et en tant que grand frère,
c'est à moi de la protéger
des gars comme toi.
- Tu me fais pas confiance ?
- Non. Et à elle non plus.
D'accord.
Très bien.
Je vais me contenter de...
prendre mon fauteuil et partir.
Attends... Reste... Reviens...
Lily et moi, on sort manger
avec Heather dimanche. Tu veux venir ?
J'ai déjà appelé
pour ajouter une personne.
- Tu peux vraiment rien dire à Lily.
- Non, vraiment rien...
<i>Cette année-là, le Canada manquait
vraiment à tante Robin,</i>
<i>donc Marshall l'a amenée
là où il allait</i>
<i>quand il était nostalgique
du Minnesota :</i>
<i>Le bar de la Perche.</i>
Bonsoir tout le monde.
- Marshall !
- Voici Robin.
- Retournez boire.
- Boire !
- Comment tu vas, Marshall ?
- Et toi ? Hé, mec !
- Tu t'es fait quoi, à la jambe ?
- Je jouais au hockey, aujourd'hui.
- Je me suis fait mal au genou.
- T'es allé à l'hôpital ?
J'ai versé de la bière dessus.
Je rate pas le match des Vikings.
Minnesota !
J'adore les mecs, ici.
C'est des vrais mecs.
Sans shampooing ou manucure.
Les mecs de New York sont 10 % nana.
Allez. T'es injuste.
Je vais prendre la <i>vichyssoise</i>
avec un <i>soupçon</i> de <i>crème fraîche</i>.
Les produits laitiers me ballonnent.
Donc... j'ai trouvé
un appart, aujourd'hui.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Et j'espérais que tu aurais
bu un peu plus de vin
avant de te demander ça, mais...
j'ai besoin que tu cosignes le bail.
Laisse-moi réfléchir.
Ça, ça veut dire qu'il le fera pas.
J'ai vraiment besoin de ton aide.
On en reparle plus tard, OK ?
Te fais pas d'illusions.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Tu me fais pas confiance ?
- T'es ma soeur.
Là, il dit juste une évidence.
Écoute, Ted,
j'aimerais me lancer
dans la finance, mais...
tu me vois comme si j'avais
quatre ans et que je voulais
devenir astronaute.
Je crois juste que tu n'as aucune idée
de la difficulté de réussir à New York.
Exactement.
T'as besoin de relations.
Si seulement Ted connaissait
quelqu'un qui bosse à, disons...
la Goliath National Bank,
alors... attends.
Quoi ?
Je bosse
pour la Goliath National Bank.
Incroyable !
D'accord.
Ça fait deux bières Bemidji et...
qui a commandé les mini-burgers ?
Mon Dieu !
C'est <i>Fisherman's Quest</i> ?
Je jouais tout le temps
à FQ à l'époque !
Ah, ouais ?
J'ai le meilleur score.
Sans me vanter, j'ai attrapé...
un brochet de presque 1 m.
Le plus gros poisson virtuel
que personne n'ait jamais pris.
Enfin... en eau douce.
Je te tire mon chapeau de pêcheur.
Merci de m'avoir amenée ici.
C'est les miens.
C'est pas une bonne idée.
Heather et Barney
seuls dans son bureau ?
Et j'ai pas envie
d'être garant pour son bail.
Elle mûrit, seulement,
tu le vois pas encore.
On parle d'une fille qui s'est fait
prendre pour vol, il y a huit mois.
Ted, beaucoup de femmes
ont une période cleptomane.
Et oui, peut-être que parfois,
il leur arrive de faucher
un petit objet parce que ça les excite
d'une façon étrange
qu'elles ne s'expliquent pas.
Mais...
Si ça te rassure,
je les accompagnerai à GNB, demain.
Je dirai que je vais déjeuner
avec Marshall,
mais en fait, je les espionnerai.
Ça me va.
Bonne chance demain à la GNB.
- Je suis sûr que tu les épateras.
- Et je vous espionnerai.
Et merde !
"Je bois jusqu'à oublier
le championnat NFC 1999" ?
Ce match.
Les Vikings étaient à 2 minutes
d'aller au Super Bowl,
quand notre buteur, qui n'avait rien
loupé de l'année a foiré une pénalité,
et on a perdu en prolongations.
Putain !
- Match de championnat NFC 99 ?
- Oui.
Putain !
Mon père, que j'avais jamais vu pleurer
de ma vie, a essuyé une larme.
Il a dit...
"Une petite part de moi
vient de mourir, fiston."
J'adore la passion
que vous avez pour vos Vikings.
C'est comme quand on regarde
le hockey au Canada...
- Quoi ?
- Ne laisse
personne ici savoir
que t'es pas du Minnesota.
Pourquoi ? Ils vont faire quoi
s'ils apprennent que je suis...
Ça a l'air d'un bar de Dallas, mec ?
C'est bizarre, mais y a un côté
réconfortant à être porté comme ça.
Mec, t'as vu ce type !
Alors, Robin, tu viens d'où ?
Bemidji.
Bemidji, Minnesota.
Allez les Vikes !
<i>Les enfants, pour la suite,
je vais sauter quelques jours.</i>
Très sympa, cette mallette.
Très sympa,
la caméra de sécurité, aussi.
Et y en a une autre.
Et un vigile.
- J'ai l'intention de la payer, Ted.
- Oui. T'as pas encore le job.
Faut pousser la porte, pas la tirer.
Et voilà.
Merci de l'avoir surveillée hier.
Peut-être que j'ai eu tort.
Elle semble avoir su gérer Barney.
- Elle saura peut-être gérer New York.
- Pas de quoi !
- Pourquoi ?
- J'ai un secret.
Non ! Il s'est rien passé.
Il s'est passé un truc.
- Il s'est passé quoi ?
- Rien.
Après l'entretien d'Heather,
je suis passée voir Marshall un moment,
quand je suis revenue...
Mon Dieu !
Avant de dire ou faire un truc,
accorde-moi une faveur.
- Quoi ?
- Bouge de là. C'est une Prada.
Je suis vraiment désolée.
Je le savais.
Je l'ai toujours su.
Elle est restée la même
traînée irresponsable.
- et quand je verrai Barney...
- Tu ne diras rien.
Ted, Heather m'a suppliée
de ne rien te dire.
Elle me détestera
si elle sait que j'ai cafardé.
J'adore cette mallette,
mais j'ai pas les moyens.
Tu avais raison, Ted.
- Et comment !
- Tu vois ?
Elle a pas acheté la mallette !
C'est responsable !
Et aucune chance qu'elle ait couché
avec quelqu'un ici.
Elle tourne la page.
Bonsoir à tous !
Donc mon père et moi étions
au match de championnat NFC de 99.
J'ai dit, bonsoir tout le monde !
Et quand on a raté
cette pénalité et perdu...
Putain !
Putain ! Putain.
... mon père,
que je n'avais jamais vu pleurer
de toute ma vie,
a essuyé une larme et a dit,
"Une petite part de moi
vient de mourir, fiston".
"Fiston" ?
C'est comme ça
que je le dirai à mon fils.
Si j'ai la chance d'avoir un fils,
que j'appellerai
Rashad Tarkenton.
- Belle histoire.
- Belle histoire !
Mais ça semble un peu familier.
Je sais !
Ils ont tout gobé.
Je vois ce que tu fais.
- Quoi ?
- Je t'ai amenée ici parce que...
j'étais désolé pour toi.
Et là, on dirait
que t'essaies de voler mon bar.
Tu crois que j'essaye
de voler ton bar ?
Hostie.
"Hostie" ? T'es Canadienne ?
- Non, je...
- Si tu veux imiter un Canadien,
éteins juste la lumière
et fais comme si t'avais peur !
- C'était quoi, ça ?
- Avec le Canada tout proche,
dans le Minnesota, on aime bien
faire des blagues sur votre dos
et elles sont souvent
sur le même thème.
- Comme la peur du noir ?
- Oui. Par exemple,
tout le monde, combien de Canadiens
faut-il pour changer une ampoule ?
"Quoi ? Non, l'ampoule est morte ?
J'ai peur !"
C'est débile. Pourquoi pensez-vous
que les Canadiens ont peur du noir ?
D'où viennent les préjugés ?
Un stéréotype apparaît,
et d'un coup, il se propage
comme le feu.
Les Asiatiques conduisent mal,
les Écossais sont radins,
les Brésiliens
mettent trop de timbres.
Je doute que ça marche.
Tu peux pas traîner avec des gens
qui rabaissent ta chère patrie.
Je te raccompagne.
Non, attends.
J'ai quelque chose à dire.
Tout le monde.
Laissez-moi vous dire
un truc sur les Canadiens.
S'il te plaît, pas de scène.
Pourquoi les Canadiens
ne font pas de voeux d'anniversaire ?
Parce qu'ils ont trop peur
d'éteindre les bougies.
Mon Dieu, j'aime cet endroit !
Je crois que tes perspectives
à la GNB sont bonnes.
Tu m'as montré que tu peux
prendre n'importe quelle position.
- C'est des nouveaux dessous de verres ?
- J'espère que t'auras le boulot.
Rien ne me fait plus plaisir
que de combler une ouverture.
Je te jure, ces dessous de verres
sont plus épais.
- Je suis prête à me plier en quatre.
- OK, ça suffit !
Je peux pas croire
que t'aies couché avec ma soeur !
- T'as cafardé ?
- Vous savez quoi ?
C'est un nouveau lot
des anciens dessous de verres.
- Je vais confirmer avec le barman.
- Et toi,
t'es adulte et responsable ?
C'est adulte et responsable
d'aller à ton premier entretien
à New York et te taper un inconnu ?
T'as toujours été immature
et irresponsable. Tu seras toujours
immature et irresponsable.
Et je cosignerai pas un abonnement
avec toi, encore moins un bail.
- Barney et moi, on n'a rien fait.
- Arrête. Lily vous a vus.
Ah oui ?
<i>Tu vois, Ted, tu as si peu de foi
en Heather et moi...</i>
<i>... Qu'on a décidé de te montrer
ce que tu attendais de nous.</i>
<i>Et comme on peut compter
sur Lily pour cafarder.</i>
Mon Dieu !
- Quoi ? Pourquoi faire ça ?
- Parce que tu le mérites.
Ted, tu sais, je suis pas un saint.
Et oui, c'est vrai que la fois
où j'ai conduit ta mère à l'aéroport,
disons qu'il y a eu un...
moment sexuellement troublant
et confus dans le parking,
mais j'ai dit
que je draguerai pas ta soeur,
et je le pensais.
Tu aurais dû me croire.
Tu es si convaincu que je suis encore
une ado incontrôlable,
que tu as oublié le fait
que j'ai grandi.
Je vais trouver un hôtel.
Je prendrai mes affaires plus tard.
Joyeux Noël.
Ta mère et moi, on s'est embrassés.
Continue. T'as 5 secondes
pour attraper encore 2 esturgeons.
On va peut-être voir
l'écran des branchies.
Tu peux pas attraper
deux poissons avec un hameçon.
Non,
mais je peux attraper un poisson
et utiliser celui-là
pour attraper l'autre.
Meilleur score !
T'as battu Marshall !
Elle est canadienne !
Robin est canadienne !
Elle est canadienne.
Elle vient pas de Bemidji
et elle sait que dalle sur les Vikings.
T'es en colère
parce qu'elle t'a battu.
Pendant le championnat NFC 1999,
- quand les Vikings ont perdu...
- Putain !
Putain !
... qui était le buteur
qui a raté la pénalité ?
Rashad Tarkenton.
Gary Anderson.
Il est retraité.
Il a une affaire de pêche à la mouche...
au Canada.
Au revoir.
Vous savez quoi ?
Je suis contente que vous le sachiez
parce que je suis fière
d'être canadienne.
On a pas une bonne équipe NFL
ou Prince,
mais on a inventé
le <i>Trivial Pursuit</i>.
De rien, la Terre !
En plus, au Canada, on peut aller
dans un club de strip intégral
et commander de l'alcool.
Et ouais.
De Moosejaw à la baie de Fundy,
tu peux siffler
ton demi-litre de Pilsner
en matant une fille de mineur
se foutre à poil.
Jaloux ?
Au Canada, les gens se fichent
d'où vous venez,
tant que vous êtes sympa
et filez éventuellement une clope,
ou alors un donut.
Je suis fière de venir
du "Grand Nord blanc"...
et j'aimerais y être en ce moment.
Et on a pas peur du noir.
Enfin, on aime pas trop,
mais comme tout le monde.
Joyeux Noël.
Regarde dedans.
Si tu pousses autour du...
Pas en bas, au milieu.
- J'ai pas besoin de toi.
- Pigé.
T'as signé le bail.
Tu sais pourquoi ?
Parce tu me fais confiance
et que c'est une bonne idée ?
Je veux apprendre à te connaître.
La nouvelle toi.
Merci.
Au fait, dans ton nouveau quartier,
tu devrais mettre
un bon verrou à ta porte.
Si tu veux...
vivre.
Désolé de ce qui s'est passé dedans.
J'ai été con.
- J'aurais dû rien dire.
- Je suis désolée.
C'était ton repaire.
J'aurais pas dû me l'approprier.
Mais tous les ans, pendant les vacances,
j'ai le mal du pays.
Et jusqu'ici, chaque année,
j'avais une raison de rester :
un petit ami, un boulot,
ou un truc.
Mais... cette année,
pour la première fois, j'ai rien.
Mais si.
Quoi ?
On t'aime tous.
Si jamais tu repars au Canada,
on saute dans un avion,
on te poursuit,
et après que Barney nous ait traînés
dans quelques-uns
des clubs dont tu nous as parlés,
on te ramènera ici,
là où tu es censée être.
C'est pas New York
sans Robin Scherbatsky.
- Merci.
- Ouais.
Ça me manque parfois.
J'aimerais pouvoir fermer les yeux
et me retrouver une heure au Canada.
J'espérais que tu dises ça.
Comment tu as trouvé cet endroit ?
- Comme chez soi, hein ?
- Il y a qu'un moyen de le savoir.
Désolé.
Je vous avais pas vue. Ça va ?
- Ça va.
- OK, j'm'excuse.
Prenez un donut, c'est cadeau.
- Merci.
- OK.
Tu lui rentres dedans, il s'excuse
et te file un donut gratos ?
C'est comme à la maison.
Désolé !
Tout va bien !
Désolé.
Personne n'aime le noir.
<i>Le suivant qui vient de l'Ontario :
Marshall Ericksen.</i>
Tu t'es inscrit ?
Tu chantes quoi ?
Je pense que tu reconnaîtras.
<i>Je vais balancer
ton corps de toute façon</i>
<i>Je vais balancer ton corps
jusqu'au Canada Day !</i>
Mec, tu peux couper l'écran.
On connaît les paroles.
<i>Tout le monde vient jouer</i>
<i>Jetez tous vos soucis</i>
<i>Allons au centre commercial</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui <i>
Hey, guys. Hey.
It's freezing out there. Where's your coat?
Ted, I'm canadian. I don't need a coat.
This kind of weather is nothing for me.
Yeah. This is like a spring day back in minnesota,
If it weren't for all the taxis
And the skyscrapers and non-white people.
There aren't any black people in minnesota?
Not if prince is on tour.
Well, my sister's plane got in an hour ago,
Or as a meteorologist might say,
Hurricane heather has just made landfall.
Come on. She's not that bad.
Here's the back of heather's baseball card.
It took her six years
To graduate from three different colleges,
During which time she wrecked two cars,
Got married for five days,
And lived in a tree for nine weeks,
Only to realize that no one had any intention
Of cutting it down.
And now, heather says
She's moving to new york.
Wow, that's big news.
She's never gonna go through with it.
Remember a few years back when she talked about transferring
To nyu? And then,
On the day of the admissions interview...
Heather?
Where's my couch and my tv?
I sold them
For nine inch nails tickets.
The tv alone is worth two grand.
Well, a last-minute plane ticket is expensive.
Wait. Where are you?
Somewhere in spain.
Oh! Gotta go. Slow song.
Oh, crap.
It's barney.
So?
For all the years heather's been visiting new york,
Ted's never let barney meet her.
And I never will.
Every year when the mosby family christmas card shows up...
Pulling down her pants
Yanking off my own
Underneath the mistletoe
I'll make your sister moan
Oh! Heather's hot, Heather's hot
And we'll go all the way...
I wish I could see her naked
I wish I could see her naked
I wish I could see her naked
And down on all fours.
Ted has a little sister
Gets hotter every day
And if I ever meet her with her boobies I will play!
Everybody! Sister, sister, sister!
What? I can celebrate hanukkah, too.
Oh, it's him again.
I should probably get it.
Hey, barney.
Hey. What's on tap for tonight?
Oh, we're heading over to marshall and lily's
For a kathy bates movie marathon,
But not misery.
You wanna join us...?
Oh. He hung up.
Hey. Oh, it's great to see you.
Hey, kiddo. You look great.
How are things back home?
Well, I moved into your old room.
Did you know that you can see
Strange mrs. Gottwald's bedroom across the street?
Oh, yes.
I am aware of that.
How's she looking?
Ted, she's 62.
Answer the question.
Surprisingly perky.
Man, it is cold out there.
Why, hello.
I've been waiting for you.
Wait a second. That's not our chair.
Did you bring that chair yourself?
I needed one that swivels.
Heather mosby...
Barney. Stinson.
Um... How did you even know heather was coming into town?
Never tell me anything!
You know I can't keep secrets around christmas!
Robin's giving you an ipod!
Ted, can I chat with you
For a sec in the kitchen?
No one touch the chair. It's a rental.
I can't believe you've been
Hiding your sister from me all these years.
Do you blame me?
You're like weird al yankovic
If he only wrote christmas songs about banging my sister.
Okay. First of all, I'm flattered.
Secondly, they're just jokes.
A bro can joke about another bro's sister.
It doesn't mean I'm ever gonna act on it.
Look, I love my sister, and as her older brother,
It's my job to protect her from guys like you.
You don't trust me, do you?
No. And I don't trust her either.
Fine. Great.
I guess I'll just... Take my chair and go.
Wait... Stop... Come back...
Lily and I are taking heather out for dinner on sunday.
Do you wanna come?
I already called hurley's and added a fourth.
You really can't tell lily anything.
No, you can't tell her... Jeez.
That year, the holidays
Were really making aunt robin miss canada,
So marshall brought her to the spot he went
Whenever he got homesick
The walleye saloon.
Evening, everybody.
Marshall!
Meet robin.
Robin!
Go back to drinking.
Drinking!
What's up, marshall?
Hey, what's u...? Whoa! Bud!
What's with the hitch in your giddyap?
Oh, I was playing some hockey today.
Tore up something in my knee.
Did you go to the hospital?
Nah. I just poured some beer on it.
Can't miss the vikes game.
Twin cities!
Oh, yeah!
I love the guys here.
They're real men.
No hair products or manicures.
All new york guys are like 10% girl.
Come on. That seems a little unfair.
I'll have the vichyssoise
With just a soupon of crme frache.
Too much dairy and I tend to bloat.
So... I found an apartment today.
Really? Yeah.
And I was hoping you'd have
A little more wine in you before I asked you this, but...
I need you to co-sign the lease.
Let me think about it.
That means he's not going to do it.
I could really use your help on this.
Let's talk about this later, okay?
Don't hold your breath.
What is it?
You don't trust me?
You're my sister.
Now he's just stating a fact.
Look, ted, I am serious about a career in finance, but...
You just keep looking at me like I'm a four-year-old
Who says she wants to be an astronaut.
I just don't think you have any idea
How tough it is to make it in new york.
Exactly. You need connections.
If only ted knew someone who worked at, say...
Goliath national bank,
Then... Wait.
What?
I work at goliath national bank.
How 'bout that?
All right.
We got two bemidji pale ales
And... Who ordered the mini-burgers?
Me.
Is that fisherman's quest? Mm-hmm.
I used to play fq all the time back home!
Oh, yeah? I kinda have high score.
Not to brag, but
I caught... Oh...
A 35-inch northern pike.
The biggest video fish anyone's ever reeled in.
I mean... Freshwater.
A tip of the angler's cap, my friend.
Thank you for bringing me here.
Uh! Those are mine.
This is not a good idea.
Heather and barney alone in his office?
And I certainly don't want to be on the hook for her lease.
She is growing up. You just can't see it yet.
We're talking about a girl who was busted for shoplifting
Eight months ago.
Ted, a lot of women
Go through a shoplifting phase.
And sure, maybe to this day, they swipe
The occasional smaller item because it turns them on
In a weird way that they can't quite explain.
But...
If it'll make you feel better,
I-i'll tag along to gnb tomorrow.
I'll say I'm having lunch with marshall,
But actually, I'll be spying on her and barney.
Okay.
Okay, I'm good with that.
Heather! Heather...
Good luck tomorrow at gnb. I'm sure
You'll knock 'em dead. And I'll be spying on you guys.
Damn it!
"i'm drinking till I forget the 1999 nfc championship"?
That game.
The vikings
Were two minutes away from going to the super bowl,
When our kicker, who hadn't missed all year
Shanked a field goal, and we lost in overtime.
Damn!
'99 nfc championship game?
Yeah. Damn!
My dad, who I'd never seen cry my whole life,
Wiped away a tear.
He said...
"a little part of me just died, son."
I love how intense you guys are about your vikings.
It's like when we watch hockey night in canada...
What?
Don't let anyone in here know
That you're not from minnesota.
Why? What are they gonna do if they find out I'm from...
Does this look like a dallas bar to you, pal?
It's weird, but there's something comforting
About being carried like this.
See you later, buddy!
Man, can you believe that guy?
So, robin, where are you from?
Bemidji.
Bemidji, minnesota.
Go, vikes!
Kids, for what happened next,
I'm gonna jump ahead a couple days.
That is a pretty sweet briefcase. Mmm...
That's a pretty sweet security camera, too.
Oh! And there's another one.
And a guard.
I'm planning on paying for it, ted. Yeah.
Well, you don't have the job yet.
That door's a push, not a pull.
There you go.
Hey, thanks again for keeping an eye on her yesterday.
Look, maybe I was wrong.
She sounds like she handled barney just fine.
Maybe she'll be able to handle new york.
No thanks necessary! Heh!
Why not?
I have a secret.
No, I don't! Nothing happened.
Something happened.
What happened?
Nothing.
After heather's interview,
I went to say hi to marshall for a few minutes,
And when I came back...
Oh, my god!
Lily, lily, before you say or do anything,
I beg you one favor.
What?
Get off that. It's prada.
I am so sorry.
I knew it.
I knew it all along.
She is still the same, irresponsible train wreck
That she always was, and when I see barney...
You won't say a word.
Ted, heather begged me not to tell you.
She will hate my guts if she knows that I blabbed.
Oh, I love that briefcase, but I can't afford it.
You were right, ted.
I certainly was.
See?
She didn't get the briefcase!
That's responsible!
And there's almost no way she had sex with anyone in there.
Turning over a new leaf.
Evening, everybody!
So my dad and I are at the '99 nfc championship game.
I say evening, everybody!
And when we missed that field goal and lost...
Damn!
Damn! Damn.
...My dad, who I had never seen cry in my entire life,
Wiped away a tear and said,
"a little part of me just died, son."
"son"?
I told it the way I'm gonna tell my son.
If I'm ever lucky enough to have a son,
And name him rashad tarkenton.
Robin,
Great story.
Great story!
But it does sound a little bit familiar.
I know!
They totally ate it up.
I see what you're doing here.
What?
I brought you here as a favor
Because... Because I felt sorry for you, okay?
And now it's like you're trying to steal my bar.
You think I'm trying to steal your bar?
Oh, get oot.
"get oot"? What, are you canadian?
No, i...
You want to impersonate a canadian,
Just turn of the lights and get all scared!
What was that?
Oh, well, with canada right across the border,
We minnesotans sometimes like to make jokes
At your guys' expense
And they're all sort of along the same theme.
That we're afraid of the dark?
Yeah, For example.
Uh, hey, everyone, how many canadians does it take
To change a lightbulb?
"what? Oh, no, the lightbulb's out?! I'm scared!"
That is insane.
Why do you think the canadians are afraid of the dark?
Well, where does any prejudice come from, robin?
A stereotype starts,
And all of a sudden it spreads like wildfire.
Like asians can't drive, scotsmen are cheap,
Brazilians always put on way too much postage.
I just don't think this is gonna work out, robin.
You can't be hanging out with people who belittle
Your beloved homeland, so I'll walk you out.
No, wait, I have something to say.
Hey, everybody.
Let me tell you something about people from canada.
Hey, robin, please don't make a scene. Shh!
Do you know why canadians never get a birthday wish?
Because they're too afraid to blow out the candles.
Oh, god, I love it here. God.
I think your prospects at gnb are good.
You certainly made it clear
You're will to take any position.
Are these new coasters?
Well, I hope you get the job.
Nothing gives me more pleasure
Than filling an opening.
I swear to god these coasters are thicker.
Well, I am willing to bend over backwards.
Okay, that's it!
I cannot believe you had sex with my sister!
You blabbed?!
Do you know what?
This is a new batch of the old coasters.
I'm just gonna confirm that with the bartender.
And you, you're mature and responsible now?
Is it mature and responsible
To go to your first big job interview in new york city
And nail a total stranger?
You've always been immature and irresponsible.
You will always be immature and irresponsible.
And I wouldn't cosign a library card for you,
Let alone a lease.
Barney and I didn't have sex.
Save it. Lily saw you.
Or did she?
You see, ted, you had so little faith in heather and me...
...We decided to give you
Exactly what you expected of us.
And I knew we could count on lily to blab.
What? Why would you do that?
Because you deserved it.
Ted, you know I'm no saint.
And yes, it's true that time I drove
Your mother to the airport,
Well, let's just say there was a very confusing,
Sexually charged moment in short-term parking,
But I said I would never go near your sister,
And I meant it.
You should have trusted me.
You're so convinced I'm still
Some out-of-control teenager,
You missed the fact I grew up.
I'm gonna find a hotel.
I'll get my things later.
Merry christmas.
Your mom and I kissed.
Better get a move on.
You got five seconds to catch two more sturgeon.
Hey, we got a possible gill screen.
Forget it.
You can't catch two fish with one hook.
No, but I can catch one fish
And use that fish to catch the other one.
High score! You beat marshall!
She's canadian!
Robin's canadian!
She's canadian.
She's not from bemidji
And she doesn't know a darn thing about the vikings.
You're just mad 'cause she got high score.
Robin,
In the '99 nfc championship game when the vikings lost...
Damn!
Oh, damn!
...Who was the kicker who missed the field goal?
Rashad tarkenton.
Gary anderson.
He's now retired.
Owns a fly-fishing business...
In canada.
Good-bye, robin.
No.
You know what?
I'm glad you found oot
Because I'm proud to be canadian.
We may not have a fancy nfl team or prince,
But we invented trivial pursuit.
You're welcome, earth!
Plus in canada, you can go to an all-nude strip club
And order alcohol.
That's right.
From moosejaw to the bay of fundy,
You can suck down a 20-ounce pilsner
While watching some coal miner's daughter strip down to her pelt.
Jealous?!
In canada people don't care where you're from,
As long as you're friendly and maybe loan them a smoke
Or hand over a donut.
I'm proud to be from the great white north...
And I wish I was there right now.
And we're not afraid of the dark.
I mean, we don't love it, but who does?
Merry christmas.
Ted...
Look inside.
You just, if you push it towards the...
Not down, towards the middle.
Don't need your help. Got it.
You signed the lease.
Yeah. You know why?
Because you trust me and think it's a great idea?
Because I want to get to know you.
The new you.
Thanks.
By the way,
In your new neighborhood,
You really should get a good solid deadbolt for the door.
If you want...
To live.
I'm so sorry for what happened back there.
I-i acted like a total jerk.
I, I shouldn't have said anything.
No, look, I'm sorry. That was your place.
I shouldn't have tried to make it mine.
Just every year at the holidays, I get homesick.
And so far, every year
A boyfriend, a job, or something.
But this year for the first time, I don't.
Yes, you do.
What?
We all love you, okay?
If you ever moved back to canada,
We would hop on a plane, we would track you down,
And after barney dragged us
To a few of those strip clubs you talked about,
We would bring you back right here
Where you're supposed to be.
It's... It's not new york without robin scherbatsky.
Thanks.
I just miss it there sometimes.
I wish I could blink my eyes
And be back in canada for an hour, you know?
I was hoping you would say that.
How did you find this place?
Feels like home, right?
There's one way to find out.
Well, sorry there. Didn't see ya. Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Okay, sorry aboot that.
Have a donut on the hoose.
Thanks. Okay.
Okay, you bumped into him,
And he apologized and gave you a donut on the hoose?
Oh, it's just like home.
Sorry!
It's gonna be fine! Sorry.
No one likes the dark.
Next up from Ontario
Marshall erickson.
I didn't know you signed up. What are you gonna sing?
Oh, I think you'll recognize it.
Buddy, you can turn off the screen. We know the lyrics.
<i>Les enfants, pendant l'hiver 2009,
Robin et moi sommes devenus colocs.</i>
Et pour Ítre honnÍte,
c'ťtait pas vraiment le top.
«a a l'air bon.
- Je vais m'en faire.
- Y a plus de lait.
- J'en ai vu dans le frigo.
- Vide.
- Alors, jette-le.
- La poubelle est pleine.
Alors, sors la poubelle.
Je mange des cťrťales.
Tu sais, quand je t'ai demandť
d'Ítre ma coloc, je me suis dit,
"Une fille, elle sera soignťe".
Mais non, tu es Ogre
de <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i>.
Tu sais quoi ?
Au lieu de venir avec des rťfťrences
typiques de derniŤres minutes comme Áa,
tu devrais passer un peu de temps,
je sais pas...
ŗ laver une assiette.
Mince, je peux pas.
Je suis occupť ŗ laisser
un plat de cookies pour l'elf magique
qui met du papier toilette.
Attends, il n'y a pas d'elf.
C'est toujours moi !
Je le change toujours.
Toi, jamais !
- C'est ridicule !
- Non, j'y suis allťe hier...
ArrÍte ! ArrÍte !
Mon Dieu, il se passe quoi ?
Quand on ťtait en couple,
on vivait pratiquement ensemble
et on se rendait pas fou.
Je sais.
Il s'est passť quoi ?
Tu sais ce que c'est ?
On faisait l'amour.
Hommes et femmes ont besoin
de sexe pour vivre ensemble.
«a rťsout toutes les disputes.
Comme la thťorie de Barney
sur la paix dans le monde ?
Je lui ai expliquť.
J'ai dit, Madeline, chaque
conflit international
se rťsume essentiellement
ŗ la tension sexuelle.
- Tous les conflits internationaux ?
- Tous, mec.
Donc, la crise au Moyen-Orient
pourrait Ítre rťsolu par...
Strip-teaseuses de Gaza. Suivant.
Apartheid ?
"Apartouze".
Tu as quoi d'autre ?
La Guerre froide ?
"Mme Gorbatchev,
enlŤve ses sous-vÍtements".
Bon,
je pense qu'on devrait
refaire l'amour.
Oui, bien sŻr.
Je sais.
C'est comme faire du vťlo, mec ?
Faire du vťlo la tÍte en bas.
Bon, ťcoute. Si Áa doit
se produire ŗ l'occasion,
on dit rien ŗ personne.
- Vendu.
- Vendu.
Vendu.

Vous fichez quoi, les gars ?
Vous Ítes de nouveau ensemble ?
Non. On faisait juste l'amour
pour ne plus se disputer.
C'est une super idťe.
Non, vraiment. Chapeau les gars.
J'ai vu dans le futur
et tout marche
ŗ merveille pour tout le monde.
Pourquoi t'es lŗ au fait ?
J'allais travailler et je
devais faire un saut ici pour...
lire ce magazine.
Dans...
la piŤce lŗ-bas.
J'ai compris.
- Pas de problŤme.
- Si, c'est un problŤme.
Tu as fait tout ce chemin jusqu'ici
pour lire un magazine ?
Je suis prÍte ŗ parier
qu'il y a un endroit
pour lire ce magazine au boulot.
Tu sais, une piŤce
avec un petit bonhomme sur la porte ?
Enfin, Robin.
Personne n'aime lire
un magazine au boulot.
Tu sors de ton bureau
en tenant un magazine
<i>et ce magazine dit une chose
et rien qu'une seule.</i>
Hť tout le monde, regardez
ce que Marshall va faire !
Marshall va lire
un bon vieux magazine
dans les toilettes
que vous partagez tous avec lui.
As-tu pensť ŗ peut-Ítre
ne pas lire un magazine
quand tu lis un magazine ?
Tu dois lire un magazine.
C'est pour Áa
qu'il y a des magazines.
Sinon, c'est du temps perdu.
Exactement.
Et le pire, c'est,
ce morceau de couloir
de ma porte ŗ ces toilettes.
C'est une exposition
ŗ la critique.
<i>On a ma chef.</i>
<i>On sait exactement
ce que vous allez faire.</i>
<i>Son patron.</i>
<i>Eriksen,</i>
<i>pourquoi vous ne dťmťnagez pas
votre bureau lŗ-dedans ?</i>
<i>Donald "J'y Crois Pas
Qu'il Ait Une Femme".</i>
<i>Mon chťri, si flagrant.</i>
Quoi qu'il en soit,
je prťfťrerais faire Áa ici.
Non, je suis dťsolťe.
C'est notre appartement maintenant.
Marshall, tu dois lire
un magazine ailleurs.
- Donne-moi ta clť.
- Non, sŻrement pas.
«a me rappelle une affaire
conclue entre 3 parties
oý personne ne discuterait
d'un certain ťvťnement
qui s'est produit.
Un ťvŤnement de...
persuasion.
Cette clť, madame, c'est mon silence.
Bonne journťe ŗ vous deux.
Vous avez couchť ensemble ?
Merci beaucoup, Lilly.
Vous...
avez couchť ensemble.
C'est ťpouv...
stouflant.
…pouvstouflant.
Bien jouť, Ted.
Bravo.
«a semble plus important
que Áa ne l'est.
On en a parlť et on a rťalisť
qu'on a eu des mois difficiles.
- On mťrite de s'amuser un peu.
- Non.
«a pourrait ruiner votre amitiť.
Quand deux ex essayent
le "juste ŗ l'occasion",
quelqu'un finit toujours
par en souffrir.
<i>En fait, Lily avait raison.</i>
<i>On en parle plus tard.</i>
On va pas en arriver lŗ, OK ?
Personne ne va souffrir.
On a mis en place des rŤgles.
RŤgle numťro un :
Relation purement physique.
Il n'y a pas de sentiments.
C'est comme dire ŗ Fonzie
d'Ítre cool.
Et puisque c'est juste physique,
on a pas ŗ se soucier de l'amour.
On peut le faire devant la tťlť !
Tout ŗ fait !
Soyons multit‚ches.
Utiliser le sexe pour pimenter
un peu les activitťs ennuyeuses.
- Comme plier le linge.
- Payer les factures.
Cuisiner.
- C'est pas trŤs hygiťnique.
- Oui, pas celle-lŗ.
Et maintenant qu'on couche ensemble,
on se dispute plus.
ProblŤme rťsolu.
En fait, le mťrite revient ŗ Barney.
Cette idťe vient de ton truc
sur la paix dans le monde.
Oui. Merci, Barney.
Tu avais raison.
La paix fut ťtablie.
Plus d'une fois.
Donc, je suis responsable de...
Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.
La prochaine tournťe est pour moi !
- «a va ?
- Oui. Pourquoi tu demandes ?
Pour une chose,
tu pleures ouvertement.
De joie.
Je suis si content pour eux.
Barney, admets-le.
Tu as toujours des sentiments
pour Robin et Áa te torture.
Je vais tout ŗ fait bien.
Excuse-moi juste une minute.
Je vais tout ŗ fait bien.
Tu dois apprendre
ŗ exprimer tes sentiments.
Tu devrais peut-Ítre
consulter un psychiatre.
Attends.
Si je paye une femme 200 $ de l'heure
pour me sentir mieux,
ce sera pas pour discuter.
Et on sera tous les deux
sur le divan.
La femme dans mon scťnario,
c'est une prostituťe.
Sale, vulgaire, toute refaite,
d'Europe de l'Est...
J'ai saisi.
Y a quelque chose de libťrateur
ŗ ne pas prendre Áa au sťrieux.
Hier soir, on l'a fait
alors que je rťpondais au tťlťphone.
Je savais que t'avais pas
de rameur !
Merveilleux, on parle encore de Áa !
…coutez, c'est un truc privť
entre Ted et moi.
Truc privť.
On discuterait mÍme pas de Áa
si Marshall pouvait lire
un magazine au boulot.
Il a toujours ťtť comme Áa.
Tu te souviens, en droit ?
Bien sŻr.
Bťbť ?
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Le relevť de banque
est arrivť aujourd'hui.
Tu as rťservť un hŰtel
ŗ deux p‚tťs de ton ťcole, un mardi.
- C'est pas ce que tu crois.
- C'est qui, Marshall ?
Comment elle s'appelle ?
Burrito.
Carnitas Burrito.
T'as rťservť une chambre d'hŰtel
juste pour pouvoir
y lire un magazine ?
Tu veux pas que je voie
si la serveuse a une ťnorme ťchelle
pour ce ton hautain que t'as ?
Personne n'aime lire un magazine
au boulot et s'ils le disent,
- ils sont pas humains.
- Mec,
je lis un magazine
au boulot chaque jour.
Je te dis pas le nombre de rťunions
oý j'ai ťtť en retard
parce que je "lisais un magazine."
Mais j'ai pas honte de Áa.
C'est mon moment.
C'est sŻr, "lire un magazine"
c'est pas sexy,
mais tu sais,
c'est un truc que j'ai ŗ faire.
Pourquoi en avoir honte ?
Attends, "lire un magazine"
c'est bien se branler, non ?
J'y crois pas.
T'as encore bu tout mon lait !
- On peut faire l'amour.
- OK.
C'est le plan idťal.
ņ chaque fois qu'on commence
ŗ s'engueuler, on couche ŗ la place.
Une minute, on est sur le dos
l'un de l'autre, et celle d'aprŤs,
eh ben, la mÍme chose.
Super.
Ce matin, elle me crie
ŗ travers la porte,
"T'es trop long sous la douche !"
La seconde d'aprŤs, elle me rejoint.
Lŗ, Áa l'a pas dťrangťe
que je prenne mon temps.
Si gťnial.
Dťsolť pour le retard.
Je me tapais une Scherbatsky.
Elle a utilisť tous mes timbres,
donc pour faire court,
le postier a sonnť deux fois.
Faut que tu tapes lŗ !
C'est...
juste...
si...
excuse-moi une seconde.
Donc, les plasmas sont meilleurs
ŗ faible lumiŤre,
mais les LCD sont mieux pour jouer ?
D'accord, mais les CRT
ont les noirs les plus profonds.
Donc, si je veux
un trŤs bon ratio de contraste...
La structure en pixels profonds
des CRT produit
une rťsolution incomparable aux LCD.
Je prends le CRT.
Barney, c'est dingue.
Je vais trŤs bien, merci.
Non, c'est faux.
Tu dois apprendre
ŗ faire sortir tout Áa.
Comme on fait
dans ma classe de maternelle.
"L'heure des ťmotions",
tous les mardis matin.
…coute, peut-Ítre que tes gamins
prennent mal que leurs amis
couchent ensemble, mais pas moi.
J'ai jamais ťtť aussi bien.
<i>Pendant ce temps,
Marshall en bavait toujours au travail.</i>
…coutez tous,
gros dťjeuner ce matin.
Vous savez ce que Áa veut dire.
<i>Puis, vint la meilleure nouvelle
qu'il ait entendue depuis longtemps.</i>
T'es au courant ?
Ils ont virť tout le monde au 8e.
Je sais.
C'est une ville fantŰme lŗ-bas.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
- C'ťtait sympa hier soir.
- SŻr, c'en ťtait une bonne.
Mťmo perso : laisser traÓner
la boÓte de pizza plus souvent.
D'accord, ŗ plus tard.
Hier soir, Robin a laissť traÓner
une boÓte de pizza par terre,
- donc on a couchť 3 fois.
- OK.
Et ce matin,
avant de partir au boulot...
- on s'est embrassťs.
- Bizarre.
C'est bizarre.
Hein ?
Ce baiser a violť l'esprit
de notre arrangement.
Elle pense sans doute
que j'ai des sentiments pour elle.
- T'en as ?
- Oui, je l'aime.
C'est ce que...
C'est toi, mec.
Non. «a voulait rien dire.
C'ťtait juste un rťflexe
de lorsqu'on ťtait en couple.
Mais j'ai tout fait foirer.
Clairement.
C'est la fin.
Attends. Peut-Ítre qu'elle n'a pas
trouvť Áa bizarre.
C'ťtait bizarre.
Bizarre, bizarre, bizarre.
B-I-Z-Z-A-R-E.
Bizarre.
- C'est pas comme Áa que Áa s'ťcrit.
- Allez, Lily. Fais pas ton Ted.
Je t'avais prťvenue.
Quand les ex rechutent,
au final, Áa blesse quelqu'un.
Mais personne n'ťcoute.
C'est l'histoire de ma vie.
Ma bonne bouille empÍche
que les gens ťcoutent mon message.
Je fais quoi ?
Une seule solution.
Vous devez arrÍter de coucher
ensemble, s'il vous plaÓt.
Je crois qu'on devrait
arrÍter de coucher.
Ted et moi,
c'est comme des cigarettes.
T'en prends une
en pensant que c'est bon.
Et trŤs vite, t'achŤtes
une cartouche par semaine.
Faut que j'arrÍte Áa.
Faut que j'arrÍte Áa.
Alors,
- on arrÍte Áa, hein ?
- Je crois, oui.
C'est pour le mieux.
C'ťtait fun, mais je veux pas
que Áa devienne bizarre.
- Moi non plus.
- Colocs ?
Colocs.
Mais on dit rien ŗ personne.
D'accord ?
- Vendu.
- Vendu.
- Mec !
- Sťrieux !
C'est quoi, votre problŤme ?
Celle-lŗ.
«a n'a pas durť longtemps.
Au fait, qu'est-ce que tu foutais
chez nous ?
Je croyais
que t'avais le plan idťal.
C'ťtait le cas.
<i>Tout se passait bien.
Je me sentais de plus en plus ŗ l'aise,</i>
<i>plus confiant.</i>
<i>J'aurais pu conquťrir le monde.</i>
<i>Un matin, je suis au 8e
avec un magazine.</i>
On va tout dťmolir.
Je veux que tu dťtruises ces murs,
- ici... et lŗ.
- «a marche.
Les cťlťbritťs ťtendent leur linge ?
Moi aussi, j'ťtends mon linge.
N'entrez pas !
«a n'a pas durť longtemps.
- Merci.
- Tu fais quoi ?
Puisque vos chamailleries de colocs
sont toujours sources de conflits
entre vous deux, j'ai voulu aider.
Au fait, je suis passť ŗ la poste.
Je t'ai pris des timbres.
En voilŗ 10 000. «a devrait suffire.
Merci, je suppose.
Tu veux une biŤre ?
J'ai pris Áa au passage.
C'est rien.
Tu nous as achetť
un lave-vaisselle ?
Il a toujours ťtť lŗ.
Tu vis ici depuis combien de temps ?
Alors, tu fais tout Áa
pour qu'on ťvite de se disputer, hein ?
Exactement.
Je m'inquiŤte pour vous.
«a te dťrange
qu'on couche ensemble, non ?
Pas du tout.
C'est dingue.
Quoi ?
Tu es amoureux de Robin ?
Tu es amoureux de Robin. Voilŗ pourquoi
tu veux pas qu'on couche ensemble.
Quoi ? Tu dis n'importe quoi.
Un pote peut pas nettoyer
l'appart d'un autre pote
comme les potes le font ?
Cite-moi un pote dans l'histoire
des potes qui a dťjŗ fait Áa.
Je t'en donne deux :
Messieurs Propre et Solcarlus.
Ce truc entre moi et Robin
est complŤtement innocent.
Je flipperai pas si tu me dis ressentir
quelque chose pour elle. C'est le cas ?
Non. C'est pas vrai, non.
C'est pas vrai, non. Non.
Robin est tout ŗ toi, mec.
…clate-toi avec elle.
Maintenant, si tu veux bien
m'excuser,
je vais aller coucher
avec d'autres filles.
- Tu es sŻr ?
- Oui !
- Positif ?
- Absolument.
Et je suis parti en trombe.
Pourquoi j'ai fait Áa ?
«a vient peut-Ítre
de mes problŤmes de pŤre, mais...
en gros, j'ai autorisť
mon meilleur ami
ŗ coucher
avec la fille de mes rÍves.
Je me suis complŤtement sabotť.
Et maintenant, je fume.
Je fume.
Sors d'ici.
Mais, c'est l'heure des ťmotions
et j'ai …motif, l'ours du partage.
Celui qui a …motif, l'ours du partage,
peut s'asseoir sur la chaise du partage.
Barney, on est pas
chez ton thťrapeute.
Ces enfants ont aussi
leurs problŤmes, tu sais.
Les parents de Ben divorcent.
Ah bon ?
Qui veut faire du coloriage ?
Gťnial, c'est Lily qui t'envoie ?
J'ai pas l'ours, OK ?
Je le rendrai pas !
Pourquoi tu souris ?
Je viens...
de lire un magazine.
Ici, au boulot.
- Quoi ?
- C'est le truc le plus drŰle.
J'ťtais sur le net,
en train de regarder les hŰtels
<i>quand j'ai compris un truc.</i>
C'est stupide.
J'ai dťcidť qu'il ťtait temps
d'affronter mes complexes
et de faire ce que j'avais ŗ faire
et une fois cette dťcision prise,
tout a changť.
<i>Voilŗ un jeune homme
ŗ l'aise dans ces baskets.</i>
<i>Je sais ce que tu t'apprÍtes ŗ faire
et je te respecte pour Áa.</i>
<i>Tiens la route.</i>
Tu as fait un grand pas aujourd'hui.
Rappelle-toi Shakespeare :
"La vertu est sans peur
" et la bontť, sans crainte."
Tu as raison, Super Bonnasse
Dont Ma Femme ArrÍte Pas
De Me Dire Pourquoi Tu Es CťlŤbre
Mais J'arrÍte Pas D'oublier.
Faisons-le.
Montre le chemin.
Fťlicitations.
Merci. Je l'aurais bien fait
ŗ un moment donnť.
Parfois, tu dois...
Tu dois t'affirmer et...
y aller.
Marshall, je dois y aller.
Au fait, y a des toilettes ici,
si tu veux t'en servir.
EspŤce...
Ted, je dois te dire la vťritť.
J'aime...
les tacos.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Je sors les belles-pou.
Si tu cherches Ted, il est sorti.
Et...
notre petit arrangement est...
terminť, au fait.
Vraiment ?
C'est ťpous... vantable.
- …pousvantable ?
- Oui, c'est ťpousvantable.
- Que s'est-il passť ?
- Il a insistť.
Il a dit "ne plus pouvoir le faire"
sinon "Áa blesserait quelqu'un".
Je pense qu'on sait tous
de qui il parle.
Ah bon ?
C'est pas ťvident ?
- «a l'est ?
- Oui.
C'est Ted.
Tu sais comme il est romantique.
Il peut pas sťparer le physique
de l'ťmotion.
Il est du genre...
- Je t'aime.
- Exactement.
Il est pas comme toi, tu vois ?
En plus, on est amis. Je veux pas
tout compliquer en s'engageant.
Sortir avec des amis
ne marche jamais.
Alors... tu veux aller
manger un taco ?
Un taco ?
Tu les aimes, non ?
Juste.
Viens, j'ai faim.
<i>Donc Robin et moi sommes redevenus
colocataires</i>
<i>et tout est rentrť dans l'ordre.</i>
<i>Votre tante Lily avait raison.</i>
<i>Quand deux ex essayent
le "juste ŗ l'occasion",</i>
<i>quelqu'un est toujours blessť.</i>
<i>C'ťtait juste pas l'un de nous deux.</i>
<i>Kids, in the winter of 2009,
Robin and I had just become roommates.</i>
<i>And to be honest,
it wasn't going very smoothly.</i>
Oh, that looks good.
- I'm gonna get some.
- There's no more milk.
- No, I just saw some in the fridge.
- Empty.
- So throw it out.
- The trash can's full.
So take the trash out.
I'm eating cereal.
You know, when I asked you
to be my roommate, I figured,
"She's a girl, she'll be neat."
But no, you're Ogre
from <i>Revenge of the Nerds.</i>
You know what, Ted?
Instead of coming up with
hot off the press
topical references like that,
maybe you should spend
a little time,
I don't know...
washing a dish ever.
Darn, I can't.
I'm too busy leaving a plate
of cookies for the magical elf
who changes the toilet paper roll.
Wait, there's no elf.
It's always me!
I always change it.
You never do!
- That is ridiculous!
- No, I went in there yesterday...
Stop! Stop!
God, what is going on?
When we were dating each other,
we were practically
living together and we didn't
drive each other this crazy.
I know.
What happened?
You know what it is?
We were having sex.
Men and women need sex
to live together.
It solves all disputes.
Oh, like Barney's theory
about world peace?
So I explained to her.
I said, Madeline, every single
international conflict
essentially boils down
to sexual tension.
- Every international conflict?
- Every single one, dude.
So the crisis in the Middle East
could be solved by...
Gaza Strippers. Next.
Apartheid?
Apart thighs.
What else you got?
Cold War?
"Mrs. Gorbachev,
take down those pants."
Well,
guess we should just
start having sex, then.
Yeah, right.
I know.
It's like riding a bike, buddy?
Riding a bike upside down, maybe.
Okay, listen. If this
is gonna happen on occasion,
we can't tell anyone about this.
- Deal.
- Deal.
Deal.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
What the hell are you guys doing?
Are you guys, like, back together?
No. We're just having sex
so we don't fight anymore.
That's a great idea.
No, really. Two thumbs up, guys.
Hey, I just looked into the future
and that works out
really great for everyone.
What are you even doing here?
I was on my way to work and I
just had to drop by here to...
read this magazine.
In...
that room over there.
Oh, I get it.
- No problem, buddy.
- Yes, a problem, buddy.
You came all the way over
here to read a magazine?
I'm willing to bet
that there is a place
to read a magazine at work.
You know, a room with
a little man on the door?
Okay, Robin. Come on.
Nobody likes to read
a magazine at work.
I mean, you walk out
of your office holding a magazine
<i>and that magazine is saying
one thing and one thing only.</i>
Hey everyone, look
at what Marshall's about to do!
Marshall's about to read
a big ol'magazine
in the bathroom
that you all share with him.
Well, have you thought about maybe
not reading a magazine
when you read a magazine?
You gotta read a magazine.
I mean,
that's why there's magazines.
Otherwise, it's time
you're not getting back.
Exactly.
And the worst part is this:
That stretch of hallway
from my door to that restroom
is... is a gauntlet of
judging eyes.
<i>You got my boss.</i>
<i>We all know exactly
what you're about to do.</i>
<i>Her boss.</i>
<i>Hey, Eriksen,</i>
<i>why don't you just
move your desk in there?</i>
<i>I-Can't-Believe-He-Has-A-Wife
Donald.</i>
<i>Oh, sweetie, so obvious.</i>
Anyways, I just would rather
do that here.
No, I'm sorry.
This is our apartment now.
Marshall, you have to read
a magazine someplace else.
- Give me your key.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
I seem to recall a deal being struck
between three parties
wherein none would discuss
a certain event
that transpired.
An event of the...
... persuasion.
That key, madam, buys my silence.
Good day to you both.
You two hooked up?
Thanks a lot, Lilly.
So...
You two...
slept together.
That is awf...
some.
Awfsome.
Nice work, Ted.
Tap that.
It sounds like
a bigger deal than it is.
Yeah, we talked it over
and we both realized
we've had a rough couple of months.
We deserve a little fun.
No.
This could wind up
ruining your friendship.
When two exes try
to "just be casual,"
someone always winds up
getting hurt.
<i>Turned out, Lily was right.</i>
<i>But more on that later.</i>
Guys, we've got this covered, okay?
No one's gonna get hurt.
We set up ground rules.
Okay, rule number one:
This is strictly
a physical relationship.
There are no feelings involved.
Please, that's like
telling the Fonz to be cool.
And since it's just physical,
we don't have to worry about romance.
Hell, no. We can do it
while we watch TV!
Totally!
And we can multi-task.
You know, use the sex to spice up
otherwise dull activities.
- Like folding laundry.
- Paying bills.
Cooking dinner.
- That doesn't seem hygienic.
- Yeah, not that one.
And now that we're hooking up,
we're not fighting anymore.
Problem solved.
Actually, the credit belongs to Barney.
This whole idea came out
of your thing about world peace.
Yeah. Thanks, Barney.
You were right.
Peace was achieved.
Repeatedly.
So I'm... I'm responsible for...
Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.
Next round's on me!
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah. Why do you ask?
Well, for one thing,
you're openly weeping.
With joy.
So happy for those two.
Barney, admit it.
You still have feelings for Robin
and this is killing you.
I am totally fine.
Now, excuse me for just a minute.
I'm totally fine.
You have to learn how
to express these feelings.
Maybe you should talk
to a psychiatrist.
Please.
If I'm gonna pay
so woman $200 an hour
to make me feel better,
we aren't going to be talking.
And we're both going
to be on that couch.
The woman in this scenario
is a prostitute.
A dirty, skanky, surgically
enhanced, Eastern European...
I got it.
There's something kind of liberating
about not taking it all too seriously.
Last night, we actually did it
while I was returning
a bunch of phone calls.
I knew you didn't
get a rowing machine!
Awesome,
we're still talking about this!
Look, guys, this is a private thing
between me and Ted.
Private Thing.
We wouldn't even be
talking about this
if Marshall could
read a magazine at work.
He's always been this way.
Remember law school?
Sure do.
Baby?
Baby, what is it?
The credit card bill came today.
You checked into a hotel
two blocks from school on a Tuesday.
- It's not what you think.
- Who is she, Marshall?
What's her name?
Burrito.
Carnitas Burrito.
So, you checked into a hotel room
just so you could
read a magazine there?
Robin, do you want me to see if
the waitress has any giant sugar cubes
for that high horse of yours?
Nobody likes to read a magazine at work
and if they say that they do,
- then they're not human.
- Dude,
I read a magazine at work every day.
I can't tell you how many
meetings I've been late to
because I was busy
"reading a magazine."
But I don't feel bad about it.
That's my time.
Sure, "reading a magazine"
ain't pretty,
but, you know,
it's something I gotta do.
So why be ashamed about it?
Wait, "reading a magazine"
means masturbating, right?
I can't believe it.
You drank all my milk again!
- We can have sex.
- Okay.
It's the perfect set up.
Anytime we start getting
into an argument,
we just have sex instead.
One minute we're just laying into
each other, and then the next minute,
Well, same thing.
Awesome.
So, this morning, she's yelling
at me through the door,
"You're taking too long
in the shower!"
Next thing I know, she hops in.
Now baby don't mind I took my time.
So awesome.
Sorry I'm late.
I was just jammin'on Scherbatsky.
She used up all my stamps,
so long story short,
the postman rang twice.
You must bump this!
That's...
just...
so...
Excuse me for a second.
So, you're saying plasmas
are better for low light,
but LCDs are better for games?
Right, but the CRTs
have the truest blacks.
So, if I want a really crisp
contrast ratio...
The CRT's deep-pixel
cell structure produces
a resolution you just
can't match with an LCD.
I'll take the CRT.
Barney, this is nuts.
I'm doing just fine, thank you.
No, you're not.
You need to learn
to let this stuff out.
Like we do in my kindergarten class
"Feelings Hour"
every Tuesday morning.
Look, maybe your kindergartners
are upset that their friends
are sleeping with each other,
but not me.
I have never been better.
<i>Meanwhile,
Marshall was still struggling at work.</i>
Coming through.
Big breakfast this morning.
You know what that means.
<i>But then came the best news
he'd heard in a long time.</i>
And did you hear?
They laid off everybody
on the eighth floor.
I know.
It's a ghost town down there.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- That was fun last night.
- Word, that was a good one.
Mental note: don't throw out
the pizza box more often.
All right, see you later.
So last night, Robin left
a pizza box out on the floor,
- so we had sex three times.
- Sure.
And then, this morning
before I left for work...
- we kissed.
- That's weird.
That is weird.
Right?
That kiss violated the spirit
of our whole arrangement.
I mean, she probably thinks
I'm getting feelings for her.
- Are you?
- Yes, I'm in love with her.
Is what you...
That's you, dude.
No. It didn't mean anything.
It was just some leftover reflex
from when we were a couple.
But I think I probably blew it.
Definitely.
It is so over.
Hold the phone.
Maybe Robin didn't think it was weird.
It was weird.
Weird, weird, weird, weird, weird.
W- I-E-R-D.
Weird.
- That's not how you spell "weird".
- Come on, Lily. Nobody likes a Ted.
I tried to warn you.
When exes relapse,
someone always gets hurt.
But no one listened.
Story of my life.
My cuteness interferes
with people hearing my message.
What should I do?
There's only one thing to do.
You have to stop
sleeping together, please.
I think we have to stop
sleeping together.
With me and Ted,
it's like cigarettes.
You have one when you're
drunk and you think it's fine.
But before you know it,
you're buying a carton a week.
I think I have to end it.
I have to end it.
So...
- We're ending it, huh?
- I think so, yeah.
It's probably for the best.
It was fun,
but I don't want things to get weird.
- Me neither.
- Roomies?
Roomies.
But we tell no one.
Deal?
- Deal.
- Deal.
- Dude!
- Come on!
What is the matter with you?
That one.
So, that didn't last long.
By the way, what were you doing
back in our apartment?
I thought you had
the perfect situation.
I did.
<i>Everything was going great.
I was feeling more comfortable,</i>
<i>more confident.</i>
<i>I felt I could take on the world.</i>
<i>One morning, I took my magazine
down to the eighth floor.</i>
We gotta gut this whole place.
I need these walls taken out
- here... and here.
- You got it.
Celebrities pick up
their dry cleaning?
I pick up my dry cleaning.
Don't come in!
So that didn't last long.
- Thanks.
- What are you doing?
Since all these roomie squabbles
are still causing friction between you
and Robin, I thought I'd help out.
BTW, I went
by the post office today.
I picked you up some stamps.
Here's ten thousand. That oughta do ya.
Thanks, I guess.
You want a beer?
I picked those up on the way over.
It was nothing.
Did you buy us a dishwasher?
That dishwasher's always been there.
How long have you lived here?
So, you're doing all this
to keep me and Robin from fighting, huh?
Exactly.
I worry about you two.
It bothers you that Robin and I
are hooking up, doesn't it?
Not at all.
That's crazy.
What?
Are you in love with Robin?
You're in love with Robin.
That's why you don't want us hooking up.
What? That is crazy talk.
Can't a bro clean
another bro's apartment
like bros do?
Name me one bro in the history of bros
who has ever done that.
I'll name two:
Misters Clean and Belvedere.
Look, this thing with me and Robin,
it's totally casual.
I'm not gonna freak out if you tell me
you have feelings for her. So, do you?
No. I don't. I don't, no.
I don't. I don't. No.
Robin is all yours, dude.
Have fun with her.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go sleep with other girls.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
- Positive?
- Absolutely.
And then I stormed out.
Why did I do that?
I mean, maybe it goes back
to my father issues, but...
I basically gave
my best friend license
to have sex
with the girl of my dreams.
I totally sabotaged myself.
And now I'm smoking.
Now I'm smoking.
Get out.
But it's feelings hour
and I'm holding
Feely the Share Bear.
Whoever's holding Feely the Share Bear
gets to sit in the share chair.
Barney, this is not
your private therapist's office.
These kids have issues
to talk about, too, you know.
Ben's parents are getting divorced.
They are?
Who wants to do some coloring?
Great, did Lily send you?
I don't have the bear, okay?
I'm not giving it back!
Why are you smiling?
I just...
read a magazine.
Here at work.
What?
It's the funniest thing.
I was online,
looking up rates for hotels
<i>when I realized something.</i>
This is stupid.
I decided it was time
to let go of my hang-ups
and do the thing I gotta do
and once I made that decision,
everything changed.
<i>There's a young man
who's comfortable with who he is.</i>
<i>I know what you're about to do
and I respect you for it.</i>
<i>Go the distance.</i>
You made a brave step today.
Remember what Shakespeare wrote:
"Virtue is bold,
"and goodness never fearful."
You're right,
Super Hot Lady Who My Wife Keeps
Telling Me Why You're Famous
But I Keep Forgetting.
Let's do this.
Lead the way.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
I was gonna have to do it eventually.
You know, sometimes you just gotta...
You gotta man up and...
and just go for it.
Marshall, I have to go.
By the way, I have a bathroom here
if you ever want to use it.
Son of a...
Ted, I have to tell you the truth.
I'm in love with...
tacos.
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking out the triz-ash.
If you're looking for Ted,
he left.
And...
our little arrangement is...
over, by the way.
Really?
That's aws... ful.
Awsful?
Yeah, it's just awsful.
- What happened?
- He just insisted.
He said he couldn't do it anymore
because "someone's gonna get hurt".
I think we all know
who he meant by that.
Do we?
Isn't it obvious?
- Is it?
- Yeah.
It's Ted.
You know what a romantic he is.
He can't separate the physical
from the emotional.
He's all like...
- I love you.
- Exactly.
He's not like you, you know?
Besides, we're friends. I don't want
to screw that up by getting involved.
Dating friends never works out.
So... you want to get a taco?
A taco?
You love them, remember?
Right.
Come on, I'm hungry.
<i>So Robin and I went back
to just being roommates</i>
<i>and things went back to normal.</i>
<i>Your Aunt Lily was right.</i>
<i>When two exes decide
to just be casual,</i>
<i>someone always gets hurt.</i>
<i>It just wasn't one of us.</i>
<i>Les enfants,
pendant la 2e année de fac,</i>
<i>quand Lily est rentrée de vacances,</i>
<i>Marshall l'a surprise ŕ l'aéroport.</i>
<i>Et elle l'a surpris
avec un pack de Root Beer.</i>
Fort Lau-ger-Dale !
T'as compris ?
<i>Et du coup, un rituel est né.</i>
<i>Les 11 années suivantes,
si l'un d'entre eux prenait l'avion...</i>
Minne-Cider !
T'as compris ?
<i>... les retrouvailles étaient toujours
commémorées avec une pancarte</i>
<i>et un pack d'oů ils venaient.</i>
Aspen Yards Ale !
- T'as compris ?
- En fait, non.
Moi non plus.
J'espérais que tu trouves.
<i>Mais, une nuit de janvier 2009,
l'impensable s'est produit.</i>
- Je vais pas la chercher.
- Quoi ?
Lily veut pas que je prenne un taxi
jusqu'ŕ l'aéroport
juste pour prendre un taxi
dans l'autre sens.
Mais le truc du pack ?
C'était marrant quand on était
plus jeunes, mais on a dépassé ça.
Quand on műrit,
la relation műrit avec nous.
Mais... vous ętes une source
d'inspiration pour nous tous,
vous ętes tellement dévoués et liés.
Je vous regarde,
et c'est tout ce que je veux au monde.
Il y a deux étudiantes dehors,
et elles ont l'air faciles !
Arizona... Tu sais...
J'ai toujours voulu voir
ŕ quoi ressemble un permis de l'Arizona.
J'ai déjŕ fait ça. 21 ans.
C'est bon. Dieu merci.
Qu'est-ce qui vous amčne par ici ?
- Notre groupe fait un concert.
- Vous avez un groupe ?
- On passera peut-ętre vous voir.
- Excusez-nous une seconde.
C'est quoi, ton problčme ?
- On va pas les voir jouer.
- Pourquoi ?
Si on va les voir, on vaut pas mieux
que les blondasses qui montrent
leurs seins ŕ un concert de Van Halen.
Oui, mais ces filles couchent-elles
avec Van Halen, aprčs ?
Si tu veux coucher avec Van Halen,
fais-le sur ton temps libre.
On est pas les mecs
qui-pourraient-venir-vous-voir.
On est les autres mecs,
ceux plus âgés, qui sont jamais venus
et dont la reconnaissance
est nécessaire.
- On est leurs pčres ?
- Exactement.
C'est une grande réunion,
je pense pas qu'on puisse venir.
Une autre fois, jeunes filles.
Si vous voulez nous voir aprčs,
on peut échanger nos numéros.
Excusez-nous une minute.
T'es devenu complčtement fou ?
On veut pas leurs numéros.
Je sais pas ce que je faisais.
J'ai dű paniquer lŕ-bas.
Quand tu échanges un numéro,
tu lui donnes la possibilité
d'appeler pour annuler.
Si tu donnes un rendez-vous
sans numéro, elles doivent venir.
Échec et mat !
Pas de numéro, juste mes doigts.
Camion.
T'es toujours leur pčre ?
Pourquoi pas se donner rendez-vous ici,
demain soir vers 22 h.
Je crois qu'il neigera.
- On fait quoi s'il y a un blizzard ?
- Quoi qu'il arrive, on sera lŕ.
C'est tout "ski" compte.
Excusez-nous une derničre fois.
C'est quoi, le problčme, lŕ ?
- Bien joué.
- Merci.
- Ŕ demain soir.
- Carrément. Génial !
"Carrément. Génial !"
Mec, ces étudiantes ont l'air stupides.
- Carrément.
- Génial. Voilŕ le truc :
demain soir, habille-toi bien,
ça va bouger !
On aurait quand męme dű
prendre leurs numéros.
Tu imagines toujours le pire.
Ted, je te promets,
tout va bien se passer.
Il commence ŕ neiger.

<i>Les enfants,
le blizzard de 2009 fut monstrueux.</i>
<i>Il a neigé pendant trois jours,</i>
<i>ce qui a donné
trois histoires incroyables.</i>
<i>Je commence par Barney et moi.</i>
Il fait vraiment mauvais dehors.
Elles viendront pas.
Mais si elles viendront.
C'est obligé.
Si je peux toucher une de ces filles,
j'aurai un "Bingo de fęte étudiante".
Allez, Ted. T'es le seul ici.
Pardon,
un "Bingo de fęte étudiante" ?
Chaque année, Playboy publie une liste
des meilleures fętes étudiantes du pays.
Je prends le top 25, et je fais...
une carte de bingo.
Il ne me manque plus
qu'Arizona Tech,
ce qui est dingue.
Dans un concours,
ça serait donné d'office.
Combien de personnes sont
sur ce Bingo de fęte étudiante ?
Juste moi.
C'est quoi, le but, alors ?
Le but est de s'en faire
cinq ŕ la suite.
Et t'as quoi, si tu réussis ?
J'ai un Bingo.
Merci d'ętre passé.
J'ai bidouillé le thermostat durant 1 h
avant de voir que c'était l'interphone.
Ouais, je t'ai entendu
râler d'en bas.
Le vol de Lily est ce soir,
tu vas vraiment pas la chercher ?
Comme j'ai dit,
quand on műrit,
notre relation műrit avec nous.
Connaissant ta femme,
elle va quand męme
te ramener un pack.
Puget Stout.
Le plus exquis
des breuvages de Seattle.
Et en parlant de pack...
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Je vais ŕ l'aéroport.
Comment j'ai pu ętre aussi bęte ?
Bien sűr qu'elle me ramčne un pack !
Mais cette fois,
je lui ai pas ramené de pack.
Parce que... quand on műrit,
la relation műrit avec nous.
Il a l'air d'un gentil jeune homme.
Je parie qu'il vous surprendra
et viendra vous chercher quand męme.
- Oů est ma bičre ?
- On avait dit pas cette fois.
QUELQU'UN AVEC DE LA BIČRE
J'ai de la bičre.
Un pack et une taille
qui me convient.
Allons-y, nouvelle Lily.
Je dois prendre de la bičre.
<i>C'est votre capitaine
qui vous parle.</i>
<i>Apparemment, on va arriver
avec une heure d'avance.</i>
Finissez, les gars.
Je ferme le bar.
- Non ! Il est seulement 21 h.
- Et ça déchire ici, yo !
Je suis vraiment désolé, mais
je dois installer des lits ŕ l'église.
Ça devient un refuge,
les nuits enneigées.
Salopard égoďste !
Il y a deux filles canons
qui viennent nous voir ici.
Tu peux laisser ouvert un peu plus ?
- On surveillera tout.
- Vous deux ? Impossible.
- Vous ignorez les bases du bar.
- Servir les canons d'abord ?
Voilŕ les clés.
Voilŕ les clés.
Dčs que vos filles arrivent,
vous éteignez les lumičres et fermez.
Je veux pas revenir
et trouver le bordel ici.
- Sérieux ?
- Je peux vous faire confiance.
<i>Pour savoir ce que ça représentait
d'avoir les clés du bar,</i>
<i>il faut que je revienne en arričre,</i>
<i>ŕ la nuit
oů j'ai sorti cinq petits mots</i>
<i>que tout homme dit
ŕ un moment dans sa vie.</i>
- On devrait avoir un bar.
- Bien sűr, on devrait avoir un bar !
- On devrait vraiment avoir un bar.
- On devrait vraiment avoir un bar.
- Notre bar serait génial.
- Et mec,
mec, mec,
mec...
Le nom de notre bar sera...
Puzzles.
Les gens feront,
"Pourquoi Puzzles ?"
C'est ça le puzzle.
C'est...
un super nom pour un bar !
Et aussi, au Puzzles :
- pas de dernier verre.
- Pas de dernier verre !
Sauf si tout le monde a fini
de passer la meilleure nuit de sa vie,
alors, on met les chaises sur les tables
et on sort la fontaine ŕ margarita.
- On devrait avoir un bar.
- On devrait avoir un bar.
<i>Comme toutes les phrases débiles
de cinq mots </i>
<i>que chaque homme dit dans sa vie...</i>
Je peux sauter aussi loin.
Je vais aller la récupérer.
Je peux vous faire confiance.
<i>... on allait le regretter.
On le savait pas encore.</i>
Vous l'avez ?
Génial ! J'arrive.
Je suis Rachel Sondheimer.
Un instant, Lily.
Si tu descends de l'avion,
oů est Marshall ?
- Et le pack de bičre ?
- C'est le problčme.
Je dois ętre ŕ <i>Brunivers</i>
dans l'East Meadow dans une heure.
- Ŕ la voiture !
- Merci.
Barman. Triple Sec.
Ça arrive, garde-robinet.
On en rachčtera une.
- Servi.
- Servi.
On en rachčtera un.
Dieu merci, vous ętes encore lŕ.
Je sais pas si vous avez vu <i>Star Wars</i>,
mais on dirait la plančte Hoth, dehors.
Prem's.
Ça me rappelle quand je faisais
de la luge avec mon pčre...
avant qu'il nous quitte.
Et prem's.
On peut vous réchauffer
avec un verre ?
Bien sűr... Au fait, j'ai invité
le reste du groupe ŕ nous rejoindre.
On a l'intention de se saouler.
Vraiment se saouler.
Comme mon pčre le faisait.
Prem's, prem's, prem's.
J'imagine qu'on pourrait rester ouvert
plus longtemps.
Tant que c'est que vous
et le groupe ?
Melissa,
quel genre de groupe est-ce ?
Nous sommes la fanfare
des Poules de combat d'Arizona Tech.
Allez, les Poules !
<i>C'est alors qu'oncle Barney et moi
avons eu une conversation télépathique.</i>
<i>Mec, Carl va nous tuer</i>
<i>si on vire pas tout le monde,
tout de suite.</i>
<i>Je suis sérieux.
On lui a promis de pas mettre le bordel.</i>
<i>Trčs bien, tu marques un point.</i>
Le bar est ouvert !
Qui veut une bičre ?
Je trouve toujours ça débile.
Qu'est devenu le "quand on műrit,
la relation műrit avec nous" ?
C'est juste un truc que Lily a lu
dans "Psychologie".
C'est bon, elle l'a lu dans "Cosmo".
D'accord, je l'ai lu dans "Cosmo".
Bon, c'était dans "Cosmo Girl".
Conduis, OK ?
Pourquoi faire toute une histoire
d'un petit rituel qu'on abandonne.
C'est plus que ça, OK ?
C'est tous nos petits rituels.
Tu sais ce qu'on faisait
dčs que je rentrais ŕ la maison ?
Je veux pas t'entendre parler
de baiser comme des lapins.
On se racontait
ce qu'on avait mangé ŕ midi.
Deux oeufs, une pizza au fromage
et des légumes vapeur.
Un petit pain, du poulet,
des bâtons de céleri et une cuillčre
de beurre de cacahučtes.
- On baise comme des lapins ?
- On baise comme des lapins.
BTI...
Beaucoup trop d'informations.
Tu sais ce qui me manque aussi ?
Le coup de fil du déjeuner.
Bébé,
c'est le déjeuner et je t'aime.
Je n'en pense pas moins.
Męme si je dois te prévenir qu'il semble
y avoir un surplus de mon côté.
Non, je t'aime encore plus.
Doit-on prendre une chambre
pour tirer tout cela au clair ?
Ça a l'air d'un bon compromis,
męme si je dois travailler
mes positions.
Je t'aime aussi.
Maintenant, quand elle appelle,
je laisse le répondeur.
Le répondeur !
Comment oses-tu ?
Ce qui me manque le plus,
c'est le bisou de minuit du Nouvel An.
C'était la tradition du Nouvel An.
Mais tu sais ce qu'on a fait,
cette année ?
- Baiser comme des lapins ?
- Non.
Tous ces petits rituels, gentils,
mignons... C'est débile.
Se dire ce qu'on a mangé ? On dirait
des gamins qui jouent ŕ la dînette.
Peut-ętre que tu trouves ça stupide
parce que t'as jamais eu
de relations qui durent
assez longtemps pour ça.
- Quoi ?
- Tu comprends rien ŕ l'amour.
T'es comme un robot qui verrait
quelqu'un pleurer et qui dirait...
"Pourquoi cet humain fuit-il ?"
Vraiment ?
D'accord... Robot en mode
gare-toi-sur-le-bas-côté
en-attendant-des-
excuses-de-l'imbécile.
Mon robot était... mille fois mieux.
Pour info, le lavabo déborde
dans la salle de bain.
Y a pas de lavabo.
Et tu sors de la cuisine.
Y a quoi dans un gin tonic ?
Y a quoi dans un gin tonic ?
Tenir un bar, c'est nul.
On ferme.
Pas de dernier verre !
Puzzles, ici Barney.
Bien, vous ętes toujours lŕ.
J'arrive dans 5 minutes.
Dernier verre.
Un chasse-neige arrive.
On doit repartir.
Tu penses qu'ętre amoureux,
c'est juste avoir des petits noms.
Ou de se laisser des mots débiles
ou de foncer dans le blizzard
sans aucune raison.
Tu comprends ce qui va se passer ?
Tu sais ce que t'es ?
T'es un snob de l'amour.
Y a plein de façons
de vivre une relation,
tu le saurais si tu quittais
ton petit club de "Snob de l'amour".
On va ętre enseveli sous la neige,
voilŕ ce qui va se passer.
Rien ŕ faire. Je vais pas rester ici
ŕ me faire insulter.
On va pas ŕ l'aéroport. On rentre.
Il s'est passé quoi ?
On a appelé tout ŕ l'heure
pour le breuvage de Seattle.
Vous avez bien fait d'appeler.
J'allais fermer.
C'est la tempęte du sičcle, dehors.
On est qu'en 2009,
alors la tempęte du sičcle,
c'est peut-ętre un peu prématuré.
Disons la tempęte de l'année.
Męme si on est en janvier.
On est plutôt pressés,
alors on va prendre la bičre.
Vous ętes un joli couple.
- Merci.
- On est pas en couple.
Dieu merci.
Ça aurait été bizarre.
La voilŕ.
"Tonic supersonique".
Non. Ça c'est un fűt.
Je veux un pack de six.
- C'est tout ce que j'ai.
- On prend le fűt.
Quoi ? Non. La derničre fois
que j'en ai eu un dans la voiture,
je me suis retrouvé ŕ enlever
du vomi séché sur le sičge
avec un couteau.
Désolée, Ranjit,
mais c'est un rituel,
et je lui ramčne cette bičre.
Si tu pouvais le mettre
dans la voiture.
Je te donnerai 50 $.
Ŕ la voiture.
Robin, je suis désolé.
T'es pas un robot.
Si tu l'es,
tu es un modčle trčs avancé,
et la race humaine
n'a aucune chance.
Tu ne choisis pas
de montrer ton amour
par des rituels ringards,
et c'est bien.
Mais peut-ętre qu'on fait ça
parce qu'on l'a toujours fait
et qu'on connaît pas
d'autres façons.
Ce que je sais c'est que
si elle est lŕ-bas assise
toute seule ŕ l'aéroport,
je dois aller la chercher.
Ce sont les rčgles.
Ferme les yeux.
Je sais pas comment tu as cru
que je te draguais, mais...
Fais-le.
Maintenant,
allons chercher ta femme.
Trčs bien, allez.
Vous ętes pas obligés de rentrer,
mais vous pouvez pas rester.
J'ai toujours voulu dire ça.
Je veux dire, dans un bar.
Je le dis tout le temps chez moi.
Un jour, on devrait avoir un bar.
Et quand on l'aura,
y aura jamais de dernier verre.
On avait dit pas de dernier verre.
On doit le faire.
On doit faire quoi ?
Carl sera lŕ d'un moment ŕ l'autre.
On peut faire qu'une chose.
S'occuper d'un bar, c'est barbant.
On devrait s'en tenir
ŕ ce qu'on connaît.
- On devrait monter un groupe.
- Mais bien sűr !
Pourquoi on a pas encore monté
un groupe ?
<i>Les enfants, parfois dans la vie,
les plančtes s'alignent,</i>
<i>tout s'enchaîne,</i>
<i>et votre timing est parfait.</i>
<i>Ce n'était pas un de ces moments.</i>
Oů est-elle ?
Seattle.
- Quoi ?
- Son vol a été annulé.
Il a jamais décollé.
Elle m'aurait appelé et...
Bébé, c'est moi.
Mon vol a été annulé
ŕ cause d'une tempęte de neige
et j'aurai pas de vol avant jeudi,
<i>je suis encore coincée ici
pour deux jours.</i>
<i>C'est l'heure du déjeuner
et je t'aime.</i>
<i>Comme je l'ai dit,
c'était une tempęte de 3 jours.</i>
- <i>Mardi.</i>
- Je pense toujours que c'est débile.
<i>Mercredi.</i>
<i>Et jeudi.</i>
<i>Donc mardi, quand Marshall
a écouté ce message...</i>
Elle revient pas avant jeudi.
On a fait tout ce chemin jusqu'ici
et elle revient pas avant jeudi.
Je me sens stupide.
Écoute, on dit rien ŕ Lily
ŕ propos de tout ça, OK ?
Surtout la partie oů tu me dragues.
Je t'ai pas dragué.
C'est ça.
<i>Puis mercredi...</i>
Mec, j'y crois pas que t'aies fait
tout ce chemin.
Tu vas devoir repartir et refaire
tout ce chemin encore demain.
Tout ça, c'était un signe.
Mettons un terme ŕ ce vieux rituel.
Je vais pas la chercher.
Robin t'a vraiment dragué ?
Mec,
c'était bizarre.
Les gars,
cette fęte est géniale !
Vous ętes de vrais amis
des Poules de combat. En cas de besoin,
n'hésitez pas ŕ demander.
La section flűte
voit-elle quelqu'un ?
Tu vas vraiment pas la chercher ?
- Vraiment.
- Alors, le baiser du Nouvel An,
les appels au déjeuner, tous les...
"j'ai mangé ça, aujourd'hui",
tu vas vraiment laisser tomber ça ?
Oui, vraiment.
<i>Ce qui nous amčne ŕ jeudi.</i>
Un muffin, un sandwich de pastrami,
et des chips.
Je sais que l'heure du déjeuner
est passée, mais je t'aime.
Je t'aime Lily,
de plus en plus chaque jour.
Bonne année.
Ça veut dire que je dois
amener une fanfare ŕ l'aéroport,
- maintenant ?
- Oui.
Merde.
Allez, les Poules !
Puzzles.
C'est un super nom de groupe.
T'as vu Amanda ?
Bingo !
<i>Kids, sophomore year of college,</i>
<i>when Lily came back
from spring break,</i>
<i>Marshall surprised her
at the airport.</i>
<i>And she surprised him with
a six-pack of locally brewed beer.</i>
Fort Lau-ger-Dale!
Get it?
<i>And with that, a ritual was born.</i>
<i>For the next 11 years, whenever
either of them would fly anywhere...</i>
Minne-Cider!
Get it?
<i>... the reunion was always
commemorated with a chauffeur sign</i>
<i>and a six-pack from
wherever they'd been.</i>
Aspen Yards Ale!
- Get it?
- Actually, no.
Me, neither.
I was hoping you would.
<i>But, one night in January of 2009,
the unthinkable happened.</i>
- I'm not picking her up.
- What?
Lily doesn't want me taking a cab
all the way to the airport
just to take a cab
all the way back, you know?
But the six-pack thing.
That stuff was fun when we were younger,
but we've grown past that.
As we mature,
the relationship matures with us.
But... you guys are such
an inspiration to the rest of us,
how you're so devoted and connected.
I look at you guys, and that's
all I want in the whole world.
Ted, there's two college girls outside,
and they look easy!
Arizona, you know,
I've always wanted to see what
an Arizona driver's license looks like.
I already ran that play. They're 21.
We're good. Thank God.
So, what brings you guys to town?
- Our band's got a gig.
- Oh, you're in a band?
- Maybe we'll come see you play.
- Excuse us for a sec.
What is the matter with you?
- We're not gonna go see them play.
- Why not?
If we see them play, we're no better
than the bleach-blonde bimbos who flash
their boobs at a Van Halen concert.
But don't those girls get to have sex
with Van Halen after the show?
If you want to have sex with Van Halen,
do it on your own time.
We are not the maybe-we-can-come-
see-you-play guys.
We're the other guys,
the older guys who never showed up
and whose approval they now crave.
- So we're their dads?
- Exactly.
It's a big meeting,
so I don't think we're gonna make it.
Maybe next time, kiddos.
If you want to meet us after your show,
maybe we could exchange numbers.
Excuse us for a minute.
Ted, have you gone completely insane?
We don't want their phone numbers.
I don't know what I was doing.
I guess I panicked out there.
When you exchange
numbers with a chick,
you give them the ability
to call and cancel.
If you set a date without a number,
they have to show up.
Check and mate!
The only digits I need are these.
Honka.
Are you still their dad?
So, why don't we just meet here
tomorrow night around 10:00.
I think it's supposed to snow.
- What do we do if there's a blizzard?
- Either way, we'll be here.
"Snow" problem.
Excuse us just one last second.
What is the problem now?
- Nice one.
- Thanks.
- We'll see you tomorrow night.
- Totally. Awesome!
"Totally. Awesome!"
Man, these college chicks
sound stupid.
- Totally.
- Awesome. So, here's the thing:
tomorrow night, dress to move;
it's gonna be a mess!
I still think we should've gotten
their numbers.
You always assume
something is gonna go wrong.
Ted, I promise you,
nothing is gonna go wrong.
It's starting to snow.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
<i>Kids,
the blizzard of '09 was a monster.</i>
<i>It snowed for three days straight,</i>
<i>which led to three amazing stories.</i>
<i>I'll start with me and Barney.</i>
It's pretty nasty out there.
I don't think they're coming.
Of course they're coming.
They have to.
If I can land just one of these girls,
I'll have party school bingo.
Come on, Ted.
You're the only one here.
Sorry.
What's party school bingo?
Every year, Playboy releases a list
of the top party schools in the country.
I take the top 25, and I make up...
a bingo card.
All I need is Arizona Tech,
which is crazy.
In league play, that would
normally be designated a free space.
So, how many people are
in on this party school bingo thing?
It's just me.
So what's the point, then?
The point is to get five in a row.
And what do you get
when you get five in a row?
I get bingo.
Thanks for coming by.
I monkeyed around with
the thermostat for about an hour
before I realized
it was the intercom.
I heard you swearing downstairs.
So, Lily's flight's coming in tonight,
you're really not gonna go pick her up?
Like I said,
as we mature,
our relationship matures with us.
Yeah, if I know your wife,
she's gonna get you
that six-pack anyway.
Puget Stout.
A most exquisite Seattle microbrew.
And speaking of six-packs...
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to the airport.
How could I be so stupid?
Of course she's bringing me a six-pack!
But this time,
I didn't bring him a six-pack.
Because... as we mature,
the relationship matures with us.
He sounds like a nice young man.
I'll bet he surprises you
and picks you up anyway.
- Where's my beer?
- We said we weren't gonna.
I have beer.
A six-pack and you're
an appropriate height for me.
Let's go, New Lily.
- Man, I got to get some beer.
- <i>Folks, this is your captain speaking.</i>
<i>Looks like we're going to be arriving
an hour early.</i>
Drink up, boys.
I'm closing the bar.
- It's only 9:00.
- And this place is ragin', yo!
Guys, I'm really sorry, but I got to go
set up cots in the church basement.
It doubles as a shelter
on snowy nights like this.
You selfish bastard!
There are two very hot girls
coming here to meet us.
Can't you leave open
a little while longer?
- We'll keep an eye on everything.
- You two? No way.
You wouldn't know the first thing
about running a bar.
Serve the hotties first?
Here's the keys.
Here's the keys.
As soon as your girls show up,
you turn off the lights and you lock up.
I don't want to come back
and find this place trashed.
- Seriously?
- I can trust you guys.
<i>To understand what it meant
to us to get the keys to MacLaren's, </i>
<i>I have to take you back a few years</i>
<i>to the night that
I uttered five little words</i>
<i>that every man at some point
in his life will say.</i>
- We should buy a bar.
- Of course, we should buy a bar!
We should totally buy a bar.
- We should totally buy a bar.
- Our bar would be awesome.
And dude, dude, dude,
dude...
the name of our bar...
Puzzles.
People will be like,
"Why is it called Puzzles?"
That's the puzzle.
That is...
a great name for a bar!
And also, at Puzzles:
no last call.
No last call!
Only when every single person
is finished having the greatest night
of his or her life do we stack
the chairs on the table
and power down the three-story
margarita waterfall.
- We should buy a bar.
- We should buy a bar.
<i>Like the other
ill-advised five-word sentences </i>
<i>every man eventually says
in his life...</i>
I can jump that far.
I'm gonna win her back.
I can trust you guys.
<i>... we would come to regret it.
We just didn't know it yet.</i>
You have it?
Awesome! I'll be right there.
I'm Rachel Sondheimer.
Wait a minute, Lily.
If you are getting off the plane,
where is Marshall?
- And where is your six-pack?
- That's the problem.
I have to get to Brewniverse
in East Meadow in an hour.
- To the Town Car!
- Thank you.
Barkeep. Triple Sec.
Coming right up, tap-minder.
We'll get one.
- Order up.
- Order up.
We'll get one.
Thank God you're still here.
I don't know if you guys have ever seen
<i>Star Wars</i>, but it's like Hoth out there.
Dibs.
It reminds me of when
I used to go sledding with my dad...
before he left.
And dibs.
So, can we warm you up with a drink?
Sure... by the way, I invited the rest
of the band to come and meet us.
We were hoping to get drunk.
I mean really drunk.
Like my dad used to.
Dibsity, dibsity, dibsity.
I guess we could keep
the place open a little bit longer.
As long as
it's just you and the band.
Melissa, what kind of band is this?
We're the Arizona Tech
Fighting Hens Marching Band.
Go, Hens!
<i>And then, your Uncle Barney and I
had one of our telepathic conversations.</i>
<i>Dude, Carl's gonna kill us</i>
<i>if we don't kick everyone
out of here right now.</i>
<i>Barney, I'm serious. We promised
we wouldn't mess the place up.</i>
<i>All right, I guess you have a point.</i>
The bar is open!
Who wants a beer?
I still say this is stupid.
What happened to, "As we mature,
the relationship matures with us"?
That's just something Lily read
in Psychology Today.
All right, she read it in Cosmo.
All right, I read it in Cosmo.
All right, it was Cosmo Girl.
Just drive, okay.
I don't get why it's such a big deal
that one little ritual
goes by the wayside.
It's not just this, okay?
It's all our little rituals.
Do you know what we used to do
every day the second I got home?
Man, I don't want to hear
about your crazy monkey sex.
We would tell each other
what we had to eat that day.
Two eggs, a slice of cheese pizza
and some steamed veggies.
Everything bagel, chicken breast,
some celery sticks
and a spoon of peanut butter.
- Crazy monkey sex?
- Crazy monkey sex.
TMI...
too many informations.
You know what else I miss?
Our lunchtime phone call.
Baby, it's lunchtime,
and I love you.
I reciprocate in principle.
Although with the caveat
that there seems
to be a bit of a surplus here
on my end.
No, I love you more.
Do we need to get in a room together
and bang this thing out?
Those sound like agreeable terms,
although I may need
adjust my briefs.
Love you, too.
But today when she called,
I let it go to voice mail.
Voice mail!
How could you?!
The thing I miss most is kissing
at midnight on New Year's Eve.
It was a New Year's tradition.
But you know what we did this year?
- Crazy monkey sex?
- No.
Okay, all these cute, adorable
little rituals... They're stupid.
Telling each other what you had to eat?
You're like children playing house.
Maybe you just think they're stupid
because you've never been
in a relationship long enough
to develop them.
- What?
- You don't understand love.
Okay, you're like some robot
who sees a person crying and says...
"Why is that human leaking?"
Is that right?
Well, then... Robot initiating
pull-over-to-the- side-of-the-road-
until-jackass-apologizes-
to-me sequence.
My robot was like,
a million times better.
So you know, the trough
in the bathroom is overflowing.
There's no trough in the bathroom.
And you just came out
of the kitchen.
What's in a gin and tonic?
What's in a gin and tonic?
Running a bar sucks.
Let's just close up.
There's no last call.
Puzzles, go for Barney.
Good. You're still there.
I'll be there in five.
Last call.
There's a snowplow coming.
We have to get back on the road.
You think the only way to be
in love is to have pet names.
Or leave each other stupid,
little notes
or go charging off into a blizzard
for no good reason.
Do you understand
what's going to happen?
You know what you are?
You're a love snob.
There's lots of ways
to be in a relationship,
you would know that if you ever left
your little love snob country club.
We're going to get buried by snow.
That's going to happen.
No, screw this. I'm not going
to sit here and be insulted.
We're not going to the airport.
We're going home.
What just happened?
We called earlier
about the Seattle microbrew.
Good thing you called when you did.
I was getting ready to close up.
Storm of the century out there.
Of course, it's only '09,
so storm of the century might be
a little bit premature.
Let's say storm of the year.
Although, it is only January.
We're in kind of a hurry,
so, we'll take the beer now.
You are a cute couple.
- Thank you.
- We're not a couple.
Thank God.
That would be weird.
Here she is.
"Supersonic Tonic."
No. This is a keg.
I need a six-pack.
- A keg's all I got.
- We'll take the keg.
What? Oh, no.
Last time I had one of these in the car,
I wound up chipping dried vomit
off the seat
with a putty knife.
I'm sorry, Ranjit,
but this is a ritual
and I am bringing him this beer.
If you could just put it in the car.
I'll give you 50 bucks.
To the Town Car.
Robin, I'm sorry.
You're not a robot.
If you are, you're,
like, an incredibly advanced model,
and the human race
doesn't stand a chance.
You just don't choose
to show your love
through corny rituals,
and that's fine.
But maybe the reason Lily and I do
is because we always have,
and we don't know any other way.
One thing I do know is that
if she's there sitting
at the airport alone,
I have to go get her.
Those are the rules.
Marshall, close your eyes.
I don't know how you heard
any of that as me hitting on you, but...
Just do it.
Now let's go get your woman.
All right, come on.
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.
I've always wanted to say that.
I mean, in a bar.
I say it all the time at home.
Dude, someday we should buy a bar.
And when we do,
we are never going to have last call.
Come on, Barney. We said no last call.
We've got to mean it.
Well, what are we supposed to do?
Carl's going to be here any minute.
Only one thing we can do.
Dude, running a bar
is a pain in the ass.
We should just stick
with what we know.
- We should start a band.
- Of course we should start a band!
How have we not started a band yet?
<i>Kids, sometimes in life
the planets align,</i>
<i>everything links up,</i>
<i>and your timing is perfect.</i>
<i>This wasn't one of those times.</i>
Where is she?
Seattle.
- What?
- Her flight's canceled.
It never took off.
She would've called me and...
Baby, it's me.
My flight's been canceled
because of some snowstorm
and they couldn't rebook me
till Thursday,
<i>so I'm stuck here
for another two days.</i>
<i>But it's lunchtime, and I love you.</i>
<i>Like I said,
this was a three-day storm.</i>
- <i>Tuesday.</i>
- I still say this is stupid.
Wednesday.
- <i>And Thursday.</i>
- ... microbrew.
<i>So on Tuesday when Marshall
heard that message...</i>
She's not coming in till Thursday.
I mean, we came all the way down here,
and she's not coming in till Thursday.
I feel so stupid.
Look, let's just, let's not tell Lily
about any of this, okay?
Especially the part
about you hitting on me.
I didn't hit on you.
Exactly.
<i>Then on Wednesday...</i>
Man, I can't believe you drove
all the way out there.
Now you're gonna turn around and drive
all the way out there again tomorrow.
This whole thing was a sign, you know?
It's time to put that old ritual to bed.
I'm not going to pick her up.
Robin really hit on you?
Dude,
it was weird.
Bros,
this party is awesome!
You are true friends
of the Fighting Hens.
If you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.
Is the flute section seeing anyone?
So, wait, you're really
not going to pick her up?
- Really.
- So the New Year's kiss,
the lunchtime phone calls,
the whole
"this is what I ate today" thing,
you're really letting it all go?
I really am.
<i>Which brings us to Thursday.</i>
A muffin, a pastrami sandwich,
and a bag of chips.
And I know it's way past
lunchtime, but I love you.
More and more each day,
I love you, Lily.
Happy New Year.
Wait, does this mean that I have
to bring a marching band to the airport
- from now on?
- Absolutely.
Crap.
Go, Hens!
Puzzles.
That is a great band name.
Have you seen Amanda?
Bingo!
C'est dingue que Metro News One
te renvoie ce courrier que maintenant.
Oui, je suis partie depuis 4 mois.
T'as plus de fans que je pensais.
Et seulement 60% d'entre eux

Ces gars pensent quoi ?
Je suis loin de ma phase

<i>Mais il y avait une lueur d'espoir.</i>
- Salut.
- Comment s'est passée l'audition ?
J'y suis allée trčs confiante.
Je savais que c'était juste moi
contre deux autres filles.
J'écoute.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
Et vous ętes ?
Vous n'avez manifestement
jamais été ŕ Denver.
Rochelle Harper, News Center 12.
On était juste
la 1re chaîne des Rockies pendant...
5 années de suite.
J'étais présentatrice ici
pour Metro News One.
Présentatrice.
Vous devez avoir un super finish.
- Pardon ?
- Vous devez avoir un super finish.
Comme Walter Cronkite :
"Et c'est comme ça que c'est."
C'est quoi, la vôtre ?
Je finissais toujours avec un simple
"De nous tous ŕ Metro News One,
passez une bonne soirée."
La mienne :
"De nous tous

T'as pas laissé ces garces
te déstabiliser, non ?
... et l'équipe économique
du président
espčre avoir une proposition
avant le Congrčs
d'ici la fin du mois.
De nous tous ŕ News 10,

Donc, bonne nuit, New York.
Et que la route devant vous

C'est terrible.
Et mauvais...

C'est pas fini.
Levez-vous, New York.
Ayez confiance.
Recyclez.
Sortez couverts.
Sortez couverts ?
Je vais pas ętre présentatrice
ŕ Channel 10, non ?
Ça vient de tomber.
Le problčme, c'est peut-ętre ton CV.
T'as vu comme le mien est aéré ?
Le tien est trop chargé.
Comme si tout sur ton CV
est si important ?
"Directeur des programmes,
Radio de l'université de Wesleyan" ?
- Mon Dieu.
- Dr X ?
Tu parles toujours de Dr X ?
- C'est qui, Dr X ?
- Personne ne sait.
- C'était un mystérieux et génial DJ.
- C'était Ted.
Son identité est toujours secrčte.
C'était Ted.
Mais ce fantôme des ondes a changé
la face de la radio du campus.
- C'était Ted.
- L'émission était nulle.

Non. On va pas se laisser faire.

Oui, je suis sűre que je peux

Non, les gars...

Non. La procédure pour officialiser ça

Oui, pourquoi pas ?

Ouah, ça fait peur.
Plus communément appelé

Allez !
Tendinite du psoas iliaque.
C'est le nom. C'est le seul nom.
Tendinite du psoas iliaque.
C'est une blessure de basket.
Enfin, rien d'incroyable.
La hanche du danseur,
Marshall a la hanche du danseur.
OK, non. Ils l'appellent comme ça
parce que c'est trčs fréquent
chez les danseurs de ballet.
Dis-moi,
les autres petites filles de ta classe
ont la hanche du danseur ?
- Bien sűr.
- J'ai une question technique.
Est-ce plus facile de danser quand on
n'a pas de parties génitales externes ?
Bien, allez-y,

Allez, les gars.
Il ne s'est pas blessé en dansant.
Merci, Lily.
Manifestement,

Ce dont tu as besoin,
c'est d'un super CV vidéo.
Comme le mien.
Je vous présente :
Barneysvideocv.com.
Bonjour.
<i>Barney Stinson, vous avez réalisé
de grandes réussites dans le business,</i>
<i>le sport
et les relations personnelles,</i>
<i>et avez été une inspiration
pour beaucoup de gens.</i>
C'est toi ?
Tu t'interviewes toi-męme ?
Comment ça pourrait ętre moi ?
C'est un Anglais.
<i>Que recommanderiez-vous
ŕ vos nombreux admirateurs</i>
<i>qui voudraient atteindre
le sommet de leur potentiel ?</i>
Et un peu écossais.
La premičre chose
ŕ savoir sur le succčs
c'est qu'il ne viendra pas ŕ vous.
La plupart des gens associent le succčs
ŕ l'argent et au pouvoir,
mais en fait,
c'est un état d'esprit.
Tu devais ętre sur une moto
pour dire ça ?
Et lorsqu'on parle de succčs, la seule
limite est qu'il n'y a pas de limite.
Tu sais te tenir ŕ côté d'un cheval.
Impressionnant.
Barney, je comprends pas.
Tu fais rien du tout dans ces clips.
Parfaitement. Parce que c'est
ce que le monde du travail veut.
Des gens qui ont l'air de savoir
prendre des risques,
mais qui ne font jamais rien.
En fait, faire des choses
vous fera virer.
J'écris un livre sur ce phénomčne.
Vraiment ?
Non, ce serait faire...
Vous écoutez ?
Toute ma vie, j'ai osé aller
au-delŕ du possible.
Jusqu'ŕ l'impossible ?
En fait, au-delŕ de ça...
ŕ l'endroit oů le possible
et l'impossible se rencontrent
pour devenir...
le possimpossible.
Le possimpossible ?
Ah oui ?
Inventer votre propre mot
montre la créativité et la vision...
"Visia-tivité".
Si je peux vous laisser
avec une pensée, c'est celle-lŕ :
rien...
et tout...
n'est possimpossible.
<i>Ce mec est génial.</i>
C'est encore toi... ?
Tu chantes une chanson sur toi ?
Absolument pas.
Ce serait débile.
<i>Stinson, Barney Stinson</i>
<i>chantant cette chanson,</i>
<i>ce serait vraiment débile.</i>
<i>Un des admirateurs
qui pense que ce mec est génial.</i>
<i>Parfait et disponible.</i>
<i>Génial, génial, génial,
génial, génial, génial...</i>
<i>Génial, génial.</i>
BARNEY STINSON, ENGAGÉ
Ce bijou m'a valu
11 offres d'emploi.
Impossible.
- Barney, c'était ridicule et insensé.
- Insens-ule.
- Fais-m'en un.
- Quoi ?
- Maintenant, on en parle.
- Quoi ? Je vais ętre expulsée.
- J'essaierais n'importe quoi.
- OK, on devrait s'y mettre.
J'ai beaucoup ŕ filmer, je peux pas
utiliser les bandes que j'ai de toi.
Des bandes sur moi ?
Commençons.
Chéri. Tu es toujours fâché
pour la blague du danseur ?
On plaisantait. On sait tous
que c'est une blessure de basket.
Oui, tout ŕ fait.
- J'ai quelque chose ŕ te dire.
- Quoi ?
Je danse plus que vous le pensez.
Quoi ?
Je danse...
plus que vous le pensez.
Je sais pas quoi répondre ŕ ça.
Qu'est-ce ça signifie ętre
un reporter pour toi ?
- Depuis que je suis petite...
- Coupez !
Tu t'enlises dans les détails.
Il faut que tu sois vague,
ŕ l'aise avec les mots ŕ la mode,
comme "synergie" et "dynamisme".
Tu peux inventer un mot, comme...
"relationalité."
Comment le fait de me sentir idiote
me fera engager quelque part ?
Trčs bien.
Ne le fais pas.
Il y a beaucoup d'histoires
excitantes ŕ couvrir au Canada.
Je viens de lire ça,
le neveu du maire de Winnipeg
est allé pęcher sur la glace
et a pris une perche de 7 kg.
En direct du pire endroit au monde,
je suis Robin Scherbatsky.
Fais tourner la caméra.
- Connectitude.
- J'aime ça.
Transformatation.
Vas-y !
Relationalité.
Relationalité, c'est ŕ moi.
De combien de danses parlons-nous ?
Je sais pas... Je pense.
Je dirais...
moyen.
Pourquoi tu danses autant,
et pourquoi j'en sais rien ?
Je fais ça quand je suis seul.
Quand quelque chose de bon arrive,
je suis excité
et je dois bouger, et je...
Je sais pas,
je veux plus parler de ça.
Tu t'es blessé ŕ la hanche
comme ça ?
T'es au courant ?
Ils nous donnent la demi-journée.
On peut partir ŕ 14 h.
Super !
Merci, Herm.
Ces vętements sont ridicules.
En plus, l'armure de la princesse
amazone me démange.
Cartes sur table.
T'es pas la premičre ŕ porter ça, ici.
Mais ça exprime le pouvoir.
Et ça aussi.
Maintenant, j'ai besoin que tu casses
ces 15 briques avec ton front.
Quoi ?
Mais tu fais rien du tout
dans ta vidéo.
Tu étais juste ŕ côté d'un cheval
et assis sur une moto.
Je suis un homme.
Tu es une femme. On suppose
que vous ne pouvez rien faire.
Vous devez prouver
que la société a tort.
Je peux pas casser 15 briques
avec mon front.
On est plus en 1950.
Oui, tu peux.
- Je me tire.
- Pourquoi ?
Ça va pas m'aider
ŕ trouver un boulot.
Je vais me faire expulser.
Je sais quoi faire.

de ce soir sont...
17...
- Arręte-la.
- Attendez.
Pourquoi elle le dit comme ça ?
C'est comme si elle se fichait
que le 17 sorte.
- Elle a l'air méchante.
- Oui, elle a l'air super méchante.
Vous pouvez redire "17" pour nous ?
17.
Je comprends męme pas
ce qu'elle fait.
Laisse-moi essayer un truc.
Essayez d'ętre
un peu plus désabusée.
Désabusée ?
Sur le 17 ?
Désabusée avec un petit...
- Pétillement.
- ... pétillement.
17.
C'était génial !
Je t'ai pris une bičre light. Je sais
que les danseurs comptent les calories.
C'est pas drôle.
Le docteur dit que si ça empire,
je devrais me faire opérer.
Comme un rajeunissement vaginal ?
Tu sais qui n'a pas opéré
plein de vagins ŕ la fac ?
- Qui ?
- Dr X.
Il était parfait !
Vous savez quoi ?
Les deux génies
vont devoir enlever
ces conneries de leur CV.
Tu n'es plus le Dr X,
et tu ne peux plus faire de dunk.
Oubliez.
Marshall et moi sommes les seuls ici
avec des conneries sur nos CV ?
Qu'est-ce que tu insinues ?
Je sais pas !
Est-ce que le 4 juillet 1995
ne te rappelle rien ?
Espčce d'enfoiré.
Fin !
Et le nouveau champion
avec 29 hot dogs,
Lily "Le Ventre" Aldrin.
En quoi c'est lié
ŕ ton boulot de maîtresse ?
Ça apprend aux gamins...
que je peux manger
beaucoup d'hot dogs trčs vite.
Oui, mais tu ne peux plus !
Tu peux plus dunker,
hanche en carton !
Comment oses-tu ?
Ces hanches peuvent...
Les gars !
J'ai męme pas été prise
comme fille du loto.
Je dois repartir au Canada.
J'y crois pas.
Je me rappelle la nuit
avant de partir.
Ils m'ont fait une fęte d'adieu.
Ils m'ont donné un appareil pour faire
des photos et les envoyer ŕ la maison.
Tout le monde était sűr
que j'aurai beaucoup de succčs.
Vous allez vraiment me manquer.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Robin doit repartir au Canada.
Oh, mon Dieu. C'est horrible.
Ça va ętre long de faire la navette.
Que veux-tu dire ?
J'ai fini ton CV vidéo moi-męme.
Je l'ai posté
ŕ toutes les chaînes de la ville.
Un mec de Channel 8 a appelé.
Il t'adore.
Il veut que tu passes une audition.
- Mon Dieu !
- J'ai dit non.
Robin Scherbatsky n'auditionne pas.
On lui donne le boulot ou rien.
- Alors, j'ai le boulot.
- Non. Il m'a maudit et a raccroché.
Mais aprčs, Channel 12 a appelé.
Ils t'adorent aussi.
Ils t'offrent d'animer
leur nouveau talk-show du matin.
- C'est incroyable !
- Je les ai envoyés chier.
- Mec !
- Ils te voulaient encore plus.
Alors, ils ont augmenté
leur offre de 10%.
Félicitations.
On dirait que tu vas devoir rester.
- Tu vas pas te mettre ŕ danser ?
- Ça va.
Plus tard.
Comment t'as fait ça ?
Je suis le maître du possimpossible.
En effet.
Merci.
<i>Donc, grâce ŕ votre oncle Barney,
on a pu garder votre tante Robin.</i>
<i>Et les autres ont décidé qu'il était
temps d'abandonner certaines choses.</i>
<i>Enfin, sauf Lily.</i>
Celui-lŕ est bon.
Et... fin !
Quel est le total ?
33 !

Pourquoi personne ne vient

I can't believe Metro News One is just
forwarding you all this fan mail now.
I know. I quit like four months ago.
You had more fans than I thought.
And only about 60%
of them are prison inmates.
What are these guys thinking?
I am way past
my "dating prisoners" phase.
It's like, hello,
I'm not 19 anymore.
- Lottery Girl's on.
- I just feel sorry for these women.
This is where broadcast careers
go to die.
Check it out. I make it fun.
I invented a little game.
<i>Tonight's Lotto numbers are...</i>
<i>19...</i>
Age you moved to New York
after a photographer "discovered"
you at a food court
and said he'd get you
in Vogue magazine.
<i>53...</i>
Number of semi-nude pictures
he took of you
before you realized he had
no connection to <i>Vogue magazine</i>.
<i>22...</i>
Age you claim you are.
<i>31...</i>
Age you actually are.
<i>45...</i>
Number of minutes it would take me
to get you into a cab,
out of your dress,
and into my jacuzzi.
<i>And tonight's Super Big Ball is...</i>
What happens after
we get out of the jacuzzi.
What up?
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
<i>Kids, by the winter of 2009,
Robin had been unemployed for months.</i>
<i>But there was a glimmer of hope.</i>
- Hey.
- How'd the audition go?
Well, I went in there
feeling really good.
I heard it was just me up
against two other girls.
Listening.
- Hi.
- Hi.
And you are?
You've obviously never spent
any time in Denver.
Rochelle Harper, News Center 12.
We were only the number-one
station in the Rockies for
five straight years.
I was an anchor here in town
at Metro News One.
An anchor.
You must have
a killer sign off phrase.
Sorry?
You gotta have
a killer sign off phrase.
Like Walter Cronkite:
"And that's the way it is."
So what's yours?
Well, I would just
always end with a simple
"From all of us here at Metro News One,
have a good evening."
Mine is:
"From all of us here
at Barney's apartment, get out."
You didn't let those reporter bitches
psych you out, did you?
... and the President's
economic team
is hoping to have a proposal
before Congress
by the end of the month.
From all of us here at News Ten,
have a good evening.
So, good night, New York.
And may the road ahead
be lit with dreams
and tomorrows.
Which are lit with dreams...
also.
That's terrible.
And bad...
also.
I wasn't done.
Stand tall, New York.
Trust worthy.
Recycling.
Wear a condom.
Wear a condom?
I'm not gonna be the new
Channel Ten anchor, am I?
This just in.
Maybe the problem is your <i>résumé</i>.
See how mine is lean and mean?
Yours is too cluttered.
Oh, like everything
on your résumé is so relevant?
"Program Director,
88.1 Wesleyan University Radio"?
- Oh, God.
- Dr. X?
You're still bragging about Dr. X?
- Who was Dr. X?
- Nobody knows.
- He was this genius mystery D.J.
- It was Ted.
His identity
remains a secret to this day.
It was Ted.
But this phantom of the airwaves
changed the very face of college radio.
- It was Ted.
- And your show sucked.
<i>Dr. X here, shooting truth bullets
at you from an undisclosed location.</i>
<i>Because if they knew where I was,
they'd shut me down.</i>
You're on the third floor
of the Student Center
next to the game room, you tool.
<i>I've been getting a lot of letters
about my segment</i>
<i>on how racist
the school's meal plan is.</i>
How are you getting letters if no one
knows where you are, douche?
<i>That's why
I'm organizing a happening </i>
<i>outside the dining hall,
Monday at midnight.</i>
<i>It's high time the Food Service
puppet masters</i>
<i>took ignorance
and injustice off the menu.</i>
<i>Ted, we need a fourth for foosball.</i>
<i>- What are you doing in here, anyway?
- Dude, get out of here!</i>
<i>I'll be there in a second.</i>
<i>So remember, dining hall,
Monday, midnight.</i>
<i>Another Dr. X happening.</i>
<i>I'll be there, because X
marks the spot-ot-ot-ot-ot...</i>
If you think people liked your show,
they did not-ot-ot-ot...
This is weird. Look
what got mixed in with your fan mail.
- What?
- It's from the U.S.
Department of Immigration.
It's postmarked two months ago.
- Oh, boy.
- What is it?
It's about my work visa.
Unless I can find
a job in the next...
seven days, they're gonna
send me back to Canada.
I can't believe you might be
kicked out of the country.
I know. My whole life is here.
No. We won't let this happen.
One of us will help you find a job.
Yeah, I bet I can get you
something at my school.
No, guys...
It doesn't work.
Robin only gets her work visa
if she gets a job in her field.
You know what, I guess you could stay
if you married a U.S. citizen.
Yeah, that could work.
Oh, no. They could never process that
and make it official in time.
That won't work.
I'm screwed.
I've been sending out my reel
for 3 months, and nothing.
Maybe there's something in your reel
that people aren't responding to.
Let's take a look at it, right?
That's a good question, Norm.
The first thing is from
when I was a cub reporter
for Channel 22 in Red Deer.
In Alberta.
In Canada.
Well, the snow's coming down
pretty hard,
but these intrepid fishermen
are still happy to be out competing
in Lake Athabasca's
Bass Fishing Jamboree,
an August 1st tradition.
Back to you, Norm.
What? That was my first job.
It shows where I came from.
Unless a bear attacks you
in the next three seconds
and you snap its neck with your legs,
that has no business being on your reel.
No, no, I get it, I get it.
Where you're from
is part of who you're selling.
For instance, under "special skills"
on my <i>résumé</i>, I mention that
back in Minnesota, I was the 1995
Nicollet County Slam Dunk Champion.
You put dunk champion
on your <i>résumé</i>?
Yeah, why wouldn't you?
A lot of companies
have basketball teams.
It's good for them
to know that VanillaThunder
can still take the rock to the hole.
- They called you Vanilla Thunder?
- Yeah, Vanilla Thunder.
The Ghost in the Post.
The Human Turnstile.
I didn't...
I didn't play that much D.
You can't still dunk.
Of course I can.
Well, I mean I could...
- until... until recently.
- Until the injury.
It's called iliopsoas tendonitis.
Oh, Yikes. That sounds bad.
It's more commonly known
as dancer's hip.
Dr. Goodman...
Oh, come on!
Iliopsoas tendonitis. That's what
it's called. That's all it's called.
Iliopsoas tendonitis.
It's a basketball injury.
You know, it's no big whoop.
Dancer's hip, Marshall has something
called dancer's hip.
OK, no, no.
They only call it that, look
because it's very common
with ballet dancers.
So, tell me,
do any of the other little girls
in your class have dancer's hip?
- Yeah, sure.
- I have more of a technical question.
Is it easier to dance when
you don't have external genitalia?
Good, don't build to that,
just go right for it.
Guys, come on. Marshall
didn't get this injury from dancing.
Thank you, Lily.
Clearly, the stirrups were set
a little too wide
during his last trip to the gyno.
Guys, I hate to cut you off
before Marshall bursts into tears,
but, Robin, check this out.
What you need
is an awesome video <i>résumé</i>.
Like mine.
I present:
Barneysvideoresume.com.
Hello.
<i>Barney Stinson, you've achieved
great success in business,</i>
<i>athletics and personal relationships</i>
<i>and have been an inspiration
to many people.</i>
Is that you?
Are you interviewing yourself?
How can it be me?
That guy's British.
<i>What would you recommend
to your numerous admirers</i>
<i>who want to reach
their highest potential?</i>
And a wee bit Scottish.
The first thing you need to know
about success
is that it doesn't just come to you.
Most people associate success
with money and power,
but really it's a state of mind.
You had to be
on a motorcycle to say that?
And when it comes to success the only
limit is that there are no limits.
I didn't know you knew how to stand
near a horse; that's impressive.
Barney, I don't get it. You don't do
a damn thing in any of these clips.
Exactly. Because that's who
corporate American wants...
people who seem
like bold risk takers,
but never actually do anything.
Actually doing things
gets you fired.
In fact, I'm writing a book
on this very phenomenon.
Really?
No, that would be doing some...
Are you even listening?
All my life, I have dared to go
past what is possible.
To the impossible?
Actually, past that...
to the place where the possible
and the impossible meet
to become...
the possimpible.
The possimpible?
Really?
Inventing your own word shows
creativity and vision...
"Vizha-tivity."
If I can leave you
with one thought, it's this:
Nothing...
and everything...
is possimpible.
<i>That guy's awesome</i>
Is that you agai...?
Are you singing a song
about yourself?
Absolutely not.
That would be lame.
<i>Stinson, Barney Stinson</i>
<i>singing this song</i>
<i>That would be really lame</i>
<i>One of the many admirers
who think that guy's awesome</i>
<i>Perfect and available</i>
<i>Awesome, awesome, awesome,
awesome, awesome, awesome...</i>
<i>Awesome, awesome</i>
That baby got me 11 job offers.
No way.
Barney, that was
ridiculous and insane.
Insane-ulous.
- Make me one.
- What?
- Yes, now you're talking.
- What? I'm about to be deported.
- I'll try anything.
- Okay, we better get started.
There's a lot to shoot, I can't use any
of the footage I already have of you.
What footage do you
already have of me?
Let's just get started.
Sweetie. Are you still upset about
the dancer's hip jokes?
We were just kidding.
We all know it's a basketball injury.
Yeah, totally.
- I have something I need to tell you.
- What is it?
I dance more than you know.
What?
I dance...
more than you know.
I don't know how to respond to that.
What does being
a reporter mean to you?
- Well, ever since I was a little kid...
- Cut!
You're getting bogged down
in specifics.
I need you to just say vague,
confident-sounding buzzwords,
like "synergy" and "dynamism".
You can make up a word, like...
"linkativity."
How will sounding like an idiot
get me hired anywhere?
Okay, fine.
Don't do it.
Anyway, there are plenty of exciting
stories to cover back in Canada.
I just read that
the mayor of Winnipeg's nephew
went ice fishing and caught
himself a 16-pound walleye.
Reporting live from the worst place
in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
Fine. Roll camera.
- Connectitude.
- Love it.
Transformatation.
Earn it!
Linkativity.
Yeah, linkativity's mine.
So, how much dancing
are we talking about?
I don't... I guess
I'd say...
medium.
Why are you dancing so much,
and why don't I know about it?
It's something I do when I'm alone.
Like if something good happens,
I get excited and I need
to move, and I just...
I don't know. I don't want
to even talk about this anymore.
So that's how you injured your hip?
Hey, did you hear?
They're giving us a half day today.
We can leave at 2:00.
Great!
Thanks, Herm.
These costumes are ridiculous.
Plus, the Amazon Warrior
Princess armor gave me a rash.
Cards on the table. You weren't
the first lady to wear that in here.
But it conveyed power.
And so will this.
What I need you to do now...
is break these 15 bricks
with your forehead.
What?
But you didn't do a damn thing
in your video.
You just stood near a horse
and sat on a motorcycle.
That's because I'm a man.
You're a woman. The assumption
is that you can't do anything.
But you have to prove society wrong.
I can't break 15 bricks
with my forehead.
It's not 1950 anymore.
Yes, you can.
- I'm out of here.
- What? Why?
None of this is going to help me
get a job.
I'm about to get kicked out
of the country.
I know what I have to do.
Is this where the Lottery Girl
auditions are?
Yeah, right here.
<i>So, your Aunt Robin
had reached her low point.</i>
<i>She was auditioning to be
the Lottery Girl.</i>
And tonight's Lotto numbers are...
Hold it. Say the line
before you press the button.
- It builds the suspense.
- It builds the suspense.
And tonight's Lotto numbers are...
seventeen...
- Stop her.
- Hold it.
Why did she say it like that?
It's like she's not even happy
about the 17 coming up.
She seems mean.
Yeah, she seems super-mean.
Can you take
another run at "17" for us?
Seventeen.
I don't even understand
what she's doing.
Let me try something.
Try being a little more wry.
Wry?
About the number 17?
Wry, with a little bit of a...
- Twinkle.
- ... twinkle.
Seventeen.
That was great!
I got you a light beer. I know how you
dancers are always counting calories.
It's not funny, all right?
The doctor says
if it gets any worse,
I might need surgery.
Vaginal rejuvenation surgery?
You know who didn't do a lot of
operating on vaginas in college?
- Who?
- Dr. X.
He did just fine!
You know what?
Both of you geniuses
need to take that weak-ass
crap off your <i>résumés</i>.
I mean, you are not Dr. X anymore,
and you cannot dunk anymore.
Let it go.
So Marshall and I are the only
people at this table
with "weak-ass crap" on their <i>résumés</i>.
What are you implying?
I don't know!
Does the date July 4, 1995
mean anything to you?
You son of a bitch.
Time!
And the new champion,
with 29 hot dogs,
Lily "The Belly" Aldrin.
How is that relevant
to teaching kindergarten?
It teaches kids that...
I can eat a lot of
hot dogs very quickly.
Yeah, but you can't do it anymore!
You can't dunk anymore, Ladyhips!
How dare you!
These hips can...
Guys, guys!
I didn't even get
the Lotto Girl gig.
I have to move back to Canada.
I can't believe this.
I remember the night
before I moved down here.
They threw
a going-away party for me.
They gave me a camera so I could
take pictures and send them home.
And everyone was so sure
I was gonna be such a big success.
I'm really gonna miss you guys.
What happened?
Robin has to move back to Canada.
Oh, my God. How awful.
I mean, for one thing
it's gonna be a really long commute.
What do you mean?
I finished your video resume
on my own.
Messengered it to every station
in the city.
A guy from Channel Eight called.
He loved you.
He wanted you to come in
and audition.
My God!
I told him no.
Robin Scherbatsky doesn't audition.
He gives you the job or nothing.
- So I got the job?
- No. He cursed me out and hung up.
But then Channel 12 called.
They also loved you.
They offered you a job hosting
their new morning talk show.
- Barney, that's amazing!
- I told them to shove it.
- Dude!
- Which only made them want you more.
So, they jacked up their offer
by ten percent.
Congratulations.
It looks like
you're gonna have to stay.
- You're not about to dance, are you?
- I'm good.
I'll do it later.
How did you pull this off?
I am the master of the possimpible.
You really are.
Thank you.
<i>So, thanks to your Uncle Barney,
we got to keep your Aunt Robin.</i>
<i>And the rest of us decided
it was time to let some things go.</i>
<i>Well, except for Lily.</i>
You got this.
And... time!
What's the count?
Thirty-three!
Why is no one coming
to my Happenings?
Regarde.
Trois magnifiques blondes buvant
du jus de mauvaise décision à 8 h.
Joli radar à poitrine.
- C'est ma femme.
- Non, faut que j'y aille.
Sérieux ? Elles sont blondes
et bourrées.
C'est pas ton type ?
Peut-être que j'ai pas de type.
Mon Dieu, tu penses
que l'esprit du mâle est vraiment
si simpliste,
qu'on a tous un type favori ?
Seigneur.
Asiatique, gros seins.
Je vais aux toilettes,
puis je m'en vais.
Vous avez remarqué que Barney
est bizarre ces derniers temps ?
En fait, oui. Vous savez,
il offre jamais de fleurs à une fille,
car les choses vivantes
rappellent les bébés ?
- Oui.
- L'autre jour,
je l'ai vu chez un fleuriste
sur la 82e,
- il achetait des roses.
- Quoi ?
Maintenant que tu le dis,
Barney a fait un truc bizarre,
hier, au bureau.
D'accord, à samedi.
Je pensais à un brunch,
et peut-être à une randonnée.
Je t'aime aussi.
Je pensais qu'il parlait juste
à une fille qu'il voulait sauter.
Ou Ted, mais maintenant,
je sais plus.
Vous pensez qu'il est possible
que Barney Stinson
ait une copine ?
À plus.
Attends. Tu vas où ?
Nulle part.
À la plage. C'est l'hiver.
Au Lazer Tag.
À la maison. Tais-toi !
C'est toi qui vas quelque part.
Mon Dieu.
Il va la voir maintenant.
- Où va Barney ?
- Ouais.
On est même plus dans Manhattan.
Où vit cette fille ?
On parle d'une femme
à laquelle Barney Stinson s'est attaché.
Je vote pour Narnia.
Il s'arrête.
- Vous faites quoi, ici ?
- Elle est où ?
- Qui ?
- Ta copine.
T'as vraiment pas de type, hein ?
Ce sont mes amis,
Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin.
Les gars,
voici Loretta.
- Ma mère.
- Ravie de vous rencontrer.
J'ai l'impression
de déjà vous connaître.
Barney n'arrête pas
de parler de vous, tous les jours.
Tu appelles ta mère, tous les jours ?
Maman !
Alors, c'est ça
que tu nous cachais ?
Tu voulais pas qu'on sache
que tu es un petit garçon à sa maman.
Oui, vous m'avez eu.
J'imagine que vous pouvez partir.
- Bonjour.
- Salut.
Qui sont ces gens ?
Je vous présente Betty...
ma femme.
Et mon fils, Tyler.
Synchro : ShalimarFox, Arrow

Venusia, tactactac

Betty et moi allons préparer le dîner.
Il y en aura pour tout le monde.
Mais oublie pas, un seul pain de viande,
après ce qu'a dit le Dr Grossbard
- sur ton cholestérol.
- Elle veut que je vive longtemps.
Coupable.
- Je t'aime.
- Moi aussi.
- Moi au-sept !
- Va-t-en, petite fripouille !
- Je vous revois au bar ?
- C'est quoi, ça, Barney ?
C'est une longue histoire.
Comme vous le savez,
mon père a dû quitter ma mère
quand j'étais un bébé, car il est devenu
présentateur du Juste Prix.
- Très bonne émission.
- Bob Barker est ton père.
Elle a dû élever mon frère et moi,
toute seule.
Et son seul souhait
était que ses fils
ne finissent pas seuls, comme elle.
Et il y a 7 ans,
elle est tombée malade.
Je ne pensais pas
qu'elle allait s'en sortir.
Donc, j'ai décidé
de réaliser son souhait.
Maman.
C'est Betty.
On est fiancés.
J'ai engagé une actrice
pour jouer ma fiancée "Betty".
Son vrai nom est Margaret.
Elle fait surtout des petits théâtres.
Superbe actrice.
À ça d'un Molière.
J'en dirai pas plus. C'est politique.
Je devrais pas en parler.
Mais il y a un problème.
Betty a une légère tendance
à improviser.
Tu vois, maman ? J'ai trouvé
quelqu'un qui me rend heureux.
Comme tu le voulais.
C'est magnifique.
J'aurais aimé pouvoir rester
pour les petits-enfants.
Je suis enceinte !
Et puis, ma mère alla mieux.
C'était miraculeux.
Mais je devais garder "Betty"
et faire un casting
pour trouver mon fils, Tyler.
C'est dingue. T'as réellement
casté ton propre fils ?
Pendant un temps, il m'a suffi
d'emprunter/garder le bébé des voisins.
Et une fois à Noël,
ma mère était bourrée au grog,
je m'en suis sorti avec un sac de farine
et un masque de Chucky.
Mais finalement,
j'ai dû faire des auditions.
Quatre,
huit...
treize, vous restez.
Les autres, vous pouvez partir.
T'as dit que si je couchais avec toi,
mon fils aurait le rôle.
Apparemment, je suis
meilleur acteur que ton fils.
Faites entrer ceux de 11 h !
Et c'est comme ça
que le rôle de Tyler est allé à...
Grant.
- Allez, Grant a l'air plutôt bon.
- Tu trouves ?
Regarde.
- Grant.
- Oui ?
Vous voyez ?
C'est du travail d'amateur.
Croyez-moi, les enfants star étaient
bien meilleurs dans les années 80.
On dirait que ta mère a gardé
ta chambre d'enfant
comme tu l'avais laissée.
C'est un énorme poster de <i>Karaté Kid</i>
au-dessus de ton lit.
<i>Karaté Kid</i> est un super film.
C'est l'histoire d'un jeune amateur
de karaté dont le rêve
l'amène jusqu'au
championnat de karaté d'All Valley.
Malheureusement, il perd en finale
contre l'autre tocard.
Mais il apprend une leçon importante
en acceptant sa défaite.
Attends.
Quand tu regardes <i>Karaté Kid</i>,
tu es pour le méchant petit blond ?
Non, je suis pour l'autre tocard
du New Jersey
qui connaît à peine le karaté.
Quand je regarde <i>Karaté Kid</i>,
je suis pour le vrai karaté kid :
Johnny Lawrence, du dojo Cobra Kai.
Te fais pas plus bête
que tu n'es, Lily.
Je viens de me souvenir
d'où je te connais.
Je t'ai vu jouer au Théâtre
de la Désorientation,
<i>Die heilige Johanna der Schlachthöfe</i>
de Bertolt Brecht, l'automne dernier.
T'étais une révélation !
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Merci.
Je sais pas, enfin, le but de l'oeuvre
de Brecht, c'est bien sûr...
- de désorienter le public.
- Oui.
Désolé.
T'as un Brechtophile devant toi !
Tu t'y connais vraiment en théâtre.
Madame Théâtre a conquis mon coeur jadis
et ne m'a plus jamais quitté.
Chaque année, à Noël,
je créais pour les parents
une pièce avec tous les gamins.
Dis donc, Papa Noël, tu crois qu'on peut
décoller avec un temps pareil ?
Coupez ! Coupez !
Papi et Mamie seront là,
dans une demi-heure,
et tu écorches toujours mes mots.
Je sens que je vais devoir écrire,
diriger et jouer ce truc.
Donne-moi ton chapeau d'elfe.
Assieds-toi.
J'ai toujours voulu être acteur.
C'est ce genre de rêves
qui s'envole avec le temps.
Écoute, si tu veux, je peux te donner
des conseils d'acteur.
- Vraiment ?
- J'adorerais.
Règle d'acteur numéro 1...
Au moins une personne
qui aime encore jouer.
Ça me manque.
Tu n'aimes pas jouer
le fils de Barney ?
Je déteste.
Mais qu'est-ce que j'y peux ?
- Je reçois aucun coup de fil.
- Je sais ce que c'est.
Je suis présentatrice.
Mais j'ai dû accepter un boulot
sur une émission matinale
qui commence à 4 h 30.
Je pensais évoluer
beaucoup plus vite que ça, tu vois ?
- J'ai presque 30 ans.
- Allez, t'es toujours très belle.
J'adore ton nouveau nez.
Je me suis pas fait opérer.
C'est ça.
Moi non plus.
J'arrive pas à croire
qu'on ne vous ait jamais rencontrée.
Qui savait que la mère de Barney
était si géniale ?
Merci, chérie.
En réalité, je n'étais pas une mère
si parfaite quand j'étais plus jeune.
Dites pas ça. Je suis sûr
que vous étiez super.
Ouais, j'étais plutôt une traînée.
Excusez-moi ?
Une traînée, chérie.
Une sale traînée.
J'en suis pas fière.
Mais...
Enfin, je m'amusais.
Y a pas de plaisir
aussi intense que...
de regarder un type
dans les yeux et se dire :
"Je ne connais pas ton nom,
toi non plus, mais...
"les huit prochaines minutes,
on va faire flancher
"les fondations des toilettes
de cette station-service."
Puis repartir
dans des directions opposées.
Et juste conduire.
Maman de Barney ?
Loretta.
Enfin, tout ça,
c'est du passé maintenant.
J'ai fait du mieux
que j'ai pu, mais...
parfois, je me demande
comment Barney a pu devenir si parfait.
Tu dois dire la vérité à ta mère, OK ?
Écoute, c'est une femme gentille,
aimante, un peu trop directe
qui mérite mieux.
Non, pas question.
La vérité la tuerait.
Je ne me sens pas bien
à l'idée de mentir
à une femme si chaleureuse, OK ?
Elle me rappelle ma mère.
- Quoi ?
- Chaleureuse ?
Souviens-toi au mariage, j'avais dit
qu'on serait ensemble pour toujours ?
À notre retour dans l'allée,
ta mère s'est penchée et a dit :
"Pas pour toujours, chérie.
Marshall ira au paradis."
- Elle plaisantait.
- Elle me déteste, Marshall.
Mais c'est pas grave, parce que...
Oublions.
Tu allais dire quoi ?
Rien. Tu veux aller le refaire
dans la chambre de Barney ?
- Sur le lit "voiture de course" ?
- Les poignées sont super.
Écoute, Lily, si on a appris
quelque chose aujourd'hui,
c'est que l'honnêteté est importante
dans une famille.
Quels que soient tes sentiments
envers ma mère,
on est ensemble depuis 12 ans, bébé.
- Je pense que je peux gérer ça.
- Vraiment ?
Je déteste ta mère.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je te déteste !
- Dans deux minutes, pain de viande !
- Pain de viande ?
Tyler pas aimer !
On a parlé de ça
des millions de fois !
- Tu te fais pas de slogan !
- Mais c'est marrant.
Je peux refaire un casting.
Va mémoriser tes phrases
pour la grosse scène du dîner.
Attends. Tu as écrit
le dîner qu'on va avoir ?
Juste un petit script.
Des choses que ma mère
sera heureuse d'entendre.
Quel genre ?
Et j'ai vraiment cru
que Barney avait oublié
notre anniversaire.
Alors, je me précipite dans le jardin,
la fumée me sortait des oreilles.
Les narines dilatées. Elles font ça
quand elle s'énerve. J'adore ça.
Comme maintenant.
Comme maintenant !
Tu ferais mieux d'arrêter !
Désolé, mon petit ours. Continue.
T'es vraiment comme ça
pendant une relation.
Donc je sors en furie
dans le jardin, et...
des bougies partout...
et un quatuor à cordes.
- Vous arrivez à le croire ?
- Non, pas du tout.
Et mon petit Ty-Ty.
Quoi de neuf ?
Drôle d'histoire,
l'autre nuit, ce petit coquin
a fait un cauchemar.
Il est venu nous dire ce que c'était,
tu te souviens de ce que tu as dit ?
Page 4...
Les os de dinosaure au musée
ont repris vie et me pourchassaient ?
Merci beaucoup, mec.
Ce soir, je dors pas.
Tyler a dit : "Dans mon cauchemar,
"maman et toi ne saviez pas
à quel point je vous aimais.
"Alors, je suis venu vous dire
que c'était grand...
"comme ça."
C'est mignon.
On est une famille heureuse.
Je vais prendre un peu de glace
dans le congélateur en bas
et on fera les coupes de glace
dans la cuisine.
Pas de maillon faible
dans cette scène.
Bravo !
Arrête, Barney. Tu n'as pas idée
de la difficulté de faire
un boulot indigne de toi.
J'ai vraiment aimé ton truc
sur les os de dinosaures.
On peut arrêter avec ça ?
Va manger ta glace.
Je peux pas.
Je suis allergique au lactose.
Devine qui n'est pas allergique
au lactose : Tyler.
Tyler va aller là-dedans
et apprécier chaque bouchée.
C'est l'heure de la glace !
Miam !
Mon Dieu !
Tyler pas aimer.
Tu vas pas nous sortir un slogan.
Je ne comprends pas.
Moi, oui.
Suivez-moi.
J'ai...
été trahi
par mon meilleur ami.
Comment as-tu pu faire ça, Ted ?
Pense au pauvre Tyler
qui essaie courageusement
de retenir ses larmes.
C'est bon mon garçon,
tu peux pleurer.
Pleure !
Je veux pas que ma maman
et mon papa divorcent !
Que peux-tu avoir à dire
pour ta défense ?
Règle d'acteur numéro 1 :
"N'aie pas peur d'improviser."
Est-ce moi qui t'ai trahi,
ou toi qui m'as trahi ?
Désolé. Quoi ?
Règle d'acteur numéro 5 :
"Invente une riche toile de fond
à ton personnage."
Le 14 novembre 1998.
Le train de nuit pour Monte-Carlo.
J'étais dans le wagon billard
arnaquant des Algériens
de quelques milliers de dinars,
pendant que toi,
tu séduisais ma fiancée !
Qui est aveugle
et t'a prise pour moi.
Pour l'amour de Dieu,
de quoi tu parles ?
Règle d'acteur numéro 8 :
"N'aie pas peur
d'en venir aux mains."
- Tu vois pas bien de quoi je parle ?
- Non, pas du tout.
Bien sûr que si ! Et pour sûr,
je t'entendrai l'avouer,
fumier !
Maman, tu nous laisses un instant ?
Il y a du chocolat et des caramels.
Il y a plein de sortes de vermicelles
et de marshmallows.
T'as perdu la tête ?
Tu étais extraordinaire !
Tu es vraiment devenu ce personnage.
Honnêtement,
je jouais pas vraiment Ted,
j'essayais de ne pas être lui.
Qu'est-ce qui va pas chez vous ?
Comment je vais expliquer ça
à ma mère ?
C'est peut-être le moment
de lui dire la vérité.
Je sais pas. Parfois, l'honnêteté mène
les gens à dire des choses méchantes
sur la femme
qui a toujours pris soin de moi
parce que j'étais
le gringalet de la famille.
Pour l'amour de Dieu,
je fais que 1 m 92 !
Comment étaient mes pleurs ?
Parfaits. Tu vois ?
Même dans un rôle que tu détestes,
t'arrives à aimer ce que tu fais.
Ce sera peut-être comme ça
à ton nouveau boulot.
- Tu crois ?
- Je le sais.
Merci, Grant.
Tu es plutôt malin, tu sais ça ?
Pardon !
Je pensais qu'il se passait un truc.
Chéri, tu vas bien ?
Maman, j'ai un truc à te dire.
Quelque chose que j'aurais dû te dire
il y a bien longtemps.
Tyler est mourant.
Et Betty dit que quand il sera parti,
elle s'éteindra.
Donc ça risque d'être bientôt fini.
Mon Dieu !
Rien de tout ça n'est vrai !
La vérité, c'est que...
Betty et Tyler sont des acteurs
que j'ai engagés pour faire semblant
d'être ma famille.
Quoi ?
Je voulais juste que tu penses
que j'avais la vie
que tu voulais pour moi.
Je voulais que tu sois fière de moi.
Ça a l'air dingue,
et je suis désolé, maman.
Alors, Betty n'est pas ta femme ?
Dieu merci !
Je n'aime pas cette femme.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Et Tyler...
Je sais que je suis sa grand-mère
et que je suis censée l'aimer,
mais je le déteste.
"Tyler pas aimer !"
- Ça veut dire quoi ?
- N'est-ce pas ?
Avec tes faux-amis, là-bas,
je voulais me tirer une balle.
Je sais !
Ils sont pas horribles ?
Alors, vraiment, tu m'en veux pas ?
Je suis confuse. Je ne sais pas
pourquoi tu as pensé devoir faire ça.
Je t'aime, famille parfaite ou pas.
Je t'aime, quoi qu'il arrive.
- Vraiment ?
- Vraiment.
Je suis vraiment soulagé
parce qu'en réalité,
je suis aussi loin d'être marié
qu'un être humain peut l'être.
Mes histoires avec les femmes
te choqueraient et t'horrifieraient.
Peu importe.
Je t'aime toujours.
Sérieusement, t'imagines pas
ce que j'ai pu faire.
Quand tu avais trois ans,
je t'ai laissé avec une baby-sitter
et j'ai passé trois semaines
avec Grand Funk Railroad,
passant d'un mec à un autre
comme un bang.
Maman !
Promets-moi une chose.
Si jamais tu rencontres
quelqu'un de spécial,
ne t'enfuis pas.
Ne fais pas comme moi.
Tente ta chance, d'accord ?
Le taxi est là.
J'essaierai.
<i>Ainsi s'acheva l'un des plus étranges
après-midi de nos vies.</i>
Et je voulais juste te dire,
si jamais j'ai été froide
ou distante, je suis désolée.
À qui elle parle ?
Ma mère.
Ça représenterait beaucoup pour moi
si nous pouvions être plus proches.
Respire fort comme si la suite
allait être dure à dire.
Je t'aime.
Je t'aime...
Maman.
... maman.
Fais comme si j'étais gentille.
Fais comme si j'étais gentille.
Je veux dire,
c'est vraiment très gentil
de ta part, Judy.
Toi aussi.
À bientôt.
Que je comprenne bien.
Tu me dis
que quand tu regardes <i>Karate Kid</i>,
tu n'es pas pour Daniel-san ?
- Qui tu aimes dans <i>Piège de cristal</i> ?
- Hans Gruber,
le bandit de classe internationale.
À la fin, il est piégé.
C'est le personnage du titre.
OK, et <i>Breakfast Club</i> ?
Le prof qui les surveille.
C'est le seul qui passe
tout le film en costard.
J'en ai un. <i>Terminator</i>.
C'est quoi, le titre, Robin ?
Qui parmi nous
n'a pas versé une larme
quand son petit oeil rouge
s'éteint à la fin
et qu'il n'arrive pas
à tuer ces gens ?
Désolé. Ce film...
Je regarderai plus jamais
de film avec toi.
Ils essaient même pas de l'aider !
Check it:
Three blonde babies drinking
bad decision juice at 8:00.
Nice rack radar.
- That's my wife.
- No, I got to get going.
Seriously?
But they're blonde and drunk.
Isn't that your type?
Maybe I don't have a type, Lily.
God, do you think
the male mind is really
that simplistic,
that we all have one favorite type?
Geez.
Asian with some boob.
I'm gonna hit the bathroom,
then bail.
Okay, have you guys noticed
Barney's been acting weird lately?
Actually, yes.
You know how he always says
never buy a girl flowers,
'cause giving her a living thing
reminds her babies?
- Sure.
- Well, the other day,
I saw him at that flower shop
on 82nd buying roses.
- What?
- Now that you mention it,
Barney did do something kind of odd
at the office yesterday.
Okay, see you Saturday.
I'm thinking brunch,
farmer's market, maybe a hike.
I love you, too.
Bye.
I figured he was just talking
to some girl he was trying to nail.
Or Ted, but now I don't know.
Wait, do you think it's possible
that Barney Stinson
has a girlfriend?
Later.
Wait, Barney, hold on.
Where are you going?
Nowhere.
The beach.
It's winter. Lazer Tag.
Home. Shut up.
You're going somewhere.
Oh, my God.
He's meeting her right now.
- Where is Barney going?
- Yeah.
We're not even in Manhattan anymore.
Where's this girl live?
We're talking about a woman
who's gotten Barney Stinson to commit.
I'm guessing Narnia.
He's stopping.
- What are you guys doing here?
- Where is she?
- Who?
- Your girlfriend.
You really don't have a type,
do you?
These are my friends.
Guys,
this is Loretta.
- My mom.
- It's so nice to meet you.
I feel like I already know you all.
Barney goes on and on about you
every day when we talk.
You call your mom every day?
Mom!
So that's what you were being
all secretive about?
You didn't want us to know
you're a big old mama's boy.
Yep, you got me.
Well, guess you guys can leave.
Who are all these people?
I'd like you to meet Betty...
my wife.
And my son Tyler.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
Betty and I are gonna get dinner ready.
There'll be plenty for everyone.
But remember you,
only one helping of meatloaf
after what Dr. Grossbard
- said about your cholesterol.
- This one wants me to live forever.
Guilty.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
- I love you three!
- Get out of here, you little scamp!
- So, I'll see you guys back at the bar?
- What the hell, Barney?
OK, it's a long story.
As you know, my father
had to leave my mom
when I was a baby because he got hired
as the host of The Price is Right.
- It was a very good show.
- Bob Barker is your father.
She had to raise
my brother and me by herself.
And her only wish was for her sons
not to wind up alone, like she was.
Then about seven years ago,
she got really sick.
It looked like
she wasn't going to make it.
So, I decided to make
her wish come true.
Mom.
This is Betty.
We're engaged.
I hired an actress
to play my fiancée "Betty".
Her real name's Margaret.
She mostly does off-Broadway theater.
Wonderful actress.
This close to a Tony.
It's all who you know.
It's very political.
I shouldn't get into it.
But there's one problem.
Betty has a slight tendency
to go off-book.
You see, Mom?
I found someone who makes me happy.
Just like you wanted.
That's wonderful.
I just wish I could've stuck around
long enough for grandchildren.
I'm pregnant!
And then my mom got better.
Which was miraculous. But it meant
that I had to keep "Betty"
around and cast a kid
to play my son Tyler.
This is crazy.
You actually cast your own son?
For a while,
I got by borrowing/babysitting
my neighbor's baby.
And this one Christmas,
when my mom was plowed on eggnog,
I got away with a bag of flour
and a Chuckie mask.
But eventually,
I had to hold auditions.
Four,
eight...
13, you can stay.
The rest of you may go.
You said that if I slept with you,
my son would get the part.
Apparently,
I'm a better actor than your kid.
Bring in the 11:00's!
And that's how the role of Tyler
eventually went to...
Grant.
- Come on, Grant seems pretty good.
- You think so?
Watch this.
Hey, Tyler.
- Grant.
- Yeah?
See?
It's like amateur hour over here.
Call me crazy, but child actors
were way better back in the'80s.
It looks like your mom kept
your childhood bedroom
just the way you left it.
That sure is a big poster
of <i>The Karate Kid</i> above your bed.
<i>Karate Kid</i>'s a great movie.
It's the story of a hopeful young karate
enthusiast whose dreams and moxie
take him all the way
to the All Valley Karate Championship.
Of course, sadly, he loses
in the final round to that nerd kid.
But he learns an important lesson
about gracefully accepting defeat.
Wait.
When you watch <i>The Karate Kid</i>,
you actually root
for that mean blond boy?
No, I root for the scrawny loser
from New Jersey
who barely even knows karate.
When I watch <i>The Karate Kid</i>,
I root for the karate kid:
Johnny Lawrence
from the Cobra Kai dojo.
Get your head out of your ass, Lily.
Okay, I just figured out
where I know you from.
I saw you perform
at the Disorientation Theater
in Bertolt Brecht's Die Heilige
Johanna der Schlachth felast fall.
You were a revelation!
- Really?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
I wasn't sure. I mean, the point
of Brecht's work, of course, is to...
Alienate the audience.
Sure.
Sorry.
Brecht-o-phile right here!
You really know your theater.
Lady Theater grabbed my heart early on
and she never let go.
Every year at Christmas,
I'd put on a little play for the parents
with all the other kids.
Gee whiz, Santa, do you think
we can take off in this kind of snow?
Cut! Cut!
Cut! Ricky!
Grandma and Grandpa
are gonna be here in half an hour,
and you're still butchering
my words.
Looks like I'm gonna have to write,
direct and star in this thing.
Give me your elf hat.
Go sit.
I always secretly wanted
to be an actor.
It's one of those life dreams
that just slipped away, I guess.
Listen, if you want,
I could give you some tips on acting.
- Really?
- I'd love to.
Acting rule number one...
At least someone's still excited
about acting.
I miss that.
So, you don't like playing
Barney's son?
I hate it.
But what can I do?
- The phone just ain't ringing.
- I know what you mean.
I'm a newscaster.
But I just had to take a job
hosting a local morning show
that airs at 4:30 in the morning.
I just thought I'd be so much
further along by this point, you know?
I'm almost 30.
Come on, you still look great.
I love your nose job.
I never had a nose job.
Right.
Me neither.
I can't believe
we haven't met you before.
Who knew Barney
had such a great mom?
Thanks, dear.
Truth is, I wasn't always
the best mother when I was younger.
Don't say that.
I'm sure you were great.
Yeah, I was a bit of a whore.
Excuse me?
A whore, dear.
A dirty whore.
I'm not proud of it.
But...
still, I had some fun.
There is no thrill equal to...
looking into some guy's eyes
and thinking,
"I don't know your name,
you don't know mine, but...
"for the next eight minutes,
"we are gonna rock
this gas station bathroom
"right off its foundation."
And then just drive off
in opposite directions.
Just keep driving.
Barney's mom?
Loretta.
Anyway, that's,
that's all in the past now.
I did the best I could, but...
sometimes I wonder how Barney
turned out to be so perfect.
You have to tell your mom
the truth, okay?
Listen, she is a sweet,
caring, slightly too graphic woman
who deserves better.
No way. The truth would kill her.
I don't feel right
about lying to such
a kindhearted woman, okay?
She reminds me of my own mother.
- What?
- Kindhearted?
Remember in our wedding vows
when I said we'd be together forever?
On our way back up the aisle,
your mother leaned in and she said,
"Not forever, sweetie.
Marshall's going to heaven."
- She was making a joke.
- She hates me, Marshall.
But that's okay because...
Never mind.
What were you gonna say?
Nothing. Do you want to go do it
in Barney's childhood bedroom again?
- On the race car bed?
- Handles great, buddy.
Look, Lily, if today has taught us
nothing else, it's that
honesty is important
when it comes to family.
Now, whatever you're feeling
towards my mother,
we've been together
for 12 years, baby.
- I think that I can handle it.
- Really?
I hate your mom.
Guess what?
I hate you!
Two minute warning for meatloaf!
Meatloaf?
Tyler no likey!
We have been over this
a million times!
- You are not getting a catchphrase!
- But it's funny.
I am not afraid to recast.
Now go memorize your lines
for the big dinner scene.
Wait. So you wrote the dinner
we're about to have?
Just a short script.
Just things that will make
my mom happy to hear.
What kind of things?
And I really thought
Barney had forgotten
our anniversary.
So I storm out to the backyard,
and there's smoke coming out of my ears.
Nostrils flaring. Her nostrils flare
when she gets mad. I love it.
Doing it right now.
Doing it right now!
You better stop, mister!
Sorry, sorry, boo bear. Continue.
This is what you're actually
like in a relationship.
So I storm out
to the backyard and...
candles everywhere...
and a string quartet.
- Can you believe that?
- No, not even slightly.
What about my little Ty-Ty.
What have you been up to?
Funny story:
just the other night,
this little rascal had a nightmare.
When he came in
to tell us what it was about,
do you remember
what you said, champ?
Page four.
The dinosaur bones in the museum
came to life and started chasing me?
Thanks a lot, buddy.
I didn't need to sleep tonight.
Tyler said, "My nightmare was
"that you and Mommy didn't
know how much I loved you.
"So I wanted to come in
and tell you it was this much."
That's so sweet.
We're a sweet happy family.
'm gonna grab some ice cream
from the freezer downstairs
and then we'll all hit
the sundae bar in the kitchen.
Not a weak link in that scene.
Bravo.
Back off, Barney.
You have no idea how hard it is
to do a job that's beneath you.
I really enjoyed your thing
about the dinosaur bones.
Can we please stop talking
about the dinosaur bones?
Just go eat your sundae.
I can't.
I'm lactose-intolerant.
Guess who's not
lactose-intolerant? Tyler.
Tyler is gonna go in there
and enjoy every last bite.
Ice cream time, gang.
Yummers!
My God!
Tyler no likey.
You're not getting a catchphrase.
I don't understand.
I do.
Follow my lead.
I've...
been betrayed
by my best friend.
How could you do this, Ted?
Think about poor Tyler
bravely trying to hold back tears.
It's okay, son, you can cry.
Cry!
I don't want my mommy
and daddy to get divorced!
What could you possibly have
to say for yourself?
Acting rule number one:
"Don't be afraid to improvise."
Was it me who betrayed you,
or you who betrayed me?
I'm sorry. What?
Acting rule number five:
"Invent a rich back story
for your character."
November 14th, 1998.
The overnight train to Monte Carlo.
I was in the billiards car
hustling some Algerians
out of few thousand dinar,
when you seduced my fiancée!
Who is blind and thought
you were me.
What in God's name
are you talking about?
Acting rule number eight:
Don't be afraid to get physical.
You know damn well
what I'm talking about!
No, I don't!
Yes, you do! And by God,
I'll hear you say it, scoundrel!
Mom, can you give us a sec?
There's chocolate and butterscotch.
There's various kinds
of sprinkles and marshmallows.
Have you lost your mind?!
You were amazing!
You completely just became
that character.
Honestly,
I wasn't so much playing Ted
as I was just trying
to get out of Ted's way.
What is wrong with you people?
How am I ever gonna
explain this to my mother?
Maybe it's time
to tell her the truth.
I don't know, Lily.
Sometimes, honesty leads people
to say mean things about a woman
who always took special care of me
because I was the
runt of the family.
For crying out loud,
I'm only six-four!
How good was my crying?
You nailed it.
See?
Even at a gig you hate,
you still managed to love what you do.
Maybe that's how it will be
for you at your new job.
- You think so?
- I know so.
Thanks, Grant.
You're pretty smart, you know that?
Sorry! Sorry!
Thought I was picking up
on something.
Honey, are you okay?
Look, Mom,
there's something I have to tell you.
Something I should have
told you a long time ago.
Tyler is dying.
And Betty said that when he goes,
she's gonna off herself.
So that's probably
all gonna go down pretty soon.
Oh, my God!
None of that is true!
The truth is, I...
The truth is Betty and Tyler
are actors
that I hired
to pretend to be my family.
What?
I just wanted you to think
I had the life
you wanted for me.
I wanted you to be proud of me.
I know it sounds crazy,
and I am so sorry, Mom.
So Betty is not your wife?
Thank God!
I do not like that woman.
- Really?
- Yes.
And Tyler...
I know I'm his grandma
and I'm supposed to love him,
but I hate that kid.
"Tyler no likey!"
- What the hell is that?
- Right?
Those fake friends of yours out there,
I just wanted to shoot myself.
I know!
Aren't they horrible?
So really, really, you're not mad?
I'm just confused. I don't know
why you thought you had to do this.
Barney, I love you, perfect
family or no perfect family.
I love you no matter what.
- Really?
- Really.
I am so relieved
because the truth is
I am as far from married
as a human being can possibly be.
My history with women
would shock and appall you.
Doesn't matter.
I still love you.
Seriously, you can't imagine
the things I have done.
Barney, when you were three,
I left you with a babysitter
and spent three weeks
with Grand Funk Railroad
being passed around like a bong.
Mommy!
Just do me a favor.
If you ever do meet someone special,
don't run away from it.
Don't be me.
Take a shot at it, will you?
Cab's here.
I'll try.
<i>And so ended one of the strangest
afternoons of our lives.</i>
And I just wanted to say to you,
if I ever seemed cold
or unwelcoming, I'm sorry.
Who's she talking to?
My mom.
It would mean a lot to me
if you and I could be closer.
Now take a deep breath like this next
thing is gonna be hard to say.
I love you.
I love you...
Mom.
... Mom.
Now pretend I said something nice.
Now pretend I said something nice.
I mean,
that's very nice
of you to say, Judy.
You, too.
Speak soon.
Let me get this straight.
You're really telling me
that when you watch <i>The Karate Kid</i>,
you don't root for Daniel-san?
- Who do you root for in <i>Die Hard</i>?
- Hans Gruber,
charming international bandit.
At the end, he died hard.
He's the title character.
Okay, <i>The Breakfast Club</i>?
The teacher running detention.
He's the only guy
in the whole movie wearing a suit.
I got one.
<i>Terminator</i>.
What's the name of the movie, Robin?
Who among us didn't shed a tear
when his little red eye
went out at the end
and he didn't get
to kill those people?
I'm sorry.
That movie...
I am never watching a movie
with you ever again.
They didn't even try to help him!
<i>En 2009, votre tante Robin
présentait une émission du matin.</i>
<i>Elle devait donc se lever assez tôt.</i>
<i>À quel point ?</i>
1 h 45
Bonjour, tout le monde.
Donc tu le fais vraiment ?
Tu vas vraiment
aller au boulot à 2 h.
Je le fais pas pour moi.
Je le fais pour les fans.
Qui est fan d'une émission
diffusée à 4 h du matin ?
Ceux qui présentent
une émission à 5 h du matin ?
Les drogués
qui ont pas vendu leur télé ?
Les strip-teaseuses
dans ce moment bizarre
entre boulot et réveil des enfants ?
Ce sont eux.
Mettez-moi au courant.
Il s'est passé quoi ?
Tu sais, comme d'hab.
Vraiment, comme d'hab ?
Pense à la chose la plus drôle
qui soit jamais arrivée.
- C'est bon.
- Et double ça.
Donc un chimpanzé
qui porte deux smokings ?
Un truc encore plus drôle
est arrivé à Marshall aujourd'hui.
D'abord,
rien n'est plus drôle que ça.
Ensuite,
c'est pas une si bonne histoire.
Allez, les gars.
Vous êtes quatre jeunes actifs
dans la ville
la plus excitante au monde.
Et vous avez rien à me raconter ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Parfois, c'est comme ça.
La même chose encore et encore.
Un de mes élèves
a mangé de la colle.
J'ai utilisé des méthodes douteuses
pour sauter une fille très bête.
Mon ex, Karen, est à New York.
La routine habituelle.
Karen est ici ?
Tu te fous de moi !
<i>Les enfants,
je crois vous avoir parlé de Karen.</i>
<i>C'était ma copine au lycée
et par moments à l'université.</i>
<i>Elle était belle, intelligente.</i>
<i>J'étais fou amoureux d'elle.</i>
<i>Le seul problème,
Marshall et Lily ne l'étaient pas.</i>
<i>Ça devait sans doute venir
de ce qui sortait dès qu'elle l'ouvrait.</i>
J'aime que vous viviez
dans un dortoir.
C'est tellement Américain.
Comme manger des sandwichs pourris
et être raciste.
Mon Dieu,
c'était une vraie andouille.
Mec, la médaille d'or
de l'andouille de Vire.
- Elle était pas si terrible.
- Bien sûr, pour toi.
Elle t'avait transformé
en zombie de l'andouille.
Je veux manger ton cerveau,
mais seulement s'il est bio
et élevé en plein air.
Quoi ?
Tu me passes le sel ?
Le sel ?
C'est si <i>bourgeois</i>.
Carrément.
C'est quoi, ça ?
C'est... une télé.
Je regarde pas la télé.
Carrément.
Tu pensais que j'allais acheter
des billets pour WrestleMania ?
C'était ironique.
Carrément.
Je sais...
que t'étais ironique.
Moi aussi...
je suis ironique.
Allons-y !
Quoi ?
Ce maquillage
a mis un mois pour partir.
J'ai rencontré les parents de Lily avec.
J'ai jamais eu l'air aussi con.
Jusqu'à aujourd'hui.
Raconte l'histoire, raconte l'histoire !
Lâche-moi !
Attends.
C'est vraiment marrant ?
Je ne plaisante pas.
J'ai presque pas envie
que tu l'entendes, parce que vraiment,
pour le reste de ta vie,
rien ne sera plus jamais
aussi marrant
et toi, tu te maudiras
d'avoir accepté de l'entendre.
Tu dois l'entendre.
C'est trop marrant.
D'accord.
<i>Ce matin, j'étais au gymnase de la boîte
pour jouer au basket.</i>
<i>Les gars du boulot peuvent être
assez violents avec leurs railleries.</i>
Regarde Wisniewski.
Il va pleurer. Regarde-le.
Regarde-le.
Je pense pas que les genoux
sont faits pour plier comme ça.
Il a peut-être déchiré
son ligament croisé.
Mec, tout ce qu'il a déchiré,
c'est son utérus ou peut-être son hymen.
Ouais, ou sa trompe de Fallope.
J'ai peut-être un peu édulcoré
le dialogue, peu importe...
Je fouille mon sac
pour prendre mes affaires de travail...
Attends, attends.
Je veux le dire.
D'accord. Dis-le.
Il fouille son sac
pour prendre ses affaires, et...
Non, dis-le.
C'est plus marrant si tu le dis.
Laisse-moi-le dire.
Non, dis-le.
Tu le dis. Dis-le.
En même temps.
Non, vas-y.
- J'ai oublié...
- Il a oublié son pantalon !
Il a oublié son pantalon.
Synchro : ShalimarFox, Arrow
Adaptation : ZeK, thiste,
Venusia, tactactac
Relecture : Arrow...

Il a oublié son pantalon.
C'est assez marrant.
Moins qu'un chimpanzé
qui porte deux smokings.
Je veux dire, il a...
il a oublié
qu'il en portait déjà un ?
Débile, le singe.
Alors, Karen à New York.
Bizarre, non ?
Tu peux pas te remettre avec Karen.
J'ai jamais dit que je ferais ça.
Je me suis dit, elle débarque.
Ça serait la pire catastrophe
si je l'appelais ?
Ça serait pas la pire, non.
Ça serait la 4e pire.
1. Super volcan.
2. Un astéroïde s'abat sur Terre.
3. Tout enregistrement
d'Evel Knievel est perdu.
4. Ted appelle Karen.
5. Lily est dévorée par un requin.
Je m'appelle Lily
et j'approuve cet ordre.
Vous connaissez pas l'histoire.
Ted et Karen ont eu
une relation houleuse à la fac.
Ça se passait toujours pareil.
Ils s'amusaient, en étant odieux
jusqu'au jour où...
Tu trouves le pepperoni fasciste
et t'as trop raison, alors...
Oh, mon Dieu ! Karen !
Désolé, mec.
Avant que tu dises un mot,
je pense que tu devrais lire
<i>Les Fleurs du Mal</i> de Baudelaire.
Après ça, ils cassaient.
Ted était totalement déprimé,
et on attendait le temps nécessaire
pour lui dire ce qu'on pensait d'elle.
- J'ai cassé avec Karen.
- On la détestait !
Bye bye, la pétasse !
Puis Ted se montait le bourrichon
et prenait le bus pour Providence
pour dire à Karen ses quatre vérités.
- C'était comment ?
- Super.
Regardez qui est là !
Et finalement,
tout recommençait à zéro.
Ça va faire 10 002 Maniacs,
parce que j'ai des billets
pour Natalie Merchant...
Désolé, mec.
Elle venait te voir à la fac
et dès que t'avais le dos tourné
elle ramenait des types
dans <i>ta</i> chambre ?
Respect.
J'étais idiot.
C'était ma première vraie copine.
J'étais dingue d'elle. On a tous fait
des trucs qu'on regrette à la fac.
En 3e année,
Marshall s'est fait pousser le bouc,
portait un béret rasta
et exigeait qu'on l'appelle M.J. Cool.
Je regrette pas du tout.
Donc vous pensez vraiment
que je devrais pas l'appeler ?
- Non.
- Rentre ça dans ta petite tête.
OK, d'accord.
Information intéressante :
c'est déjà fait.
- Tu plaisantes !
- Le pantalon !
Je peux pas croire
que tu l'aies appelé.
Pourquoi tu l'invites pas
à déjeuner tant que t'y es ?
Parce que, je vais pas
l'inviter à déjeuner...
à nouveau.
Tu l'as invitée à déjeuner ?
Pour quelle raison peut-on vouloir
déjeuner avec une ex ?
Bonne question,
il y a quatre raisons
pour un "repas d'ex".
1. Ils veulent se remettre ensemble.
Comme mon copain du lycée, Scooter.
Des Lilium, pas bête.
Désolée, j'ai pas
de scooter pour toi.
C'est super drôle !
J'avais oublié ton humour.
- Il est où ce serveur ?
- Pourquoi ?
T'aimes les serveurs ?
Je peux être serveur.
Je deviendrai
le meilleur serveur du monde,
et tu m'aimeras !
2. Ils veulent te tuer.
Comme mon déjeuner avec Wendy.
Heureuse qu'on se voie enfin.
Tu sais,
après que tu as repoussé neuf fois,
j'ai failli laisser tomber.
Mais tu l'as pas fait,
t'as continué à insister.
D'ailleurs,
il y a une chose
que je voulais te donner.
Flingue ! Elle a un flingue !
C'est une cravate !
3. Ils veulent vraiment
te rendre tes affaires.
Comme mon déjeuner avec Curt.
D'ailleurs, il y a une chose
que je voulais te donner.
Mon 38 à canon court
spécial police !
Je savais que je l'avais laissé
quelque part.
À chaque fois que je regarde les infos,
je prie que ça soit pas mon arme.
On a bien fait de casser.
Ou 4. Te narguer avec leur réussite.
Comme mon déjeuner
avec Nicole Barsamian.
- Qui est Nicole Barsamian ?
- Mon ex.
Salut, Nicole.
T'as l'air bien.
T'as l'air pas mal.
Je vois quelqu'un.
Déjà ? Qui ?
Lee Roberts. Il lit déjà
comme un CM2.
Tu dois annuler ce déjeuner.
Je ferais ça, bien sûr...
s'il avait pas déjà eu lieu.
Robin, je vais devoir emprunter
la crosse de ton flingue.
Je l'ai encore perdu.
Vous arrivez à le croire ?
Comment peux-tu casser la croûte
avec cette nana ?
C'était qu'un déjeuner,
et elle mange pas de blé.
C'était sympa de se retrouver.
On a même ri des idiots qu'on était.
Dire que j'avais un béret différent
pour chaque jour.
Dire que j'avais une image
de Molière sur mon sac à dos.
- On était prétentieux.
- Carrément prétentieux.
Que prendrez-vous ?
Je veux pas faire de scène,
mais dans votre liste de vins,
il y a un Châteauneuf-du-Pape
listé sous "Côtes de Provence".
Vous devriez avertir
votre sommelier.
Et pour vous ?
Je déteste le changement,
mais apportez-nous des <i>bruschetta</i>
et de la mozzarella fraîche.
<i>Grazie.</i>
C'était super.
Il y a eu un moment bizarre
vers la fin.
Comment dire au revoir
dans ces situations ?
Un baiser sur la joue, trop familier.
Une poignée de main, trop formelle.
Et une étreinte,
c'est comme un câlin en public.
Tu dois étreindre bizarrement.
- Que s'est-il passé ?
- Donc...
Schopenhauer a eu
une discussion osée,
dans laquelle il s'opposait...
Ted, chéri. Va dehors et mords
le trottoir. J'arrive dans 1 minute.
Karen a été la première fille
que j'ai vraiment aimée.
Et après l'année que j'ai eu,
je sais pas,
je crois que de déjeuner avec elle
m'a rappelé ce que c'était
d'avoir 18 ans et la vie devant soi.
Et je voudrais rappeler à tous
qu'au moins, je portais un pantalon.
Tu peux pas changer
de sujet comme ça.
Le pantalon.
Le pantalon ! Le pantalon !
C'était rien !
J'ai eu un petit souci,
donc j'ai appelé Lily.
- Dis-nous, c'était quoi, ce souci ?
- J'ai oublié mon pantalon.
Comment ça,
t'as oublié ton pantalon ?
Je l'ai oublié.
Il faut que tu m'en apportes un.
Et celui de rechange ?
Jeudi dernier, la moutarde ?
Tu as une mémoire de poisson rouge.
Ted, tu vas pas t'en sortir
si facilement.
Même si l'histoire de pantalon
est amusante...
Amusante ?
Plutôt, très amusante.
Ce n'est rien comparé
à ce truc de fou avec Karen.
Termine.
C'est tout.
C'était juste un baiser au resto.
Pourquoi tu dis "au resto" ?
Tu l'as embrassée ailleurs ?
Comme dans un arbre ?
Non, on l'a pas fait dans un arbre.
C'est quoi, son problème ?
Tu as fait quoi ?
Comment peux-tu ?
Marshall a oublié
son pantalon aujourd'hui,
et tu es pourtant
le plus stupide de cette table.
Lily, soyons honnêtes.
On connaît tous les deux
tes motivations.
Tu hais Karen, car elle s'attardait.
Enfoiré.
- Tu veux dire quoi par s'attarder ?
- Le 5 février...
1998. Je peignais...
Désolée.
Désolée.
Cette palette de couleurs
est un peu dérivée
des premiers Van Gogh, non ?
Trompe Ted, critique ma peinture,
quoi que ce soit, c'est ton affaire.
Mais je t'attrape lorgnant
sur le bazar de mon mec
et tu t'attardes ?
Tu vas bien être reçue.
Le jeu, c'est le jeu.
Pour sa défense,
je venais de faire de la muscu.
Pourquoi le peindre tout nu ?
Il avait mangé ma coupe de fruits.
Le fait est
que Karen est une sale perverse,
et tu peux pas la ramener
dans nos vies.
Du calme, c'était juste une nuit !
Et les trois d'après.
Et un matin.
Mais au moins, j'avais un pantalon.
- Même si, en fait, j'en avais pas.
- Ça s'est passé chez nous ?
- Où j'étais ?
- Tu sais les somnifères
que tu prends
pour ton emploi du temps de fou ?
Ils sont plus forts
que tu le penses.
La Fontaine
envoie le palet à Turgeon.
Turgeon tire.
Arrêt de la mitaine.
Vous inquiétez pas.
Je dirai rien à Marshall.
Je vais prendre une bière.
T'en veux une ?
Une bière.
Je décante le Bordeaux.
Ted, c'est sûr, c'est amusant
de regarder en arrière,
quand tu étais une fille de ferme
au teint frais et vierge.
Mais tous ces trucs...
Ohio, Karen, la fac...
c'était A.S.
"Avant Stinson."
Maintenant, ta vie est géniale !
D'accord, tu vis toujours
avec ton ex,
ce qui est ridicule.
Tes aptitudes au laser tag
sont quasi inexistantes.
Et ta garde-robe,
c'est genre, quoi,
t'es allergique
au tissu de qualité ?
Sérieusement, reprends-toi.
De quoi on parlait ?
- C'est quoi, la suite avec la bimbo ?
- C'est couru d'avance.
Ted, c'est Charlie Brown
qui essaye de tirer
et Karen, c'est Lucy qui lui retire
le ballon à la dernière seconde
et qui couche avec.
Vous m'avez compris.
Ted va tomber amoureux,
et Karen va le tromper
avec un play-boy,
qui dira...
"Désolé, mec."
Faux ! T'as dû laisser
la bonne réponse dans ton pantalon,
car c'est exactement
ce qui ne s'est pas passé.
<i>Car voilà ce qui s'est passé.</i>
<i>Un après-midi, chez Karen.</i>
Mon Dieu.
Comment t'as pu ?
Désolé, mec.
<i>Cette fois,
le play-boy avec qui elle trompait...</i>
C'était moi.
Moi.
La fois où Marshall
a oublié son pantalon ?
Bon sang !
Arrête de changer de sujet.
Tu as dépassé les bornes.
Tu es complice d'avoir brisé le coeur
de ce pauvre gars. Et toi,
tu es le mieux placé
pour savoir ce que ça fait.
Tu parleras vraiment pas
de ton pantalon ?
- Quoi ?
- Pantalon, pantalon...
Très bien !
Lily est venue au bureau
m'apporter mon pantalon...
- Pourquoi elle a fait ça ?
- Car je l'avais oublié.
- Lily, que fais-tu là ?
- Je viens donner un truc à Marshall.
Lui "donner" un truc.
Compris. Sympa.
Mais je suis pressé.
Je peux te le donner ?
Bien sûr, oui.
Et tu lui donneras ?
Attends. Je sais pas trop.
Le tien a intérêt
à être vraiment bien.
- De quoi tu parles ?
- Et toi ?
Marshall a oublié son pantalon,
alors, je lui en amène un.
Il a oublié son pantalon.
Une bonne chose que tu sois venue
parce qu'aujourd'hui,
il a une réunion importante,
et ce serait plutôt embarrassant
et pas du tout drôle
s'il devait se montrer
sans pantalon.
- Je m'assurerai qu'il l'ait.
- Génial. Merci.
Et tu lui as pas donné.
Theodore Evelyn Mosby.
Bien sûr que je lui ai donné.
Je lui ai donné ma parole.
Elle est en béton.
Par contre, j'ai fait
quelques retouches.
Comme vous le voyez
à la page 44 du contrat...
Depuis quand tu es dans AC/DC ?
On peut regarder
la page 44 du contrat ?
Les auditions pour <i>Oliver Twist</i>
sont en bas !
S'il vous plaît,
pourrais-je avoir plus... de pantalon ?
Plus de...
C'est tout ?
C'est l'histoire ?
- Que s'est-il passé avec Karen ?
- Je vais finir pour toi.
Ted est parti sans rien dire
et Karen a eu
exactement ce qu'elle voulait.
Pas cette fois.
Tu as un copain ?
Ça fait un moment qu'on s'éloigne.
J'avais l'intention de rompre.
Tu es incroyable.
Tu n'as pas le cran
de rompre décemment avec quelqu'un.
Alors, t'as préféré monter tout ça.
OK, tu as raison.
Je suis douée en littérature.
Douée en art.
Douée pour identifier
un vin français
à moins d'un kilomètre
d'où le raisin a poussé. Mais...
je suis vraiment nulle
pour regarder quelqu'un
et lui dire ce que je ressens.
On est tous les deux nuls
pour ça. Mais...
je pense qu'on a besoin de changer.
Pourquoi je commencerais pas ?
Tu es vraiment blessante
et imprudente
et je veux plus jamais
te voir ni te parler.
<i>Au revoir</i>.
Ted, attends.
En fait, "au revoir" veut dire
"jusqu'à ce qu'on se revoit".
Donc, j'imagine que tu veux dire
qu'en fait, on va se revoir ?
Désolé, mec.
Je suis impressionnée.
Par toi aussi,
t'as porté ça toute la journée ?
Ça montre mes mollets.
Le pantalon. Raconte encore.
Tu sais, c'est peut-être bien
que tu aies appelé Karen.
C'est sûr. Et pas que pour moi,
pour elle aussi.
Plus tard, elle a parlé avec Jerry,
et a eu la discussion de rupture
qu'elle évitait avec moi.
<i>Vous voyez, les enfants,</i>
<i>parfois quand il faut avoir
une discussion difficile,</i>
<i>le mieux à faire...</i>
Attendez un instant.
Tu as bien dit
que tu lui reparlerais jamais ?
Alors, comment tu sais
qu'elle a suivi tes conseils ?
Exact.
À ce sujet...
Après sa rupture avec ce gars,
on est sorti,
on a couché, depuis, on est ensemble.
On est vraiment d'accord,
cette fois, c'est différent.
La voilà. Soyez sympa !
<i>Back in 2009, your aunt Robin got
a job hosting a morning show.</i>
<i>Which meant
she had to get up kind of early.</i>
<i>How early?</i>
Morning, everybody.
So you're actually doing it?
You're actually going to work
at 2:00 a.m.
I'm not doing it for me.
I'm doing it for the fans.
Who exactly are the fans of a show
that airs at 4:00 in the morning?
People getting up to host a show
at 5:00 in the morning?
Meth addicts
who haven't sold their TVs yet?
Strippers in that messy gray area
between getting off work
and getting their kids
up for school?
Them's my peeps.
All right, catch me up.
What's been going on?
You know, the yoozh.
- Really, the yoozh?
- Yes.
Robin, think of the funniest thing
that has ever happened.
- Got it.
- Now double that.
So a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos?
Something even funnier than that
happens to Marshall today.
First of all,
there's nothing funnier than that.
Second of all, look,
it's not that good a story.
Come on, you guys.
You're four young active people living
in the most exciting city on earth.
You have no stories for me?
What can I say?
Some weeks are just like that.
It's the same thing over and over.
A kid in my class ate some paste.
I used deceitful means to hook up
with a less-than-intelligent girl.
My ex-girlfriend Karen moved to town.
It's just, it's all the same.
Karen's in town?
You have got to be kidding me!
<i>Kids, I think I've told you
about Karen.</i>
<i>She was my girlfriend in high school,
and intermittently through college.</i>
<i>She was beautiful, smart.</i>
<i>I was madly in love with her.</i>
<i>The only problem was,
Marshall and Lily were not.</i>
<i>I think it had something to do
with every time Karen opened her mouth.</i>
I love that you guys live in a dorm.
It's so American.
It's like, let's all eat
baloney sandwiches and be racist.
Oh, my God, she was such a douche.
Dude, she was the heiress
to the Massengill fortune.
- She really wasn't that bad.
- Of course you think that.
She turned you
into one of her douche zombies.
I want to eat your brain,
but only if it's organic
and grass-fed.
What?
Will you pass the salt?
Salt?
So bourgeois.
Totally.
What's that thing?
That's... a TV, Karen.
I don't watch TV.
Totally.
You thought I actually bought
tickets to WrestleMania?
I was being ironic.
Totally.
I know...
that you were being ironic.
I too...
am being ironic.
Let's do this!
What?
That makeup
didn't come off for a month.
I had to meet Lily's parents that way.
I've never looked like a bigger jackass.
Until today. Tell the story.
Tell the story....
Just let it go!
Hold on.
Is it really funny?
I am not kidding you.
I almost don't want you to hear it,
because seriously,
for the rest of your life,
nothing else will ever be as funny
and you will curse yourself for agreeing
to ever hear it in the first place.
But seriously, you got to hear it.
It's so funny.
Fine.
<i>I was at the company gym
this morning playing basketball.</i>
<i>The guys I work with can be
pretty brutal with their ridicule.</i>
Look at Wisniewski.
He's gonna cry. Look at him.
Look at him.
I don't know, I don't think knees
aren't supposed to bend that way.
I think he might have tore his ACL.
Bro, the only thing that guy tore
was his cervix or maybe his hymen.
Yeah, or his fallopian tube.
I may have cleaned up
the dialogue a little bit, anyways...
I go to my duffle bag
to get out my work clothes...
Wait, wait...
I want to say it. I want to say it.
Fine. You say it.
Marshall goes to his duffle bag
to get out his work clothes, and...
No, you say it.
It's funnier if you say it.
No, let me say it.
No, you say it.
You say it. Say it.
Same time.
No, you go, you go.
- I forgot...
- Marshall forgot his pants!
He forgot his pants.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
Marshall forgot his pants.
That's pretty funny.
It's no chimpanzee
wearing two tuxedos.
I mean, what did he...?
He forgot he put the first one on?
Stupid monkey.
So Karen in New York.
Weird, right?
Ted, you cannot get back
together with Karen.
I never said I was going to get back
together with her.
But I was thinking,
she's new in town.
Would it be the worst thing
in the world if I gave her a call?
It wouldn't be the worst thing.
 It would be the fourth worst thing.
1: Super volcano.
2: An asteroid hits the Earth.
3: All footage
of Evel Knievel is lost.
4: Ted calls Karen.
5: Lily gets eaten by a shark.
I'm Lily and I approve
the order of that list.
You don't know the whole story.
Ted and Karen were off
and on all through college,
and it always went the same way.
They'd be having fun, douching it up,
and then one day...
I know you think pepperoni is fascist
and you're totally right, so I...
Oh, my God! Karen!
Sorry, bro.
Before you say anything,
I think that you should read
Baudelaire's <i>Les Fleurs du Mal</i>.
So then they break up.
He would be all depressed, we would wait
the appropriate amount of time then
we'd would tell him how we really felt.
- Karen and I broke up.
- We hated her!
Bitch had to go!
And then Ted would build up
a head of steam
and finally take the bus to Providence
to give Karen a piece of his mind.
- How'd it go?
- Great.
Look who's back.
And then, sure enough,
the whole thing
would start all over again.
Make that 10,002 Maniacs,
because I got us
Natalie Merchant tick...
Sorry, bro.
So she would come visit you at school
and the second you turned your back
she would bring guys
back to your dorm room?
Respect.
I was an idiot.
She was my first real girlfriend.
I was madly in love with her.
We all did stuff we regret in college.
Junior year Marshall
grew a soul patch,
wore a rasta hat, and asked everyone
to call him M.J. Smooth.
I don't regret that for one second.
So you guys absolutely
don't think I should call her?
- Ted, no.
- Get it through your thick skull.
Fine, I won't.
Interesting piece of trivia:
I called her.
- What are you doing?
- The pants story.
I can't believe you called her.
Why don't you just ask her
to lunch while you're at it?
Because, Lily,
I'm not gonna ask her out to lunch...
again.
You asked her to lunch?
Why would anyone want
to have lunch with their ex?
Glad you asked,
there are four possible motives
behind an "ex lunch."
1: They want to get back together.
Like my high school boyfriend
Scooter.
Lilies, clever.
I'm sorry I don't have
a scooter for you.
My God, that's funny!
I forgot how funny you are.
- Where is that waiter?
- Why?
You like waiters?
I can be a waiter.
I'm going to be the greatest waiter
on this earth,
and then you'll love me.
2: They want to kill you.
Like when I had lunch with Wendy.
I'm glad we could finally do this.
You know, after the ninth time
you rescheduled on me,
I almost gave up on you.
But you didn't.
You just kept on trying.
By the way,
there's something
I've been meaning to give you.
Gun! She's got a gun!
It's a tie.
3: They actually do
want to give you your stuff back.
Like when I had lunch with Curt.
By the way, there's something
I've been meaning to give you.
My snub-nosed.38 police special!
I knew I left that somewhere.
Every time I watch the news,
I'm like, "Hope that wasn't my gun".
Breaking up was the right choice.
Or 4: to rub your face
in how great they're doing.
Like my lunch with Nicole Barsamian.
- Who's Nicole Barsamian?
- My ex.
You look well, Marshall.
You look okay, I guess.
- I'm seeing someone.
- Already? Who?
Lee Roberts.
He reads at a fifth grade level.
You have to cancel the lunch.
I would definitely do that,
definitely...
Except I already had it.
Robin, I'm going to need
to borrow the butt of your gun.
I actually lost it again.
Can you believe that?
How could break bread
with that woman?
It was just lunch,
and you know she doesn't eat wheat.
We had a great time catching up.
We even laughed about what jerks
we were back then.
I can't believe I had a beret
for each day of the week.
I can't believe I had
an iron-on image
of Moličre on my backpack.
- Man, we were pretentious.
- So pretentious.
What can I get you?
I don't want to cause a scene,
but your wine list
has a Châteauneuf-du-Pape
listed under the "Côtes de Provence".
You might want to alert
your sommelier.
And for you?
I hate to go off-menu,
but can you bring us some bruschett
with fresh mozzarell?
<i>Grazie.</i>
It was great. It was great.
I mean, there was one weird
moment towards the end.
How do you say good-bye
in those situations?
A kiss on the cheek is too familiar.
A handshake is too formal.
And a hug is just like
a public dry hump.
I think you're hugging wrong.
- So what happened?
- Well...
Schopenhauer made
a saucy little argument
in which he posited...
Ted, honey, I want you to go outside and
bite the curb. I'll be out in a minute.
Karen was the first girl
I ever loved.
And after the year I've had,
I don't know,
I guess having lunch with her just...
remind me of what it was like to be 18
and have my whole life figured out.
And I would like to remind everyone
that at least
I was wearing pants, Marshall.
You can't just go changing
the subject like that.
The pants story.
Pants story bomaye!
Pants story bomaye!
There's no story!
I had a little situation,
so I called Lily.
- Refresh us, what was that situation?
- I forgot my pants.
What do you mean
you forgot your pants?
I forgot them.
Now, I need you to bring me some.
What about your spare pants?
Last Thursday, the mustard incident.
Jeez, woman, you have
the memory of a goldfish.
Ted, you're not
getting off that easy.
Marshall's pants story,
while amusing...
Amusing?
Try very amusing.
Is nothing compared
to this Karen madness.
Finish your story.
What? That's it.
It was just one kiss in the restaurant.
Why did you say "in the restaurant"?
Did you kiss somewhere else?
Like where, in a tree?
No, Lily, we did not
make out in a tree.
What's with this one?
What did you do?
How could you?
Marshall forgot to bring
his pants to work today,
and you're still the stupidest
person at this table.
Okay, Lily, let's be honest.
We both know
your real motivation here.
You hate Karen because she lingered.
You son of a bitch.
- What do you mean she lingered?
- February 5,
1998. I was painting...
Sorry.
Sorry.
You know, that color palette
is a bit derivative
of early Van Gogh, don't you think?
Cheat on Ted, criticize my painting,
whatever, that's your business.
But I catch you peeping
on my man's junk
and you linger?
You gots to get got.
The game is the game.
In Karen's defense,
I had just worked out.
Why'd you have
to paint Marshall nude anyway?
Because he ate my bowl of fruit.
The point is,
Karen is a dirty linger,
and you cannot bring her back
into our lives.
Relax, it was just that one night!
And the next three after that.
And one morning.
But at least
I had pants on, Marshall.
- Although, actually, I didn't.
- Wait, this happened in our apartment?
- Where was I?
- You know those sleeping pills
you're taking to keep
on your crazy new schedule?
I think they're stronger
than you realize.
La Fontaine gets
the puck to Turgeon.
Turgeon shoots.
Glove save.
Don't worry.
I won't tell Marshall.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want one?
Beer.
I'll start decanting the Bordeaux.
Ted, sure it's fun
to look back at a time
when you were a fresh-faced
farm girl with a virgin's glow.
But all that stuff...
Ohio, Karen, college...
all that was BS.
"Before Stinson."
Now your life is awesome!
I mean, yeah, you still live
with your ex-girlfriend,
which is ridiculous.
Your laser tag chops
are almost nonexistent.
And your wardrobe,
it's like, what,
are you allergic to quality fabrics?
Seriously, Ted, shape up.
What were we talking about?
- So what's next with this broad?
- Please, the story's already written.
Ted is Charlie Brown
trying to kick the football
and Karen's Lucy, who pulls it
away at the last second
and has sex with it.
You guys know what I mean.
Ted's gonna fall in love,
and then Karen's gonna cheat
on him with some meathead,
who's like...
"Sorry, bro."
Wrong, wrong! You must have left
the right answer in your pants,
because that's exactly
what didn't happen.
<i>Because here's what happened.
One afternoon, we were at Karen's place.</i>
Oh, my God.
How could you?
Sorry, bro.
<i>So this time,
the meathead Karen was cheating with...</i>
Was me, Ted.
Me.
Remember that time
Marshall forgot his pants?
Damn it!
You quit trying to change the subject.
You crossed the line.
You are complicit in breaking
some poor guy's heart. And you,
you of all people
know exactly how that feels.
You really don't want to tell
the pants story?
- What?
- Pants, pants...
Fine! Okay?
So, Lily came down to the office
to bring me my pants...
- Why did she have to do that?
- Because I forgot my pants.
- Lily, what are you doing here?
- I'm here to give Marshall something.
Here to give him something.
Gotcha. Nice.
Yeah, but I'm in a hurry.
Can I just give it to you?
Sure, okay.
And then you'll give it to him?
Wait. I don't know about all that.
I mean,
yours would have to be really good.
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?
Marshall forgot his pants,
so I'm bringing him a new pair.
Marshall forgot his pants.
It's a good thing that you came by
because he has
a really important meeting today,
and it would be pretty embarrassing
and not at all funny
if he were to show up
not wearing pants.
- I'll make sure he gets these.
- Great. Thanks, Barney.
And you didn't give him his pants.
Theodore Evelyn Mosby.
Of course I gave him his pants.
I gave Lily my word.
My word is oak.
Though I did make some alterations.
Now, as you'll see on page 44
of the contract...
When did you join AC/DC?
Now, can we please just turn
to page 44 of the contract.
I think the Oliver Twist
auditions are down the hall!
Please, sir, may I have
some more... pants?
More pan...
That's it?
That's the whole story?
- So what happened with Karen?
- I'll finish it for you.
Ted left without saying anything
and Karen got exactly
what she wanted.
Not this time.
So you have a boyfriend?
We've been drifting apart
for a long time.
I've been meaning
to break up with him.
You are unbelievable.
You don't have the guts
to break up with someone
like a decent human being,
so instead you pull this crap.
Okay, you're right.
I'm great with books.
I'm great with art.
I'm great with
identifying French wines
from within a mile of where the grapes
are grown. But...
I'm really bad when it comes
to looking someone in the eye
and telling them the truth
about how I feel.
We're both bad at that. But...
I think we both need to change.
So, why don't I go first?
You're a really hurtful
and reckless person,
and I never want to see you
or speak to you again.
<i>Au revoir</i>.
Ted, wait.
Actually,"au revoir"means
"until we see each other again".
So, I'm assuming that you mean
we will in fact
see each other again?
Sorry, bro.
Thank you. Thank you.
- Bravo.
- I am impressed with you.
You, too, Marshall.
Have you been wearing those all day?
They show off my calves.
Pants story. Tell it again.
You know, maybe it was good
you called Karen.
It definitely was.
And not just for me, but for her, too.
Later that night,
she sat down with Jerry,
and she had the break-up talk
she always avoided with me.
<i>So you see, kids,</i>
<i>sometimes when you have to have
a tough conversation,</i>
<i>the best thing to do...</i>
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
You said you were never gonna talk
to Karen again, right?
Then how do you know
she took your advice?
Right.
About that...
After she broke up with that dude,
she called me, we went out,
we hooked up, we've been dating ever
since. We're really seeing eye to eye,
It just feels different somehow.
Here she comes now. Be cool!
<i> En mars 2009,</i>
<i>je suis sorti quelques semaines
avec ma copine de lycée, Karen.</i>
<i>Mes amis n'étaient pas
super contents.</i>
- Salut à tous.
- Salut.
Désolés, on peut pas rester.
- C'est malheureux !
- Dégoûtée !
- Ce sont des vrais diamants ?
- Oui.
Oui, tout à fait.
- Merci.
- J'ai pas dit que j'aimais.
J'ai fait une super affaire...
Je suis sûre que les mineurs
exploités en Sierra Léone
t'en taperaient cinq
s'ils avaient encore leurs doigts.
Mais c'est joli.
Rejoins-moi en haut.
Il leur faut qu'un doigt
pour faire ce que je pense.
Ted, Karen est une conne.
- Sympa de mettre les formes.
- Je mets les formes, là.
Croyez-le ou non, mes amis n'ont pas
leur mot à dire sur qui je fréquente.
C'est ma vie. Je décide.
- Maintenant !
- J'arrive.
Je vois pas ce qu'il lui trouve,
à cette mégère.
D'accord,
elle a des nichons, mais...
En fait, je vois.
C'est parce qu'il l'a rencontrée
au lycée.
C'est sa toute première copine.
Pour nous, Karen est une idiote.
Pour lui, c'est la première
à avoir touché son zizi
à part lui-même,
sa mère et son pédiatre.
Il est presque 2 h.
Faut que j'aille bosser.
Comment peuvent-ils
appeler ça une "matinale" ?
4 h, c'est encore
le milieu de la nuit.
Tu m'épates.
Ça fait presque un mois.
Je suis habituée.
Et puis le show est pas mal, non ?
- C'est clair.
- Jamais vu.
Vous l'avez déjà regardé ?
- Bien sûr !
- Jamais vu.
Votre rubrique favorite ?
- Météo.
- Jamais vu.
- Vous avez jamais regardé.
- Désolé.
Je viens de le dire.
Je sais, c'est basique et insipide,
et on fait moins d'audience
que la chaîne coréenne
qui ne passe que Kim Jong Il
faisant du cheval.
Mais, les amis,
ça me toucherait de savoir
qu'au moins une fois vous regardez.
Tu sais quoi.
Ce vendredi, tout le monde
viendra chez nous à 3 h 30.
On sort les pyjamas
et on regarde son show.
- Vous êtes les meilleurs.
- On veut t'encourager.
Je veux seulement aller dormir !
Je déteste Robin
de pas avoir mieux réussi.
Salut, les gars.
Mauvaise nouvelle :
Karen m'a plaqué.
Allez-y.
Je savais que tu écoutais !
Synchro : ShalimarFox, Arrow
Adaptation : thiste,
Venusia, tactactac
Relecture : Arrow...

On devrait pas célébrer.
Ted vient de se faire larguer.
Dis-nous tout,
tout ce qui s'est passé.
Sérieux, n'oublie aucun détail.
Elle a dit quoi ?
Toi, t'as dit quoi ?
Comment t'allais ?
Si tu devais le refaire,
du début, peut-être que tu... ?
Comment c'est arrivé ?
C'est totalement stupide.
On était ensemble,
tu sais, on rigolait...
C'est toi qui aimes
le Chianti de 2002.
Non, c'est toi qui aimes
le Chianti de 2002.
Attends. C'est quoi, ça ?
On dirait la boucle d'oreille
de Robin.
Bizarre.
C'est toi...
- Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait ici ?
- Je sais pas.
- T'as couché avec Robin ?
- Quoi ? Bien sûr que non !
Elle a dû se retrouver
dans le linge.
Pourquoi je te croirais ?
Peut-être parce que
j'ai toujours été fidèle,
alors que toi,
tu m'as trompé 6 fois, pétasse.
- Dans ta face !
- Pas vrai ?
J'aurais trop dû dire ça.
Pourquoi je te croirais ?
Peut-être parce que j'ai toujours
été fidèle, alors que toi...
Je t'aime...
Je savais que c'était une erreur.
C'est bon. C'est fini.
Et c'est tout.
Elle est partie.
Quelle histoire.
Quel courage
de partager ça avec nous.
Attends. C'est ça, ton pyjama ?
- Tu dors en pyjama-costard ?
- Bien sûr.
- Tu crois que je dors dans quoi ?
- Un cercueil.
Ça a pas l'air confortable du tout.
- Tu portes une cravate.
- Primo, c'est une cravate de nuit.
Secundo, c'est pas pour le confort.
C'est pour être classe
à tout moment.
Pourquoi avoir la classe
à tout moment ?
Laisse-moi te raconter une histoire
qui m'est arrivée récemment.
On fait un concours
de "qui est la plus chaude",
et on s'est badigeonnées
d'huile de massage.
- Super pyjama.
- On peut utiliser ta douche ?
C'est pas une anecdote,
c'est un porno.
C'est pas "un" film porno,
c'est la scène de...
Oubliez ça.
Mais ça pourrait arriver.
Si ça arrivait
et que j'étais pas au top
pour ces garces huilées,
je le regretterais.
Désolé, mec, mais c'est
le vêtement de nuit le plus ridicule
que j'ai vu de ma vie. Enfin...
Marshall porte une robe de nuit !
Il porte une robe de nuit !
Vous savez quand on dira,
"Rappelez-vous,
il portait une robe de nuit ?"
C'est maintenant !
- C'est une chemise de nuit.
- Appelle ça,
"Tenue de Danger du Ninja",
si tu veux.
Tu restes quand même un travelo.
Je m'en fous. C'est confortable.
Sympa de voler
vers le pays imaginaire avec Peter Pan ?
Moi, encore !
C'était sympa de sortir du lit
pour accompagner
Charlie à la chocolaterie ?
Oh, moi, moi !
Un truc sur Picsou !
Allez, les gars.
Je fais tout le boulot.
Je sais pas.
Je vis avec Marshall depuis 12 ans.
Dès qu'il porte quelque chose,
c'est une victoire.
- Ted, ça va commencer !
- J'arrive.
<i>Bonjour, New York.
Je suis Robin...</i>
Marshall, j'ai trouvé une boucle
d'oreille de Robin sur ta commode.
Tu sais pourquoi l'autre
était dans mon lit ?
- De quoi tu parles ?
- Tu détestes Karen.
Tu m'as dit de rompre avec elle.
C'est toi. T'as mis la boucle
dans mon lit pour que Karen la trouve.
- Je ferais jamais...
- Admets-le !
- Y a rien à admettre !
- Pourquoi était-elle sur ta commode ?
Il est coquet !
Je te jure, si tu me dis pas
la vérité sur le champ...
Attends !
Marshall n'a rien fait.
C'est moi.
Je vous ai fait rompre.
Tu m'as fait rompre avec Karen ?
T'es malade ?
- De quel droit t'as fait ça ?
- Je l'ai fait pour ton bien.
Tu ne voyais pas
à quel point elle était horrible.
Elle a raté le test du porche.
C'est quoi, ce test ?
Toi, moi et Marshall,
on est amis depuis la fac.
Imagine à quel point on compte
les uns pour les autres.
Donc, quand j'envisage l'avenir,
je nous vois tous ensemble.
Quand on sera retraités,
sirotant du thé
sur le porche de notre maison,
jouant au bridge toute la journée.
Les bridges sont sauvages.
Un bridge de quatre
bat un bridge royal.
Je vois vos bridges
et je relance de 3 bridges.
Bridge ! J'ai gagné !
Vous savez pas
jouer au bridge, hein ?
- On prendra des cours.
- C'est important de rester actif.
Donc, chaque fois que tu sors
avec quelqu'un pendant un moment,
je fais le test du porche.
Comment cette personne
s'intègrera au fil des ans ?
Et quand je pense à Karen...
Bridge ! J'ai gagné !
Fantastique. Encore du bridge.
Surtout, pas de lecture.
Regarde, chérie...
des dauphins.
Ils semblent heureux.
Apparemment, les rejets chimiques
de cette propriété élitiste
n'ont pas encore
pourri leurs évents.
Ça arrivera.
Cette eau va vous tuer.
Un vrai piège toxique.
- Je vais me baigner.
- Je viens avec toi.
Karen a raté le test du porche.
Elle devait partir.
Je peux pas croire
que tu aies fait ça.
Pense comme on est géniaux,
toi, moi et Marshall.
Vraiment, penses-y.
- On est assez géniaux.
- On est vraiment géniaux !
Donc, pour celle que tu épouseras,
celle qui rejoindra la Team Géniale,
la barre est très haute.
Je dis pas
que j'ai bien fait, mais...
Tu es mieux sans elle.
Si l'ange Clarence dit que c'est vrai,
ça doit l'être.
Vous savez quoi ?
Allez-y, moquez-vous.
Pourquoi tu portes
ce genre de truc ?
- Plusieurs raisons.
- Tu peux même pas en donner cinq.
Une : on peut
ne rien porter en-dessous.
Je confirme.
Tu peux croiser les jambes ?
Deux : c'est sexy.
Je confirme.
Tu peux décroiser les jambes ?
Trois : mon grand-père Olaf
en portait et il est mort à 107 ans.
Quatre : pas de taille élastique
qui laisse sa marque
autour de ma bedaine de Thanksgiving.
Et cinq :
chaque nuit, quand je vais dormir,
c'est la plus libre et merveilleuse
sensation au monde.
Je me sens...
comme si je volais.
Voilà comment
je vais au lit le soir :
heureux, léger.
Avec le coeur rempli de joie.
Et toi ?
Je dois rester immobile
pour pas froisser mon pyjama-costard.
Mais au moins,
je ne porte pas de robe.
Alors, tu es vraiment fâché ?
Je sais pas.
Je veux dire,
je suppose que si vous ressentez
tout ça pour Karen,
alors, c'est peut-être mieux.
Je suis vraiment désolée.
J'ai détesté refaire ça,
mais Karen devait partir.
"Refaire" ?
Combien de fois tu m'as fait
casser avec mes copines ?
Jamais ! Six.
- Comme qui ?
- Personne ! Angie.
En deuxième année.
Elle t'utilisait
pour se venger de son ex,
et tu le voyais pas, donc...
un jour, elle faisait la sieste...
Creed ?
Oh, mon Dieu,
je dois rompre avec elle.
Voilà où est passé mon CD de Creed.
Qui d'autre ?
Tu te rappelles cette fille bizarre
qui voulait que tu l'épouses
après deux mois ?
Tu l'aimais à peine,
mais tu y pensais quand même, donc...
Écoute, Ted, tu es super,
et c'est très difficile,
mais je pense
qu'on ne recherche pas la même chose.
Donc, longue vie et prospérité.
Ou autre chose.
C'était toi ?
C'est dingue !
Ted, j'ai fait ça pour t'aider.
Tu es accro à l'engagement.
Tu es tombé amoureux de ces femmes,
même si elles ne te méritaient pas.
Et si une d'elles
devait être la mère de mes enfants ?
S'il y avait eu la moindre chance,
je jure, je n'aurais rien fait.
Comme avec Victoria ou Stella.
Ou Robin.
Ou Robin.
Tu nous as fait rompre aussi ?
Tu nous as fait rompre aussi ?
Arrête de me parler
comme si j'étais ton ennemie !
Tu pleures sur ces femmes,
mais tu as le luxe
de ne pas savoir ce que je sais :
ces ruptures tragiques
t'ont sûrement évité
un premier mariage
merdique et très cher.
Tu nous as fait rompre ?
Tu veux pas la vérité, car au fond,
tu veux que je veille sur toi.
Et au fond,
tu sais qu'aucune de ces femmes
n'aurait été la mère de tes enfants.
- Tu nous as fait rompre ?
- J'ai fait ce que j'avais à faire.
- Tu nous as fait rompre ?
- Un peu que je l'ai fait !
Ton grand-père Olaf était un sage.
- Tu m'as fait rompre avec Robin ?
- Non, c'est pas...
Je peux pas le croire.
Il me faut un autre verre.
Je sens une petite brise par là.
- C'est agréable.
- Tu trouves ça bien ?
Viens sur la bouche du chauffage.
C'est comme si ton bazar
était sur une île tropicale.
Le Petit Barney dit "Mahalo".
Sérieusement,
c'est quoi, ton problème ?
- Comment as-tu pu faire ça ?
- Je l'ai fait, car je tiens à toi !
Trop contente
que vous ayez regardé celle-là !
Mon Dieu, que t'est-il arrivé ?
- Vous avez pas vu le show ?
- Le show !
Désolé.
Il s'est passé un truc ?
La routine.
Lily vient de nous dire
qu'elle nous a fait rompre.
Quoi ? Nous faire rompre ?
Ça veut dire quoi ? Et pourquoi
ils portent une robe de nuit ?
- Une chemise.
- Ça s'appelle une chemise.
Il s'avère que Lily
a décidé de saboter
plusieurs de mes relations,
dont la nôtre.
Robin était différente.
Je voulais pas que vous cassiez,
mais vous vouliez
des choses différentes
et vous refusiez de régler ça.
Je pouvais l'imaginer
sous le porche.
2 de coeur.
Comme les coeurs des 2 enfants
que je n'ai jamais eus,
car ma charmante femme
déteste les enfants.
Égalité.
Comme ma carrière qui a chuté
quand j'ai décidé de m'installer
et d'épouser Ted.
Bridge ! J'ai gagné.
Je n'aime pas du tout ce scénario.
J'essayais juste
de vous faire parler de vos problèmes.
Je ne savais pas
que ça mènerait à votre rupture.
J'ai une question drôle, pour rire.
Où tu te vois dans cinq ans ?
Tu sais ce qui est drôle ?
Les questions drôles.
Où tu te vois dans cinq ans ?
Où tu te vois dans cinq ans ?
Et toi ?
Pas que je veuille te le faire dire,
mais tu voudras sûrement te marier.
Je voudrais sûrement me marier.
Tu voudrais sûrement
être à Tokyo ou à Paris.
Je voudrais sûrement
être en Argentine.
En Argentine ?
Ou Tokyo, ou Paris.
On a une date limite, n'est-ce pas ?
Mon Dieu.
Tu peux pas manipuler
les gens comme ça !
Je te connais depuis 12 ans,
mais j'ai jamais été aussi remonté !
- Je voulais pas...
- Je veux rien entendre !
On se calme !
Calmons-nous !
J'ai une question.
- C'est comment quand on est au lit ?
- Viens, allons vérifier.
Donc, sans toi,
on sortirait toujours ensemble ?
Ou vous seriez restés ensemble
trop longtemps,
et auriez eu une rupture
incroyablement amère
sans même rester amis,
et on serait jamais devenues
meilleures amies.
Ne dis pas ça.
Arrêtez les câlins !
T'as pas le droit
de t'immiscer dans mes relations.
T'as de la chance.
Tu as trouvé l'amour de ta vie
dans un dortoir à tes 18 ans.
Ça te donne pas le droit
de jouer à Dieu
pendant que les autres
sont toujours en train de chercher.
Tu t'inquiètes tellement de savoir
qui va finir avec vous sous ce porche.
Tu sais quoi ?
Gardez-le pour vous.
- Il arrivé quoi à ta veste ?
- Suie, miette de pain, placenta.
Tu l'as même pas enregistré ?
T'es à l'aise, tous les soirs,
et Lily couche toujours avec toi ?
C'est ça, le mariage, mec,
l'amour inconditionnel.
Tu peux porter ce que tu veux
et t'envoyer en l'air.
Dis m'en plus sur le mariage.
Parfois, quand tu es marié,
l'odeur du petit-déjeuner
déjà prêt te réveille.
- Le café aussi ?
- Le café aussi.
Parfois, elle met même un vase
de fleurs fraîchement coupées.
J'adore les fleurs.
Et parfois,
quand tu as peur
de faire les mauvais choix
et que t'es pas celui
que tu voulais être,
qu'est-ce qu'elle fait ?
Elle te dit que tu es génial
et que tout ira bien.
C'est magnifique.
Et elle t'aide à trouver
d'autres filles avec qui coucher ?
J'imagine.
Si vous en avez convenu ainsi,
peut-être.
Le bonhomme a eu une dure journée.
On en parlera demain.
Bonne nuit, champion.
<i>Le soir d'après, j'en voulais
toujours à votre tante Lily.</i>
<i>Jusqu'à...</i>
Que fais-tu...
Lily est passée
et m'a tout expliqué.
Et elle m'a donné ça pour toi.
<i>Ted, je suis désolée.</i>
<i>Peu importe qui tu épouses.</i>
<i>Je sais qu'elle sera géniale
parce qu'elle pensera que tu l'es.</i>
<i>Pour prouver ma bonne foi,
je t'ai préparé une surprise</i>
<i>pour toi et Karen en haut.</i>
<i>Bisous, Lily."</i>
<i>P.S. : Désolé que l'enveloppe
soit ouverte.</i>
<i>J'ai lu ce qu'elle a écrit.</i>
<i>Marshall.</i>
Saboter notre relation ?
Je dois avouer que même en mettant
la barre vraiment très bas
pour juger tes amis,
Lily s'est vraiment surpassée.
Manifestement,
on peut pas la revoir.
Je sais.
C'est dur, hein ?
Tu te rappelles
ton coloc de la fac ?
Il était marié à cette fille
à la voix de crécelle.
Ça fait si longtemps.
Mon Dieu, je le détestais.
Enfin, voilà sa nécrologie.
J'ai réalisé que peu importe
ce que mes amis
pensent de ma copine,
mais ça compte vraiment
ce que ma copine pense de mes amis.
- Alors, c'est fini ?
- Oui.
Si tu veux être mon invitée,
Lily est une sacrée cuisinière.
Tourte au boeuf,
macaroni au fromage,
biscuit au beurre maison.
Normal que Marshall meurt à 68 ans.
Merci.
<i>Et avec Robin, nous nous sommes régalés
d'un dîner de gourmet.</i>
<i>Pour elle, le petit-déjeuner.</i>
<i>Et on a fini par faire exactement
ce que Lily voulait qu'on fasse :</i>
<i>parler de notre relation.</i>
En gros, Lily nous a fait rompre.
C'est à se demander.
Si elle avait pas été là,
on sortirait toujours ensemble ?
Peut-être.
Elle a eu raison.
On était pas prêts.
On avait besoin d'avancer,
faire nos trucs à nous.
C'est toujours le cas.
On devrait faire un pacte.
Si les années passent
et qu'à 40 ans,
on est toujours seuls...
Veux-tu être ma femme de secours ?
Une fille rêve d'entendre ces mots.
Un million de fois, oui !
D'accord, c'est réglé.
Est-ce qu'on doit
établir des règles ?
- Genre ?
- Je sais pas.
Comme ne pas devenir énorme,
ce genre-là.
Juste une chose :
pas de chemise de nuit.
Je n'en porterai jamais.
Tant pis.
<i>2009, I'd been dating
my high school girlfriend Karen</i>
<i>for a few weeks. My friends couldn't
have been less excited.</i>
- Hey, everybody.
- Hello.
Sorry, we can't stay long.
- What a shame!
- That is sad!
- Are those real diamond earrings?
- Yes.
Yes, they are.
- Thank you.
- I didn't say I liked them.
I got a great deal on them, so...
Cool. I'm sure
all the exploited diamond miners
in Sierra Leone
would give you a high five
if they still had all their fingers.
But really pretty.
Meet me upstairs.
They only need one finger
to give her what I'm thinking.
Karen's a douche.
- Thanks for sugarcoating.
- "Douche"is sugarcoating it.
Believe it or not, my friends
do not get a vote on who I date.
It's my life.
I call the shots.
- Ted, now!
- Yeah, coming!
I don't know what Ted sees
in that horrible woman.
I mean, yeah,
she's got boobs, but...
I guess I get it.
I think it's 'cause
they met in high school.
She was his first real girlfriend.
We look at Karen and see a jerk.
Ted looks at Karen
and sees the first person to touch
his wiener besides himself,
his mom, and his pediatrician.
It's almost 2:00 A.M.
I better get ready for work.
How can they call that thing
you're on a "morning show"?
4:00 A.M. is still
the middle of the night.
I don't see how you do it.
It's been almost a month.
I'm used to it.
Plus the show's not half bad, right?
- Totally.
- I've never seen it.
Have you guys ever watched it?
- Of course!
- I've never seen it.
What is your favorite segment?
- Weather.
- Never...
- You guys have never seen my show.
- Sorry.
Never seen it.
It's dull and generic
and we get spanked in the ratings
by that Korean channel
that only shows Kim Jong Il
riding a horse,
but guys,
it would mean so much to me
if just once I knew my friends
were out there watching.
I'll tell you what.
This Friday morning,
everyone can come
to our place 3:30 A.M.
We'll all put on Pjs.
We'll watch Robin's show.
What?
- You guys are the best.
- We just want to support you.
I just want to go to sleep!
I hate Robin
for not being more successful.
Sad announcement:
Karen broke up with me.
Go ahead.
I knew you were listening!
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
We shouldn't be celebrating.
Ted's just been through
a bad break-up.
Buddy, tell us everything.
Tell us what happened.
Seriously, spare no details.
What did she say?
What did you say?
How did it feel?
If you were to do it again,
all over, would you maybe...?
How did it happen?
It was the stupidest thing.
I mean,
we were just hanging out,
you know, being funny...
You're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.
No, you're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.
Wait. What is this?
Looks like one of Robin's earrings.
That's weird.
You're the...
- How did it get in your bed?
- I don't know.
- Have you been sleeping with Robin?
- What? No, of course not!
It probably got mixed in
with the laundry or something.
Why should I believe you?
Maybe because
I've always been faithful to you
while you've cheated on me,
like, six times, bitch.
- Cold-blooded!
- Right? Right?
I totally should have said that.
Why should I believe you?
Maybe because I've always been
faithful to you while you...
I love you...
I knew this was a mistake.
That's it. It's over.
And that was it.
She left.
What a story.
So brave of you to share that.
Wait.Those are your pajamas?
- You sleep in a pajama suit?
- Of course.
- What do you think I sleep in?
- A coffin.
Dude, that doesn't look
comfortable at all.
- You're wearing a tie.
- First of all, it's a sleeping cravat.
Second, it's not about comfort.
It's about looking good
all the time.
Why do you have to look good
all the time?
Let me tell you a little story
about something happened
a couple months.
We were just having a
"Who's hornier" contest
and we spilled massage oil
all over ourselves.
- Nice pajamas.
- Can we use your shower?
That's not a memory.
That's from a porn movie.
- Not just any movie.
- That's the exact scene from...
Never mind.
The point is it could happen.
And if it did,
and I didn't look my absolute best
for those greasy sluts,
I'd regret it forever.
I'm sorry, dude, but that is
just the most ridiculous
sleeping attire
I've ever seen in my life. Anyway...
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!
You know how in the future
we're always saying
"Remember when Marshall
wore a nightgown"? This is that time!
- It's a nightshirt.
- You can call it
a Ninja Star Danger Jock
if you want.
Doesn't make you any
less of a cross-dresser.
Whatever, dude. It's comfy.
So, flying to Neverland
with Peter and Tink, was that amazing?
Let me go next!
Was it nice
to finally get out of that
crowded bed and take
Charlie to the chocolate factory?
Oh, me, me!
Something about Scrooge!
Come on, guys.
I'm carrying the team.
I don't know.
I lived with Marshall for 12 years.
Any time he's wearing clothes at all,
it's a victory.
- Ted, show's about to start!
- Be right there!
<i>Good morning, New York.
I'm Robin...</i>
Marshall, I just found
Robin's earring on your dresser.
Did you have something to do
with the other being in my bed?
- What are you talking about?
- You've hated Karen.
You've been telling me
to break up with her.
You did it. You put the earring
in my bed so that Karen would find it.
- No, Ted, I would never...
- Admit it!
- There's nothing to admit!
- Why was Robin's earring
- on your dresser?
- He was accessorizing!
Marshall, I swear to God,
if you don't tell me the truth now...
Wait!
Marshall didn't do it.
I did.
I broke you and Karen up.
You broke me and Karen up?
Are you insane?
- What gives you the right to do that?
- I did it for your own good.
You just weren't seeing
how awful she was.
She failed the Front Porch Test.
What's the Front Porch Test?
Ted, you, me, and Marshall
have been best friends since college.
Think about how much
we all mean to each other.
So when I picture the future,
I picture us all together.
<i>How we'll all be retired,
sipping tea</i>
<i>on the front porch of our beach house,
playing bridge all day.</i>
Bridges are wild.
Four of a bridge
beats a royal bridge.
I see your bridge
and I raise you three bridges.
Bridge!
I win!
You have no idea
how to play bridge, do you?
- We're gonna take a class.
- It's important to stay active.
So whenever you've been dating
somebody for a while,
I do the Front Porch Test.
You know, how is this person gonna fit
in with our group over the years?
And when I think
about Karen there...
Bridge!
I win!
Fantastic. Another game of bridge.
Don't read a book or anything.
Look, dear...
dolphins.
They seem happy.
I guess the chemical runoff
from this elitist beach front property
hasn't rotted out
their blowholes yet.
It will.
That water will kill you.
It is a toxic deathtrap.
- I'm gonna take a dip.
- I'll join you.
Karen failed the Front Porch Test.
She had to go.
I can't believe you did that.
Think about how awesome you, me,
and Marshall are.
Seriously think about it.
- We're pretty awesome.
- We're totally awesome!
So whoever you marry, whoever
joins Team Awesome,
the bar is set pretty damn high.
Look, I'm not saying
what I did was right, but...
You're better off without her.
And if Clarence the angel
says it's true, it must be true.
Okay, you know what?
Fine, make your little jokes.
Why would you wear
something like that?
- Lots of reasons.
- I bet you can't name five.
One: No need to wear
anything underneath.
I can vouch for that.
Will you cross your legs?
Two: Sexy.
I can vouch for that.
Will you uncross your legs, buddy?
Three: My Grandpa Olaf
wore one and he lived to be 107.
Four: No elastic waistband
leaving its judgmental pink teeth marks
around my Thanksgiving belly.
And five:
Every night when I go to sleep,
it's the freest, most wonderful
feeling in the world.
I feel...
like I'm flying.
So that's how
I go to bed every night:
happy, weightless.
With a heart full of joy.
What about you?
I have to lie perfectly still
so I don't wrinkle my suit-jamas.
But at least
I'm not wearing a dress.
So... how mad are you?
I don't know.
I mean,
I guess if you guys feel
that strongly about Karen,
then maybe it was for the best.
I really am sorry.
I hated doing that again,
but Karen had to go.
"Again"?
Wait. How many times have you
broken me up with a girlfriend?
Never! Six.
- Like who?
- No one! Angie.
Sophomore year.
She was just using you
to get back at her ex,
and you clearly didn't see it, so...
one day when she was taking a nap...
Creed?
Oh, my God,
I have to break up with her.
So that's where my Creed CD went.
Who else?
Remember that weird sci-fi girl
who wanted you to propose
after, like, two months?
You barely even liked her, but
you were still thinking about it, so...
Listen, Ted, you're great,
and this is so difficult,
but I think we're looking
for different things.
So, live long and prosper.
Or whatever.
That was you?
This is insane!
Ted, I did those things to help you.
You're a commitment junkie.
You fall in love with these women,
even if they don't deserve you.
What if one of those women
was the mother of my children?
If there was ever the tiniest chance
of that, I swear I didn't do anything.
Like with Victoria or Stella.
Or Robin.
Or Robin.
Did you break us up, too?
Did you break us up, too?!
Stop talking to me
like I'm your enemy!
You weep for these women,
but you have the luxury
of not knowing what I know:
that those breakups, while tragic,
probably saved you
from a crappy
and very expensive first marriage.
Did you break me and Robin up?
You don't want the truth
because deep down,
you want me out there
watching out for you.
And deep down,
you know that none of those women
were ever gonna be
the mother of your children.
- Did you break me and Robin up?
- I did what I had to do.
- Did you break me and Robin up?
- You're damn right I did!
Your grandpa Olaf was a wise man.
- You broke me and Robin up?
- No, it's not...
I cannot believe this.
I need another drink.
I feel a little breeze down there.
- It's nice.
- You think that's something?
Stand over this heating vent.
It's like your junk
is on a tropical island.
Little Barney says "Mahalo".
Seriously, what is wrong
with you, Lily?
- How could you do that?
- I did this because I care about you!
I am so glad
that is the one you watched!
Dear God, what happened to you?
- You didn't watch my show?
- The show.
Sorry.
Something special happen?
Same old, same old.
Lily just told us
that she broke you and me up.
What? Broke-broke us up?
What does that even mean? And why
are these guys wearing nightgowns?
- Nightshirts.
- It's called a nightshirt, Robin.
Turns out Lily has taken it
upon herself to sabotage
many of my relationships,
including ours.
Robin was different.
I didn't want you two to break up,
but you wanted completely
different things out of life
and refused to deal with it.
I could just picture
that front porch.
Two of hearts.
Just like the hearts of
the two children I never had
because my lovely wife hates kids.
A deuce.
Exactly what my career dropped
once I decided to settle down
and marry Ted.
Bridge!
I win.
I do not like that scenario one bit.
All I tried to do was get you guys
to talk about your issues.
I didn't know
I was feeding you the words
that would lead to your breakup.
Here's a fun question, just for fun.
Where do you see yourself
in five years?
You know what's fun?
Fun questions.
Where do you see yourself
in five years?
Where do you see yourself
in five years?
Where do you see yourself?
Not to put words in your mouth,
but you probably want to be married.
I probably want to be married.
You probably want to be
in Tokyo or Paris.
I probably want to be in Argentina.
Argentina?
Or Tokyo or Paris.
We have an expiration date,
don't we?
Oh, my God.
You can't manipulate people
like that!
I've known you 12 years,
and I can honestly say,
I have never been
more furious at you!
- Look, I didn't mean to...
- I don't even want to hear it!
Settle down!
Let's just settle down!
Now, I have one question.
What do these bad boys
feel like in bed?
Come on. Let's go see.
So, if it weren't for you,
Ted and I might still be dating?
Or you would have
stayed together far too long,
had an incredibly bitter breakup
and not even remained friends,
and then you and I would
never have become best friends.
Don't even say that.
Stop hugging!
You had no right
to interfere in my relationships.
You got lucky.
Okay? You met the love of your life
in a dorm hallway when you were 18.
But that doesn't give you the right
to play God
to the rest of us mortals down here
who are still looking for someone.
You're so concerned about who you
and Marshall are gonna end up
on that front porch with.
You know what?
You can have it to yourselves.
- What happened to your jacket?
- Oh, soot, bread crumbs, placenta.
Did you at least TiVo it?
So you're this comfy every night,
and Lily still has sex with you?
That's what marriage is all about,
man, unconditional love.
You can wear whatever you want
and still get laid.
Tell me more about being married.
Sometimes, when you're married,
you wake up to the smell
of breakfast already on the table.
- And coffee, too?
- And coffee, too.
Sometimes, she'll
even put out a vase
of freshly cut flowers.
I love flowers.
And sometimes,
when you're worried you've made
all the wrong decisions in life
and you're not nearly
the man you want to be,
what does she do then?
She tells you that you're great
and it's all gonna be okay.
That's wonderful.
And she'll help you find
other girls to have sex with?
I mean, I guess.
Maybe if you agreed upon
that beforehand, yeah.
Little guy had a big day.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Sweet dreams, slugger.
<i>The next night,
I was still angry at your aunt Lily.</i>
<i>Until...</i>
What are you...?
Lily came by
and explained everything.
And she gave me this note for you.
<i>"Ted, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>"It doesn't matter to me
who you marry.</i>
<i>"I know they'll be awesome
because they'll think you are.</i>
<i>"To show I mean it, I put
together a little surprise</i>
<i>"for you and Karen upstairs.</i>
<i>"Love, Lily."</i>
<i>"P.S. Sorry the envelope
was already open.</i>
<i>"I had to read what she wrote.</i>
<i>"Marshall."</i>
Sabotaging our relationship?
I got to say, even using the
specially-ordered extra-low bar
by which I judge your friends,
Lily really outdid herself
this time.
Obviously,
we can't ever see her again.
I know.
It's a big loss, right?
Remember your old college roommate?
He was married
to that shrill little idiot girl.
It's been so long.
God, I hated him.
Anyway, here's his obituary.
I realized,
maybe it shouldn't matter
what my friends think
of my girlfriend,
but it sure as hell matters
what my girlfriend thinks of my friends.
- So you ended it?
- Yeah.
So if you want to be my plus one,
Lily's a damn good cook.
Beef pot pie, mac and cheese,
homemade buttermilk biscuits.
No wonder Marshall dies at 68.
Thank you.
<i>So, Robin and I enjoyed
a gourmet dinner.</i>
<i>For her it was breakfast.</i>
<i>And we ended up doing exactly
what Lily wanted us to do all along:</i>
<i>we talked about our relationship.</i>
So, Lily broke us up, sort of.
Kind of makes you wonder.
I mean, if it weren't for her,
would we still be dating right now?
Maybe.
But Lily was right.
We weren't ready. We both need
to move on, do our own thing.
Still do, I guess.
We should make a pact.
If the years go by,
and we both turn 40,
and we're still single...
Will you be my backup wife?
A girl always dreams
of hearing those words.
A million times, yes!
All right, it's a deal.
So, should we set up
some ground rules for this?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Like neither one of us
can get super fat. Stuff like that.
Okay, I only have one:
you can't wear a nightshirt.
I will never wear a nightshirt.
Never mind.
<i>Au printemps 2009, j'ai ťtť engagť

Scarlett Johansson aux Oscars.
Si je pouvais me faire une cťlťbritť,
Áa serait Scarlett Johansson.
Canon, talentueuse et on ne tourne pas
autant de Woody Allen
sans problŤme de pŤre.
Si je me faisais une cťlťbritť,
Áa serait Lily.
C'est la star de mon coeur.
Pour moi, Áa serait Hugh Jackman.
Vous savez, les cťlťbritťs,
elles aiment des trucs sexuels
vraiment bizarres. Croyez-moi.
Comment tu saurais Áa ?
C'est embarrassant, mais je...
Je suis rentrťe
avec une cťlťbritť un soir.
Mon Dieu ! Sťrieux ?
Il voulait faire
des trucs ťtranges avec moi,
donc je suis partie.
C'est tout. Fin de l'histoire.
Non, pas fin de l'histoire.
Je dois savoir qui, quoi, quand et oý.
Balance !
S'il te plaÓt, calme-toi.
Tu avales trop d'air.
Mais avant que tu poursuives,
je suis flattť,
mais techniquement,
je ne suis pas une cťlťbritť.
De plus, une derniŤre fois,
le masque, c'ťtait une blague.
Pas toi, Barney.
Qui c'est, qui ?
Maintenant,
tu lui as filť le hoquet.
Je vous dirai rien de spťcifique.
Mais tout ce que je dirai,
c'est qu'il est canadien,
mais vous le connaissez.
Et il m'a ramenť chez lui
en proposant de me montrer
une collection unique.
Comment Áa, "collection" ?
Comme on collectionne les timbres
ou les piŤces. Mais je dirai rien.
Dis-nous au moins
le truc bizarre qu'il voulait faire.
Je sais pas comment vous l'appelez,
mais on a un nom pour Áa au Canada.
…coutez, j'en ai dťjŗ trop dit.
Donc, la cťlťbritť mystŤre
qui collectionne un truc mystťrieux
t'a demandť de faire
un mystťrieux acte sexuel canadien.
- Oui.
- Dis-nous.
Je vous le dirai.
Mais seulement si vous devinez
les trois parties correctement.
- C'est tout simplement impossible.
- Exactement.
Je ne connais mÍme pas
d'acte sexuel canadien.
Tu as le <i>Chien de TraÓneau</i>,
le <i>PiŤge du Homard</i>,
la <i>Police Montťe</i>.
Comment tu connais Áa ?
Canadiansexact.org, c'est en favori.
- Point org ?
- Ouais. C'est non lucratif.
Ils veulent juste
diffuser l'information.
Je viens d'avoir
une conversation bizarre.
Une femme ŗ la GNB
m'a dit que la nouvelle tour
a ťtť abandonnťe le mois dernier.
C'est dingue, non ?
C'est quoi, ce regard ?
- On lui dit ? On devrait.
- Non. Je veux pas.
- Y a pas eu de regard.
- Il se passe quoi ?
Il est temps que tu saches.
Il y a quelques semaines,
Bilson nous a convoquťs.
On abandonne le projet
pour le nouveau siŤge.
Cette rťcession nous tue.
On annule tout le superflu.
Et j'ai des choix difficiles ŗ faire
pendant ma retraite semestrielle
ŗ Saint Croix.
Mec, Ted va Ítre dťvastť.
Pas s'il l'apprend
de son meilleur ami.
- Je dois lui dire ?
- Je dois lui dire ?
- Dis-lui, t'es son meilleur ami.
- Non, c'est toi.
- Non, c'est vraiment toi.
- Chut, il arrive.
Le blanc ou l'asiatique ?
Tu vois, je le connais ŗ peine.
- Comment Áa va ?
- Tu vas bien ?
Je suis frustrť.
Le moindre truc innovant
dans mes dessins,
Bilson le coupe ŗ la machette.
Je dťteste dťpendre
de ce genre de type.
- Tu devrais quitter le projet.
- C'est clair, quitte-le.
- C'est indigne de toi.
- C'est dťcidť.
Un nouveau dťpart !
Que les vents soient avec toi...
Vous rigolez ? Ils viennent encore
de virer un type dans ma boÓte.
Bilson est lourd, c'est clair,
mais sans ce projet,
j'ai plus de boulot.
C'est drŰle
que tu mentionnes le projet.
- Car...
- T'es super bon.
Continue comme Áa, mec.
Tes cheveux, tes dents
sont superbes aujourd'hui.
Tu brilles comme un diamant !
Merci bien.
J'en avais besoin.
Bon, je remonte travailler.
Faut que j'insŤre une poutre
dans le couloir sombre de Bilson.
Vous m'avez compris.
C'ťtait quoi, Áa ?
J'ai une idťe.
Les deux prochains mois de Ted
sont payťs de toute faÁon.
On pourrait pas le laisser continuer
et ne rien lui dire ?
Il a eu une annťe difficile.
Laissons-le s'amuser encore un peu.
Tu suggŤres un mensonge compliquť,
ŗ long terme
qui implique une grande discipline.
Un mec comme toi n'y arrivera pas.
- Mais si, je peux.
- Mens-moi, lŗ.
- J'ai un vaisseau spatial.
- Quel type de carburant ?
J'ai pas de vaisseau spatial.
Mais non !
Dťfends-toi !
Si quelqu'un te questionne,
dťtourne-le du mensonge initial
avec d'autres mensonges.
Je te montre. J'ai un poney.
Questionne-moi.
- Il est de quelle couleur ?
- Quand j'ai eu Dandelion,
elle ťtait
d'un teint noisette profond,
malheureusement, son ťtable est situťe
prŤs d'une usine chimique,
qui a contaminť l'eau.
Avec le temps,
elle est devenue d'un gris terne
et le vťtťrinaire
ne peut rien faire pour l'aider.
Mon Dieu !
C'est horrible.
Dandelion va s'en sortir ?
D'accord... T'es fort !
Dandelion n'est pas malade, hein ?
Donc la tour est vraiment annulťe
et vous m'avez menti.
On l'a fait pour te protťger.
J'y crois pas. Mes deux meilleurs amis
m'ont plantť et j'ai rien vu.
Au Canada, on appelle Áa
un <i>Chasse-neige Vicieux</i>.
Cette tour ťtait le job de mes rÍves
et elle est partie en fumťe.
Dťsolť, Ted.
Il me faut un verre.
Le pauvre.
C'est dťplacť si je reviens
sur le sexe au Canada ?
- Pas du tout.
- T'as mis du temps.
Qu'est-ce qu'un <i>Zamboni ŗ 2 mains</i> ?
Disons que le seul truc
que porte la femme,
c'est des patins ŗ ses mains.
Le <i>Pack de lait de Manitoba</i> ?
C'est comme la <i>Moustache de Chicago</i>,
mais la personne en dessous
porte une combi.
Un <i>PiŤge ŗ Homards de Terre-Neuve</i> ?
Je sais pas, je veux pas le savoir.
Ces gens-lŗ sont dingues.
Bon, je fais ma 1re proposition.
D'accord, mais je le dis seulement
si tu trouves la personne,
l'acte et la collection.
Bon, je me lance.
Bryan Adams.
Il collectionne
des cartes de baseball
et il voulait te faire...
un <i>Kayak huileux</i>.
Wayne Gretzky, Hot Wheels anciennes,
un <i>Eskimo ŗ genoux</i>.
Kiefer Sutherland,
petits verres souvenir,
et un <i>Pancake Collant</i>.
J'aurais acceptť, Áa.
Attendez.
S'ils ont annulť
le projet il y a un mois,
pourquoi y suis-je allť chaque semaine
pour voir le nouveau groupe de travail ?
…videmment, tu pouvais pas
te pointer et voir Bilson.
Donc, on a... inventť
le groupe de travail.
Il suffisait juste
de rťunir une ťquipe.
<i>Tu vois Roy Waterman,
Vice Prťsident du Capital Risque ?</i>
<i>C'est en fait...</i>
<i>Roy de l'entretien.</i>
Excuse-moi, Roy.
«a te dirait
de te faire un peu d'argent ?
Jusqu'oý je dois me dťsaper ?
<i>Louisa Mendoza,
Vice Prťsidente exťcutive au Capital,</i>
<i>c'est en fait...</i>
<i>Louisa de la cantine.</i>
Louisa, j'ai besoin de votre aide,
mais interdit d'en parler.
Je parle pas anglais.
Exactement.
C'est un secret important.
Comment dit-on "secret" en espagnol ?
Des boulettes ?
D'accord. <i>Albondigas</i>.
Ce sera notre petit <i>albondigas</i>.
Je peux avoir des boulettes,
s'il vous plaÓt ?
<i>Et Arthur Nasmith, le gťnie excentrique,
gourou des investissements,</i>
<i>c'est en fait...</i>
<i>Arty le fÍlť,
l'homme-orchestre de la 15e rue.</i>
Excusez-moi.
On peut discuter ?
En fait, mon assistant Reginald
prend mes rendez-vous.
<i>On a complťtť le groupe
avec des stagiaires</i>
<i>et payť 50 $ pour qu'ils aient l'air
passionnťs quand tu disais...</i>
Reginald, la semaine prochaine,
sors-moi de lŗ.
C'ťtait une des conceptions
les plus inspirťes de ma carriŤre.
J'ťtais si excitť.
Alex Trebek, un <i>Gardien …ventť</i>,
- ours en peluche !
- Non.
- Bon sang !
- Attendez.
«a explique
ce qui s'est passť avec Louisa.
- Bon boulot.
- TrŤs bien !
Louisa.
On fait quoi ŗ propos de Áa ?
Ne faites pas
comme si vous compreniez pas.
Vous ressentez la mÍme chose.
AprŤs tout !
Non, je ne peux pas.
Je suis fiancťe avec M. Barney.
On s'en fiche. On vit qu'une fois !
Non, c'est pas bien !
Nom de Dieu,
vous Ítes dans le groupe de travail !
Y a t-il autre chose
que vous voudriez me dire ?
Quand tu as jouť 3e base
pour l'ťquipe de softball de GNB.
Il n'y a pas d'ťquipe de softball.
On a juste louť un terrain,
rťuni un tas de mecs
pour qu'ils fassent de toi un hťros.
Mon tour d'honneur ťtait bidon ?
Dťsolť, on savait que tu serais
bientŰt au chŰmage.
On voulait que tu te sentes bien.
Les amis font Áa.
Mentir ?
Parfois, oui, pour les protťger.
Faux ! Ne jamais mentir ŗ ses amis.
Je ne vous aurais jamais menti.
Vraiment ? Et cette soirťe Micro Ouvert
au Comedy Club ?
<i>Vous Ítes comme moi, les gens ?</i>
<i>Avez-vous dťjŗ songť
ŗ la quantitť d'espŤces de poissons ?</i>
<i>Et...</i>
<i>le nom de ces poissons ?</i>
<i>En voici quelques-uns.</i>
<i>"Truite."</i>
Pas vrai ?
<i>"Esturgeon".
Je pense pas mon pote.</i>
<i>"Saumon".</i>
<i>Je vais le redire...</i>
<i>Saumon.</i>
<i>Qui a cru
que c'ťtait une bonne idťe ?</i>
"Bar". Ce gars-lŗ
sait de quoi je parle.
<i>"Flťtan".</i>
<i>Merci, bonne soirťe.</i>
- Comment j'ťtais ?
- Super. TrŤs marrant.
Mortel...
jeudi soir pour tout le monde.
Temps mort.
Vous avez pas aimť les poissons ?
C'ťtait horrible !
T'as juste lu une liste de poissons.
Quoi qu'il en soit...
«a prouve mon point de vue.
Vous m'avez menti pour me protťger.
«a n'a rien ŗ voir !
J'ai perdu un mois de ma vie
ŗ bosser sur un projet mort.
J'aurais pu passer ce temps
ŗ trouver de nouveaux contrats.
Au lieu de Áa,
je vais y aller demain matin,
et sŻrement Ítre virť.
Meilleur scťnario,
mon patron va me gueuler dessus
devant tout le monde.
- Chez moi, on appelle Áa un...
- Un <i>Totem de Saskatoon</i>. C'est lŗ.
Bonjour, salauds de menteurs.
Pas de mensonges avant que je parte
au boulot pour me faire virer ?
- Jolie chemise.
- T'es le diable.
Et si on te disait qu'on t'a trouvť
un autre projet ŗ la GNB,
oý tu devras refaire
une partie du 20e ťtage.
Si c'est un mensonge,
c'est vraiment nul.
Et je ferai quoi ?
C'est la P.T.E. du 18e ťtage.
En gros,
Bilson veut une piŤce comme Áa,
deux ťtages plus haut, chez nous.
- Attends, c'est quoi une P.T.E. ?
- PiŤce de Transition des Employťs.
- «a veut dire quoi ?
- C'est un endroit
oý un responsable et un employť
entament un transfert de connaissance
ŗ propos d'un imminent
changement professionnel.
On vire les gens ici.
C'est horrible.
Pourquoi avoir une piŤce spťciale
pour virer les gens ?
GNB pense
qu'il faut un endroit sťcurisť
pour faire face aux nouvelles.
C'est du sťrieux lŗ-dedans.
<i>ņ contrecoeur, j'acceptais de concevoir
une piŤce oý virer les gens.</i>
<i>Mais, j'ťtais dťcidť
ŗ y mettre ma touche.</i>
En quittant l'espace licenciement,
vous arriverez dans ce que j'appelle
"le Couloir
de la Renaissance Tranquille".
Ici, une chambre de repos ovale
avec un soutien psychologique.
Juste lŗ, aprŤs la fontaine
du Nouveau Dťpart.
Et la voilŗ.
Au lieu d'une cellule triste
et lugubre,
un utťrus protecteur...
donnant le jour ŗ une nouvelle vie.
- J'adore.
- Vraiment ?
- Bon boulot, Ted.
- Merci.
Vous pouvez ajouter ces touches
ŗ la PTE du 18e ťtage ?
- Absolument.
- Gťnial.
Allons voir Áa.
- OK, je pense que ce mur...
- Vous Ítes virť !
- Quoi ?
- Je voulais cette piŤce !
Cette mÍme piŤce,
deux ťtages plus haut !
- Mais...
- Vous Ítes virť !
Dťgagez d'ici.
Salut, chťrie.
N'importe qui du groupe Rush,
une <i>Tarte ŗ la Viande de Montrťal</i>
et une boÓte ŗ goŻter de superhťros.
Rick Moranis,
Le <i>Rick Moranis Inversť</i>,
des antiquitťs juives.
J'abandonne.
«a fait trois jours que je cherche.
J'arrÍte.
Si Áa veut dire
que je saurais jamais, soit.
- Bien.
- Dis-le-nous !
Vous voulez vraiment savoir ?
Mais cette info
ne quitte pas cette table.
Mon Dieu.
Je suis toute excitťe.
- Je vais le lire.
- Lis-le.
- Lis-le.
- Je vais le lire. Allons-y.
"La Raquette Gelťe",
"Le Vieux Roi Clancy",
"Les Plateaux d'Harvey".
Alors ?
Je ne comprends aucun de ces mots.
L'un d'eux est censť Ítre cťlŤbre ?
Qui diable...
est Le Vieux Roi Clancy ?
C'est pas la personne,
c'est l'acte sexuel.
C'est comme le <i>Col Roulť de Sacramento</i>,
mais avec du sirop d'ťrable.
Et la cťlťbritť,
c'est Harvey Lťplateaux ?
Non, c'est la collection.
Les plateaux d'Harvey.
Ces plateaux orange qu'on te donne
quand tu manges chez Harvey.
Les restaurants ?
Allons, tu fais une virťe
sur l'autoroute Trans-Canada,
tu as un creux
entre Milverton et Wawa,
oý tu t'arrÍtes manger, hein ?
Chez Harvey. Plus de 12000 clients !
Donc la cťlťbritť ťtait...
La Raquette Gelťe.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Vous connaissez pas La Raquette Gelťe ?
C'est que le catcheur pro
le plus connu du Canada.
Je l'ai rencontrť aprŤs sa victoire
sur Rick "Le Tťmťraire" Rogers
ŗ la Memorial Arena de Kamloops
en 2002.
Un classique.
Alors, tu dis que La Raquette Gelťe
t'a invitť chez lui
pour te montrer
des plateaux d'Harvey,
et t'as demandť de lui faire
un <i> Vieux Roi Clancy</i> ?
Exactement.
Et je suis sťrieuse,
n'en parlez ŗ personne.
Mon hoquet est parti.
Peut-Ítre pour toujours.
Tu as recommencť.
Tu as mÍme trouvť
un moyen de g‚cher Áa.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi te laisse-t-on Ítre un pays ?
Hť, Mister Whisper.
Tu devrais pas Ítre lŗ-haut
ŗ dessiner ta super PTE ?
- Je suis plus sur le projet.
- Quoi ?
- Bilson m'a virť.
- Tu plaisantes.
«a veut dire quoi pour ta sociťtť ?
Tu vas Ítre licenciť ?
En fait, je viens de dťmissionner.
Pourquoi ?
Je ne peux plus travailler
pour de grandes sociťtťs sans coeur.
En me vendant
ŗ votre "groupe de travail",
je faisais le boulot le plus inspirť
de ma carriŤre. En fait,
vous m'avez rappelť
combien mon boulot pouvait Ítre sympa
quand j'ai pas affaire
ŗ des Bilson, alors...
j'ai dťmissionnť.
- Ils t'ont virť, hein ?
- Oui, monsieur.
Mais j'ai de bonnes indemnitťs
et j'ai pris une grande dťcision.
Je vais monter ma propre boÓte.
- C'est excitant.
- Avec cette ťconomie ?
Alors, tu nous en veux pas ?
En fin de compte,
je vous suis reconnaissant.
Comment c'ťtait avec Bilson ?
AprŤs qu'il a proposť
un changement professionnel,
j'ai fait une prťsentation impromptue
avec une approche en quatre temps
- qui l'a mis ŗ genou.
- Tu l'as frappť avec une chaise ?
- Ouais.
- Bien jouť.
Celui lŗ, je l'ai eu au restaurant
entre Milverton et Wawa.
C'est trŤs impressionnant,
La Raquette Gelťe.
On est amis.
Appelle-moi "Raquette".
Assieds-toi.
Alors, Raquette...
Aimerais-tu me faire...
un <i>Vieux Roi Clancy</i> ?
Tu devrais y aller.
<i>In the spring of 2009,
I've been hired to design</i>
<i>a new headquarters
for Goliath National Bank.</i>
<i>And I was eager to add
as much of my voice</i>
<i>as an architect
into the plans as possible.</i>
Woodbeams bathed
in natural light in the atrium.
They're gonna love it!
<i>There was only one problem</i>
<i>and his name was Bilson.</i>
Wood?
Natural light?
Natural light reminds the workers
that there's an outside world
where they had family and friends.
We want to crush that!
You show up in the dark,
you go home in the dark.
You spend your whole damn day
in the dark!
I need to hear Lily's voice.
Who said you could leave?
<i>Bilson was killing
every original idea I had.</i>
<i>Then, one day
GNB took him off the project</i>
<i>and created a new task force
to oversee my designs.</i>
<i>Suddenly, everything changed.</i>
We'll have a rooftop zen garden
for quiet contemplation.
We'll have a reflecting pool
in the lobby where...
local children
can come to make wishes.
The New GNB,
a place of work.
That you can call "home".
Thank you, and...
welcome home.
<i>Everything was going great,</i>
<i>until one day, in the elevator.</i>
Yeah, it's Ted.
No, no.
I did not approve that change
for the blueprints
for the new GNB headquarters
for which I'm the head architect,
at only 30 years old.
Yes, I'm single,
and I give to charity.
What does that have to do
with anything?
All right, goodbye, Mr. Mayor.
You know that was a fake phone call?
Yes, and I also know
that the new GNB headquarters project
was scrapped last month.
Nice try.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
Check out
Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars.
If I could nail any celebrity it would
definitely be Scarlett Johansson.
Hot, talented, and nobody does
that many Woody Allen movies
without serious daddy issues.
If I could nail any celebrity,
it would be Lily.
She's the star of my heart.
For me, it would be Hugh Jackman.
You know, I don't know, celebrities,
they're into some really
weird sex stuff. Trust me.
How would you know that?
This is embarassing, but I...
I went home
with a celebrity one night.
Oh my God! Seriously?
Yeah, he wanted to do
this really freaky thing with me,
so I left. That's it. End of story.
No, no, not end of story
I need to know who, what,
when, and in where. Spill it!
Lily, please settle down.
You're swallowing to much air.
But before you go any further,
I'm flattered, but technically,
I'm not a celebrity.
Plus, for the last time,
I put the mask on as a joke.
OK, not you Barney.
OK, who is it?
Now you give Lily the hiccups.
OK, I won't tell you
anything specific.
But all I'll say
is he is Canadian born,
but you definitely know this guy.
And he got me back to his place
by offering to show me
a very unique collection.
What do you mean collection?
You know some people collect
like stamps or coins,
it's like that. But I'm not telling.
At least tell us the weird thing
he wanted to do.
I don't know what you call it here,
but we have a name for it in Canada.
Look, I've already said too much.
So, mystery celebrity
who collects a mystery item
asked you to do
a mystery Canadian sex act.
- Yes.
- Tell us!
OK, I'll tell you.
But only if you guess
all three parts correctly.
- That's just impossible.
- Exactly.
I don't even know
any Canadian sex acts.
You got your "Sloppy Dog Sled",
your "Alberta Fur Trapper",
your "Full Mounty".
How do you know all these?
Canadiansexacts.org,
it's bookmarked on the top right.
- Dot org?
- Yeah. It's not for profit.
They really just wanna get
the information out there.
So I just had
the weirdest conversation.
This woman at GNB told me
that the new bank building
was scrapped last month.
It's crazy, right?
Wait, what's that look?
- Should we tell him?
- Not me.
- We should.
- No.
- There was no look.
- Guys! What the hell?
It's time that you know the truth.
A few weeks ago,
Bilson called us into his office.
We're scrapping the plan
for the new GNB headquarters.
This recession is killing us.
We're cutting
anything non-essential.
And I have a lot of tough choices
to make at the
bi-quarterly retreat in St. Croix.
Man, Ted is gonna be devastated.
Not when he hears it
coming from his best friend.
- I have to tell him?
- I have to tell him?
- Tell him, you're his best friend.
- I'm not, you're his best friend.
- I'm not, you're his best friend.
- Quiet, here he comes.
The white dude or the Asian fellow?
See, I barely know the guy.
- Ted, what's up?
- How're you doing?
I'm frustrated.
Anything innovative
I put in my designs,
Bilson just hacks out
with a machette.
I hate having to answer
to a guy like that.
- You should drop the project.
- You should totally drop the project.
- It's beneath you.
- Then it's settled.
Ted Mosby's new chapter!
May the wind be at your back...
Are you kidding? They just laid off
another architect at my firm.
I mean, Bilson is
a pain sure, but...
without this project,
I'm probably out of a job.
Right... it's funny
that you mentioned the project.
- Because...
- You're nailing it.
Keep up the good work buddy.
Your hair and teeth
look fantastic today,
you're shining like a diamond!
Thank you.
I needed that.
I'm gonna head upstairs
and keep working.
I got to find a way to introduce
some wood into Bilson's dark atrium.
I think you know what I meant.
- What was that?
- What?
I have a thought. OK, we're paying
Ted's firm for two more months
of design work no matter what,
so couldn't we just let him
keep working and not tell him?
He's had a rough year. Let's let the guy
be happy a little while longer.
What you're suggesting
is an elaborate, long-term lie
that requires tremendous commitment.
A nice guy like you
can't pull that off.
- Sure I can.
- Lie to me right now.
- I have a spaceship.
- What kind of fuel powers it?
Okay, I don't have a spaceship.
Stand your ground!
If someone questions you,
distract them from the original lie
with more lies.
Here, let me demonstrate.
I own a pony.
Ask me a question.
- What color is your pony?
- Well, when I first got Dandelion,
she was a deep, chestnut brown,
but, sadly, her stable
is located near a chemical plant,
which contaminated
the drinking water.
So over time, she's turned a sickly,
grayish-white color
and there's nothing
that the vet can do to fix her.
My God!
That's horrible.
Is Dandelion going to be okay?
All right. You are good!
Dandelion's not even sick, is she?
So the building's really dead
and you guys lied to me.
We just did it to protect you, Ted.
I can't believe this.
I just got screwed by my 2 best friends
and I didn't even know it.
In Canada,
that's called a "Sneaky Snowplow".
That building was my dream job,
and now, it's just gone.
We're so sorry.
Yeah, I need a drink.
Poor Ted.
Would I seem heartless if I switched us
back to Canadian Sex Acts?
- Not at all.
- I'm surprised you waited this long.
What the hell is a
"Two-Hand Zamboni"?
Let's just say, the only thing
the woman is wearing
is skates on her hands.
A "Manitoba Milk Bag"?
Okay, it's like a "Chicago Mustache",
but the person on the bottom
is wearing a snowsuit.
A "Newfoundland Lobster Trap"?
Don't know. Don't want to know.
Those Newfies are out of control.
Okay, I'm gonna make my first guess.
Okay, but I'll only tell you
if you correctly guess the person,
the act and the collection.
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Bryan Adams.
He collects baseball cards,
and he wanted to do
a "Greasy Kayak".
Wayne Gretzky, vintage Hot Wheels,
a "Squatting Eskimo".
Kiefer Sutherland,
souvenir shot glasses,
and a "Sticky Flapjack".
That I would have done.
Wait.
Wait, if they pulled the plug
on the project a month ago,
why have I been going in once a week
to meet with
the New Headquarters Task Force?
Well, obviously you couldn't come in
and pitch to Bilson.
So, we... invented the task force.
Then it was just a question of putting
together the team.
<i>You know Roy Waterman,
Vice President of Capital and Risk,</i>
<i>he's actually...</i>
<i>Roy the janitor.</i>
Excuse me, Roy.
How'd you like to make
a few extra bucks?
How naked do I have to get?
<i>Louisa Mendoza,
Executive Vice President of Assets,</i>
<i>she's actually...</i>
<i>Louisa the lunch lady.</i>
Louisa, I need your help
with something,
but you can't tell anybody.
Exactly.
This is a big secret.
How do you say "secret" in Spanish?
Ah, yes. <i>Albondigas</i>.
This will be our little <i>albondigas</i>.
Can I have
a couple meatballs, please?
<i>And Arthur Nasmith, the eccentric genius
guru of corporate investments,</i>
<i>he's actually...</i>
<i>Crazy Arty,
15th Street's own one-man band.</i>
Excuse me.
Do you have a minute to talk?
Actually, my assistant, Reginald,
makes all my appointments.
<i>We rounded up the group
with a few interns</i>
<i>and payed everyone 50 bucks to act super
interested in what you were saying.</i>
Reginald,
get me out of this for next week.
That was some
of the most inspired design work.
I've done in my entire career.
I was so excited.
Alex Trebek, a "Musty Goaltender",
- Beanie Babies!
- Nope.
- Damn it!
- Wait.
So that explains the thing
that happened with Louisa.
- Good job, buddy.
- Nice!
Listen, Louisa.
What are we going to do about this?
Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.
I know you feel it, too.
What the hell.
No, this is wrong!
For God's sake,
you're on the task force!
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?
You know how you played third base
for the GNB softball team.
There is no GNB softball team.
We just rented out a field,
rounded up a bunch of guys
and told them to make you the hero.
So my game-winning walk was a lie?
We're sorry, but we knew
that you'd be out of work soon,
we just wanted to make you feel good.
That's what friends do.
Lie to each other?
Sometimes, yeah,
to protect each other's feelings.
No way! You never lie to your friends.
I would never not be honest with you.
Really? What about that open mic night
at the comedy club?
<i>Are you like me, folks?</i>
<i>Have you ever thought about how many
different kinds of fish there are?</i>
<i>And the names of those fish?</i>
<i>Let's take a little ride.</i>
<i>"Trout."</i>
<i>Am I right?</i>
<i>"Sturgeon." I don't think so, pal.</i>
<i>"Salmon."</i>
<i>I'm going to say that again...</i>
<i>Salmon.</i>
<i>Who thought that was
a good idea, right?</i>
"Bass." This guy over here knows
what I'm talking about.
<i>"Halibut."</i>
<i>Thank you, good night.</i>
- How was it?
- You were great. Really funny.
You killed...
everyone's Thursday night.
Time out.
You didn't like the fish list?
It was horrible!
You just read a list of fish.
Anyway...
you guys just proved my point, okay?
You lied to me to protect my feelings.
This is completely different!
I just wasted a month of my life
working on a dead project.
That's time I could've spent
trying to bring my firm new business.
Instead, I'm going to go
in there tomorrow morning.
I'm probably going to get fired.
Best case scenario,
my boss is going to ream me out
in front of everybody.
- Back home, we call that a Sas...
- "Saskatoon Totem Pole." It's on here.
Good morning, lying bastards.
Anything you want to lie about
before I head off to work to get fired?
- Nice shirt.
- You're the devil.
Ted, what if we told you
that we found you a new project at GNB
where you would be
redesigning part of the 20th floor.
If that's a lie,
it's an incredibly dull one.
- What exactly would I be doing?
- This is the 18th Floor E.T.R.
Basically,
Bilson wants a room just like this,
only two stories up, on our floor.
- Wait, what's an E.T.R.?
- It's the Employee Transition Room.
- What does that mean?
- Well, it's a space
where a supervisor and employee
engage in a knowledge transfer
about an impending
vocational paradigm shift.
People get fired in here.
That's horrible!
Why do you need a room
specifically for firing people?
GNB feels that people need a safe,
secure space to deal with the news.
It gets pretty real in here.
<i>So I reluctantly agreed
to design a room</i>
<i>where people would be fired.
But I was determined to make it my own.</i>
Now, when you leave
the dismissal space,
you'll exit into what I'm calling
"the Rebirth Tranquility Hallway".
Here, you'll find
a soothing oval chamber
with a trained grief counselor.
It's right here,
past the New Beginnings Fountain.
And there you have it.
Instead of a drab, dark prison cell,
a nurturing womb...
birthing you into a new life.
- I love it.
- Really?
- Nice work, Ted.
- Thank you.
Can you add some of these touches to
the existing 18th Floor E.T.R. as well?
- Absolutely.
- Great.
Let's take a look.
- Okay, so I'm thinking this wall...
- You're fired!
- What?
- I wanted this room!
This exact room two floors up!
- But...
- You're fired!
Now, get the hell out of here.
Hey, honey.
Anyone from the band Rush,
a "Montreal Meatpie",
and superhero lunch boxes.
Rick Moranis,
"The Reverse Rick Moranis",
antique Judaica.
I give up.
I've been guessing for three days.
I'm done.
If that means I never get to know,
so be it.
- Fine.
- Tell us!
- You really want to know?
- Yes!
But this information
does not leave this table.
Oh, my, God.
I am so excited.
- I'm gonna read it.
- Read it.
- Read it.
- I'm gonna read it. Here we go.
"The Frozen Snowshoe,
"Old King Clancy, Harvey's trays."
Right.
I don't know
what any of those words mean.
Is one of those supposed
to be a celebrity?
Who the hell...
is Old King Clancy?
No, that's not the person,
that's the sex act.
It's the same
as a Sacramento Turtleneck,
except with maple syrup.
So the celebrity was Harvey Straze?
No, that's what he collected.
Harvey's trays.
Those classic orange trays you get
whenever you eat at Harvey's.
The restaurant?
Come on, you're road tripping down
the Trans-Canada Highway,
you get a hunger on
between Milverton and Wawa,
where you gonna strap
on a feed bag, huh?
Harvey's. Over 12,000 served!
So the celebrity was...
The Frozen Snowshoe.
Oh, my God! You guys have never
heard of The Frozen Snowshoe?
He's only the most famous
professional wrestler in Canada.
I met him after he defeated
Reckless Rick Rogers
in the Kamloops Memorial
Arena back in '02.
Classic match.
So you're saying The Frozen Snowshoe
invited you back to his place
to look at Harvey's trays,
and asked you to do
an Old King Clancy?
Exactly.
And I'm serious,
you cannot tell anyone.
My hiccups are gone.
Possibly forever.
Canada! You did it again.
You even found a way to ruin this.
Why? Why do we let you be a country?
Hey, Mister Whisper.
Shouldn't you be upstairs
designing your big fancy E.T.R.?
- I'm off the project.
- What?
- Bilson fired me.
- You're kidding me.
So what does this mean
for you at your firm?
- Are you gonna get laid off?
- Actually,
I just quit.
Why?
Because I can't work for big,
heartless corporate clients anymore.
When I was pitching
to your "task force",
I was doing the most inspired work
of my career. In a way,
you idiots reminded me
how much fun my job can be
when I'm not answering
to the Bilsons of the world, so...
I quit.
- They fired you, didn't they?
- Yes, sir.
But I got a sweet severance package
and I've made a big decision.
I'm gonna start my own firm.
- That's exciting.
- In this economy?
So you're not mad?
As it turns out, I'm grateful.
How'd it all go down
between you and Bilson?
After he proposed
a vocational paradigm shift,
I made an impromptu presentation
using a four-pronged approach
- that really brought him to his knees.
- Hit him with a chair?
- Yep
- That's my boy.
And this one, I got on the drive
from Milverton to Wawa.
That's pretty impressive,
The Frozen Snowshoe.
Please, we're friends.
Just call me "Shoe".
Have a seat.
So, Shoe...
How would you like to give me...
an "Old King Clancy"?
I think you should go.
Vous croirez pas ce qu'il s'est passť
au laser tag hier soir.
Les gens ont flippť
ŗ cause d'un tarť en costume
qui embÍtait leurs enfants ?
Ouais, ŗ peu prŤs.
Allez !
Tu veux Áa !
Mon ťpaule !
Allez.
Stinson, dans mon bureau !
Maintenant !
Merde.
Jeu dťloyal,
trois bousculades,
et maintenant, Áa !
Stinson, vous Ítes un boulet !
Je sais, je ne suis pas
vos prťcieuses rŤgles, McCracken,
mais, bordel,
les rťsultats sont lŗ !
…coutez, vous Ítes
un bon joueur de laser tag.
Peut-Ítre le meilleur que j'aie vu.
Mais un de ces jours,
vous allez blesser quelqu'un.
Peut-Ítre mÍme vous.
Vous oubliez comment c'est lŗ-bas.
Votre gros cul est coincť ici
depuis trop longtemps.
«a suffit !
Vous Ítes banni, Stinson !
Rendez votre arme et votre badge !
Avec plaisir.
Faites pas Áa.
Ce jeu, c'est tout ce que j'ai.
Et j'ai presque assez de tickets
pour l'hťlicoptŤre tťlťcommandť.
Pitiť.
J'arrive pas ŗ croire
que je fasse Áa.
Mais je vais vous laisser
une derniŤre chance.
Mais sachez bien,
si vous dťpassez les limites
d'un orteil,
vous jouerez au tir au canard
chez votre mŤre
si vite que Áa vous fera
tourner la tÍte.
Sortez d'ici !
Vous le regretterez pas.
<i>30 secondes plus tard</i>
C'est fini, Stinson.
Vous Ítes banni ŗ vie !

Je peux pas croire que tu sois virť
du laser tag. Tu vas faire quoi ?
Ce que je vais faire ?
Je vais te dire
ce que Ted et moi allons faire.
On va s'introduire
et mettre du PQ partout.
Barney, on est trop vieux
pour mettre du papier toilette
parce que tu peux plus
jouer au laser tag.
Et au passage,
trop vieux pour le laser tag.
Ted, le laser tag
n'a aucune limite d'‚ge.
Comme le strip-tease
dans le Middle West.
Ouais, peu importe.
J'ajoute le laser tag
ŗ la liste de Murtaugh.
- Pas la liste de Murtaugh.
- C'est quoi, la liste de Murtaugh ?
<i>La liste de Murtaugh a ťtť crťťe
vers mes 30 ans.</i>
<i>Tout a commencť
avec l'entonnoir ŗ biŤre de votre oncle.</i>
... deux, un, chug !
<i>ņ nos 20 ans,</i>
<i>ŗ chaque fÍte,
cet entonnoir sortait.</i>
<i>Et vers nos 30 ans, pareil.</i>
<i>Bien sŻr, ŗ 20 ans,
le lendemain ressemblait ŗ Áa.</i>
<i>Mais vers nos 30 ans,
le lendemain ressemblait ŗ Áa.</i>
<i>Puis un jour, dans les souffrances
de la pire gueule de bois de ma vie,</i>
<i>j'ai rťalisť qu'une seule
personne au monde me comprenait :</i>
<i>Le dťtective Roger Murtaugh,
jouť par Danny Glover</i>
<i>dans le chef d'oeuvre de 1987 :</i>
L'Arme Fatale<i>,</i>
<i>connu pour sa devise
souvent reprise :</i>
- Je suis trop vieux pour ces...
- <i>Trucs.</i>
<i>Il a dit,
"Je suis trop vieux pour ces trucs."</i>
C'est dur ŗ admettre, mais avec l'‚ge,
on peut plus faire certaines choses.
C'est pourquoi j'ai cette liste,
pour pas faire l'erreur de penser
que je peux encore
faire une nuit blanche.
Je suis trop vieux
pour ces trucs.
Ou manger une pizza entiŤre
en une fois.
Je suis trop vieux
pour ces trucs.
Ou mettre des posters
sans cadre sur le mur.
"Riggs."
Je suis trop vieux
pour ces trucs.
- Au fait, c'est bien <i>Lethal Weapon</i> ?
- Je sais pas. «a a l'air pompť.
Un vieux associť
ŗ un flic jeune et rebelle.
«a vous rappelle rien ?
<i>Mackleroy et LaFleur.</i>
Me dites pas que vous avez jamais vu
<i>Mackleroy et LaFleur.</i>
C'est le meilleur film d'action
canadien de tous les temps.
Mackleroy est un jeune
de la police montťe
dont le cheval est assassinť
par des mťchants Amťricains,
et LaFleur, son vieux partenaire
grincheux et Afro-Canadien,
vient d'acheter une jolie cabane
de pÍche dans le Nord de l'Alberta...
- Je dois y aller.
- Salut, bťbť. Bon entraÓnement.
Quoi ?
Il fait encore l'homme-orchestre ?
Parce que c'ťtait naze.
<i>En fait,</i>
<i>Marshall ťtait coach</i>
<i>pour l'ťquipe de basket
de la classe de Lily.</i>
<i>Il trouvait Áa marrant, mais Lily
y voyait plus : l'entraÓnement de pŤre.</i>
Mon Dieu !
Des quartiers d'orange.
C'est gentil.
- Tu fais quoi, lŗ ?
- Je pouvais pas rťsister.
Je voulais voir
coach Marshmallow ŗ l'oeuvre.
Les enfants,
qui veut s'arrÍter plus tŰt
et manger des quartiers d'orange ?
- Ouais !
- Ouais ? Hors de question !
Les oranges, c'est pour les vainqueurs,
et vous, petites merdes,
vous n'avez pas encore
mis un seul panier !
Vous devriez avoir honte,
vous faites honte ŗ Miss Aldrin,
et pire encore,
vous me faites honte !
Assez !
On sprint, sur la ligne !
Et que Áa saute !
On y va.
Y a rien sur cette liste
pour lequel tu es trop vieux.
En fait, si tu faisais tout
sur la liste de Murtaugh,
j'appellerais Áa un week-end sympa.
Barney, t'as plus 18 ans.
Si tu faisais toute la liste,
tu crŤverais.
- C'ťtait pas un dťfi.
- Dťfi acceptť.
Les prochaines 24 heures, je vais faire
tout ce qu'il y a sur la liste.
Et aprŤs Áa,
tu passes le laser tag
au PQ avec moi.
- Et si tu ťchoues ?
- Je passerai 3 heures
ŗ t'ťcouter parler d'architecture.
«a marche pour moi.
Robin, tu fais les honneurs ?
Un accord d'honneur !
Allez les gars, on s'y met !
T'es sŻr de vouloir faire Áa ?
Tu sais comment il est.
Y a des choses assez balŤzes
sur la liste.
Enfin, tu crois vraiment que Barney
va se faire percer l'oreille ?
"Se percer l'oreille." Fait.
Bon, je pars faire une lessive
chez ma mŤre.
«a vous dťrange
si j'utilise votre futon ?
- On n'a pas de futon.
- Posez-le lŗ, les gars.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- C'est sur la liste.
"Atterrir sur le futon d'un pote
plutŰt que d'aller ŗ l'hŰtel."
Je suis trop vieille pour ces trucs.
T'as quoi ŗ l'oreille ?
On dirait l'intťrieur d'une citrouille
aprŤs Halloween.
Quoi, Áa ?
Juste une petite infect'.
Rien qu'un gamin comme moi
n'a ŗ se soucier.
Puis, "repousser une visite mťdicale",
sur la liste.
Attends.
Ici Bar...
On s'arrÍte pas !
Tu sais, c'est drŰle,
j'ťtais venu pour leur apprendre...
N'arrÍtez pas de courir !
Tout ce temps,
c'est eux qui m'ont appris des choses.
Tu cours pas, lŗ ! Tu tombes !
<i>Le lendemain matin, Barney se rťveillait
sur le futon du salon.</i>
Fait.
"Boire des coups avec des inconnus."
Fait.
«a va, Barney ?
T'as l'air d'avoir mal au dos.
Non, c'est juste la bosse du fÍtard.
J'aime Áa.
«a me rapproche de mon verre.
ņ la jeunesse !
T'aurais une paille ?
Y a un cŰtť admirable dans sa faÁon
de vouloir rester jeune.
- Qui voudrait Ítre vieux ?
- Ce type-lŗ.
La vie est un repas
et la vieillesse, le dessert.
Je me fais tellement de soucis
ŗ propos de l'avenir.
Oý va ma carriŤre ?
Qui vais-je ťpouser ?
Quand t'es vieux, tu t'en fais pas,
parce que tout Áa,
c'est dťjŗ arrivť.
T'as des pompes confortables
et un siŤge pour les escaliers.
C'est parfait.
C'est pas parfait, c'est pathťtique.
Tu peux pas sauter jusqu'ŗ la fin.
Le mieux, c'est le voyage.
Je pensais Áa, moi aussi,
tu comprendras
quand tu seras plus vieille.
Marshall, tu peux ťviter
de les attaquer aujourd'hui ?
Je les attaque pas, Lily.
J'attaque cette culture de l'ťchec
omniprťsente.
Je dois les endurcir
si on veut gagner le match, demain.
Gagner ?
On compte pas les points.
- Quoi ?
- On compte pas les points.
Vous comptez pas...
Quel intťrÍt de ne pas le faire ?
Comment vous savez...
Lily, qu'est-ce que tu faisais
avec l'ťquipe avant que j'arrive ?
Je les entraÓnais.
C'est Áa, mes petits anges.
Vous Ítes
des Ítres de lumiŤre lumineux.
- C'est quoi, le score ?
- …galitť : joie ŗ joie !
Car c'est Áa l'intťrÍt de jouer,
de s'amuser.
L'intťrÍt de jouer,
c'est de gagner le trophťe.
Et si tu sais pas qui gagne,
qui remporte le trophťe ?
Tout le monde.
C'est un trophťe de participation,
tout le monde en a un.
Tout Áa, c'est du chinois pour moi.
- Salut, c'est Barney.
- Et Robin.
- On peut pas rťpondre, car...
- Il regarde le foot et je suis...
Partie faire du shopping.
Laissez un message, on vous rappelle
- DŤs
- Qu'on
Peut !
"Faire un message de rťpondeur
ťnervant ŗ deux."
Fait.
«a va sŻrement me coŻter
quelques rendez-vous, mais Áa va.
Ton oreille commence ŗ sentir.
C'est bon.
J'ai horreur de refuser,
mais vous m'aviez dit que la dinde
ťtait extrÍmement maigre,
et voyez vous-mÍme.
D'accord. C'est bon.
- T'as ta propre liste.
- Quoi ?
Une liste de choses
pour lesquelles tu es trop jeune.
Fais toutes ces choses et dis-moi
si tu veux encore Ítre vieux.
EnlŤve "coloscopie"
et "coucher avec une vieille",
et c'est du g‚teau.
Nouveau pari, alors.
Si tu peux finir ta liste avant moi,
on va au laser tag le couvrir de PQ
et tu payes le papier toilette.
Et pas cette merde biodťgradable.
J'en veux lŗ-haut pour toujours.
Bien, si je la finis en premier,
c'est six heures d'ťtude
de l'architecture amťricaine
du dťbut du 20e,
et tu ne pourras plus jamais faire
un truc de la liste de Murtaugh.
- C'est pour ton bien.
- Pari tenu.
Un accord d'honneur !
Marshall, ils sont ŗ la maternelle.
On enseigne pas le basket comme Áa.
Bien sŻr. J'ai appris comme Áa.
Tu plaisantes ?
Quel genre de sociopathe
t'a appris comme Áa ?
Allez, papa. Je suis fatiguť.
Dormir, c'est pour les gagnants.
T'iras au lit quand t'auras marquť.
J'essaie.
Je te donne deux points
pour avoir essayť.
Mais j'enlŤve deux points
ŗ cause de ta grosse tÍte.
Avec mon pŤre, pas de clťmence
et je n'en demandais pas.
Je dois vraiment appeler ce mec.
Continuez les ťtirements !
"Mettre des lunettes pour lire."
Fait.
"Engueuler les gamins du quartier."
Avec plaisir.
- Que t'est-il arrivť ?
- J'ai juste eu un petit
"Bousiller mon genou
et Áa fait mal" incident.
- Comment t'as fait ?
- On...
"A aidť ŗ dťmťnager du 6e ťtage
sans ascenseur contre pizza et biŤre".
Ou on a aidť ŗ voler
du 6e ťtage sans ascenseur.
Ils ťtaient pressťs
et ont laissť toutes les photos.
«a compte quand mÍme.
Maintenant, je vais aller
"Me teindre en couleurs flashy",
et aprŤs on ira ŗ
"Aller ŗ une rave".
16 h !
L'heure du souper.
Ton pŤre ťtait dur avec toi.
C'est moche,
mais t'as pas ŗ Ítre comme lui.
Tu peux apprendre de ses erreurs.
Erreurs ?
Lily, rťsultat.
Le mec a rťussi.
Il m'a appris ŗ Ítre un gagnant.
C'est ce que j'apprends ŗ ces gosses.
Et d'ailleurs,
c'est ce que je ferai
avec nos enfants.
OK, Áa suffit.
C'est pas comme Áa
qu'on va ťlever nos enfants !
Et c'est pas comme Áa
que tu vas entraÓner cette ťquipe !
Au match de demain,
si tu es autre chose
qu'un ours en peluche
avec de la barbe ŗ papa
et des arcs en ciel,
je te foudroierai du regard
si fort que tu t'ťcraseras !
La fois oý j'ai trouvť
ton historique Internet,
c'ťtait de la bagatelle ŗ cŰtť !
C'est clair ?
- Il y a diffťrentes...
- C'est clair ?
Oui, m'dame.
Ce qui est ironique, c'est que...
Appelle Ted.
Je veux rentrer.
D'accord.
Je l'appelle.
Mais il est 4 h 30 du matin.
Il ne sera pas rťveillť.
Levť ŗ 4 h...
Fait.
- Il rťpond ?
- J'ai pas encore appelť.
DťpÍche-toi, Robin.
Parfait.
"Prends du temps pour rťpondre
au tťlťphone".
Allez, Ted.
On m'a donnť de l'aspirine
et je pense pas que c'en ťtait.
Fait.
Je sais que j'ai ťtť
un peu dur avec vous,
ces deux derniers jours.
Et je m'en excuse.
Aujourd'hui, on va pas penser
ŗ la victoire.
On va aller lŗ-bas et...
s'amuser.
<i>Les enfants, au fil des ans
votre oncle Marshall a rab‚chť</i>
<i>l'histoire de ce match
des centaines de fois. Et en fait,</i>
<i>les enfants de l'autre ťquipe
ťtaient plus ‚gťs d'une classe.</i>
<i>Mais en rab‚chant l'histoire,</i>
<i>ils ressemblaient ŗ Áa.</i>
Laissez-les marquer facilement.
Maintenant, vous Ítes assis.
Gťnial.
Addison, c'est pas du foot.
Ne shoote pas !
Sauf si tu trouves Áa drŰle,
dans ce cas, amuse-toi bien.
- C'ťtait pas une faute, arbitre ?
- Je m'appelle pas Arbitre, mais Kenny.
- Et surveiller votre ton.
- Pas de ton, Kenny.
Bon boulot.
Merci beaucoup.
ņ plus tard.
En tant que manager,
je jette l'ťponge.
Ce pari est fini.
Ton oreille ressemble
ŗ une p‚tisserie danoise
dans un petit dťjeuner franÁais.
Non, il en reste un.
"L'entonnoir ŗ biŤre."
Il arrive.
J'ai trouvť ces biŤres russes
bizarres, au sous-sol.
Des biŤres russes ?
Je prendrai une biŤrofski.
BiŤrofski. Pigť ?
Oui, c'est...
un peu chaud.
J'espŤre que c'est pas gÍnant.
Non, non.
D'accord. T'as gagnť, je dťteste Áa.
Je dťteste tout Áa.
Mon dos me tue.
ņ la rave, on m'a pris pour un flic.
J'ai tellement mal ŗ l'oreille
que je peux l'entendre...
J'entends ma propre oreille.
Pensez-y.
Mes fringues... Qu'est-ce...
Enlevez-moi Áa !
Je te rachŤte ton meilleur costume
pour le double de son prix.
Voilŗ...
30 dollars.
Et jette les chaussures.
T'as gagnť, Ted.
Je ne ferai plus jamais rien
de la liste de Murtaugh.
Je suis trop vieux pour ces trucs.
Tu sais, hier,
je me suis couchť ŗ 20 h
parce que c'ťtait sur la liste
et j'arrivais pas ŗ dormir...
parce qu'il ťtait 20 h.
Alors, j'ai regardť <i>L'Arme Fatale</i>.
<i>J'arrivais toujours pas ŗ dormir,
alors j'ai regardť</i> L'Arme Fatale 2<i>.</i>
<i>Et puis le 3.</i>
<i>Et au milieu de</i> L'Arme Fatale 4,
<i>je me suis aperÁu...</i>
que Murtaugh rťpťtait :
"Je suis trop vieux pour ces trucs",
mais ŗ chaque fois qu'il le dit,
il change d'avis, fait un autre film,
et plein de trucs.
Ce que j'essaye de dire,
c'est que...
aux chiottes, l'‚ge.
Allons recouvrir le laser tag de PQ.
Et aprŤs, l'hŰpital.
Bon boulot, les gars.
Au moins, on compte pas les points,
hein ? Aucune idťe du score.
«a pourrait Ítre 53 ŗ 0.
«a pourrait Ítre autre chose.
C'est 53 ŗ 0.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait de mal, coach ?
Vous ne faites rien de mal.
C'est gťnial que vous perdiez,
parce que dans la vie,
peu importe l'effort que vous faites,
ou ŗ quel point vous essayez,
les gens vous donneront des choses.
Comme des diplŰmes, des boulots,
des promotions.
Peu importe ce que vous faites
sur le terrain,
tant que...
tant que vous vous amusez.
<i>Parce qu'ils ne voulaient pas
se disputer devant les enfants,</i>
<i>votre oncle Marshall et votre tante Lily
ont eu une conversation tťlťpathique.</i>
<i>- Ne me regarde pas comme Áa.
- J'en peux plus !</i>
<i>Ton coaching est dingue !</i>
<i>ArrÍte de me crier dessus !</i>
<i>Pardon.</i>
<i>Mais est-ce que je peux le faire
ŗ ma faÁon ?</i>
<i>OK, mais je vais le faire
ŗ ma faÁon aussi.</i>
<i>Avec la guitare.</i>
<i>…tait-ce
la dťtermination de Marshall,</i>
<i>l'encouragement de Lily,</i>
<i>ou la combinaison magique des deux,</i>
<i>mais dans la deuxiŤme mi-temps,</i>
<i>ce groupe dťsorganisť
de petits garnements...</i>
<i>ont rťussi ŗ faire pire.</i>
<i>En fait, d'aprŤs oncle Marshall,</i>
<i>en 2e mi-temps,
l'autre ťquipe avait mÍme grandi.</i>
<i>Et l'un d'eux s'ťtait changť
en loup-garou.</i>
Il y a un loup-garou
sur le terrain !
«a peut pas Ítre rťglo.
Ils ont l'air diffťrent,
les enfants,
mais assurez-vous
qu'il se sente entourť.
C'ťtait pas un marchť, Áa ?
Tu me tues !
Tu me tues carrťment !
Attention, coach,
ou je vous mets un avertissement.
Je te conjure de m'en mettre un.
<i>Quand le sifflet final retentit
charitablement,</i>
<i>le score ťtait, d'aprŤs l'estimation
de Marshall, 118 ŗ rien.</i>
<i>Et mÍme s'ils n'avaient rien gagnť,</i>
<i>tous, y compris le coach,
reÁurent un trophťe de participation.</i>
Je comprendrais
que tu le veuilles pas.
Je l'adore.
J'ai travaillť dur. C'est bien
d'Ítre apprťciť ŗ sa juste valeur.
Je sais, bťbť.
Ta faÁon est peut-Ítre pas
complŤtement stupide.
Merci.
La tienne l'est.
Mon grand...
tu me causes des problŤmes
depuis que tu as rejoint ce club.
Mais bon sang...
si c'est pas la meilleure bataille
de PQ que j'ai jamais vue.
Tu es rťintťgrť...
Et tout de suite.
Vraiment ?
Bon Dieu, non !
J'appelle la police !
Des grands cons avec les cheveux roses
qui balancent du PQ. Vous plaisantez.
- Je suis trop vieux pour ces...
- <i>Trucs.</i>
<i>Il a dit "trucs".</i>
You will not believe what happened
at laser tag last night.
People freaked out because
a creepy man in a suit
wouldn't leave their kids alone?
Well, yeah, pretty much.
Come on!
You want it?!
My shoulder!
Come on.
Stinson, my office! Now!
Crap.
Disorderly game play,
three counts of shoving,
and now this!
Stinson, you're a liability!
I know, I don't play
by your precious rules, McCracken,
but, damn it, I get results!
Look, you're a good
laser tag player.
Maybe the best I've ever seen.
But one of these days,
you're gonna get someone hurt.
Maybe even yourself.
You just forgot
what it's like out there.
You've had your fat ass stuck
behind that desk for too long.
That's it!
You're out of here, Stinson!
Hand in your gun and your ID badge!
With pleasure.
Please don't do this.
This game is all I got.
And I've almost got enough tickets
for the remote control helicopter.
Please.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
But I'm gonna give
you one last shot.
But so help me,
if you so much as step one toe
out of line,
you'll play Duck Hunt
in your mama's basement so fast,
it's gonna make your head spin.
Now, get out of here!
You won't regret this.

That's it, Stinson.
You're banned for life!
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
I can't believe you got kicked out
of laser tag. What are you gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
I'll tell you
what Ted and I are gonna do.
We're gonna break in after hours
and TP the place.
Barney, we are too old
to cover a place in toilet paper
because they won't
let you play laser tag.
And for that matter,
too old for laser tag.
Ted, laser tag knows
no age restrictions.
Kind of like stripping
in the Midwest.
Yeah, whatever.
I'm adding laser tag
to the Murtaugh List.
- Jeez, not the Murtaugh List.
- What's the Murtaugh List?
<i>The Murtaugh List is something
that came into being</i>
<i>around the time I turned 30.</i>
<i>It all started with
yourUncle Marshall's beer bong.</i>
... two, one, chug!
<i>When we were in our early 20s,</i>
<i>every time we had a party,
that beer bong came out.</i>
<i>And around the time
we turned 30, same thing.</i>
<i>Of course, in our early 20s,
the next day would go like this.</i>
<i>But by the time we were 30,
the next day would go like this.</i>
<i>Then one day, in the throes of the worst
hangover of my life,</i>
<i>I realized there was only one person
in the world that I could relate to:</i>
<i>Detective Roger Murtaugh,
played by Danny Glover</i>
<i>in the'80s noir masterpiece</i>
Lethal Weapon<i>,</i>
<i>known for his
oft-quoted catchphrase:</i>
- I'm too old for this...
- Stuff.
<i>He said,
I'm too old for this stuff.</i>
It's sad to admit, but as you get older,
there's things you can't do anymore.
That's why I have this list, so
I never make the mistake of thinking
that I can still
pull an all-nighter.
I'm too old for that stuff.
Or eat an entire pizza
in one sitting.
I'm too old for that stuff.
Or hang posters
on your wall without frames.
"Riggs."
I'm too old for that stuff.</i>
- By the way, how good is <i>Lethal Weapon?</i>
- I don't know. It's kind of a rip-off.
Old guy paired up
with a young renegade cop.
Sound familiar?
<i>Mackleroy and LaFleur.</i>
Don't tell me you guys have never seen
<i>Mackleroy and LaFleur.</i>
It's the greatest Canadian
action movie of all time.
Mackleroy is a young,
renegade Mountie
whose horse was just killed
by evil Americans,
while LaFleur, his grouchy,
old, African-Canadian partner,
just bought a cozy ice fishing
shack in northern Alberta...
- I got to go.
- Bye, baby. Have fun at practice.
Practice?
Is he doing that one-man
band thing again?
'Cause that was a bummer.
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>He had just taken over</i>
<i>as coach for Lily's
kindergarten basketball team.</i>
<i>He thought it'd be fun, but Lily saw it
as something more: dad practice.</i>
Hi.
Hey! Oh, my gosh!
Orange slices.
That is so sweet.
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't resist.
I wanted to see
Coach Marshmallow do his thing.
Hey, kids,
who wants to knock off early
and have some of these here
orange slices?
- Yeah!
- Yeah? Well, you can't!
Because oranges are for winners,
and you little turds
haven't even made a single shot yet!
You're embarrassing yourselves,
you're embarrassing Ms. Aldrin,
and worst of all,
you're embarrassing me!
That's it!
Suicides! Baseline! Now!
Run.
Ted, there is not
a single thing on here
that you are too old to do.
In fact, if you did
everything on the Murtaugh List,
I'd call that a pretty fun weekend.
Barney, you are not 18 anymore.
If you did everything
on that list, you would die.
- That wasn't a challenge.
- Challenge accepted.
In the next 24 hours,
I'm going to do
every single thing on this list.
And after I do,
you will TP
the laser tag place with me.
- And if you can't do it?
- I will spend three hours
listening to you
talk about architecture.
You have got yourself a deal.
Robin, will you do the honors?
A gentleman's agreement!
All right, chumps, let's do this.
You really want to make this bet
with him? You know how he is.
There is some pretty
tough stuff on that list.
I mean, do you really think
Barney's gonna get his ear pierced?
"Get ear pierced."
Check.
All right, I'm off to go
do laundry at Mom's house.
You mind if I crash
on your futon tonight?
- We don't have a futon.
- Put it over there, boys.
- What's going on?
- It's on the Murtaugh List.
"Crash on a friend's futon
instead of getting a hotel room."
I am too old for that stuff.
What's going on with your ear?
Looks like the inside
of a jack-o'-lantern on November 3rd.
What, this?
Ah, just a little infecsh.
Nothing a young guy like me
can't shake off.
Plus, "Put off going
to the doctor," on the list.
Hold on.
Go for Bar...
Keep running!
You know what's funny is, I was supposed
to come here to teach them...
Do not stop running!
This whole time, they've been
the ones who are teaching me.
That's not running!
That's falling!
<i>The next morning, Barney woke up
on the futon in our living room.</i>
Check.
"Drinking shots with strangers."
Check.
You OK, Barney?
It looks like you hurt your back.
Oh, no.
Just rocking a party hunch.
I like it.
Closer to my booze.
To youth.
Can I get a straw?
I must say,
there's something admirable
about the way he wants
to stay young at heart.
- I mean, who wants to get old?
- This guy.
Life is a meal
and old age is the dessert.
I spend so much of my time
worrying about the future.
Where's my career going?
Who am I gonna marry?
But when you're old,
you don't worry,
'cause all that stuff's
already happened.
You get to wear comfy shoes
and a chair takes you up
and down the stairs, it's perfect.
That's not perfect.
That's pathetic.
You can't just jump to the end.
The journey is the best part.
I used to feel that way, too,
but you'll understand
when you're a little bit older.
Marshall, can you try
not to pick on the kids today.
I'm not picking on the kids, Lily.
I'm picking on the culture
of losing around here.
I got to get them in shape
if they're gonna win
that game tomorrow.
Win?
We don't keep score.
- What?
- We don't keep score.
You don't keep s...
What's the point of playing
if you don't keep score?
How do you know...
Lily, what were you doing
with this team before I got here?
I was coaching them.
That's it, my little angels.
You're all luminous
wonderful beings of light.
- What's the score?
- It's all tied up at fun to fun!
Because that's the point of playing,
to have fun.
The point of playing
is to win the trophy.
And if you don't know who's
winning, who gets the trophy?
Everyone.
It's a participation trophy,
everyone gets one.
It's like you're speaking
Chinese to me right now.
- Hi, this is Barney.
- And Robin.
- We can't answer the phone because...
- He's watching sports and I'm...
Probably out shopping.
Leave a message,
we'll call you back just as soon...
- As...
- We...
Can!
"Leave an annoying two-person message
on your answering machine."
Check.
Probably gonna cost me
some dates, but it's okay.
Your ear's starting to smell.
It's good.
I hate to send it back,
but you did describe the turkey
as extremely lean,
and, well, you tell me.
All right. That's it.
- We have our own list.
- What?
This is a list of things
you're too young to do.
Go out and do each one of these things,
tell me you still want to be an old man.
Remove "colonoscopy"
and "Have sex with an old lady",
and this is a cakewalk.
New stakes, then.
If I can finish your list
before you finish mine,
you have to come with me
to TP laser tag
and you have to buy
the toilet paper.
And none of that biodegradable crap.
I want it up there forever.
Fine,
but if I finish your list first,
it's a six hour survey
of early 20th century
American architecture
and you can never do anything
on the Murtaugh List ever again.
- It's for your own good.
- You, sir, have got yourself a deal.
A gentleman's agreement!
Marshall, they're in kindergarten.
This isn't how you teach basketball.
Sure it is. It's the way I learned.
Are you kidding me?
What kind of sociopath
taught you this way?
Come on, Dad. I'm tired.
Sleep is for winners.
You can go to bed
when you score a basket.
I'm trying.
Let's give you
two points for trying.
But negative two points
for having a great big head.
My father gave me no quarter
and I asked for no quarter.
I totally got to call that guy.
Keep stretching!
"Put on reading glasses." Check.
"Yell at neighborhood kids."
My pleasure.
- What the hell happened to you?
- I just had a very minor
"blew out my knee
and it hurts like hell" incident.
- How did you blow out your knee?
- We...
"Helped someone move out of a 6th floor
walk-up in exchange for pizza and beer."
Or we helped someone
rob a sixth floor walk-up.
They were in a big hurry
and left all the pictures behind.
Whatevs, it counts.
Now, I am off to
"Dye my hair a funny color",
and then we are going to,
"Go to a rave".
4:00!
Supper time.
So, your dad was tough on you.
That stinks,
but you don't have to be like him.
You can learn from his mistakes.
Mistakes?
Lily, scoreboard.
The guy nailed it, okay?
He taught me how to be a winner.
That's what I'm teaching these kids.
And, for that matter,
that's what I'm gonna teach
our kids someday.
Okay, that's it.
This is not
how we're gonna raise our kids!
And this is not
how you're gonna coach this team!
At tomorrow's game,
if you are anything less
than a teddy bear stuffed
with cotton candy and rainbows,
I will silent treatment
your ass into the ground!
You'll think the time I found
your Internet search history
was a freakin' picnic!
Are we clear?
- There are many different philo...
- Are we clear?
Yes, ma'am.
What's ironic is that now...
Just call Ted.
I want to go home.
All right.
I'm calling him.
But it's 4:30 in the morning.
He's not going to be awake.
Up at 4:00...
Check.
- Is he answering?
- I haven't dialed yet.
Please hurry, Robin.
Perfect.
"Take forever to answer the phone."
Come on, Ted.
Someone gave me some aspirin
and I don't think it was aspirin.
Check.
So, I know that I have been
a little tough on you
for the past couple days.
And I apologize for that.
So today, we're not gonna
worry about winning.
We're gonna go out there and...
have fun.
<i>Kids, over the years,
your uncle Marshall has told and retold</i>
<i>the story of this game
hundreds of times. And in reality,</i>
<i>the kids on that other team
were probably only a grade older.</i>
<i>But, in telling
and retelling the story,</i>
<i>they came to look like this.</i>
Way to let them score that easily.
Now, you're sitting down.
Awesome.
Addison, it's not soccer.
You don't kick the ball!
Unless that's something
that you think is fun,
in which case, great job having fun.
- That was a foul, wasn't it, Ref?
- My name's not Ref. It's Kenny.
- And watch your tone.
- No tone, Kenny.
Great job, Kenny.
Thanks a lot, Kenny.
See you later, Kenny.
All right, Barney. As your manager,
I am throwing in the towel.
This bet is over.
Your ear looks like
a free Danish
at a continental breakfast.
No. One thing left.
"Beer bong."
Coming right up.
Oh, I...
found these weird Russian beers
in the basement.
Russian beers?
I'll take a brewski.
Brewski. Get it?
Yeah, it's...
It's a little warm.
Hope that's not a problem.
No, don't, don't.
All right, Ted.
You win. I hate this.
I hate all of it.
My back is killing me.
Everyone at the rave
thought I was a narc.
My ear hurts so bad I can hear it...
I can hear my own ear.
Think about that.
My clothes... What is it...
What is it... What am I...
Get this stuff off of me!
Ted, I'll pay you double
for your finest suit.
Here's...
30 bucks.
And throw in the shoes.
You win, Ted.
I'll never do anything
on the Murtaugh List again.
I'm too old for this stuff.
You know, Barney, last night,
I went to bed at 8:00
because it was on the list,
and I couldn't sleep because...
well, it was 8:00.
So I decided to watch <i>Lethal Weapon</i>.
<i>And then,
when I still couldn't sleep,</i>
<i>I watched </i>Lethal Weapon 2<i>.</i>
<i>And then I watched 3.</i>
<i>And then, halfway through</i>
Lethal Weapon 4<i>,</i>
<i>is when it occurred to me...</i>
Murtaugh kept saying,
"I'm too old for this stuff",
but every time he'd say it,
he'd turn around,
make another movie,
and do more stuff.
I guess what I'm saying is...
screw being old.
Let's go TP laser tag.
And then the hospital.
Great job, guys.
At least we're not keeping score, right?
No idea what the score is.
Could be 53 to zero.
Could be some other score.
It's 53 to zero.
What are we doing wrong, Coach?
You know what?
You're not doing anything wrong.
It's great that you guys are losing,
because in life, it doesn't matter
how much effort you put in,
or how hard you try,
people will just give you things.
Like diplomas and jobs
and promotions.
So, it doesn't matter
what you do out there,
as long as...
as long as you have fun.
<i>At that point, because they didn't want
to fight in front of the kids,</i>
<i>your uncle Marshall and aunt Lily had
one of their telepathic conversations.</i>
<i>- Don't you give me that look.
- Lily, I can't take it anymore!</i>
<i>Your way of coaching is crazy!</i>
<i>Stop yelling at me!</i>
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>But can I please do it my way?</i>
<i>Fine, but I'm going
to do it my way, too.</i>
<i>I'm getting my guitar.</i>
<i>I don't know if it was
Marshall's tough attitude,</i>
<i>Lily's gentle encouragement,</i>
<i>or some magical combination
of the two,</i>
<i>but in the second half of that game,</i>
<i>that ragtag group
of little firecrackers...</i>
<i>got beat down even worse.</i>
<i>In fact, according
to your uncle Marshall,</i>
<i>in the second half,
the other team got even taller.</i>
<i>And one of them
turned into a Teen Wolf.</i>
Kenny! There is a Teen Wolf
on the court!
That can't be legal.
I know the Teen Wolf
looks different, kids,
but try to make sure
he feels included.
How is that not traveling, Kenny?
You are killing me!
You are absolutely killing me!
Watch it, Coach,
or you'll get a technical.
I am begging you
to give me a technical.
<i>When the final horn mercifully blew,</i>
<i>the score was,
by Marshall's estimate, 118 to nothing.</i>
<i>And even though
they didn't win anything,</i>
<i>everyone, even the coach,
got a participation trophy.</i>
I understand if you don't want it.
I love it.
I worked so hard. It feels good
to be appreciated for my effort.
I know, baby.
Maybe your way
is not totally stupid.
Thanks.
Your way is totally stupid.
Son...
you have been a pain in my ass
ever since you joined this club.
But damn it...
if this ain't some
of the finest TP work I've ever seen.
You're reinstated...
effective immediately.
Really?
Hell, no!
I'm calling the police!
Grown-ass man with pink hair throwing
toilet paper. You're kidding me.
- I'm too old for this...
- <i>Stuff.</i>
<i>He said stuff.</i>
- J'ai entendu une blague au boulot.
- Allez.
Elle va pas l'aimer. C'est drôle
pour les mecs, pas pour les filles.
C'est sexiste !
Quand c'est drôle, c'est drôle.
Lily est cool. Elle va l'aimer.
- Fais-le tout seul.
- Raconte-la.
Pręte ?
Quelle est la différence
entre le Nutella et la confiture ?
- C'est drôle.
- Pour les mecs.
- Elle va pas l'aimer.
- Pourquoi je décide pas ?
Quelle est la différence
entre le Nutella et la confiture ?
<i>Puis Barney a donné la chute.</i>
<i>Ŕ ce jour, ça reste la blague
la plus dégueulasse</i>
<i>que j'ai jamais entendue de ma vie.
Et non, je ne la dirai pas.</i>
Ouais, je ne peux plus
traîner avec vous.
Allez.
Elle est drôle. C'est...
Je te l'avais dit.
Elle reviendra.
<i>Et on a plus vu Lily
pendant 4 semaines.</i>

<i>Les enfants, aprčs avoir été viré,</i>
<i>je réalisais enfin
le ręve de ma vie :</i>
<i>créer mon propre
bureau d'architecte.</i>
<i>Il me fallait juste des clients.</i>
Je trouve ça super
que tu voles de tes propres ailes.
- J'admire ça.
- Merci.
Et merci de me laisser
utiliser l'appartement.
Ouais, bien sűr.
Tout ce que tu veux.
Une petite chose, ça te dérange
de couper la TV pendant le travail ?
- C'est pas du travail !
- Désolé. C'est juste...
Je peux pas me concentrer
pendant <i>La Roue de la fortune</i>...
Un sou est un Sou, Helen !
Je sais que tu es nerveux,
mais il faut arręter de procrastiner.
T'as passé deux jours ŕ choisir
le stylo officiel de Mosbius Designs.
J'ai avancé !
J'ai éliminé le feutre.
De qui je me moque ?
Le feutre est de retour.
- Tu sais pour les licenciements ?
- Oui, je sais. Je balise.
- T'es inquiet ?
- Tu déconnes ?
Je sais une chose sur cette entreprise.
Je ne serai jamais viré.
Il est probable qu'un jour je m'échoue
sur une plage sans empreintes ni dents,
mais je serai pas viré.
J'aimerais avoir ton assurance.
Tu dois juste trouver un moyen
de te rendre absolument essentiel.
Je travaille plus
que tout ceux de ma division.
Garder ton boulot n'a rien ŕ voir
avec le fait d'ętre bosseur.
- Il te faut un truc.
- Comment ça, un truc ?
Tu sais, quelque chose
qui te rend marrant et aimé,
comme Marcus Denisco.
<i>Marcus Denisco travaillait
ŕ la comptabilité,</i>
<i>et c'était probablement
le pire employé de la boîte.</i>
J'ai apporté des donuts.
Ils sont sűrement stupides.
<i>Mais finalement, on l'appelait...</i>
Bouffe-man !
Qui veut du porc barbecue ?
Bien sűr que vous en voulez !
J'adore Bouffe-man.
Ils peuvent pas le virer.
Tu sais ce que j'aime chez Bouffe-man ?
- Il a toujours ŕ manger.
- Il a toujours ŕ manger.
Tu vois ? Il te faut ça.
Il te faut ce truc
qui fait de toi un mec.
J'ai ce truc qui fait de moi un mec.
Peut-ętre męme un mec et demi.
Pas ce truc.
Tu sais, un truc. Comme Jouet-man.
Mauvaise nouvelle.
En tant que RH,
je dois revoir la nouvelle politique
des heures supplémentaires avec vous.
La bonne nouvelle, c'est qu'on va
le faire avec des griffes de Wolverine !
Section 5A :
les heures sup' ne seront plus
payées double.
C'est génial !
Griffe tape !
- J'adore Jouet-man.
- Tu vois ? Il te faut un truc.
Comme Youtube-man.
T'as raison.
Il me faut un truc.
Mais choisis avec sagesse.
Tu veux pas devenir
l'horrible Massage-man.
Te remplis pas. Bouffe-man
a un panna cotta dans son bureau.
Salut, mec.
Salut, Douglas.
Tu es si tendu.
J'étais détendu,
il y a deux secondes.
T'es le suivant.
Bienvenue ŕ Mosbius Designs.
- Qui ętes-vous ?
- PJ, l'assistant de M. Mosby.
- Il se passe quoi ?
- Désolé. On n'interrompt pas
M. Mosby pendant
son heure de réflexion.
<i>C'est bon, PJ. C'est Robin.</i>
<i>Elle vit ici.</i>
<i>Désolé pour le dérangement,
monsieur.</i>
<i>Vous avez besoin d'autre chose ?</i>
- <i>Je ne refuserais pas un café.</i>
- T'es juste ŕ côté !
Donc maintenant, Ted se fait assister
pour ne rien faire.
PJ est d'une grande aide.
Installer le bureau,
créer le site Web.
Et en retour,
je guide un jeune esprit brillant.
Oui, le guide.
Je veux que tu sortes
aujourd'hui et...
mets tes mains sur les bâtiments.
D'accord ?
Sens
les vibrations du béton.
Écoute les histoires
que les pierres te racontent.
Et passe chez le teinturier.
Je le ferai.
- Merci beaucoup, M. Mosby.
- Trčs bien.
Cette table vient de me dire
que t'es un crétin.
Cette idée d'ętre un guide,
c'est pour procrastiner
- le fait d'appeler des clients.
- Je ne procrastine pas.
Je veux juste que tout soit parfait,
d'accord ?
J'ai qu'un seul essai.
D'accord, mais PJ n'aide pas.
Si Ted dit que PJ
est nécessaire ŕ la société,
alors PJ n'ira nulle part.
Tu vois ? Il est utile.
PJ est un mec ?
PJ, c'est pas une bonnasse
que tu baises ?
Non, je le guide.
Un guide.
J'ai guidé un jeune, une fois.
J'ai fait de lui mon copilote.
Puis, un jour,
il a embauché un assistant
pour bosser
ŕ 3 mčtres de sa chambre, qui...
écoute ça...
n'est pas une bonnasse,
prouvant qu'il ne m'a jamais écouté.
Tu sais comment s'appelle ce type ?
Peut-ętre. Je m'en souviens plus.
Car pour moi, il est mort !
PJ va recevoir de la poste
une carte perturbante
avec une tenue,
qu'il ne doit en aucun cas
porter trois jours
puis me la renvoyer.
J'ai pensé ŕ un truc
pour devenir indispensable.
L'Écolo-man !
Tout le monde aime recycler, hein ?
Viré. T'as quoi d'autre ?
J'en ai d'autres : Cravates-Fun-man.
- Viré.
- Infos-Insolites-man ?
Le saviez-vous ? Que t'es viré ?
Étirement-man ?
Viré tęte en bas.
Le Monty-Python-man ?
Nous sommes les chevaliers
qui disent...
T'es viré.
Attends !
Je gérais une simulation
de ligue de baseball ŕ l'école.
Pas mal.
T'as peut-ętre quelque chose.
Génial ! Génial !
Je suis Simule-man !
En fait, tu seras Sport-man.
On a déjŕ Simule-man.
- Ça va, les gars ?
- Salut, Frank.
T'es oů ? T'es jamais en retard.
T'es monté
sur l'Empire State Building ?
Écoute la vieille dame.
Elle en connaît, des histoires.
Prends ton temps.
Attends.
"Maison de Ted Mosby".
Le coup de fil
vient de l'intérieur !
C'est pas l'Empire State Building.
Tu peux pas coucher
avec mon assistant.
J'essaye de travailler ici, moi.
Comment c'est arrivé ?
Le midi, quand tu vas faire
tes marches de réflexion,
ça nous laisse du temps
ŕ passer ensemble.
Inspiration...
- fais ton oeuvre.
- Ŕ chaque fois, chef.
Ŕ chaque fois.
Dis-moi, PJ, j'ai une question
d'architecture pour toi.
Le cul de Ted a quel goűt ?
Aucune idée,
mais sans doute le goűt du génie.
C'est verrouillé ?
Les visiteurs doivent s'enregistrer
pour avoir la clé.
Écoute, Peej. Et je veux
que tu réfléchisses sérieusement
avant de répondre.
Tu me dis que je peux pas
aller aux toilettes chez moi ?
Je vous dis que vous devez
demander la permission
pour aller aux toilettes
dans mes locaux.
Pourquoi ça m'excite ?
Y a des milliards de types
sur Terre.
Pourquoi tu couches avec lui ?
Quand je sors du boulot,
il est 5 h 30 du matin.
T'as une idée des mecs
que je croise ?
Je distribue le journal. C'est sale,
mais quelqu'un doit le faire.
T'inquičte pas, je me les laverai
avant de te tripoter les parties.
Je vis avec ma maman. Le soir,
on regarde la télé dans son lit.
On appelle ça "Le Club des Câlins".
Alors, tu te lčves trčs tôt
pour échanger sur le marché européen ?
C'est comment ?
Écoute, on va le faire ou pas ?
Premičrement, je connais Simule-man,
c'est un bon parti.
Deuxičmement, ça doit s'arręter !
Si tu distrais PJ,
on perd en productivité.
Quelle productivité ?
T'as pas appelé un seul client.
Une fois le site internet lancé,
les brochures imprimées,
et le choix des jeux
au séminaire d'entreprise,
je les appellerai.
Séminaire ?
M. Mosby et moi allons camper
sur le toit.
Sport-man. J'ai entendu
les gens parler de ton club.
C'est un peu plus dur
que je pensais.
Les frais d'inscription,
de transaction,
les frais de pénalité, je...
garde beaucoup d'argent.
Bon boulot, Sport-man.
C'est pour la semaine derničre.
<i>60,</i>
<i>80, 100.</i>
<i>18 000 $ en liquide.</i>
<i>C'est rien.</i>
<i>Je vais les ramener ŕ la maison
et les mettre dans un endroit sűr.</i>
<i>OK, marcher dans la rue
avec de l'argent en poche.</i>
<i>Touche pas l'argent.</i>
<i>C'est si évident.
Sois naturel.</i>
<i>Le bébé me regarde.
Les bébés peuvent sentir l'argent.</i>
<i>C'est connu !</i>
Je transporte beaucoup d'argent !
Vraiment, mec,
je sais pas combien de temps
je vais tenir.
La semaine derničre,
tu étais un rebut
que personne ne regardait.
Maintenant, tu es Sport-man.
- Un rebut ?
- La semaine derničre !
Voilŕ Ted Mosby de Mosbius Designs.
Comment va le bureau ŕ domicile ?
Trčs bien jusqu'ŕ ce que Robin
couche avec mon assistant.
C'est notre appart.
Tu laisses un gâteau sur le comptoir,
maman va s'en offrir une tranche.
Je te l'ai dit,
engage une jolie assistante
avec qui tu peux coucher
au lieu d'engager un assistant
avec qui Robin peut coucher.
Bien sűr qu'il va coucher avec elle.
C'est la plus géniale de la plančte.
Je suis hors sujet !
T'es un idiot !
C'est mon message !
T'es un idiot !
Une personne en furie, ça suffit pas !
Marshall avec moi !
Mec, pourquoi tu es si contrarié
que Ted ne couche pas
avec les gens qu'il embauche ?
Parce que ça fait mal !
- Comment ça ?
- Ça fait mal, car j'aime...
quand Ted...
couche avec des femmes.
Je suis un ami trčs dévoué !
Lily est la seule
ŕ qui je peux en parler.
Dis-lui de me parler.
J'essaierai,
mais sans aucune garantie.
Elle est encore scandalisée
par cette blague.
Cette blague.
Ça déchire notre groupe,
qui braque les gens que j'aime
contre les autres.
Franchement, je voudrais...
Je voudrais que cette blague
ne soit jamais entrée dans nos vies.
- C'est drôle quand męme, non ?
- C'est trčs drôle.
Bonne nouvelle, PJ.
Les brochures viennent d'arriver.
Trčs bon choix pour la couverture.
J'aime qu'ŕ la place
d'une de mes créations,
tu choisisses ça.
Vous savez quoi ?
J'ai dű envoyer la mauvaise photo.
Tu crois ?
Écoute PJ,
le site Web n'est toujours pas fait.
Tu n'es męme pas venu
au séminaire...
Au fait,
j'ai vu une étoile filante...
et tu es en retard tous les jours.
Désolé, PJ. Je dois ętre concentré.
- Tu es viré.
- Vous pouvez pas me virer...
Tu es viré.
Bien !
Salut, bébé,
je viens d'ętre viré.
Oui, je t'attendrai chez toi.
<i>La Roue de la fortune.</i>
J'aime avoir tout ce temps libre
ŕ passer avec toi.
Je vais t'embrasser lŕ...
Et lŕ.
Et lŕ et lŕ.
Et...
- Encore un.
- Arrętez.
Je vais aux toilettes.
Tu vas me manquer.
Tu vas me manquer aussi.
- T'en as déjŕ marre de lui.
- Il me rend folle.
Quand PJ travaillait, il était sexy.
Le gardien de la clé des toilettes.
Un mec sexy qui dit quand tu peux
ou pas aller aux toilettes ?
C'est le ręve.
"C'est le ręve" ?
Le ręve ?
Comme ce dont parlait
Martin Luther King ?
Je dois arręter, non ?
Je sais pas rompre.
Je dois encore y aller,
mais je pouvais plus rester loin de toi.
Écoute...
Mec, je sais pas.
- Quoi ?
- Oui, c'est juste...
C'est pas vraiment...
ça, tu sais ?
Ça sur quoi ?
Je le sens pas.
Tu sens pas quoi ?
Mais, amis et autre.
Mon Dieu, c'est la pire rupture.
Tu romps avec moi ?
Si c'est ce que tu veux,
je comprends tout ŕ fait.
Tu n'as pas utilisé cet <i>short-stop</i>
que les Mariners ont abordé.
Il faut que je l'ai.
Tu vois, Sport-man.
Les gens t'adorent.
Je peux plus ętre Sport-man.
Je deviens dingue !
Je reçois constamment
des SMS, des e-mails
et des appels au milieu de la nuit.
Parfois, je pense męme
qu'on me suit.
Salut, mec.
Il faut que tu fasses cet échange,
que je puisse préparer mon équipe.
Tu es vraiment tendu, n'est-ce pas ?
Sérieux, c'est fini.
J'arręte ?
<i>Avec la rupture de Robin et PJ,</i>
<i>j'étais libre de modifier
le personnel au bureau.</i>
Bienvenue chez Mosbius Designs.
Tu plaisantes ?
<i>Maintenant que PJ revenait bosser...</i>
Tu plaisantes ?
Apparemment, Robin et PJ sont
de nouveau ensemble.
Tu plaisantes !
Ça va ?
Comme Lily ne me parle plus,
je dois te dire un truc.
Et c'est pas facile ŕ dire, OK ?
Je... attends...
suis... attends...
amoureux... attends...
de... attends...
une... attends...
- certaine... attends...
- Je sais que t'es amoureux de Robin.
- Quoi ?
- Lily me l'a dit.
Elle te l'a dit ?
Génial.
J'imagine que vous vous marrez
dans mon dos depuis tout ce temps.
En fait, bizarrement,
on pense tous les deux
que vous ętes faits l'un pour l'autre.
Vrai ?
On essaye męme de s'asseoir
du męme côté
pour que vous vous asseyiez
côte ŕ côte.
Vraiment ? C'est si mignon.
Mais soyons clairs.
Je ne l'aime pas, OK ?
C'est juste qu'elle...
me manque quand elle est pas lŕ.
Je pense ŕ elle tout le temps,
j'imagine qu'un jour, on courra
l'un vers l'autre au ralenti
et que je porterai
une veste en daim.
Tu vas lui dire ce que tu ressens ?
Peut-ętre. Jamais.
Je sais pas. Écoute...
Je dois juste me débarrasser
de cet idiot de PJ.
Si Lily était lŕ, elle saurait
comment se débarrasser de lui.
- Je peux peut-ętre aider.
- Tu n'es pas Lily.
Lily est une marionnettiste diabolique,
manipulant subtilement les situations
pour parvenir ŕ ses fins.
C'est le mal incarné.
Tu as la bonne. Accroche-toi ŕ elle.
<i>Pendant ce temps, ma lutte sans merci
contre Robin et PJ continuait.</i>
J'allais faire
ma promenade de sagesse.
Tu veux venir ?
J'ai pris la clé des toilettes
sans demander.
Tu vas faire quoi ?
Écoutez...
vous ętes géniaux.
Mais j'ai choisi un autre boulot.
C'est pour vous.
Robin, j'espčre que cette lettre
t'offrira une conclusion.
Vous allez vraiment me manquer.
On échange pas Manny Ramirez
contre deux remplaçants !
Si tu mets ton veto, je m'en vais !
Je trouverai un truc.
Embaucher le gamin comme assistant.
Il fait tout le boulot
et tu es toujours Sport-man.
Le mal incarné, Eriksen.
Le mal incarné.
Ça va ?
Et si je pensais pas aux livres ?
Pardon ?
Il y a une histoire d'architecture
trčs connue sur un architecte
qui a dessiné cette bibliothčque.
Elle était parfaite.
Mais chaque année,
tout s'enfonce
de quelques centimčtres dans le sol.
Évidemment,
le bâtiment fut condamné.
Il a oublié de prendre en compte
le poids des livres.
Cette boîte... ce n'est que moi.
Si jamais je pensais pas
aux livres ?
Plus personne ne va ŕ la bibliothčque,
donc on se fiche de ce type.
Et tu dois prendre le téléphone
et appeler des clients.
Plus je retarde le lancement
de ma boîte,
plus ça peut rester un ręve
et pas un truc que j'ai foiré.
C'est comme si j'abandonnais
avant d'avoir commencé.
Tu veux qu'on parle d'abandon ?
Je décrivais le mec parfait comme :
"drôle, intelligent,
passionné, ambitieux".
Et apparemment, je me contente de...
"dans mon appartement".
Tu pensais pas
que tu l'aurais compris, maintenant ?
Tu rigoles ? Ŕ 30 ans,
je devais avoir un succčs insolent,
ętre marié ŕ la femme parfaite,
peut-ętre un môme en route.
Au lieu de ça, je suis juste
un mec assis dans son appartement,
qui fait un concours de regard
avec son téléphone.
Et qui perd.
Tu peux le faire.
Bonjour, Ted Mosby
de Mosbius Designs.
Je me renseigne sur vos besoins
en design, présent ou ŕ venir.
- Ça a l'air bien.
- J'avais l'air confiant ?
- Maintenant appelle un vrai client.
- Génial.
Hé, Bouffe-man !
Hé, Jouet-man !
C'est qui, ce mec ?
Il travaille pas ici.
Je pense qu'on devrait partir.
- Vraiment ?
- C'est déjŕ arrivé.
- I heard this great joke at work.
- Dude, come on.
She's not gonna like it.
It's boy-funny. It's not girl-funny.
That is sexist!
Funny is funny, Ted.
Lily's cool.
She'll appreciate this.
- You're on your own, man.
- Just tell me the joke.
Okay. Ready?
Lily, what's the difference
between peanut butter and jam?
- See? It's funny.
- It's boy-funny.
- She's not gonna like it.
- Why don't you let me decide?
What's the difference
between peanut butter and jam?
<i>And then Barney said the punch line.</i>
<i>To this day,
it's still the dirtiest joke</i>
<i>I've ever heard in my life.
And no, I'm not gonna say it.</i>
Yeah, I can't hang out
with you anymore.
Oh, come on.
That's a funny joke. That...
Told you.
She'll be back.
<i>And we didn't see Lily
for four weeks.</i>
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
<i>Kids, after getting laid off,</i>
<i>I was finally pursuing
my lifelong dream:</i>
<i>starting my own architecture firm.</i>
<i>All I needed was some clients.</i>
I think it's so great that
you're striking out on your own, Ted.
- I admire that.
- Thanks.
And thanks for being so cool
with me using the apartment.
Yeah, of course.
Anything you need.
Small thing, do you mind not watching
television during business hours?
- This isn't working!
- I'm sorry. It's just, I....
I can't concentrate
while <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> is...
A penny saved
is a Penny Marshall! Yes!
Ted, I know you're nervous,
but you've got to stop procrastinating.
You've spent the last two days choosing
the official pen of Mosbius Designs.
I've made some progress!
I've eliminated felt-tip.
Who am I kidding?
Felt's back in the ballgame.
Hey. You hear there's gonna be
more layoffs?
I know. I'm freaking out.
- Are you worried?
- Are you kidding?
The things I know about this company.
I won't ever be fired.
There's a pretty good chance one day
I'll wash up on shore
with no fingerprints or teeth,
but I won't be fired.
I wish I had your confidence.
Look, you just need a way to make
yourself absolutely essential.
Well, I work harder
than anyone in my division.
Yeah. Keeping your job has
nothing to do with hard work.
- You need a thing.
- What do you mean, a thing?
You know, something
that makes you fun
and well-liked, like Marcus Denisco.
<i>Marcus Denisco worked
in account services</i>
<i>and was perhaps the most expendable
employee at the company.</i>
I brought some donuts.
They're probably stupid.
<i>But eventually,
he came to be known as...</i>
Food Guy!
Who wants some pulled pork?
Of course you do! Come on!
I love Food Guy.
They could never lay him off.
You know what I love about Food Guy?
- He always has food.
- He always has food.
See? That's what you need.
You need that thing
that makes you a guy.
I have that thing
that makes me a guy.
Maybe even a guy and a half.
Not that thing.
You know, a thing. Like Toy Guy.
Guys, bad news.
As your HR rep,
I got to review the new overtime
scheduling policy with you.
The good news is we're gonna do it
while wearing Wolverine claws!
Section 5A:
Overtime will no longer be paid
at time and a half.
This is awesome!
Claw five!
I love Toy Guy.
See? You need a thing.
Like YouTube Clip Guy.
You're right.
I do need a thing.
But choose wisely.
You don't want
to be Creepy Back Rub Guy.
Don't fill up. Food Guy's
got panna cotta in his office.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, Douglas.
You're so tight.
I was relaxed about two seconds ago.
You're next.
Hi. Welcome to Mosbius Designs.
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm PJ, Mr. Mosby's assistant.
- What the hell is going on?
- I'm sorry. We do <i>not</i> interrupt
Mr. Mosby during
his brainstorming hour.
<i>It's okay, PJ. That's Robin.</i>
<i>She lives here.</i>
<i>I'm sorry for the disturbance, sir.</i>
Do you need anything else?
- I wouldn't say no to a cup of coffee.
- You're right there!
So now, Ted has an assistant
to help him not do anything.
PJ's been a huge help to me,
setting up the office,
designing the Web site.
And in return, I'm mentoring
a bright young mind.
Yes, the mentoring.
I want you to go outside
today and simply...
put your hands on buildings.
All right? Feel
the concrete pulse.
Listen... Listen to the stories
the stones are telling you.
And pick up my dry cleaning.
I will.
- Thank you so much, Mr. Mosby.
- All right.
This table just told me
you're a douche.
This whole mentoring thing
is just another way to procrastinate
- from actually calling clients.
- I'm not procrastinating.
I just... I want everything
to be perfect, okay?
I only get one shot at this.
Fine, but PJ is not helping.
If Ted says that PJ
is important to the company,
then PJ is not going anywhere.
See? He's very valuable.
PJ's a guy?
PJ's not some hot chick
you're banging?
No, I'm mentoring him.
Mentoring.
I mentored a young fellow once.
Even made him my wingman.
Then, one day, he hired an assistant
to work ten feet
from his bedroom who...
get this... isn't a hot chick,
proving he never listened
to a word I said.
And do you know
that young man's name?
Maybe. I don't remember.
Because he is dead to me!
PJ's gonna be getting
a very confusing card in the mail,
along with a garment
that he should by no means wear
for three days
and then mail back to me.
I thought of a "thing"
to make me more essential here.
I'm Eco Guy, 'cause everybody loves
a guy who recycles, right?
Fired. What else you got?
I thought of a few others:
Wacky Tie Guy.
- Fired.
- Daily Fun Fact Guy?
Did you know that you're fired?
I Know a Good Stretch for That Guy?
Downward-facing fired.
Monty Python Guy?
We are the knights who say...
You're fired.
Wait! Wait!
I did used to run
a fantasy baseball league
back in law school.
That's not bad.
You might be on to something.
Awesome. Awesome!
I'll be Fantasy Guy!
We'll have to make you Sports Guy.
We already have a Fantasy Guy.
- What's up, bros?
- Hey, Frank.
Hello?
Where are you?
You're never late.
You're on top
of the Empire State Building?
Listen to the old gal.
She's got some stories to tell.
Take all the time you need.
Wait a second.
"Ted Mosby Home".
Oh my God, the call is coming
from inside the house.
That's not
the Empire State Building.
Robin, you cannot sleep
with my assistant.
I'm trying to run a business here.
How did this even happen?
Well, at lunch, when you go
on your wisdom walks,
it gives me and PJ
some time alone together.
Inspiration... do your thing.
It always does, sir.
It always does.
Hey, PJ, I actually have
an architectural question for you.
How does Ted's ass taste?
I wouldn't know, but I assume
it tastes like genius.
Why is the bathroom locked?
Visitors need to sign in
for the bathroom key.
Listen, Peej, and I want you to think
this over real good
before you answer.
Are you telling me that I can't
go to the bathroom in my apartment?
I am telling you that you need
to ask permission
to use the bathroom in my office.
Why is that so hot?
There are billions
of guys in the world.
Why do you have to sleep with him?
Ted, when I get off work,
it's 5:30 in the morning.
Do you have any idea
what kind of guys I'm meeting?
I deliver newspapers. It's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.
Don't worry. I'll wash them
before I handle your business.
I live with my mom.
At night, we watch TV in her bed.
We call it "Cuddle Club".
So, you, get up really early to trade
on the European stock exchanges?
What's that like?
Look, is this going
to happen or not?
Okay, first of all,
I've hung out with Fantasy Guy.
You could do a lot worse.
Secondly,
this has to stop.
Distracting PJ is going
to kill our productivity.
What productivity? You haven't
even called a single client.
Once I get the Web site up,
the brochures printed,
and figure out what trusts games
we're going to play at the corporate
retreat, I am making those calls.
Corporate retreat?
Mr. Mosby and I are going camping
on the roof.
Hey, Sports Guy. I hear people
are raving about your league.
It's a lot harder
than I thought it would be.
Between entry fees
and transaction fees
and penalty fees, I'm actually...
I'm holding on to a lot of money.
Great work, Sports Guy.
That's for last week.
<i>60,</i>
<i>80, a hundred.</i>
<i>This is $18,000 cash.</i>
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>
<i>I'll just take it home
and put it somewhere safe.</i>
<i>Okay, just walking down the street</i>
<i>with some money in my pocket.</i>
<i>Don't touch the money.</i>
<i>That's so obvious.
Just be cool.</i>
<i>The baby's on to me.
Babies can smell money.</i>
Everyone knows that!
I'm carrying a lot of money!
Seriously, dude,
I'm not sure how much longer
I can keep doing this.
Marshall, last week you were trash
that no one wanted to look at.
Now, you're Sports Guy.
- I was trash?
- Last week!
There's Ted Mosby
of Mosbius Designs.
How's the home office coming, buddy?
It was going great till Robin started
banging my assistant.
It's our apartment, okay? You leave
a big chocolate cake on the counter,
Mama's gonna cut her off a slice.
I told you.
Hire a cute assistant
that you can sleep with,
but instead you hire a cute assistant
that Robin can sleep with.
And of course he's gonna sleep with her.
She's the greatest woman on the planet!
I'm getting off topic!
You're an idiot!
That's my message!
You're an idiot!
One person storming off isn't enough!
Marshall, storm off with me!
Dude, why are this upset
about Ted not having sex
with the people he hires?
Because it hurts!
- It hurts you how?
- It hurts because I love...
Ted.
Having sex with women.
I'm a very dedicated wingman!
Look, Lily's the only person
that I can talk to about this stuff.
Just get her to talk to me.
I'll try, but there's no guarantees.
She's still really outraged
about that joke.
That joke.
Torn our little group apart,
pitted people I love
against each other.
Seriously, I wish...
I wish that joke had never come
into our lives.
- It's kinda of funny though, right?
- It's so funny, man.
Hey, good news, PJ.
The brochures you designed just came in.
Really interesting choice for the cover.
I like how instead of one
of my designs,
you chose this.
You know what?
I must've sent in the wrong photo.
You think?
Look, PJ,
the Web site's still not done.
You didn't even show up
to the corporate retreat...
by the way, I saw a shooting star...
... and you're late every day.
I'm sorry, PJ. I gotta get focused.
- You're fired.
- You can't fire...
PJ, you're fired.
Fine!
Hey, baby.
I just got fired.
Yeah, I'll wait for you
at your place.
<i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>
I love having all this free time
to spend with you.
I'm going to kiss you here...
And here.
And here and here.
And...
- One more.
- Please stop.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you, too.
- You're already sick of him.
- He's driving me crazy.
When PJ had a job, he was sexy.
He was guardian of the bathroom key.
A hot guy telling you
when you can and can't pee?
That's the dream.
"That's the dream"?
The dream?
Like what Martin Luther King
was talking about?
I have to end it, don't I?
I'm terrible at breakups.
I still have to go a little bit, but
I couldn't be away from you 1 s longer.
Listen...
Dude, I don't know.
- What?
- Yeah, it's just...
It's not really...
ix-nay, you know?
Ix-nay on what?
Not feeling it.
Not feeling what?
But friends and stuff.
My God, this is
the worst breakup ever.
You're breaking up with me?
If that's what you want,
I totally understand.
You still haven't activated that
shortstop the Mariners just brought up.
Got to have it.
See, Sports Guy!
People love you.
I can't be Sports Guy anymore, okay?
It's killing me!
I keep getting
these constant texts and e-mails
and phone calls
in the middle of the night.
Sometimes I even think
that I'm being followed.
Hey, buddy.
I need you to push that trade through,
so I can set my new lineup.
You really carry it
in your shoulders, don't you?
Seriously, it's over.
Do you want me to stop?
<i>With Robin and PJ broken up,</i>
<i>I was free to make
some staffing changes in the office.</i>
Welcome to Mosbius Designs.
You got to be kidding me?
<i>And now that PJ was back at work...</i>
You got to be kidding me?
So, apparently Robin and PJ
are an item again.
You got to be kidding me!
Are you all right?
Since Lily's not talking to me,
there's something I have to tell you.
And this isn't easy to say, all right?
I'm... wait for it...
in... wait for it...
love... wait for it...
with... wait for it...
a... wait for it...
- certain... wait for it...
- I know that you're in love with Robin.
- What?
- Lily told me.
She told you?
Great.
I bet you guys have been laughing at me
behind my back the whole time.
Actually, in a weird way,
we both think you're kind
of perfect for each other.
You do?
Matter of fact,
we even try to sit on the same side
of the booth so you two
will have to sit together.
Really? That's so sweet.
But let's be clear.
I don't love her. Okay?
I just...
miss her when she's not around.
I think about her all the time,
and I imagine us one day running towards
each other in slow motion,
and I'm wearing a brown suede vest.
Are you ever gonna tell her
how you feel?
Maybe. Never. I don't know. Look...
I just need to get
that PJ idiot away from her.
If Lily were here, she'd know exactly
how to get rid of him.
- Maybe I can help.
- Marshall, you're no Lily.
Lily is a diabolical puppet master,
subtly manipulating
every situation to get
exactly what she wants.
She's pure evil, Marshall.
You got a good one there.
Hang on to her.
<i>Meanwhile, my bizarre tug of war
with Robin over PJ continued.</i>
I was about to go on my wisdom walk.
Want to join me?
I took the bathroom key
without asking.
What are you gonna do about it?
Look...
you guys are both great.
But the truth is I'm taking another job.
These are for you.
Robin, I hope this letter
offers some closure.
I'm really going to miss you.
You can't trade Manny Ramirez
for two middle relievers!
If you veto that trade,
I am out of the league!
I'll figure it out.
Hire the kid to be a "paralegal".
He gets to do all the work,
and you still get to be Sports Guy.
Pure evil, Eriksen.
Pure evil.
You okay?
What if I don't think of the books?
Excuse me?
There's this famous architecture story
about an architect
who designed this library.
It was perfect.
But every year,
the whole thing would sink
a couple inches into the ground.
Eventually, the building
was condemned.
He forgot to account
for the weight of the books.
This company... it's just me.
What if I don't think of the books?
First of all, nobody goes to libraries
anymore, so who cares about that guy?
Secondly, you need to get
on the phone and start calling clients.
The longer I put off
starting my own firm,
the longer it can remain a dream
and not something I screwed up at.
It's like I'm giving up
before I even started.
You want to talk about giving up?
I used to describe my ideal guy as
"funny, smart,
"passionate, challenging".
And now, apparently,
I will settle for...
"in my apartment".
Didn't you think you'd have it
all more figured out by now?
Are you kidding? By 30,
I was gonna be annoyingly successful,
married to the perfect woman,
maybe a kid on the way.
Instead, I'm just some guy
sitting in his apartment,
having a staring contest
with his phone.
And losing.
You can take that thing.
Hi, this is Ted Mosby
of Mosbius Designs.
I'm calling to inquire about any design
needs you may have now or in the future.
- That sounds great.
- Really? I sound confident?
- Now call an actual client.
- Great.
Hey, Food Guy!
Hey, Toy Guy!
Who's that guy?
He doesn't work here.
I think we should leave the building.
- Really?
- This has happened before.
Super. Donc, je t'appellerai.
J'espère bien.
- Regarde ça.
- J'ai eu le numéro de cette fille.
Regardez.
Holly.
Chouette.
Les filles avec un prénom
finissant par L-Y sont cochonnes.
Holly, Kelly,
Carly, Lily.
Ouais, c'est vrai.
Et sans parler des filles
avec des prénoms finissant en I,
au lieu d'un Y.
C'est filles sont comme des manèges.
Tu fais la queue longtemps,
mais une fois dedans,
tu t'accroches en espérant
ne pas perdre tes clés.
Tu sais ce que je vais faire ?
Je vais l'appeler de suite.
Je vais faire "tu te souviens de moi ?
Ça fait un bail".
C'est marrant
parce que je viens de la voir.
Tu peux pas.
Tu dois attendre 3 jours,
avant d'appeler. C'est la règle.
Cette règle
est complètement dépassée.
Elles savent exactement
ce que tu fais.
J'ai une autre règle.
C'est un peu dingue,
mais je l'appelle,
"tu l'aimes bien, tu l'appelles".
Pardon. Tu peux répéter ça ?
Je ne parle pas le je-baise-jamais.
La règle des 3 jours,
c'est n'importe quoi.
Qui l'a inventée ?
Jésus.
Barney, fais pas ça.
Pas avec Jésus.
Sérieusement.
Jésus a commencé
ce truc des 3 jours.
Il a attendu 3 jours
pour revenir à la vie. C'était parfait.
S'il n'avait attendu qu'un jour,
on n'aurait pas su qu'il était mort !
Ils auraient dit : "Jésus, ça va ?".
Et Jésus aurait probablement dit :
"Ça va ? Je suis mort hier !".
Et ils diraient tous :
"Tu m'as l'air bien vivant, mec".
Et il aurait dû
expliquer sa résurrection.
Et le miracle.
Et ensuite, le gars dirait :
"D'accord, comme tu veux, mec".
Ces dialogues anciens
ont l'air pompeux maintenant.
Et il va pas revenir un samedi.
Tout le monde est occupé
à faire les corvées.
Tisser, couper la barbe.
Non. Il attend exactement
le bon nombre de jours...
Trois.
Je promets, j'attendrai 3 jours.
Arrête de parler.
Et, c'est dimanche,
ils sont déjà tous à l'église.
Ils sont tous là,
"Non, Jésus est mort."
Puis, bam !
Il fait irruption par la porte,
traverse la nef,
tout le monde est excité.
Et au passage,
c'est là qu'il a inventé
le "tope là !".
3 jours.
On attend 3 jours
pour appeler une femme
Car c'est le temps
que Jésus veut qu'on attende.
Histoire vraie.
Synchro : ShalimarFox, Arrow
Adaptation : Arrow, ZeK, Tactactac
Relecture : mpm, Collioure
D'accord. Je promets.
Je l'appellerai pas avant 3 jours.
<i>Mais j'ai rien dit sur les textos.</i>
<i>J'ai commencé
avec quelque chose de joli et charmant.</i>
<i>"Je pensais à toi, alors,
j'ai pensé t'envoyer un piti texto."</i>
<i>En appuyant sur "Envoyer", j'ai réalisé
que ce n'était pas du tout charmant.</i>
<i>C'était le truc le plus naze
que quiconque ait dit à quelqu'un.</i>
<i>Et le pire avec les textos,
c'est qu'une fois envoyés...</i>
<i>on ne peut pas les récupérer.</i>
<i>Et puis...</i>
<i>tu attends.</i>
<i>Et juste quand tu as décidé
de ne plus jamais envoyer de texto...</i>
<i>"Je pensais à toi aussi,</i>
<i>"c'est dingue que tu m'envoies un texto
quand je suis dans mon bain."</i>
- C'était quoi ?
- Quoi ?
- T'as fait un bruit.
- C'est mon portable, un texto.
Pas ça.
T'as fait le bruit de la fille nue.
- Quoi ?
- Dès que tu vois une fille nue,
tu fais le bruit.
- C'est pas vrai.
- Vraiment ?
Désolé, Lily.
<i>Pendant que les hommes chassent, </i>
<i>les femmes
de la tribu indigène Korowai</i>
<i>lavent leurs vêtements
dans la rivière.</i>
C'est un sein.
C'est Holly qui t'écrit ?
T'as pas promis d'attendre 3 jours ?
Pour appeler.
Les textos, c'est différent.
D'accord, essaie juste
de calmer ton bruit de la fille nue.
Je fais pas de bruit.
Vraiment ?
<i>Holly et moi,
on s'est envoyés des textos jusqu'à 2 h.</i>
<i>Et toute la journée suivante, aussi.</i>
<i>Elle semblait parfaite.</i>
Holly vient de me dire ce qu'elle porte.
C'est assez excitant.
Quoi que ce soit,
je te garantis qu'elle ne le porte pas.
Elle ment pour te plaire.
Comment tu sais ça ?
Parce qu'aucune femme dans l'histoire
ne s'est jamais,
"posée pour lire des magazines
d'architecture dans mon vieil...
uniforme de pom-pom girl."
D'accord, elle ment peut-être
sur les magazines d'architecture.
- Non. C'est mauvais.
- Quoi ?
Elle vient de m'envoyer un message
clairement destiné à quelqu'un d'autre.
"Bébé, j'ai pris à manger chez Generro.
Je rentre bientôt."
Oui, ça a l'air mauvais,
mais réfléchissons un peu.
C'est peut-être pour son frère
ou son père qui est malade.
Descends.
"Et après je veux...
"que tu me prennes sur le canapé."
Peut-être pas un père malade...
Ou un père vraiment malade...
Pas vrai ?
Désolée.
Salut les gars !
C'est quoi ?
Un repas de Generro
que je ramène à Lily.
Bizarre.
Holly a envoyé un message à Ted
parlant d'un repas de Generro.
Une seconde.
Bande de salopards !
Quoi ?
Vous êtes Holly !
Donc, Ted n'a pas envoyé
de messages à Holly ?
Il en envoyait à vous ?
On savait qu'il essaierait
de l'appeler avant les 3 jours,
donc j'ai pris son portable
et changé son numéro par le mien.
On voulait le chopper
à appeler trop tôt, mais ensuite il a...
envoyé des textos.
"Piti texto" ?
Pauvre, petit Ted.
On devrait...
- On devrait lui dire que c'est nous.
- Ouais.
Ou...
on se fait passer pour Holly
et on est dans le bain.
C'est mieux.
C'était drôle.
- On devrait lui dire que c'est nous.
- On devrait.
Ou...
on lui dit que le rouge
est notre couleur préférée
et qu'on trouve
le look "cowboy", sexy.
C'est mieux.
<i>Je les porte en ce moment
et elles sont bien sexy.</i>
- Il a mis les bottes !
- Il les a carrément mises !
C'était génial !
Mais c'est le moment de lui dire
pour qui il les porte.
Ou...
on enlève notre chemise.
C'est mieux.
Peut-être qu'on porte en dessous,
un soutien-gorge noir en dentelle.
Je crois bien
qu'on porte rien dessous.
On est chauds.
Là, il porte seulement
les bottes de cowboy !
- C'est parti !
- Trop !
Dis-lui qu'on fait
lentement glisser notre...
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Je crois qu'on va...
avoir une relation sexuelle
avec Ted.
Vous avez fait ça,
toute la journée ?
C'est méchant.
Non, en fait, c'était pour son bien.
On le protège de lui-même.
Il aime vraiment cette fille.
Il avait ce regard.
Le regard dingue : "Je vais trop vite
et je vais tout foutre en l'air".
Le même qu'il a eu avec toi
la première fois.
On sait tous ce que ça a donné.
- Je suis amoureux de toi.
- Quoi ?
J'étais un cas unique.
Cette Holly n'est pas
Robin Scherbatsky.
C'est quoi,
le problème avec ses cheveux ?
Flash info :
Le démêlant, ça existe
pour ne pas avoir un casque.
Je suis si méchante.
Ça fait longtemps
que Ted n'a pas aimé quelqu'un.
Il a beaucoup emmagasiné...
On pensait lui faire dire "Je t'aime"
avant qu'il la contacte.
Et c'est pour bientôt.
Il montre tous les signes révélateurs.
Primo :
il plaisante avec le mariage.
"Tu aimes l'architecture ?
On devrait se marier.
"Ha-ha. MDR.
Je plaisante. Alors ?"
Deuzio : il fait bien trop tôt
des suggestions folles de voyages.
"J'aime aussi la bière.
"On devrait aller en Allemagne.
"MDR. JP. MDR."
Tertio : Il dit bien trop tôt
des choses personnelles.
"Mes parents ont divorcé y a 2 ans.
"Ça a été vraiment dur.
"MDR."
Et il sait vraiment pas
ce que MDR veut dire.
Oui, mais voilà le problème.
Ted n'a pas dit "Je t'aime"
aussi facilement qu'on le pensait.
Et là, on a rencontré Stan.
Pourquoi vous faites
autant de bruit ?
Alors, on lui a tout expliqué
et une fois fini,
y a eu un truc fascinant.
Pourquoi ne pas lui dire
que vous savez qu'il est là,
pensant à vous,
se préoccupant de vous,
et que vous vous sentez
en sécurité ?
Que vos peurs,
votre passé s'évanouissent.
Et que le seul espoir
est la promesse d'une étreinte.
Super, Stan.
- Qui c'est ?
- Un garde qui travaille de nuit.
Il mange ici, chaque jour.
- Et il avait pas fini.
- Loin de là.
Je remercie Dieu
pour chaque erreur que j'ai faite,
parce que chacune d'elles m'a indiqué
le chemin qui m'a mené à vous.
C'est... vraiment joli.
Peu importe. Ça va.
<i>Et quand, finalement, on sera ensemble,
je veux que tu m'enlaces.</i>
Enlace-moi toute la nuit.
Caresse mes cheveux.
Dis-moi que je suis une femme
et montre-moi que tu es un homme.
Jusqu'à ce qu'il y ait
que maintenant.
Toi et moi...
et maintenant.
Tu veux que j'envoie ça à Ted.
Je le savais.
<i>"Je ne demande pas
qu'on m'explique la nuit.</i>
<i>"Je l'attends et elle m'enveloppe</i>
<i>"Et tu es comme le pain,</i>
<i>"La lumière et l'ombre."</i>
C'est de Pablo Neruda.
Je sais pas...
ce que vient faire le pain ici,
mais ça me touche...
ici...
et ici.
Eh bien, si Ted ne le dit pas,
je le dirai.
Je t'aime.
C'est cool.
- Toujours rien ?
- Il est peut-être pas amoureux de nous.
Comment c'est possible ?
On est tout ce qu'il attend !
Je comprends pas les hommes.
- Je dois aller bosser.
- Est-ce que... tu reviendras ?
Je reviendrai quand le vent, le destin
et la chance me ramèneront.
C'est-à-dire demain.
C'est le jour du cheesesteak.
Ce gars vous a fait craquer.
J'espère que sa copine
est pas jalouse.
Il a parlé d'une copine ou... ?
Tout allait bien
jusqu'à ce qu'il lui envoie
un texto destiné à Lily
- et gâche tout.
- C'est pas grave.
C'est fini maintenant.
Je dois partir,
mais voilà ce qui va se passer :
vous allez l'appeler maintenant,
lui dire ce que vous avez fait
et vous excuser.
- Compris ?
- Oui.
Ou...
Holly m'a tout expliqué,
c'était juste un malentendu.
- Tout va bien maintenant.
- Vraiment ?
Comment elle a expliqué
le coup du texto ?
Apparemment,
son imbécile d'ami Marsha
a utilisé accidentellement son téléphone
- pour un message à son mari Billy.
- Marsha et Billy.
Ils se sont pas foulés.
Et maintenant,
ça va mieux que jamais.
Ça paraît dingue,
mais je crois
que je m'attache à cette fille.
Tu t'attaches à Barney et Marshall.
- Quoi ?
- Ils ne croyaient pas
que tu attendrais 3 jours,
donc Barney a changé son numéro
par celui de son portable de travail.
Holly est Barney et Marshall.
Attends.
C'était eux tout ce temps ?
Donc Holly n'était pas
dans son bain ?
Ou assise près de la fenêtre,
regardant les étoiles en pensant à moi ?
Ou sur son canapé en pom-pom girl
lisant des magazines d'architecture ?
Je pense pas qu'ils aient fait ça.
Ils étaient juste au bar.
- C'est vrai.
- Mais oui, c'était eux.
- Incroyable !
- Je sais.
Tu devrais leur dire
que tu n'es pas dupe.
Ou...
Je leur envoie un texto
qui va vraiment les embrouiller.
Je vois.
Pourquoi pas :
"Je ne l'ai encore dit à personne,
"mais il ne me reste
que trois mois à vivre" ?
Pas mal.
Et : "J'ai tué un homme
avec une pelle,
"et ces sentiments refont surface" ?
J'aime ce truc que quelqu'un a dit
sur les trois mois à vivre.
"Je ne l'ai jamais dit à personne
"mais j'ai couché
avec la mère de mon meilleur ami."
C'est bon, mais je pense
qu'on en revient toujours
au truc des trois mois à vivre.
Attends.
Je crois que je l'ai.
Il a répondu !
"Je devrais probablement pas
te le dire,
"enfin, on se connaît à peine,
"mais tant pis,
je le dis quand même."
Ça y est, mec.
Voilà le "Je t'aime".
- J'aimerais que Stan soit là.
- Stan.
Quoi ?
"J'ai parfois des rêves gay
sur mon meilleur ami."
"J'ai parfois des rêves gays
sur mon meilleur ami."
Pourquoi Ted enverrait des textos,
à une fille qu'il connaît à peine,
où il dit avoir
des rêves gay sur moi ?
Doucement.
Toi ?
Il parle clairement de moi.
Mec, je suis son meilleur ami.
OK, un : Ça n'a jamais été prouvé.
Deux : Si quelqu'un avait des rêves gay
sur l'un d'entre nous,
ce serait sur moi !
Enfin, regarde-moi.
Maintenant, regarde-toi.
Un octogénaire encore dans son placard
ne serait pas dans cet état.
Voilà le truc.
Je suis câlin, toi, pas.
Qui ne voudrait pas faire des câlins
à cette affaire, le dimanche matin ?
Enroulé dans la couette
alors qu'il pleut,
et qu'il y a des muffins dans le four.
Je suis câlin, pétasse.
Faut t'y faire.
Je m'entraîne tous les jours.
S'il y a une chose
qu'on sait sur Ted,
c'est qu'il aime un joli corps.
Ce corps le ferait vibrer.
Ted et moi, on a un vécu.
Je sais ce qu'il aime.
Il y a des trucs que je peux lui faire
qui l'époustoufleraient...
- Pourquoi veut-on coucher avec Ted ?
- Je sais pas. C'est bizarre.
Dingue, non ?
Ted fait des rêves gay sur moi.
Et par "moi", il veut dire
Marshall Eriksen,
star des rêves gay de Ted.
Et alors ?
Donc Ted a des rêves gay
sur l'un d'entre vous.
C'est pas comme s'il lui restait
trois mois à vivre.
Ce serait...
choquant, non ?
Regardez ce mec.
Comment va
mon meilleur ami depuis 12 ans ?
C'est un peu bizarre, mais...
j'ai fait un drôle de rêve, hier.
C'est un peu embarrassant.
Tu peux nous le dire.
C'est une zone sécurisée.
Tes sentiments
sont tout à fait naturels.
Voilà ce qui s'est passé.
<i>Et j'ai gâché une demie-heure</i>
<i>de la vie de ces enfoirés,
à leur parler de ce rêve</i>
<i>où je dîne avec mon top 5
des meilleurs architectes.</i>
Ensuite, à la fin du repas,
Frank Gehry glisse l'addition
à I.M. Pei et dit,
"L'ami, ce soir,
ton nom est Je Paye."
Buckminster Fuller
a failli s'étouffer.
Et je me suis réveillé.
C'est tout ?
Pas d'autres rêves ?
Rien de perturbant ou érotique ?
OK, que dis-tu de ça.
Tu sais qu'un jour dans le futur,
- les machines se rebelleront ?
- Bien sûr.
Donc, les machines...
ont tué tout le monde.
Et il ne reste
que toi,
moi,
et Barney.
Lequel d'entre nous voudrais-tu...
te faire ?
Et...
pourquoi devrais-je
"me faire" l'un de vous ?
Les machines te forcent.
Elles veulent regarder.
C'est comme ça qu'elles s'éclatent.
C'est difficile.
J'imagine que ce serait...
Holly.
Robin m'a tout dit.
C'est pour ça que j'ai tout inventé.
Les gars, voici Holly.
Et j'ai pas attendu
vos trois précieux jours pour appeler.
Je savais où elle bossait
alors je l'ai retrouvée.
Laisse-moi te demander ?
C'était trop tôt ?
J'ai adoré qu'il m'appelle
tout de suite.
C'est très romantique.
Et je ne m'assois pas chez moi
pour lire des magazines d'architecture
en uniforme de pom-pom girl.
Je le fais toute nue.
Holly et moi allons dîner.
Je te retrouve dehors.
Désolé.
On essayait juste de t'aider.
Et aussi, c'était vachement drôle.
J'ai pas besoin d'aide, OK ?
Je peux m'occuper de moi.
Et oui,
peut-être que certaines filles
n'aiment pas qu'on les appelle de suite
ou qu'on en dise trop,
mais devinez ?
Ce sont pas les bonnes pour moi.
Peut-être que la bonne est celle
qui aime que je fasse ça,
parce que...
c'est qui je suis
et je vais pas changer
à cause d'une stupide
Règle des Trois Jours.
Holly épelle son nom avec un "I".
<i>J'avais prouvé que
la Règle des Trois Jours était fausse</i>
<i>et je sortais dîner
avec une jolie fille.</i>
<i>Et jusqu'à ce jour,
je n'ai dit à personne</i>
<i>la vérité sur ce rencard.</i>
C'est drôle !
J'adore aussi la musique indie.
On devrait se marier.
Je rigole.
Ou pas ?
Je rigole encore.
Ça y est.
On va au Brésil ensemble !
J'ai vu mon médecin ce matin,
il m'a dit que tout était réglé,
alors je peux y aller.
Je crois que je t'aime.
<i>Finalement, je n'ai pas eu
à attendre trois jours,</i>
<i>mais Holly aurait vraiment dû.</i>
<i>Comme beaucoup de règles,
il faut parfois les suivre</i>
<i>et parfois pas.</i>
<i>Mais je vous dirai ceci.</i>
<i>Quand j'ai eu le numéro
de votre mère,</i>
<i>je l'ai appelée immédiatement.</i>
Salut, les amis.
- Tu bosses pas ?
- J'ai pris un congé.
- Génial ! On peut s'éclater !
- Je peux pas. J'ai un rencard.
Prête ?
Qu'est-ce que...
Attendez. Vous pouvez pas rester là
et avoir votre rencard avec nous ?
Ouais, ce sera marrant !
Regarde, je rigole ! On s'éclate !
Vous aimez la magie ?
Les amis.
C'est l'heure de se dire au revoir.
On a partagé ensemble
un après-midi spécial
et c'est quelque chose
que je chérirai.
Je ne vous oublierai jamais.
- Tu connais leur nom ?
- Non. Le grand, c'est Ted ?
Non, c'est Marshall.
Marié à Lily.
OK. Tu aimes les chicken wings ?
Great. So, I'll give you a call.
I hope you do.
- Look at this.
- I just got that girl's number.
Check it out. Holly.
Nice.
Girls whose names end
in L-Y are always dirty.
Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily.
Yeah, I know it's true.
And don't even
get me started on girls
whose names should end in Y,
but instead end in I.
Those girls are like
roller coasters.
You got to wait in a long line,
but once you get up there,
you just hold on for dear life
and hope you don't drop your keys.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna call her right now.
I'm gonna do that whole,
"Remember me? It's been so long".
See, it's funny
because I just saw her.
You can't call her.
You have to wait 3 days
to call a woman. That's the rule.
Barney, that rule
is completely played out.
Girls know exactly
what you're doing.
I got a new rule.
It's kind of crazy, but I call it,
you like her, you call her.
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
I don't speak "I never get laid".
Barney, the 3 days rule is insane.
I mean, who even came up with that?
Jesus.
Barney, don't do this.
Not with Jesus.
Seriously.
Jesus started
the whole wait 3 days thing.
He waited 3 days to come back to life.
It was perfect.
If he have only waited one day,
people wouldn't have
even heard that he died.
They'd be all, "Jesus, what up?"
And Jesus would probably be,
like, "What up? I died yesterday".
And then they'd be all,
"You look pretty alive to me, dude".
And then he would have to explain
how he was resurrected
and how it was a miracle.
And then, the dude would be, like,
"Okay, whatever you say, bro".
Ancient dialogue
sounds so stilted now.
And he's not going
to come back on a Saturday.
Everybody's busy doing chores.
Working the loom,
trimming their beards.
No. He waits the exact
right number of days...
Three.
OK, I promise, I'll wait three days.
Just please stop talking.
Plus, it's Sunday,
so everyone's in church already.
They're all in there,
"No, Jesus is dead".
Then, bam! He bursts through
the back door, runs up the aisle.
Everyone's totally psyched.
And, FYI,
that's when
he invented the high-five.
Three days, Ted.
We wait three days to call a woman
because that's how long Jesus
wants us to wait.
True story.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
Okay, fine.
I promise.
I won't call Holly for three days.
<i>But I never said anything
about texting.</i>
<i>I started things off with something
cute and charming.</i>
<i>"I was thinking about you, so I thought
I'd send you a little texty text."</i>
<i>And the moment I hit "Send",
I realized it wasn't cute at all.</i>
<i>It was the lamest thing
anyone has ever said to anyone.</i>
<i>And the worst thing about texting
is that once you send it...</i>
<i>... you can never get it back.</i>
<i>And then... you wait.</i>
<i>And just when you've decided
never to text anyone again...</i>
<i>"I've been thinking about you, too,</i>
<i>"and how weird is it that you texted me
while I was in the bath?"</i>
- What was that?
- What?
- You made a noise.
- That was my phone. I got a text.
Not that. You made
your naked lady noise.
- What?!
- Whenever you see a naked lady,
you make the noise.
- I don't do that.
- Really?
God, sorry, Lily.
<i>While the men are out hunting, </i>
<i>the women of New Guinea's
indigenous Korowai tribe</i>
<i>wash their clothes in the river.</i>
That's totally a boob.
Is that Holly who keeps texting you?
Didn't you promise to wait three days?
To call, yes.
Texting is totally different.
Okay, well, just try to keep
the naked lady noises to a minimum.
I don't make a naked lady noise.
Really?
<i>Holly and I stayed up texting
until 2:00 in the morning.</i>
<i>And we spent the whole next day
texting each other, too.</i>
<i>She seemed perfect.</i>
Holly just told me what she's wearing
right now. It is pretty hot.
Yeah, whatever it is, I can
guarantee you she's not wearing it.
She's lying to make you like her.
How do you know that?
Because no woman
in the history of the world is ever
"just sitting around reading
architecture magazines in my old
"cheerleader uniform."
Okay, maybe she's lying
about the architecture magazines.
- No. This is bad.
- What?
She just sent me a text that was
clearly meant for someone else.
"Baby, I picked up some take-out
from Generro's. Be home soon."
Okay, yes, this sounds bad,
but let's think about this, okay?
It could be for a brother
or maybe her sick dad.
Scroll down.
"And then I want you to
do me on the couch."
Okay, maybe not a sick dad.
Or a very sick dad.
Am I right?
Sorry.
Hey, guys.
God. What is this?
It's some take-out from Generro's.
I'm bringing it home for Lily.
That's weird.
Holly just texted Ted something
about take-out from Generro's.
Wait a second.
You sons of bitches.
What?
You're Holly.
So Ted hasn't been texting
Holly at all?
He's been texting you two?
Look, we knew he'd try to call her
before the three days,
so I swiped his phone, and I changed
her number to my work cell.
We were just gonna bust on him
for calling her too soon, but then he...
started texting her.
"Texty text"?!
Poor, sweet Ted.
We should...
- we should tell him it's us.
- Yeah.
Or...
we pretend we're Holly,
and we're in the bath.
Yeah, that's better.
That was fun.
- We should tell him that it's us.
- Yeah, we should.
Or...
we tell him
our favorite color is red,
and we think the cowboy look
is very sexy.
Yeah, that's better.
I'm wearing them right now,
and they do look sexy.
- He put on the boots!
- He totally put on the boots!
That was awesome!
But it's time to tell him
who he really put those boots on for.
Yeah.
Or...
we just took off our shirt.
Yeah, that's better.
You think maybe we're wearing
a black lace bra underneath?
I don't think we're wearing anything
underneath.
God, we're hot.
Now he's only wearing
the cowboy boots!
- It is on!
- It is so on!
Tell him that we're...
we're slowing slipping out of our...
What are we doing?
I think that we're...
about to have sex with Ted.
So, you did this to him all day?
That's just mean.
No, it was...
it was actually for his own good.
We're protecting him from himself.
He... really likes this girl.
He had that look in his eye.
Yeah, that crazy "I'm about to move
too fast and screw this up" look.
The same look he had
on his first date with you.
We all remember how that went.
- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?
Yeah, well,
I think I was a special case.
This Holly is no Robin Scherbatsky.
What is the deal with her hair?
I mean, news flash:
they make conditioners
that don't leave a buildup.
I'm so bad.
Look, it's been a while
since Ted really liked someone.
He's clearly got a lot of crazy
stored up. We just...
we thought we'd get him
to say "I love you"
before he makes contact
with this girl.
And you can tell it's on the way.
He's exhibiting all the telltale signs.
Yeah. One:
He joked about getting married.
<i>"You like architecture?
We should get married.</i>
<i>"Ha-ha. LOL. Just kidding.
Question mark?"</i>
Two: He made a crazy way
too soon trip suggestion.
<i>"I like beer, too.</i>
<i>"We should totally go
to Germany together.</i>
<i>"LOL. JK. LOL."</i>
And three:
He got way too personal way too soon.
<i>"Yeah, my parents got divorced
a couple years back.</i>
<i>"It was really tough.</i>
"<i>LOL."</i>
And he clearly doesn't know
what LOL means.
Yeah, but here's the real problem.
Ted wasn't saying "I love you"
as easily as we thought he would.
Then we met... Stan.
Why are you making
so much noise, man?
So we explained everything to him,
and when we were done,
something amazing happened.
Why don't you tell Ted
that just knowing he's out there,
thinking about you,
caring about you,
makes you feel safe?
So, all your fears,
all your yesterdays wash away,
and only hope remains
in the promise of his embrace.
Go, Stan.
- Who is this guy?
- A security guard who works nights.
- He eats lunch at MacLaren's every day.
- And he wasn't done.
Not by a long shot.
You make me thank God
for every mistake I ever made
because each one led me down
the path that brought me to you.
That's... really nice, man.
Whatever. It's okay.
<i>"And when we finally come together,</i>
<i>"I want you to hold me.</i>
Hold me all night.
Stroke my hair.
Tell me I'm a woman
and show me you're a man.
Until there there was only now.
You and I...
and now.
You want me to text that to Ted.
I know that.
<i>"I do not ask
of the night explanations.</i>
<i>"I wait for it, and it envelops me,</i>
<i>"and so you and bread</i>
<i>"and light and shadow are."</i>
That's Pablo Neruda.
I don't know...
what bread was doing in there,
but that touched me here
and here.
Well, if Ted won't say it, I will.
I love you.
That's cool.
Still nothing, huh?
Maybe he's not in love with us.
How can he not be in love with us?
We're everything he's looking for.
I don't get men.
Got to head to work.
Will you be...
Will you be back?
I'll be back when the wind
and fates and chance bring me back.
Which will be tomorrow.
It's cheese steak day.
It sounds like
you were all over this guy.
Hope his girlfriend
didn't get jealous.
Did he mention a girlfriend or...?
It was all going great
until Marshall sent Ted
a text meant for Lily
- and ruined everything.
- It doesn't matter.
Okay? It's over now.
I got to get going,
but here's what's gonna happen:
You're going to call him right now,
tell him what you did,
and apologize.
You got it?
Or...
Holly explained everything.
It was all just a misunderstanding.
Everything's great now.
Really?
How did Holly explain
her way out of that one?
Apparently,
her dumb friend Marsha
accidentally used her phone
- to text her husband Billy.
- Marsha and Billy.
No one sprained any muscles there.
And now we are better than ever.
Look, I know this sounds crazy,
but I think I might actually
be falling for this girl.
You're falling
for Barney and Marshall.
- What?
- They didn't believe
that you could wait the 3 days,
so Barney changed her number
in your phone to his work cell.
Holly is Barney and Marshall.
Wait. That whole time it was them?
So Holly wasn't in the bath?
Or sitting by her window, looking up
at the stars, thinking about me?
Or lounging
in her old cheerleader uniform
reading architecture magazines?
Yeah. I don't think
they actually did those things.
They were just at the bar.
Right.
But, it was them.
- Unbelievable.
- I know.
So you might as well tell them
you're on to them.
Or...
I text them something
that will really mess with their heads.
Oh, I gotcha.
How about...
"I haven't told any
of my friends yet,
but I only have three months
to live"?
Not bad.
How about "I once killed a man
with a shovel,
and those feelings
are creeping up again"?
I liked that thing
someone said before
about having three months to live.
How about "I never told anyone this,
but I slept
with my best friend's mom"?
That is good, but I feel
like we keep coming back
to that three months to live thing.
Wait.
I think I got it.
He texted back!
"I probably shouldn't tell you this.
"I mean we barely know each other.
"But what the hell,
I'll just say it."
This is it, dude.
Here comes the "I love you."
- I wish Stan were here.
- Stan.
What?
"I sometimes have gay dreams
about my best friend."
"I sometimes have gay dreams
about my best friend."
Why in the world would Ted text
a girl he barely knows
that he sometimes has gay dreams
about me?
Slow your roll.
You?
He's clearly talking about me.
Dude, it's me.
I'm his best friend.
Okay, one:
that has never been proven.
Two:
If anyone were to have gay dreams
about one of us, it would be me.
I mean, look at me.
Now look at you.
A still-in-the-closet 80-year-old
wouldn't be into that mess.
Here's the thing, Barney.
I'm snuggly. You're not.
Who wouldn't want to snuggle up next
to this business
on a Sunday morning?
Wrapped in a comforter,
and it's raining outside,
and there's muffins warming in the oven.
I'm cuddly, bitch.
Deal with it.
I work out every day.
If there is one thing
we know about Ted,
it's that he likes a nice body.
This body would rock his world.
Ted and I have a history.
I know what he likes.
There are things I could do to him
that would blow his mind...
- Why do we want to have sex with Ted?
- I don't know. It's weird.
Crazy, right?
Ted's having gay dreams about me.
And by me, he means M-E,
Marshall Eriksen,
star of Ted's gay dreams.
Who cares?
So Ted has gay dreams
about one of you guys.
It's not like you found out
he has three months to live.
That's like... shocking, right?
Look at this guy.
How's it going best friend
of 12 years?
Well, it's kind of weird, but...
I had this crazy dream the other night.
It's a little embarrassing.
You can tell us, Ted.
This is a safe space.
Yeah, your feelings are
perfectly natural, buddy.
Here's what happened.
<i>And then I proceed
to waste a half hour</i>
<i>of those bastards' lives,
telling them about this dream</i>
<i>I had where I ate dinner with my top 5
favorite architects throughout history.</i>
And then, at the end of the meal,
Frank Gehry slides the check
over to I.M. Pei, and he says,
"Buddy, tonight,
your name is I.M. Paying."
Buckminster Fuller
almost did a spit take.
And then I woke up.
So, that's it?
No other dreams?
Nothing confusing or erotic?
Okay, how about this? You know
how at some point in the future,
- machines will rise up against us?
- Sure.
So, the machines...
they've killed everybody,
and all that's left
is you,
me,
and Barney.
Which one of us would you, like...
get with?
And...
why do I have
to get with one of you?
The machines are forcing you.
They want to watch.
That's just how they get down.
That's a tough one.
I guess it would have to be...
Holly.
Robin told me what you guys did.
That's why I made up the gay
dreams thing. Guys, this is Holly.
And I didn't wait your precious
three days to call her.
I knew where she worked,
so I tracked her down.
Let me ask you.
Did I call you too soon?
I loved that he called me
right away.
I found it very romantic.
And I don't sit around my apartment
reading architecture magazines
in my old cheerleader uniform.
I do that completely naked.
So Holly and I
are going out to dinner.
I'll meet you out front.
I'm sorry, buddy.
We were just trying to help you.
And, also, it was really fun.
I don't need your help, okay?
I can take care of myself.
And, yeah, maybe...
maybe there are some girls
who wouldn't like it
that I called them right away
or said things too soon,
but guess what?
Those aren't the right girls for me.
Maybe the right girl is the one
who loves that I do those things
because...
that's just who I am,
and I'm not gonna change
because of some stupid
Three Days Rule.
Holly spells her name with an "I".
<i>So I had proven
that the Three Days Rule was wrong,</i>
<i>and I was out to dinner
with a pretty girl.</i>
<i>And until right now,
I've never told anyone</i>
<i>the truth about what happened
on that date.</i>
That's so funny!
I love indie music, too.
We should get married.
Just kidding.
Or am I?
Just kidding again.
That's it. We're totally going
to Brazil together!
And I went to my doctor this morning,
and he said it is all cleared up,
so I'm good to go.
I think I'm in love with you.
<i>In the end, I didn't need
to wait three days,</i>
<i>but Holly really, really did.</i>
<i>Like a lot of rules,
there are times to follow them</i>
<i>and times to not.</i>
<i>But I will tell you this.</i>
<i>When I got your mother's number,</i>
<i>I called her right away.</i>
Hey, fellas.
- Aren't you working?
- Took the night off.
- That's great! We can all hang out!
- Yeah. I can't. Got a date.
You ready, baby?
What the...?
Wait, wait. Couldn't you guys
just stay here and do your date with us?
Yeah, it'll be fun!
Look, I'm laughing!
It's fun here! You like magic?
Fellas, it's time we said good-bye.
I mean, we shared a very special
afternoon together,
and that's something
I will always cherish.
I'll never forget you guys.
- Do you know their names?
- No idea. Is the tall one Ted?
No. That's Marshall.
He's married to Lily.
Okay. You like chicken wings?
<i>En mai 2009,
j'ťtais sur le point d'avoir</i>
<i>mon premier gros client
en tant qu'architecte indťpendant.</i>
<i>J'ťtais prÍt ŗ tout
pour que Áa arrive.</i>
Voilŗ ce qu'on veut, fiston.
C'est trŤs simple.
On ouvre un restaurant
qui s'appelle Rib Town
et on veut qu'il ait la forme...
d'un chapeau de cowboy.
<i>Tout.</i>
Un chapeau ?
C'est brillant.
J'adore !
Rien de mieux pour dire "dťlicieux"
que l'intťrieur d'un chapeau de cowboy.
Je vous le dis, je suis votre homme.
Je pense Ítre nť
pour dessiner ce b‚timent.
Je...
Je le vois.
Je le vois pas. Je le vois pas.
- Qu'est-ce que Áa a de bien ?
- Nuit blanche ?
Je leur ai dit
que j'avais une vision pour ce truc.
Ils veulent un dessin dans une semaine
et j'ai rien !
- C'est mignon.
- Mignon ?
Je pourrais dessiner
des salles de concert et des ponts.
Des ponts si beaux
qu'ils pourraient Ítre dans des musťes.
Et je pourrais dessiner ces musťes.
Mais je dessine quoi, ŗ la place ?
Oý en est ma carriŤre ?
Un Stetson de deux ťtages...
avec une terrasse sur le bord.
C'est une blague cosmique.
L'univers conspire contre moi.
T'as juste besoin de sortir.
Fais un tour. Paie-toi un bagel.
Ouais, Áa va tout rťsoudre.
J'ai pas dormi depuis 34 heures,
mais un bagel est la rťponse.
Un bagel cannelle et raisins
avec un peu de crŤme.
«a a l'air bon.
Je vais m'en acheter un.
Prends un parapluie.
Il va pleuvoir,
d'aprŤs Galoshes, notre clown-mťtťo.
Ton ťmission a un clown
pour prťsenter la mťtťo ?
C'est un peu nase, non ?
Et ce restaurant que tu dessines,
il a quelle forme, Hoss ?
D'accord. Tu veux me virer d'ici,
je sors.
Je suis impatient de voir
ce que l'univers m'a prťparť.
<i>Les enfants, je vous raconte l'histoire

C'est une intoxication.
J'ai mangť quelque chose au resto,

T'es enceinte ?
Ouais, je suis enceinte.
Pourquoi tu me dis pas

Je dis rien.

Tu veux vraiment savoir ?

Elle est sŻrement retouchťe.
- J'ai rendez-vous avec.
- Tu es mon hťros ! C'est vrai ?

AprŤs que Barney m'ait racontť Áa,
j'ai revu les chiffres et...
j'ai quelques graphiques.
Barney drague environ
20 filles par semaine.
C'est bien plus que 20.
B. Prťcis ne fait rien d'approximatif.
Disons 20.
Donc, 20 filles par semaine,
Áa fait 1 040 filles par an.
Dans ses 16 ans d'activitť sexuelle,
Áa voudrait dire
qu'il a draguť 16 640 filles.
S'il a couchť avec 199,
c'est un taux de rťussite...
lťgŤrement supťrieur
ŗ un pour cent.
C'est une moyenne de frappe de 12,
8 fois pire
que la moyenne en carriŤre...
du lanceur ŗ une main,
du lanceur... Jim Abbott.
Jaloux.
Jaloux.
Hťros.
Bizarrement muette
pendant cette conversation
sur son nombre de partenaires sexuels.
Hťros.
Le total gťnťral,
c'est le seul nombre qui compte.
- Qui l'a dit ?
- Matthew Panning,
le tombeur
du collŤge de Port Richmond.
Stinson, t'es un amateur.
Je parie que tu l'as jamais fait.
Toi non plus.
Combien de fois je dois te le dire ?
Je l'ai fait avec 100 filles.
Des cinquiŤmes
ŗ l'ťcole de mon cousin ŗ Long Island.
Tu sais quoi, Matthew ?
Un jour, je l'aurais fait avec 200.
Appelle-moi quand Áa arrivera.
Et je vais l'appeler.
Je crois
qu'il va le redire trŤs lentement.
Je vais...
l'appeler.
Tu as notť Gaby Allan en double,
en 78 et en 162.
Quoi ? Fais-moi voir.
Soixante...
Une fois. Oh mon Dieu.
Attends...
J'ai comptť la mÍme fille deux fois ?
«a veut dire
que je suis seulement ŗ 198 ?
«a signifie juste que t'es 0.5 %
moins dťgoŻtant qu'on pensait.
Je dois sťduire
un top model tchŤque dans 2 heures.
Je ne peux pas gaspiller Áa en 199e.
- Petra doit Ítre la 200e.
- Tu vas faire quoi ?
Tu trouveras pas une partenaire
dans les 2 prochaines heures.
Astronaute millionnaire.
Tu viens chez moi
- voir des coquillages ?
- Dťgage.
Je viens de la tombe de ma femme.
Je l'ai enterrťe il y a un juste an.
Elle me manque.
J'ai besoin de rťconfort.
T'es flippant.
T'en as pas marre de tous ces jeux ?
Je veux juste m'installer
et avoir une armťe de bambins,
tout de suite.
J'ai une masse
et j'adore m'en servir.
Sachant comme c'est important pour moi,
tu penses que Lily...
- Je ferais tout le boulot...
- Je te tuerai.
D'accord.
Oý est allť Barney ?
«a fait plus d'une heure.
Tu sais,
en regardant les noms de cette liste,
je ne vois pas beaucoup
de diversitť ethnique.
Il devrait vraiment
se remettre en question.
C'est fait.
199 de faites, plus qu'une.
Tu as fini ton verre ?
C'est mieux.
Il t'est arrivť quoi ?
Il y a...
une fille ŗ la salle de sport.
Pauline. Elle me court aprŤs
depuis un moment.
- Pourquoi attendre jusque-lŗ ?
- C'est pas vraiment mon type.
C'est bien, Pauline.
Tu vas tous les avoir
au Leveuse de Fonte Classic
ŗ Sarasota cet automne.
Je pensais...
ŗ toi et moi.
Et si t'es toujours intťressťe...
- OK, c'est l'heure de la cardio.
- Bon sang ! Maman !
Chaque centimŤtre
avait le goŻt de boeuf rŰti
et de crťatine.
Mais je l'ai fait.
Je l'ai fait et il me reste 30 min
avant de rencontrer Petra.
Robin, tu aurais du fond de teint ?
Je voudrais couvrir
des contusions et le feu du rasoir.
- Je dťteste t'annoncer Áa, mais...
- Quoi ?
Tu as bien comptť
Gaby Allan deux fois,
mais... t'es aussi passť
du 138 au 138.
T'as utilisť
deux fois le mÍme nombre.
Donc Áa veut dire...
Pauline n'est pas la 199e,
elle est la 200e ?
Fťlicitations !
«a devait Ítre Petra !
Petra devait Ítre la 200e !
Spendide, fťminine,
"sans ceinture de force au lit", Petra !
Allez ! T'es arrivť ŗ 200.
Tu devrais Ítre fier.
Tu devrais Ítre testť,
mais tu devrais Ítre fier.
On se fiche si Pauline ne pose pas
en bikini dans des magazines.
Elle le fait.
Elle va Ítre
dans le prochain <i>Muscle Sexxy</i>.
Et comme beaucoup de femmes
dans ce magazine,
Sexxy a deux X et un Y.
<i>Et donc, sur le chemin du bagel,</i>
<i>je me suis arrÍtť une minute

Fran, je ne veux pas vous embÍter,
mais j'ai une prťsentation demain
et Áa m'aiderait si je pouvais avoir
des tableaux et des graphiques.
- Pouvez-vous m'aider ?
- C'est le service des graphiques.
On peut faire
tous les graphiques, tableaux,
en toutes couleurs
sur le papier que vous voulez.
On va bien s'amuser.
J'ai classť les prťsidents

Et oý ils se rejoignent :

C'est un camembert

Et Áa, c'est un graphique

Qui y a-t-il ?
«a suffit les tableaux.
Et les graphiques.
Toute reprťsentation visuelle
de donnťes.
Je suis pas idiot.
Je sais ce que vous pensez
de mes tableaux et graphiques.
En fait, j'ai fait un tableau
de vos rťactions ŗ mes tableaux.
Voyons Áa.
Oui, c'est vrai,
depuis Cťcilia,
votre intťrÍt pour mes tableaux
n'arrÍte pas de chuter.
Mais d'aprŤs les rťcentes tendances,
j'ai aussi fait...
un tableau de projection !
Et regardez...
un gros pic d'intťrÍt arrive !
Et ce n'est pas
juste un soubresaut de chat mort.
C'est une croissance
soutenue ŗ long terme.
C'est toi, la croissance soutenue.
Alors, j'ai prťparť
quelques tableaux
pour montrer comment la mise en place
d'une sociťtť-ťcran aux Bermudes
pourrait minimiser
nos pertes du 2e trimestre.
Et vous ťviter la prison.
Pour commencer...
Vous m'excusez un instant ?
- Mosbius Designs.
- Qu'est-il arrivť ŗ mes tableaux ?
- On les a jetťs.
- Quoi ?
C'est Áa, une intervention.
T'arrÍtais pas de consommer,
alors on a jetť ta came.
Allez, Ted !
Il me faut mes tableaux !
Rien qu'aujourd'hui
et je promets de jamais plus en faire.
Je subis beaucoup de pression.
Il me faut mes tableaux, Jack !
Tu fais des tableaux au travail ?
C'est pour le travail, idiot !
Je fais une grande prťsentation
et si j'ai pas ces tableaux,
je vais me faire virer !
Merde.
Bouge pas.
Je te les amŤne.
Magne ! Je vais chercher
comment les faire patienter.
Dťsolť, il y a un peu de retard
avec les tableaux.
Mais on va commencer
dans un instant.
Les poissons sont bizarres, non ?
Je veux dire,
c'est quoi, leur problŤme ?
Tableaux ! Achetez vos tableaux !
Excuse-moi, Milt ?
Je pense que ce sont mes tableaux.
Ces tableaux ?
Sur ma couverture ?
C'est aussi ma couverture.
On verra Áa plus tard.
- Mais j'ai besoin de ces tableaux.
- «a tombe bien, ils sont ŗ vendre.
D'accord, combien ?
Un million.
- Je t'en donne cinq dollars.
- Un million.
Personne ne payera un million
pour ces tableaux !
Un million.
OK, Milt, t'as gagnť.
Je te donnerai un million.
Je t'urine...
Le problŤme,
c'est que le distributeur...
La machine temporelle alien...
La machine temporelle alien

Voilŗ ce que je vais faire.
Je te donne un dollar...
par jour...
pendant un million de jours.
«a fait...
«a fait 2700 ans.
«a marche !
Gros nase.
Pardon,

CommenÁons.
<i>Si je n'avais pas rachetť
ces tableaux pour Marshall,</i>

Mon Dieu !
C'est beaucoup trop.
Enfin... c'est dťgoŻtant.
T'as pensť ŗ consulter

Tu es le candidat parfait.
T'as pensť ŗ consulter

D'un coup, tes 100 filles en cinquiŤme,
c'est plus si impressionnant.
100 filles ?
C'est de Áa qu'il s'agit ?
J'ai menti !
Mais bien sŻr.
J'avais 12 ans,
bien sŻr que je mentais.
J'avais pas non plus

Mais bien sŻr.

Bonne chance, j'imagine.
Je suis gťnial.
200.
Et maintenant ?
<i>In May of 2009,
I was on the verge of scoring</i>
<i>my first big client
as an independent architect.</i>
<i>I was willing to do anything
to make it happen.</i>
Here's what we want, son.
It's real simple.
We're opening a restaurant
called Rib Town
and we want it to be shaped
like a cowboy hat.
<i>Anything.</i>
A cowboy hat?
That's brilliant.
I love it!
I mean, nothing says delicious
like the inside of a cowboy hat, right?
Look, I'm telling you, I'm your guy.
I think I was born
to design this building.
I just...
I see it.
I don't see it. I don't see it.
I don't see it.
What's so good about it?
Up all night?
I told these guys
I have a vision for this thing.
They want to see a pitch
in a week and I got nothing.
- It's cute.
- Cute?
I could be designing concert halls
and bridges.
Bridges so beautiful
they could be in museums.
And I could design those museums.
But what am I designing instead?
What has my career come to?
A two-story Stetson
with outdoor dining on the brim.
It's a sick cosmic joke.
The universe
is conspiring against me.
You just need to get out of the house.
Take a walk. Get a bagel.
Yeah, that'll solve everything.
I haven't slept for 34 hours,
but a bagel is the answer.
A cinnamon raisin bagel
with a little cream cheese.
That sounds pretty good,
I'm going to get a bagel.
Bring an umbrella.
It's supposed to rain,
according to Galoshes,
our weather clown.
Your show has a clown
who does the weather?
That's a little cheesy, no?
And what's that restaurant
you're designing shaped like, Hoss?
Fine.
You want me out of the house,
I'll get out of the house.
Can't wait to see what the universe
has lined up for me out there.
<i>Kids, I've been telling you
the story of how I met your mother.</i>
<i>And while there's many things
to learn from this story,</i>
<i>this may be the biggest.</i>
<i>The great moments of your life
won't necessarily be the things you do.</i>
<i>They'll also be the things
that happen to you.</i>
<i>I'm not saying you can't take action
to affect the outcome of your life.</i>
<i>You have to take action,
and you will.</i>
<i>But never forget that, on any day,</i>
<i>you could step out the front door
and your whole life can change forever.</i>
<i>You see,
the universe has a plan, kids,</i>
<i>and that plan is always in motion.</i>
<i>A butterfly flaps its wings...</i>
<i>and it starts to rain.</i>
<i>It's a scary thought.
But it's also kind of wonderful.</i>
<i>All these little parts of the machine
constantly working,</i>
<i>making sure that you end up
exactly where you're supposed to be,</i>
<i>exactly when you're supposed
to be there.</i>
<i>The right place...
at the right time.</i>
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
<i>Kids, it's a miracle
that I ended up on that street corner.</i>
<i>Especially when you consider how easy
it would have been not to end up there.</i>
<i>I mean, when I first
stepped out of the apartment,</i>
<i>I almost went right instead of left.</i>
<i>Why didn't I go right?</i>
<i>To answer that,
we have to go back a few days.</i>
<i>As you know, back then,
your Aunt Robin hosted a morning show.</i>
Now Eunice here
makes all of these purses herself.
They're hand embroidered
with the world's finest silk.
And each one takes months to make.
I cannot emphasize
how much work goes into...
Go to weather, you idiot.
Hey, everybody.
We got a high pressure system
coming in from the west and...
On the plus side,
I bought the cutest purse today.
So, wait, why did you throw up?
- You don't want to know.
- Come on. Tell me.
I'm pregnant.
I will raise this child with you.
You are not alone in this.
We can even get married if you want,
but I still want to see other girls,
- it would've to be one of those kind...
- God, stop it.
I'm not pregnant.
It's food poisoning.
I ate something from this place,
and three hours later,
I was spewing like an open hydrant.
- God. From where?
- Well, that's a gross question.
No, where was the food from?
- I don't want to tell you.
- What?
Go to YouTube. Put in
"Robin Scherbatsky morning show vomit"
Robin, home so soon.
Someone already put it on YouTube?
Yeah... Someone.
So...
Why you been throwing up? You pregnant?
Yeah, Barney. I'm pregnant.
So, wait, why won't you tell me
where you got food poisoning?
You love this place.
If I tell you, it'll just ruin it.
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.
Don't tell me.
Is it that Indian place where the cat
jumps on all the tables?
I'm not saying.
- That Spanish place with baby's crib?
- I'm not saying.
God, no.
Is it this place?
Tell me, damn you!
- You really want to know?
- Yes!
It's Schlegel's Bagels.
Why did you tell me that?
Schlegel's?
Thanks a lot, Robin.
Now I'm gonna have to try to find
another place in NY
that serves bagels.
<i>So, you see, kids, if I had gone
to Schlegel's Bagels as usual,</i>
<i>I would have taken a right.</i>
<i>I would have gotten a bagel...</i>
<i>gone home,
worked on the old hat building,</i>
<i>and you kids
might never have been born.</i>
<i>But I turned left instead, to go
to my second-favorite bagel place</i>
<i>and the rest is history.</i>
<i>Of course, I stopped
at that magazine stand on the way.</i>
<i>Why did I stop there?
Here's why.</i>
<i>Bro's Life</i> magazine.
Page 83.
Check it.
"What your paintball gun says
about your personality"?
Below that.
"That last five pounds:
How to get her to lose them."
Above that.
Petra Petrova.
<i>Bro's Life</i> magazine's
girl of the year for may.
A delicate flower in stiletto pumps
and leopard panties,
straddling an ATV.
These magazines are so lame. I mean,
she's probably airbrushed and enhanced.
- I have a date with her.
- You are my hero! Are you serious?
- How do you have a date with her?
- Not part of the story.
Ted, I have been waiting
a long time to say this.
This girl is the one.
Of course she's the one.
You have to marry those.
Her.
Marry?
I have something much,
much more special in mind.
Petra here, if all goes well,
will be my...
wait for it, two hundredth.
Sorry, I couldn't wait.
It's all exciting.
Your two hundredth,
as in "sex with"?
As in "sex with."
I request the highest of fives.
Not if I was wearing a HazMat suit.
200 is too many.
Right, 'cause there can be
too many of something wonderful.
"Babe Ruth, easy, big fella.
Let's not hit too many homers."
"Steve Guttenberg, maybe just make
three Police Academy movies.
"America's laughed enough."
Who are these girls?
That was rhetorical.
Don't show me the list.
199 satisfied customers.
Anyway, the big night is Thursday.
I'm having a celebratory soirée
beforehand at MacLaren's.
Prepare a toast.
Black tie optional, but preferred.
Gifts are, look, I would say
unnecessary, but follow your heart.
200's too many.
- It's not too many.
- It's too many!
- It's not too many.
- Thank you.
No, don't get me wrong.
You're disgusting, and the cops should
probably clamp a boot on your genitals,
but that number should be higher.
After Barney told me about all this,
I crunched the numbers and,
well...
I had some charts made up.
Barney here
hits on roughly 20 girls a week.
It's way more than 20.
And B. Smooth don't do nothing roughly.
Let's say 20.
So, 20 girls a week means
1,040 girls a year.
In Barney's 16 years
of sexual activity,
that means he's hit on 16,640 girls.
Now, if he's bedded 199 of them,
that is a success rate of...
a little over one percent.
That's a batting average of 12,
eight times worse than
the career batting average of...
one-handed pitcher, that's right,
pitcher... Jim Abbott.
Jealous.
Jealous.
Hero.
Suspiciously quiet
during this conversation
about number of sex partners. Hero.
It's the grand total.
That's the only number that matters.
- Says who?
- Matthew Panning,
the stud of Port Richmond
Middle School.
Stinson, you're such a dweeb-o.
I bet you never
even done it with a girl.
Neither have you.
How many times do I have
to explain this?
I've done it with 100 girls.
They're seventh graders
at my cousin's school on Long Island.
Well, you know what, Matthew?
Someday, I'm gonna do it with 200.
Yeah.
Call me when that happens.
And call him I will.
I think he's gonna say it again
really slow.
Call him...
I will.
You listed Gaby Allan twice,
as 78 and 162.
What? Let me see.
Seventy...
Once. Oh, my God.
Wait a...
I counted the same girl twice?
That means I'm only at one 198?
That only means that you're half
a percent less gross than we thought.
I'm seducing
a Czech supermodel in two hours.
I can't squander that on 199.
Petra has to be 200.
What are you gonna do? It's not
like you're gonna find someone new
to have sex with
in the next two hours.
Hi, millionaire astronaut.
Want to come back to my place
- and see some moon shells?
- Go away.
I just got back from my wife's grave.
Put her in the ground a year ago today.
Man, I miss her.
I sure could use some comfort.
You're creepy.
Man, aren't you sick of all the games?
I just want to settle down
and have a gaggle
of rug rats, like, right now.
I have Mace, and I enjoy using it.
Knowing how important this is to me,
do you think Lily would even consider...
- By the way, I would do all the work...
- I will end your life.
Right.
Where'd Barney go?
It's been over an hour.
You know,
looking over the names on this list,
I'm not sensing a lot
of ethnic diversity.
He should really look
at that in himself.
All done.
199 down, one more to go.
You done with your drink?
There's the stuff.
What the hell happened to you?
So, there's this girl at my gym...
Pauline... she's been
after me for some time.
- Why'd you wait until now?
- She's not exactly my type.
Looking good, Pauline.
You are gonna rip it up
at the Women's Pumping Iron
Classic in Sarasota this fall.
I was thinking about you and me
and if you're still interested...
- Okay, blondie, time for Mama's cardio!
- Geez! Mommy!
Every inch of her
tasted like roast beef and creatine.
But I did it.
I did it and I still have 30 minutes
before I'm supposed to meet Petra.
Robin, do you have
any concealer handy?
I'd really like to cover up
some bruises and razor burn.
- I hate to break this to you, but...
- What?
Well, you did count
Gaby Allan twice,
but... you also went
from 138 to 138.
You used the same number twice.
Wait, so, that means...
Pauline wasn't 199, Pauline was 200?
Congratulations!
No... That was supposed to be Petra!
Petra was supposed to be 200!
Gorgeous, feminine, "Doesn't wear
a weight belt in bed," Petra!
Hey, come on.
You made it to 200.
You should be proud.
You should be tested,
but you should be proud.
Who cares if Pauline doesn't
pose for bikini pictures in magazines?
Actually, she does.
She's gonna be in next week's
issue of <i>Muscle Sexxy</i>.
And like many of the ladies
in that magazine,
Sexxy has two X's and one Y.
<i>And so, on my way to get a bagel,</i>
<i>I stopped at a newsstand
for a full minute</i>
<i>to check out a picture
of Barney's 200th.</i>
<i>If I hadn't done that,</i>
<i>I would've walked right
by the newsstand,</i>
<i>cut down 77th and gotten to
that corner a minute early.</i>
<i>I would've gotten the bagel,
done some work,</i>
<i>and you kids might
never have been born.</i>
<i>Now, why did I cut down 77th,</i>
<i>and give a dollar to the homeless guy?
Here's why.</i>
<i>Back when Marshall first started working
at Goliath National Bank...</i>
Fran, I don't mean to bother you
but I have a big presentation tomorrow
and it would really help if I could get
like some charts and graphs made up.
- Could you help me with that?
- This is the graphics department.
We can make as many graphs,
as many charts in as many colors
on as many kinds
of paper as you want.
We are gonna have some fun.
I've ranked the Presidents
in order of how dirty their names sound.
One: Johnson.
Two: Bush.
Three: Harding.
Four: Polk.
This circle represents
"People Who Are Breaking My Heart..."
and this circle represents
"People Who Are Shaking
My Confidence Daily."
And where they overlap:
Cecilia.
This is a pie chart
describing my favorite bars.
And this is a bar graph
describing my favorite pies.
What's going on?
Enough with the charts.
And the graphs.
Really any visual
representation of data.
I'm not an idiot.
I know how you guys feel
about my charts and my graphs.
As a matter of fact, I've made a chart
of your reaction to my charts.
Let's take a look.
Yes, it is true,
since Cecelia,
your interest in my charts
has been steadily dropping.
But based on recent trends,
I have also made...
A projection chart!
And look...
huge spike in interest coming!
And this isn't just
some dead cat bounce.
This is big sustainable growth
over the long term.
You're a big sustainable growth.
So, I have prepared a few charts
to demonstrate how setting up
a shell corporation in Bermuda
could help minimize
our second quarter losses.
And save you all some jail time.
To begin with...
Could you just please excuse me?
- Mosbius Designs.
- What the hell happened to my charts?
- We threw them away.
- What?
That's how an intervention works.
You wouldn't stop using,
so, we flushed your stash.
Come on, Ted!
I need my charts, man!
Just for today and then I promise
I will never ever use charts again.
I'm under at lot of pressure here.
I need my charts, Jack!
My God, you're doing charts at work?
They're for work, you idiot!
I'm giving a big presentation right now
and if I don't have
those charts I'm gonna get fired!
Crap.
Stay right there.
I'll bring them to you.
Hurry up! I'll try to think
of a way to stall them.
I'm sorry but there's been
a little delay with the charts.
But we will get started
in just a minute.
Fish are weird, right?
I mean what's up with fish?
Charts! Get your charts here!
Excuse me, Milt?
I think those are my charts.
These charts?
On my blanket?
That's also my blanket.
We'll get to that later.
- But I really need these charts.
- Good, 'cause they're for sale.
Fine, how much?
One million dollars.
- I'll give you five bucks.
- A million dollars.
No one's gonna pay
a million dollars for these charts!
One million dollars.
Okay, Milt, you win.
I'm gonna give you
one million dollars.
Urinating...
The problem is, the ATM...
The alien time machine.
The alien time machine
has a withdrawal limit.
So, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you one dollar
a day
for a million days.
That's...
That's 2700 years.
Deal!
Sucker.
I'm sorry, is there a land bass
I don't know about?
Let's get started.
<i>And so, if I hadn't bought
those charts back for Marshall,</i>
<i>I wouldn't have had to cut down 77th</i>
<i>to give Milt his daily dollar</i>
<i>and well, you know the rest.</i>
<i>So, there you have it, kids.
There's a lot of little reasons</i>
<i>why the big things
in our lives happen.</i>
<i>If I had known then where
all those little things were leading me,</i>
<i>and how grateful
I'd be to get there,</i>
<i>well, I probably
would've done something</i>
<i>like this.</i>
<i>Because somehow, I ended up
in the right place at the right time.</i>
<i>And, as a result,</i>
<i>my life would never be the same.</i>
<i>The next day, Uncle Barney
finally confronted Matthew Panning,</i>
<i>the stud of Port Richmond
Middle School.</i>
So, Barney, great to hear
from you after all this time.
- What's been going on?
- I've had sex with 200 women.
God!
That's way too many.
I mean, that's just gross.
Have you sought counseling
for sex addiction?
Because you're a prime candidate.
Have you sought counseling
for I win you lose?
Yeah, suddenly those 100 girls
you nailed in the seventh grade
aren't so impressive.
100 girls?
Is that what this is about?
Barney, I lied.
Sure you did.
I was 12... of course I was lying.
I didn't have a pet Ewok either.
Sure you didn't.
Your whole adult life
has been built around...
something I lied about
when I was 12?
Jealous?
Look, I gotta go pick
my kids up at school.
It sounds like you got
a lot of problems.
Good luck, I guess.
I'm awesome.
200.
Now what?

<i>Les enfants, Stella était la fille
avec qui je pensais finir ma vie.</i>
<i>Avant qu'elle me quitte sur l'autel,
en me brisant le coeur.</i>
<i>Donc, quand je l'ai croisée
7 mois après,</i>
<i>je n'avais qu'une chose à lui dire.</i>
- Content de te revoir !
- Moi aussi.
Et Tony !
Quelle bonne surprise.
"Quelle bonne surprise" ?
Non, une bonne surprise aurait été
qu'un coffre tombe de 40 étages
et les écrase tous les deux.
Tu t'es laissé faire ?
On a eu une discussion amicale
et on a repris nos chemins respectifs.
T'as merdé.
Il a merdé, non ?
- Bien joué, monsieur.
- Bravo.
- Quoi ?
- Tu sais,
Ted l'a joué cool,
c'est exactement ce qu'il devait faire.
En fait,
je dirais que sur une échelle de...
Et j'ai gardé ton pull...
et parfois,
je m'assieds dans la baignoire
pendant des heures pour,
tu sais, le sentir.
... jusqu'à...
C'est ma nouvelle fiancée.
C'est Stella,
sauf qu'elle est française
et, comme tu le vois,
elle a d'énormes seins.
<i>Enchantée.</i>
<i>Enchanté.</i>
- Pour moi, t'as été génial.
- Je dirais même plus.
Vous, monsieur,
avez fait réfléchir Stella.
"Ted avait l'air si cool aujourd'hui.
Est-ce que j'ai choisi le mauvais ?"
Attends une semaine.
Tu l'auras sur le dos.
Et sur le ventre.
T'as senti ça ?
Il y a eu un séisme de "tope là".
Je la veux pas sur le dos.
Ou sur le ventre.
Je veux avancer.
Et c'était une étape
importante vers ça.
Au futur.
<i>Et vous savez,
je le pensais vraiment.</i>
<i>Mais quand même, cette nuit,
mon esprit a divagué.</i>
- J'ai fait une terrible erreur.
- Je sais.
Je suis mieux que toi.
Carrément.
Ressortons ensemble
et couchons encore plus.
Vendu !
Salut, Ted.

Non, entre.
C'est pas du tout bizarre.
Je savais que c'était mal
de voler la fiancée de quelqu'un.
Je m'y suis fait.
Je pouvais plus dormir.
Et pas pour les bonnes raisons.
Parfois pour les bonnes raisons.
Stella et moi,
on s'était pas vus depuis 5 ans,
donc tu peux imaginer, au début,
c'était rapide et intense.
Lampes cassées, les meubles déplacés.
Tu vois cette zone chauve ?
Peu importe, on a tourné la page.
Moi, Lucy, Stella,
on allait déménager à L.A.
J'allais devenir scénariste.
Puis, on t'a croisé,
et t'avais l'air si...
triste.
Triste ? Non.
Je crois que ce que tu appelles
tristesse n'était qu'une...
nonchalance joviale.
Tu vas mal, OK ?
Comme un petit teckel
avec un mal de dos qui doit
se faire balader dans un sac.
Pourquoi t'es là ?
Je sais que je peux être un peu dur,
mais je ne peux pas supporter
de t'avoir autant blessé.
Le destin m'a mis dans cette rue
pour arranger ça.
Manifestement,
je peux pas remplir le cratère
- laissé par Stella dans ton coeur.
- J'ai rencontré plein de filles.
Et je sais que tu as été viré.
Je suis passé
à la gestion d'une petite entreprise.
- C'est le poumon de l'économie.
- Non.
Ted, ma famille a beaucoup d'argent.
Et je veux utiliser cet argent
pour arranger ça avec toi.
Tony est riche ?
Dis-moi qu'il t'a fait un chèque.
Dis-moi qu'il t'a fait
un très gros chèque.
Si gros qu'il enlève pas sa chemise
pour aller nager.
C'est un très gros chèque.
Si gros, que si tu couchais avec,
tu le dirais pas à tes amis.
C'est un très gros chèque.
Si gros, que quand tu t'assieds
à côté dans l'avion,
tu te demandes si le chèque
aurait pas dû acheter deux places.
- C'est...
- Un très gros chèque !
Ouais ! Il m'a pas signé de chèque.
- Ted, je veux t'offrir un boulot.
- Un boulot ?
Tous les ans, ma famille donne
beaucoup à l'université de Columbia,
j'ai des contacts.
Ça te dirait de concevoir...
<i>Mon coeur a fait un bond.</i>
<i>Une nouvelle bibliothèque ?
Un conservatoire ?</i>
... ton propre CV
comme professeur d'architecture.
Non merci.
Comment ça,
"non merci" ?
Tu serais un super professeur.
Tu es expert,
tu sais parler,
et quand il le faut,
tu peux te faire pousser
une superbe barbe.
Je ne serai pas professeur.
C'est ce que tu fais
quand ta carrière bat de l'aile
et que tu dois payer les factures.
Gérant de petite entreprise.
Le poumon de l'économie.
Je ne prendrai pas ce job, d'accord ?
Je vais m'en sortir.
- Nouveau sujet.
- D'accord.
Aujourd'hui, j'ai eu une amende de 200 $
pour excès de vitesse.
C'est nul, mec.
T'as pas réussi à la faire sauter ?
Tu peux pas faire sauter une amende.
Je l'ai déjà fait.
C'était... quand ?
En 1998.
Où est le feu ?
Il n'y a pas de feu.
En fait, vous savez, il y a un feu
au barbecue où je vais.
Rien de spécial.
Hamburgers, côtelette... merguez.
Vous savez
comme c'est dangereux d'aller...
- Vous avez dit "merguez" ?
- Ouais, des merguez.
Ma mère les fait mariner dans la bière
pendant 2 jours. C'est tout.
C'est bizarre, j'aurais juré
qu'une de ces grosses,
succulentes, merguez fumées
avaient une écriture dessus.
Bizarre. Vous disiez ?
C'était écrit quoi ?
Sur la merguez ?
Ça disait :
"Propriété du policier du Minnesota
"Jorgensen."
Vous aimez les merguez,
agent Jorgensen ?
Vous allez à cette adresse ?
Suivez-moi avec la sirène.
On va brûler des feux rouges.
J'aurais fait ça aussi,
si j'allais à un barbecue.
Mince, j'y allais.
Tout est dans l'évaluation
de ton ennemi.
Je savais qu'il aimait
les merguez parce que,
il était essoufflé
rien qu'en venant à ma voiture
et il avait de la moutarde
sur son étui.
Manipuler un agent de police
avec ta saucisse.
C'est sexy.
Tu penses que je peux pas
faire sauter une amende ?
Tu penses que je peux pas
faire sauter mon amende ?
Je suis Barney Stinson,
maître en manipulation.
Si j'ai réussi à me faire payer
par une strip-teaseuse pour danser,
je peux faire sauter une amende.
Défi accept...
attendez.
Je comprends pas.
"Accep-Ted."
J'ai compris.
- Quoi encore ?
- Tu veux être architecte ?
Super. Un mec avec qui j'étais à l'école
veut une nouvelle maison.
- Le boulot est à toi si tu veux.
- Tony, j'ai pas besoin de ton aide.
Voilà son offre.
Ça, c'est un très gros chèque.
C'est parti.
- Permis et carte grise.
- Bien sûr, monsieur l'agent. De suite.
Monsieur, ceci est un chèque-cadeau
pour un costume italien sur mesure.
Alors, c'est bon ?
375 dollars !
Et il a gardé le chèque-cadeau.
Je vais appeler Emilio et lui dire
de lui raccourcir l'entrejambe.
- Tu es mauvais à ça, mec.
- N'importe quoi, Robin.
Comme si tu avais déjà
fait sauter une amende.
Tu plaisantes ?
Robin est une jolie fille.
Elles n'ont pas d'amendes.
Je parie qu'elle a souvent été arrêtée
et n'en a jamais eu.
C'est scandaleux !
Et pertinent.
Permis et...
Mon chou.
Non, ne pleurez pas.
OK, pas d'amende pour vous.
Roulez plus lentement,
la prochaine fois, OK ?
Merci.
Excusez-moi.
J'ai laissé un truc au New Jersey.
C'était comment ton déjeuner
avec le riche ?
Ça a bien commencé.
Je veux concevoir une maison
qui met en valeur le paysage
sans le dominer.
En 1935, quand Franck Lloyd Wright
a conçu la Maison de la cascade...
Oui, c'est très bien.
Vous allez faire du bon boulot.
Mon souci, c'est le sous-sol.
- Spécialement la buanderie.
- La buanderie ?
Je veux une buanderie
de 5 mètres sur 5,
des carreaux en céramique anti-taches
du sol au plafond.
Je suis un homme qui aime faire
sa propre lessive et, parfois,
c'est salissant.
- Salissant ?
- Salissant.
Des chaînes en acier de 3 mètres
suspendues au plafond.
C'est là que mes sacs de lessive
seront accrochés
pendant 3 jours
et 3 nuits avant que je...
les nettoie.
Ted, on dirait que ce mec
te demande de concevoir...
- Une maison meurtrière.
- C'est ça. Une maison de l'horreur.
En pratiquant les arts martiaux,
j'ai appris à croire en mon instinct
et mon instinct me dit que...
ça semble très bien.
Le steak est très saignant.
N'est-ce pas ?
Un dernier point,
l'insonorisation.
J'ai tendance à faire
beaucoup de bruit quand je lave.
Je vais vous montrer.
Je vais aller dans la buanderie
et vous me direz si vous m'entendez.
Il est un peu grave, hein ?
Grave bien.
Tu as tapé dans le mille.
- Tu peux pas faire cette maison !
- Je vais pas la faire.
- Tu peux pas la faire !
- Je vais pas la faire !
Amène-toi.
M. l'agent, s'il vous plaît,
ma femme va avoir un bébé !
- Elle vient de perdre les eaux !
- Où est votre femme ?
Elle a pris l'autre voiture.
C'est du cuir italien, alors...
Je... Allez...
Désolé
pour cette maison de l'horreur
C'était de ma faute.
C'est pour moi.
Nouveau plan.
Mon ami, tu vas construire
un mari à la Statue de la Liberté.
J'ai quelques connaissances
à la mairie.
Arrête !
Je veux pas de ton aide, OK ?
T'as pas à faire ça.
- Si.
- Pourquoi ?
Parce que...
quand tu étais avec Stella,
elle me manquait terriblement.
Je peux imaginer ce que tu ressens.
Laisse-moi te rassurer.
Je ne veux plus de Stella.
Elle m'a menti,
m'a largué devant l'autel.
Qui peut faire ça ?
Je suis mieux sans elle.
Elle est toute à toi, mon pote.
D'accord.
Un poids en moins.
<i>Et ce fut tout. Tony est parti</i>
<i>et j'ai commencé à mettre tout ça
loin derrière moi.</i>
<i>Enfin, je le pensais.</i>
Tony m'a quitté.
Tony t'a quittée ?
Il a dit que c'était à cause
de ce que tu avais dit.
Tu as fait rompre Tony et Stella ?
Vraiment désolée,
mais je dois insister
pour que tu topes là.
Allons parler dans le couloir.
Je vais attendre.
Pourquoi tu es là ?
Écoute, Ted, j'ai 7 mois de retard,
mais c'est comme ça.
Je suis amoureuse de Tony,
depuis le lycée.
On est sortis ensemble longtemps,
et puis...
je suis tombée enceinte
et pour une fille de 19 ans,
ça faisait trop à gérer,
et on a rompu.
Et pendant un long moment,
j'ai trop pensé à mon rôle de mère.
J'ai oublié Tony.
J'ai oublié...
comment c'était d'être amoureux.
Puis t'es arrivé et tout a ressurgi.
Et je t'aimais pour ça.
Je t'aimais tellement, en fait,
que c'était juste...
assez.
Mais j'aimais toujours Tony.
Reprends-le, chérie.
Il est désolé.
Non, c'est pas ce qui se passe.
Rentrez, Mme Matsen.
- Ravi de t'avoir revue, Stella.
- Peux-tu parler à Tony ?
Quoi ?
Il t'écoutera.
Tu l'as fait changer d'avis.
Tu peux le refaire.
C'est cruel de demander ça...
Oui, c'est cruel de demander ça.
Je sais pas quoi faire d'autre.
Je l'aime.
Tu l'aimes ?
Quoi, tu fais appel
à mon romantisme ?
C'est ta stratégie ?
Parce que ce gars est parti.
Tu peux plus m'avoir comme ça.
Je ne m'attache plus à rien,
grâce à toi.
Vas-y, chérie, embrasse-le !
- Rentrez, Mme Matsen !
- Rentrez !
OK, tu peux le faire.
Tu peux le faire !
Tu peux le faire.
- Permis et...
- Permis et carte grise.
Pardon ?
Vous devez avoir un permis
pour être aussi jolie.
Et ce corps ?
J'imagine qu'une chose
aussi explosive doit être enregistrée
auprès des autorités.
Sortez du véhicule.
Pourquoi,
suis-je en état d'arrestation ?
Ça dépend de ce que tu me feras.
Faux.
C'est jamais arrivé.
C'est tiré d'un porno. Je l'ai vu.
Merde, je l'ai fait.
Quand comprendrez-vous
que la différence
entre ma vie et un porno, c'est
que ma vie a un meilleur éclairage.
Tu mens.
Je ne mens pas !
Je jure sur ma mère.
Je jure
sur la Goliath National Bank.
Je jure sur mes costumes.
Je...
ne...
mens...
pas.
<i>Il mentait.
Voilà ce qui s'est vraiment passé.</i>
Vas-y, chérie, embrasse-le !
- Rentrez, Mme Matsen !
- Rentrez !
Je ne peux rien faire
pour tout arranger ?
C'est moi ! C'est Barney. À l'aide !
J'ai de gros problèmes !
Ralentis.
Que se passe-t-il ?
J'imagine qu'une chose
aussi explosive doit être enregistrée
auprès des autorités.
Sortez.
Pourquoi,
suis-je en état d'arrestation ?
Oui. J'ai fait une recherche.
Vous avez 15 infractions
sur ces trois derniers jours.
Sortez du véhicule.
Mais non, ma femme va accoucher !
- J'ai une saucisse avec votre nom !
- Sortez !
Tu dois venir à Brazzaville,
dans le New Jersey pour me faire sortir.
Je suis un peu occupé.
Dépêche.
Tu n'as pas idée du genre de criminels
avec qui ils m'ont mis.
On va nous rendre notre peinture ?
Sauve-moi, Ted !
Tu veux faire quelque chose pour moi ?
Je dois aller dans le New Jersey.
Tu payes le péage, hein ?
Je rigole.
<i>Donc, Stella et moi sommes allés
dans le New Jersey,</i>
<i>pour libérer votre oncle Barney</i>
<i>et nous sommes rentrés.</i>
Au fait, comment va la fille
que tu vois ?
Cette superbe Française
avec d'énormes seins ?
Tu parles de Claudette ?
Elle va bien.
La plus bonne de toutes celles
avec qui t'es jamais sorti !
Jamais !
Encore une fois, désolée pour tout.
- À dire vrai...
- Je parlerai à Tony.
Vraiment ?
Je veux que tu sois heureuse.
Je lui parlerai.
<i>Et je l'ai fait.</i>
<i>Je sais plus ce que je lui ai dit,
mais il a dû changer d'avis</i>
<i>parce que le jour suivant,</i>
<i>ils partaient en Californie.</i>
<i>Stella a ouvert un nouveau cabinet.</i>
<i>Et contre toute attente,
Tony est devenu scénariste à succès.</i>
<i>Son film, </i>La mariée<i>, fut un carton.</i>
<i>Mais on y reviendra.</i>
Dis-moi juste une chose.
Pourquoi Tony ?
Je veux dire, c'est l'argent,
les pyjamas kung-fu ?
Enfin... C'est quoi ?
C'est le bon.
Le bon.
Ça fait un peu idiot, mais oui.
Je vais dire à voix haute
quelque chose
que j'avais réussi
à ne pas dire à voix haute.
Ce que vous avez, Tony et toi...
Ce que, à un moment,
j'ai cru avoir avec toi...
Ce que je sais
que Marshall et Lily ont...
Je veux ça.
Je le veux.
J'arrête pas d'attendre
et d'attendre que ça arrive
et...
J'imagine que je suis juste...
fatigué d'attendre.
Et c'est tout ce que j'ai à dire
là-dessus.
Je t'ai déjà dit
que j'ai évité un PV ?
Vraiment ?
J'allais chez mes parents
en faisant du 130 et on m'a arrêtée.
Le flic sort de sa voiture.
Il se pavane un peu vers moi, genre,
"Jeune fille,
je vous ai attendue toute la journée."
Alors, je l'ai regardé et j'ai dit :
"Désolée, M. l'agent.
Je suis venue aussi vite que j'ai pu."
Vraiment ?
Une vieille blague.
Je sais que tu en as marre
d'attendre
et faudra peut-être
que tu attendes encore un peu,
mais elle arrive, Ted.
Et elle arrive
aussi vite qu'elle peut.
Elle m'a retrouvé deux jours plus tard,
dans l'annuaire.
Je n'ai plus jamais mis mon nom
dans mes sous-vêtements.
Tu es revenue !
En écoutant cette blague
de beurre de cacahuètes et de confiture,
j'étais complètement dégoûtée.
Mais ce matin, sous la douche,
j'y ai repensé
et ça m'a fait rigoler.
Beurre de cacahuètes.
Donc je pense
que j'ai pu m'emporter.
D'après Marshall.
C'est bon de te revoir, Lily.
Merci.
- Alors, quoi de neuf ?
- Je vais dans un monde d'amnésie
avec plein de photos de mon fils
et une alliance.
Je vais trouver la meilleure
patiente/femme et nous allons...
OK, ça suffit pour ce soir.
Je vais y aller petit à petit.
<i>Kids, Stella Zinman was the girl</i>
<i>I thought I'd spend
the rest of my life with.</i>
<i>Until she left me at the altar,
smashing my heart to smithereens.</i>
<i>So when I ran into her
seven months later,</i>
<i>there was only one way
to deal with her.</i>
- Great to see you!
- You, too.
And Tony!
What a nice surprise.
"What a nice surprise"?
No, a nice surprise would be
if a safe fell from 40 stories
and smushed them both.
You didn't let them have it?
No, we had a nice friendly chat, then,
they went their way and I went mine.
You blew it.
He blew it, right?
- Well played, sir.
- Bravo.
- What?
- You see,
Ted played it cool, which is exactly
what he should have done.
As a matter of fact,
I'd say on a scale ranging from...
And I kept this sweater of yours...
and sometimes
I just sit in the bathtub
for hours just,
you know, just sniffing it.
... all the way to...
This is my new fiancée.
She's basically Stella,
except she's French
and, as you can see,
she's got enormous cans.
<i>Enchantée.</i>
<i>Enchanté.</i>
I'd say you nailed it.
I'll do you one better.
You, sir, got Stella thinking.
"Gosh, Ted seemed so cool today.
Did I choose the wrong guy?"
Give it a week, you'll get her back.
And her front.
Did you just feel that?
I think we just had a "what up" quake.
I don't want her back.
Or her front.
I just want to move on.
And this was an important step
towards that.
To moving on.
<i>And you know, I really meant it.</i>
<i>But still, that night,
my mind began to wander.</i>
I made a terrible mistake.
I know.
I'm a better person than you are.
You totally are.
Let's get back together,
and have way more sex.
Deal!
Hello, Ted.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
No, come in. It's not weird at all.
I knew it was wrong
to steal somebody's fiancée.
I mean, I grappled with it.
I was up nights.
And not for the good reason.
Well, sometimes for the good reason.
I mean, Stella and I hadn't
seen each other in five years,
so, as you can imagine, the beginning,
it was just fast and furious.
Lamps breaking, furniture moving.
You see this bald patch?
Anyway, we moved on.
Me, Lucy, Stella,
we were gonna move to L.A.
I was gonna become a screenwriter.
Then we bumped into you,
and you just looked so...
sad.
Sad? No.
I think what you're calling sad
was actually
a jovial nonchalance.
You looked awful, okay?
Like a little dachshund puppy
with a bad back that's got
to pull itself around on a cart.
Why are you here?
I know I can
come across pretty tough,
but I can't bear to have hurt someone
the way I hurt you.
I think fate put me on that corner
to make this right.
Obviously, I can't fill that giant
crater that Stella left in your heart.
- I've been dating. Like, a lot.
- And then I heard you got fired.
I transitioned into small business
ownership.
t's the backbone of the economy.
No, it's not.
Ted, my family's got a lot of money.
And I want to use that money
to make this right with you.
Tony is rich?
Ted, tell me he wrote you a check.
Tell me he wrote you
a big, fat check.
A check so big it doesn't take
its shirt off when it goes swimming.
That is a big, fat check.
A check so big, if you had sex with it,
you wouldn't tell your buddies.
That is a big, fat check.
A check so big that
when you sit next to it on an airplane,
you find yourself wondering whether
the check should have bought 2 seats.
- That...
- Is a big, fat check!
Yeah! He didn't write me a check.
- Ted, I want to offer you a job.
- A job?
Every year, my family gives
a lot of money to Columbia University,
so I got some pull.
How would you like to design...
<i>My heart leapt into my throat.</i>
<i>A new library?
A new student center?</i>
... your very own curriculum
as a professor of architecture.
No, thanks.
What do you mean,
"No, thanks"?
You would be a great professor, OK?
You are knowledgeable,
you're a good talker,
and when you need to,
you can grow
a very handsome neck beard.
I'm not gonna be a professor.
Teaching is what you do
when your career
has totally bottomed out
and you need to pay the bills.
Small business owner.
Backbone of the economy.
I'm not gonna take that job, all right?
I'm gonna be just fine.
- New topic.
- Okay, new topic.
I just got a $200
speeding ticket today.
That sucks, dude.
You couldn't talk your way out of it?
You can't.
I've done it.
It was... what was it?
It was 1998.
So where's the fire?
There's no fire.
Actually, you know, there is a fire
at this barbecue I'm headed to.
Nothing special.
Burgers, ribs... brats.
Son, do you have any idea
how dangerous it is to be...
- Did you say brats?
- Yeah, brats.
My mom marinates them
in Belgian beer for two days. No big.
Funny thing was, I could've sworn
that one of those thick,
succulent, hickory-smoked brats
had some writing on it.
Weird. What were you saying?
What did it say? The brat?
It said
"Property of Minnesota State Trooper
"Jorgensen."
You a brat man,
Officer Jorgensen?
You going to this address?
Follow me and lean on the horn.
We're gonna be running some reds.
Well, duh.
I would've done that, too,
if I'd have been going to a barbecue.
Damn, I was.
See, it's all about
sizing up your opponent.
I could tell that the officer
was a brat man because,
well, he was out of breath
just from walking to my car and...
he had mustard on his holster.
Manipulating an officer of the law
with your sausage.
That is very hot.
You think I can't talk my way
out of a ticket?
You think I can't talk my way
out of a ticket?
I am Barney Stinson,
master of manipulation.
If I can talk a stripper
into paying me for a lap dance,
I think I can talk my way
out of a ticket.
Challenge accept...
wait for it.
I don't get it.
"Accep-Ted."
I get it now.
- What now?
- You want to be an architect?
Great. Guy I went to private school
with wants a new house built.
- Job's yours if you want it.
- Tony, look, I don't need your help.
Here's what he's offering you.
That is a big, fat check.
Showtime.
- License and registration.
- Of course, Officer. Right away.
Sir, this is a gift certificate
for a custom-tailored Italian suit.
So, we done here?
375 dollars!
And he kept the gift certificates.
I'm gonna call Emilio and tell him
to short-sheet him on the crotch.
You are bad at this, dude.
Whatever, Robin.
Like you've ever talked
your way out of a ticket.
Are you kidding me?
Robin's a pretty girl.
Pretty girls don't get tickets.
I bet she's been pulled over tons
of times, never once gotten one.
That is outrageous!
And factual.
License and re...
Honey.
Don't cry.
It's okay. No ticket for you.
Go a little slower next time, okay?
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I think I left something in New Jersey.
How did your lunch go
with the rich guy?
Well, it started off great.
I want to design a house
that celebrates the landscape
without overpowering it.
You know, when Frank Lloyd Wright
designed Fallingwater in 1935...
Yes, that's all fine.
I'm sure you'll do a great job.
What I'm really worried about
is the basement.
- Specifically the laundry room.
- The laundry room?
I require a laundry room
of 15 feet by 15 feet,
stain-proof ceramic tile
from floor to ceiling.
I'm a man who likes to do
his own laundry, and sometimes,
it gets messy.
- Messy?
- Messy.
Steel chains will dangle from
the ceiling  at a height of nine feet.
And that is
where my laundry bags will hang
for three days
and three nights before I...
clean them.
Ted, it kind of sounds like
what this guy is asking you to design...
- It's a murder house.
- It is. It's totally a murder house.
You know, as a martial artist,
I'm trained to trust my instincts,
and my instincts are saying this...
feels very good.
The steak is so rare.
Right?
One final concern:
soundproofing.
I tend to make a lot of racket
when I launder.
I'll show you what I mean.
I'm gonna go to my laundry room,
and you tell me if you can hear me.
Does something feel off
about this guy?
Off the hook!
Bro, you are nailing this.
- You can't design a murder house!
- I'm not gonna design a murder house.
- You can't design a murder house!
- I'm not!
Bring it.
Officer, please,
my wife is about to have a baby!
- Her water just broke!
- Where's your wife?
She took the other car.
This is Italian leather, so...
I... Oh, come...
I'm sorry
about that murder house thing.
That was my bad.
That's on me.
New plan.
You, my friend, are gonna build
the Statue of Liberty
a husband.
Now, I got some suction down
at City Hall.
Stop it!
I don't want your help, okay?
You don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.
- Why?
Because...
when you were with Stella,
I know how much I missed her.
I can only imagine you feel
the same way.
Let me put your mind at ease.
I don't want Stella back, okay?
She lied to me
and left me at the altar.
What kind of person does that?
I'm better off without her.
She's all yours, buddy.
There you go.
Load off my mind.
<i>And that was it. Tony left,</i>
<i>and I began to put this whole
business far behind me.</i>
<i>Or so I thought.</i>
Tony broke up with me.
Tony broke up with you?
He said it was
because of something you said.
You got Tony to dump Stella?
I am very sorry,
but I'm going to have to insist
that you bump this.
Let's talk out in the hall.
It'll be waiting.
So, why are you here?
Look, Ted, this is about
seven months too late,
but here goes.
I've been in love with Tony
since high school.
We dated for a long time,
but then...
I got pregnant,
and I guess for two 19-year-olds
it was just too much to handle,
so we broke up.
And for a long time I just
focused on being a mother.
I forgot about Tony.
I forgot about...
the very idea of being in love.
And then you came along
and reminded me.
And I loved you for that.
I loved you so much, in fact,
that it was just...
shy of enough.
But I never stopped loving Tony.
Take him back, honey.
He's sorry.
No, that's not...
that's not what's happening.
Just go back inside, Mrs. Matsen.
- It was good seeing you, Stella.
- Can you talk to Tony?
What?
He'd listen to you.
You changed his mind.
You could change it back.
I know it's an awful thing to ask...
Yeah, it's an awful thing to ask.
I don't know what else to do, okay?
I love him.
You love him.
So what, you're-you're appealing
to the romantic in me?
Is that your strategy?
Because that guy's gone.
You can't pull
those strings anymore.
They're not attached
to anything thanks to you.
Go ahead, honey, kiss him!
- Go inside, Mrs. Matsen!
- Mrs. Matsen, go inside!
Okay, you can do this.
You can do this!
Oh, you can do this.
- License and regis...
- License and registration.
Excuse me?
I can only assume you need a license
to have a face that beautiful.
And that body?
I'm guessing something that
explosive has to be registered
with the proper authorities.
Get out of the car.
Why, am I under arrest?
But you're about to be under me.
No. False.
Did not happen.
That's a line from a porno.
I've seen that porno.
Hell, I've made that porno.
When will you realize
that the only difference
between my real life and a porno
is my real life has better lighting?
You're lying.
I am not lying!
I swear on my mother.
I swear on Goliath National Bank.
I swear on my suits.
I...
am...
not...
lying.
<i>He was lying.
Here's what really happened.</i>
Go ahead, honey, kiss him.
- Go inside, Mrs. Matsen!
- Mrs. Matsen, go inside!
Is there anything I can do
to make this better?
It's me! It's Barney. It's me!
I need your help! I'm in big trouble!
Slow down. What happened?
I'm guessing something
that explosive hasto be registered
with the proper authorities.
- Get out of the car.
- Why, am I under arrest?
Yes, you are. I ran your plates.
You've had 15 moving violations
in the last three days.
Get out of the car.
But no, my wife's having a baby!
- I have a sausage with your name on it!
- Out of the car now!
I need you to come
to Brazzaville, New Jersey
and bail me out.
I'm in the middle of something.
Hurry, Ted. You have no idea
of the kind of the hardened criminals
they've got me in here with.
Are we gonna get
our spray paint back?
Save me, Ted!
You want to do something for me?
I need a ride to New Jersey.
You'll pay for tolls, right?
I'm kidding.
<i>So Stella and I drove
all the way out to New Jersey,</i>
<i>bailed your Uncle Barney out of jail</i>
<i>and drove all the way home.</i>
By the way, how's
that girl you've been seeing?
That super hot French chick
with the big enormous boobs?
Oh, you mean Claudette?
She's... fine.
Man, she's the hottest girl
you have ever been with, Ted.
Ever!
I'm so sorry again about everything.
- For what it's worth...
- I'll talk to Tony.
Really?
I want you to be happy, Stella.
I'll talk to him.
<i>And I did.</i>
<i>I don't remember what I said to him,
but I guess I changed his mind</i>
<i>because the next day,</i>
<i>they flew to California.</i>
<i>Stella set up
a new dermatology practice.</i>
<i>And against all odds, Tony found
some success as a screenwriter.</i>
<i>His movie, </i>The Wedding Bride,
<i>was a big hit.</i>
<i>But we'll get to that later.</i>
But just tell me this.
Why Tony?
I mean, is it the money,
the kung fu pajamas?
Like, what...
what is it?
He's the one.
The one.
Yeah, I know it's kinda sappy,
but, yeah.
I'm gonna say something
out loud that I've been doing
a pretty good job of not
saying out loud lately.
What you and Tony have...
What I thought for a second
you and I had...
What I know that Marshall
and Lily have...
I want that.
I do.
I keep waiting for it to happen
and waiting for it to happen,
and...
I guess I'm just...
I'm tired of waiting.
And that is all I'm going
to say on that subject.
I once talked my way
out of a speeding ticket?
Really?
I was heading upstate
to my parents' house
doing, like, 90 on this country road,
and I got pulled over.
So this cop gets out of his car.
He kind of swaggers on over
and he's, like,
"Young lady,
I have been waiting for you all day."
So I looked up at him and I said,
"I'm so sorry, Officer.
I got here as fast as I could."
For real?
It's an old joke.
I know that you're tired of waiting,
and you may have to wait
a little while more,
but she's on her way, Ted.
And she's getting here
as fast as she can.
She tracked me down two days
later using a phone book.
And that's the last time I wrote
my name in my undergarments.
You're back!
When you told me
that peanut butter and jam joke,
I was completely disgusted.
But I was in the shower this morning
and it popped into my head
and it actually made me laugh.
Peanut butter.
So I can see now
how I may have overreacted.
Marshall's words, not mine.
It's good to see you again, Lily.
Thanks.
- So what have you been up to?
- I'm going to an amnesia ward
with a bunch of photos
of my children and a wedding ring.
I'm gonna find the hottest
patient/my wife, and we are going...
Okay, so that's good
enough for tonight.
I gotta ease back into this.

On ouvre un restaurant appelé Rib Town,
on le veut en forme...

Écoutez, il me faut ce boulot.
J'ai pas d'autre option.
Tu peux toujours faire prof.
J'ai pas travaillé aussi dur
pour finir dans un boulot merdique.
- Le prends pas mal, Lily.
- On m'a pissé dessus 3 fois ce matin.
Je peux rien dire.
Je dois réussir ce bâtiment,

<i>Les trois jours suivants,
j'ai bossé comme jamais.</i>
<i>Et ça m'a mené... nulle part.</i>

- Un bâtiment en forme de chapeau.
- C'est le moment pour parler ?
- Non.
- Tu penses quoi de Robin ?
- Je dois vraiment travailler, donc...
Génial.
Disons qu'on est chez un tailleur
et tu as trouvé un beau costume,
un beau costume canadien.
Superbe poitrine.
Tu l'essaies,

Donc tu le rends. Puis je l'essaie.
J'ai pas trop envie...
d'un costume qui t'a tapé dans l'oeil,

J'aime beaucoup ce costume.
Achčte le costume.
Il est important pour toi.
Dis-lui ce que tu ressens.

Je sais !
D'accord ?
Je suis avec toi.
Maintenant.
- Car je t'ai expliqué.

Allez, mec, tu es dessus
depuis trois jours sans t'arręter.
C'est ton anniversaire.
Viens boire une bičre sur le toit.
Impossible, la présentation est demain.
Ces chapeaux se font pas tout seuls.
C'est un restaurant
pour gros touristes.
Mets juste des portes larges
et des chaises renforcées.
Bičre d'anniversaire sur le toit.
Allons-y !
Pourquoi tu veux tant
que j'aille sur le toit ?
- Vous m'avez fait une fęte-surprise ?
- Quoi ?
On t'a fait une fęte-surprise,
l'année derničre.
Tu n'auras pas
deux fętes-surprises de suite.
Le fait que du monde soit venu
ŕ la premičre était déjŕ surprenant.
Non ?
Deux fętes-surprises de suite !
C'est trčs fort !
C'est trčs fort !
Super !
Super...
Il veut toujours pas monter.
Allez. C'est chiant !
Je savais
que c'était une mauvaise idée.
Oui, Robin, je sais.
Cette fęte est...
c'est... un désastre.
C'était mon idée.
J'en prends la responsabilité.
Il n'y a qu'une chose ŕ faire.
- Marshall, non.
- Lily, je dois le faire !
Ça sert ŕ rien
de remettre ŕ plus tard.
<i>Je devrais vous expliquer.
Quelques années plus tôt...</i>
Oublie.
C'est vraiment pas classe.
Au mieux, c'est naze.

<i>Un paradis nous attendait

Chouette. Comment on y va ?
On va faire quoi ? Sauter ?
Je peux sauter ça.
Depuis peu, il te faut deux essais
pour te lever du canapé.
Tu peux pas sauter ça.
- Vraiment ?
- Vraiment.
Regarde.
<i>Mais il n'a pas sauté.</i>
Une heure plus tard
En fait, c'est pas mal.
Pas vrai ?
<i>Et les années suivantes,</i>
<i>il a continué d'essayer.</i>
<i>Mais ŕ chaque fois,

On y va.

Vous inquiétez pas.
Si je peux sauter ce soir,
ça va sauver la soirée.
Chéri, descends d'ici, s'il te plaît.
Quand Evel Knievel
a chevauché sa fusée étoilée
sur la rive du Snake River Canyon,
tu penses que sa femme a dit :
"Chéri, descends d'ici" ?
Pour la derničre fois,
je ne suis pas Linda Knievel !
Je ne serai jamais Linda Knievel !
Inutile de me le rappeler.
Marshall, ne fais pas ça.
Ne saute pas, s'il te plaît.
Désolé, mais je dois le faire.
- Tu peux pas.
- Pourquoi ?
Tu veux une raison ?
Tu vas en avoir une.
Je suis enceinte.
Mon Dieu !
Mon Dieu, vraiment ?
J'ai bien vu

Je mentais, salopard !
Vas-y, saute !
J'espčre que tu vas mourir !
C'est la permission

Écoute, Robin...
- Je dois te dire quelque chose.
- Attends.
Avant ça,
je dois te dire quelque chose.
C'est quoi ?
Je crois que je t'aime.
C'est Ted.
Tout le monde !
Ted, ça va ?
Elle est ici, Lily.
Elle me regarde.
Quoi ?
La chčvre.
<i>Je vous ai déjŕ dit une partie
de l'histoire de la chčvre.</i>
<i>Comment tante Lily a invité un fermier
pour parler ŕ sa classe,</i>
<i>comment il a amené la chčvre,</i>
<i>et dit ŕ la classe
ce qu'il allait lui faire plus tard.</i>
<i>Comment tante Lily,
dans un accčs de bonté,</i>
<i>acheta la chčvre
pour commuer sa peine.</i>
Il s'est passé un truc incroyable.
J'allais parler ŕ Robin,
j'allais lui avouer mes sentiments,
mais juste avant,
tu croiras jamais ce qu'elle a dit.
Je crois que je t'aime.
- Tu as répondu quoi ?
- Ŕ ton avis ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on peut répondre ŕ ça ?
Robin, écoute
t'es super.
T'es vraiment géniale,
mais on est amis.
C'est pas une bonne idée.
Tu dois avoir raison.
Amuse-toi bien.
Toi aussi, ma puce.
- Quoi ?
- Dčs qu'elle m'a dit ça,
plus de sentiments.
Je ne suis plus amoureux.
Tu as été amoureux de cette fille,
pendant toute l'année
et dčs qu'elle ressent
la męme chose,
tu ne l'aimes plus.
C'est pas super ?
C'est une lavette.
Pas de la nourriture.
Comment... ?
On y est.
On...
est... parti !
On y est.
Tracey,
dis ŕ Lily ce que tu viens de dire.
- Que je viens d'arriver ŕ New York ?
- Non, comment tu y es arrivée.
Je viens de descendre
du bus de l'Iowa.
Viens de descendre
du bus de l'Iowa !
Quelle chance qu'une apprentie...
danseuse
descendant du bus de l'Iowa...
rencontre...
le producteur des Rockettes ?
Je me croirais
dans une histoire classique du showbiz.
Chérie, tu y es.
Tu y es vraiment.
Tu peux nous faire
un de ces rhum et bičre,
- que ton pčre aime tant ?
- Bien sűr !
- Bon sang.
- Quoi ?
Tout le monde dit toujours :
"Ne dites rien ŕ Lily.
"Lily sait pas garder un secret."
Et, d'habitude, ils ont raison.
Mais cette fois,
j'ai gardé le secret.
Et lŕ, tu arrives avec ces conneries
et tu me forces ŕ redevenir
la Lily qui va cracher le morceau !
Quel morceau ?
Il y a un morceau ?
Il y a un morceau.
Le costume, c'est Robin.
Je sais !
D'accord ?
Je suis avec toi.
Maintenant.
- Car je t'ai expliqué.
- Qu'est-ce que...
Voilŕ.
Merde.
- Il a dit ça ?
- Mon Dieu !
Quelle incroyable surprise !
- Tu sais depuis quand ?
- 8 mois.
Et t'as rien dit depuis ?
Bravo.
Bravo, Lily.
Je veux dire, quelle bombe.
Qui a vu ça venir ?
- Tu sais depuis quand ?
- 7 mois et 29 jours.
Je vais faire quoi ?
Je sais pas.
Tu vas faire quoi ?
Je vais épouser Barney
dans une grande église.
On va déménager au New Hampshire
et ouvrir des chambres d'hôtes.
- Vraiment ?
- Non !
C'est Barney.
Je veux dire...
c'est Barney.
Mais c'est Barney.
Je dois lui dire non.
Bon sang, tu vas lui briser le...
Le truc qui pompe
cette boue noire dans ses veines.
Tu as raison.
Pour la premičre fois
qu'il aime une fille,
elle le repousse ?
Et pas n'importe quelle fille.
Ça va le détruire.
OK, premičrement...
Deuxičmement,
il y a un truc que tu peux essayer.
C'est risqué,
mais ça peut ętre payant.
Faute de mieux,
je vais appeler ça...
- Le Mosby.
- Le Mosby ?
Non, elle pourra pas le mosbyser.
- Elle pourrait carrément le mosbyser.
- C'est quoi, le Mosby ?
Tu te souviens
ta premičre fois avec Ted ?
Tu voulais monter dans le train Ted,
visiter sa gare de triage.
J'étais pręte
ŕ sauter ce tourniquet.
Qu'est-ce qui a tout changé ?
- Je crois que je t'aime.
- Quoi ?
Le Mosby !
C'est génial !
Et...
excuse-moi.
T'es vraiment jolie,
mais anormalement grande
et tu crois pas aux fantômes.
Donc...
quand elle a dit m'aimer,
elle voulait dire... le contraire.
C'est ça.
Ça a bien fonctionné.
Tu es redevenu normal.
Oui. C'est vrai.
Et c'est super.
C'est génial.
- Donc, Robin ne m'aime pas.
- Non.
Pourquoi ?
M. La Chčvre ?
M. La Chčvre ?
Ça suffit.
Idiote de chčvre.
Je comprends pas ta fascination
pour cette lavette.
Ça doit ętre normal
avec un cerveau de la taille d'un...
Marshall,
tu peux aller chercher Ted ?
J'étais sur le point de sauter.
Tu m'as pas entendu
répéter "OK" en boucle ?
Désolée.
Vas-y, saute.
C'est bon.
Désolé, tout le monde.
Lily veut pas que je saute.
Merci, mon Dieu.
L'hôpital !
Que s'est-il passé ?
Il s'est passé...
que tu as laissé un animal sauvage
dans notre appartement.
J'ai été attaqué.
C'est la plus douce
et adorable chčvre au monde.
"La plus douce
et adorable chčvre au monde" ?
<i>Je manquais de sommeil,</i>
<i>ça s'est sűrement pas passé comme ça,
mais voilŕ comment je m'en souviens.</i>
Vous ętes celui qui a voulu
se faire une chčvre ?
C'est la chčvre
qui m'a sauté dessus !
- Je peux y aller ?
- Oui.
Mais souvenez-vous,
"bęę" veut dire "bęę".
Génial, je suis en retard
pour ma présentation.
Merci, M. La Chčvre.
M. La Chčvre ?
C'est une fille.
- Elle s'appelle Missy.
- Tu t'es fait battre par une fille.
Alors...
- Tu es amoureuse de moi.
- Quoi ? Oui. Beaucoup.
Tu peux arręter. Lily m'a tout dit.
- Bon sang, Lily !
- J'arrive pas ŕ y croire.
C'est juste...
Tu comptes pour moi, Barney.
Et...
Ce genre de truc,
le côté émotionnel.
C'est pas ton genre.
Je pensais t'éviter ça.
Peut-ętre que je veux pas l'éviter.
Je le veux peut-ętre.
Je l'ai pas voulu depuis longtemps.
Mais avec toi,
ça n'a pas l'air si...
difficile.
Je sais pas.
Je pensais...
que tu ressentais la męme chose.
Peut-ętre.
Je sais pas.
Je suis pas douée
pour affronter les sentiments.
Il y a clairement un truc...
entre nous.
Peut-ętre que ma tęte disait :
"Étouffe ça dans l'oeuf"
parce que mon coeur disait...
quelque chose d'autre.
Écoute...
J'ai des sentiments pour toi.
Peut-ętre męme que je t'aime.
Ça va plutôt vite, tu trouves pas ?
- Quoi ?
- On est bons amis.
Pourquoi tout risquer ?
Amis ?
Amis.
Mon Dieu. Tu viens de le refaire.
Tu m'as mosbysé !
- Mais non.
- Mais si, petite aguicheuse.
T'as raison.
Je viens de te mosbyser.
Pourquoi t'as peur d'essayer ?
Parce que j'ai peur
de combien je pourrais t'aimer.
Mauvaise idée.
Tu as raison.
C'est une erreur.
- Non.
- Je t'aime.
- Amis.
- Amis, alors.
- Je t'aime.
- Marions-nous.
- Non, tu m'étouffes.
- OK, oublie ça.
Tu sais quoi ?
On verra ça plus tard.
C'est ça, allons-y.
<i>Ce fut une longue et folle nuit,</i>
<i>mais au matin, contre toute attente,</i>
<i>j'ai fait ma présentation.</i>
Le voilŕ, messieurs.
Rib Town.
N'est-ce pas ?
N'est-ce pas ?
Ted, écoute. Tu es génial
et tu as fait un...
super travail,
et tu rendras d'autres restaurants
trčs heureux un jour,
mais...
on a...
décidé d'aller...
dans une autre direction.
- Quoi ?
- Régalez-vous avec...
Rib Town !
Sven...
Je vais vous dire,
je mangerai plus de côtelettes.
Ouais, c'est ça.
Je ne mangerai...
plus jamais...
de côtelettes !
Devant Ted !
C'est un désastre.
Comment je vais m'en relever ?
OK, je ne fais que demander.
Tu veux vraiment t'en relever ?
- Ça veut dire quoi ?
- L'architecture est en train de te tuer
et ça nous tue de la voir te tuer.
Tu es comme la chčvre
avec la lavette.
Tu la veux tellement,
et chaque fois que le monde
essaye de te la reprendre,
tu t'y accroches.
Mais tu sais quoi ?
Ce n'est qu'une lavette.
Pourquoi tu la veux ?
Parce que je dois ętre architecte.
C'est...
C'est le plan.
Aux chiottes, le plan.
Je voulais ętre une artiste célčbre.
Marshall voulait ętre
avocat environnemental.
Robin voulait ętre reporter télé.
Je suis reporter télé.
Je suis ŕ l'antenne ŕ 4 h du matin.
Ça continue ?
Bravo.
Que quelqu'un regarde,
s'il vous plaît.
Barney voulait ętre violoniste.
Faut pas me le dire.
Tu peux pas dessiner ta vie
comme un immeuble.
Ça marche pas comme ça.
Tu dois la vivre
et elle se dessinera d'elle-męme.
Alors quoi, je devrais rien faire ?
Écoute ce que le monde
te dit de faire
et saute le pas.
Tu as raison.
Tu as complčtement raison.
Je t'aime, Lily.
Un saut métaphorique.
Un saut métaphorique !
- Ne fais pas ça.
- Pas cool.
- Je l'ai fait !
- Chéri, tu l'as fait !
- Je peux tout faire !
- C'est vrai !
Je m'achčte une moto !
Non, pas du tout !
OK, désolé.
Venez, les gars.
<i>C'est l'année
oů on m'a quitté ŕ l'autel.</i>
<i>L'année oů un barman taré
m'a mis K.O.</i>
<i>L'année oů j'ai été viré.</i>
<i>L'année oů j'ai été battu
par une chčvre.</i>
<i>Une fille-chčvre, en plus.</i>
<i>Pourtant, ce fut
la meilleure année de ma vie.</i>
<i>Parce que si tout ça
n'était pas arrivé,</i>
<i>je n'aurais jamais eu
le meilleur job de ma vie.</i>
<i>Mais le plus important,</i>
<i>je n'aurais pas rencontré
votre mčre,</i>
<i>car comme vous le savez...</i>
<i>elle était dans cette classe.</i>
<i>Bien sűr, cette histoire
ne fait que commencer.</i>
<i>Every architect can point to that one
design that changed their career.</i>
<i>For me, it was around the time
of my 31st birthday.</i>
It wasn't a museum or a concert hall
or a skyscraper.
<i>It was something else.</i>
We're opening a restaurant called
Rib Town, and we want it to be shaped...
Like a cowboy hat.
Look, I need the work.
I don't have any other options.
- There's always that teaching job.
- Yeah,
I didn't work this hard to be stuck
in some crappy, dead-end teaching job.
- No offense, Lily.
- I got peed on three times today.
No arguments here.
I just gotta nail this hat building so,
I'll see you all in three days.
<i>For the next three days, I worked harder
than I'd ever worked in my life.</i>
<i>And I got... nowhere.</i>
Hey, Ted, whatcha doing?
Designing a building shaped
like a hat.
- Now a good time to chat?
- No.
- So, what do you think of Robin?
- I really need to get to work, so...
Great.
Say you and I went suit-shopping,
and you happened upon
a beautiful suit,
a beautiful Canadian suit.
Double-breasted.
You try it on, but it's not exactly
the right fit for you.
So, you put it back.
Then I try it on.
I don't really want
to take the same suit that you had
your eye on, but at the same time,
I really like that suit.
Buy the suit, Barney.
You clearly care about it.
Tell the suit how you feel.
But Ted, rember that
that was your answer because...
The suit is Robin.
I know!
Right?
I'm with you, buddy.
You are now.
- Because I explained it to you.
- What do you talk...
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
Come on, dude, you've been at this
for three days without a break.
It's your birthday. Come up to the roof
and have a beer with me.
No can do.
Presentation is tomorrow.
Hat buildings
don't design themselves.
It's a rib joint for fat tourists.
Just make sure the doors are wide
and the chairs are reinforced.
Now, birthday beer on the roof.
Let's go!
Why do you want me to come up
to the roof so bad?
- Are you throwing me a surprise party?
- What?
Ted, we threw you
a surprise party last year.
Okay, you don't get
two surprise parties in a row.
The fact that anyone showed up
at the first one was surprise enough.
Right?
Two surprise parties in a row!
That is rich!
That is rich!
Classic!
Classic...
He still won't come up.
Come on. What the crap?!
I knew having a second surprise party
was a bad idea.
Yes, Robin, I know.
This party is...
it's... it's a disaster.
It was my idea.
I take responsibility.
And there's really only one thing
to do about it.
- Marshall, no.
- Lily, I have to do this!
No point in putting it off
any longer.
<i>I should explain.
You see, a few years earlier...</i>
Forget it.
This is so not pimped out.
If anything, this is pimped in.
You know who knows how to live?
Those people.
<i>The rooftop patio
one building over from ours.</i>
<i>Across a chasm of just six or seven feet
awaited a landscaped paradise.</i>
<i>And best of all...</i>
That looks to be one...
... hot...
tub.
Great. How do we get over there?
What are we gonna do? Jump?
I can jump that far.
Marshall, lately it takes you
two tries to get off the sofa.
You can't jump that far.
- Really?
- Really.
Watch me.
<i>But he didn't jump.</i>
This actually is kind of nice.
Right? Right?
<i>And in the years that followed,
he kept almost jumping.</i>
<i>But each time, without fail...</i>
Here we go.
<i>He didn't jump.</i>
But don't worry.
'Cause if I can make this jump tonight,
it's totally gonna save the party.
Honey, please get down from there.
When Evel Knievel sat astride
his star-spangled rocket
on the rim of Snake River Canyon,
do you think his wife said,
"Honey, get down from there"?
For the last time,
I am not Linda Knievel!
I will never be Linda Knievel!
You don't need to remind me.
Marshall, please don't do this.
Please don't jump.
I'm sorry, Lily,
but I gotta do this.
- You can't do this.
- Why?
You want a reason?
I'll give you a reason.
I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, really?!
Lily, I mean, I noticed
that you gained some weight lately...
I was lying, you jerk!
Go ahead and jump.
I hope you die!
That's all the permission I need.
Listen, Robin...
- There's something I have to tell you.
- But wait.
Before you do,
I have to tell you something first.
What is it?
I think I'm in love with you.
It's Ted.
Everybody!
- Hey, Ted, what's up?
- It's here, Lily.
It's looking at me.
- What is?
- The goat.
<i>Now, I've told you some of the story
of the goat already.</i>
<i>How Aunt Lily invited a local farmer
to come talk to her class,</i>
<i>and how he brought a goat,</i>
<i>and how he told the whole class
what he was gonna do</i>
<i>to the goat later that day.</i>
<i>And how Aunt Lily,
in a fit of mercy,</i>
<i>bought the goat off the guy
in order to commute its sentence.</i>
Something amazing has happened.
I was talking to Robin,
I was all set to tell her how I feel,
but before I could,
you'll never believe what she said.
I think I'm in love with you.
- What did you say?!
- What do you think I said?
What would anyone say
to something like that?
Robin, listen.
You're great.
I mean, you're really awesome,
but I mean, we're friends.
It's probably a bad idea.
I guess you're right.
Have a good party.
You too, kiddo.
- What?!
- It's like, as soon as she said that,
no more feelings.
I'm not in love with her anymore.
So, you've been in love with this girl
for the past year,
and the second
she reciprocates those feelings,
just like that, you're over her.
How great is that?!
This is a washcloth.
Not food.
What the...?
This is it.
Here...
we... go!
This is it.
Tracey, Tracey,
tell Lily what you just told me.
- That I just moved to New York?
- No, no, but tell her how you got here.
I just got off the bus from Iowa.
I just got off the bus from Iowa!
How lucky is it that an aspiring
dancer
just off the bus from Iowa runs into
the producer of the Rockettes?
I feel like I'm in one of those
classic show biz stories.
Honey, you are.
You really are.
Tracey, why don't you make me
one of those rum and beers
- that your dad loves so much?
- Sure thing!
- Damn it.
- What?
Everybody always says,
"Don't tell Lily."
"Lily can't keep a secret."
And, usually, they're right.
But this time, I kept the secret.
And then you come along
with this crap
and you force me to pull
an old classic Lily and spill the beans!
What beans?
There's beans?
There's beans.
The suit is Robin.
I know!
Right?
I'm with you, buddy.
You are now.
- Because I explained it to you.
- What do you talk...
There you go.
Crap.
- He said that?
- Oh, my God!
What a tremendous
ground-breaking surprise!
- How long have you known?
- 8 months.
And you've kept it a secret since then?
Good for you.
Good for you, Lily.
I mean, what a bombshell.
Who saw that coming?
- How long have you known?
- Seven months, 29 days.
God, what am I going to do?
I don't know.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to marry Barney
in a big church wedding.
We're going to move
to some sleepy New Hampshire town
and open a bed-and-breakfast.
- Really?
- No!
It's Barney.
I mean...
it's Barney.
But it's Barney.
I got to tell him no.
Oh, man, you're going
to break his...
Whatever it is that pumps
that black sludge through his veins.
Crap. You're right.
The first time Barney
expresses feelings for a girl
and she rejects him?
And not just any girl. I mean...
It will destroy him.
Okay, well, first of all...
Second of all,
there is a maneuver you can try.
It's high-risk,
but it's also high-reward.
For lack of a better term,
I'm going to call it...
- The Mosby.
- The Mosby?
No, she couldn't Mosby him.
- She could Mosby the crap out of him.
- What's the Mosby?
Robin, you remember
your first date with Ted?
You wanted to hop on the T-train
and take a ride downtown.
I was ready to jump that turnstile.
What changed all that?
I think I'm in love with you.
What?
The Mosby!
- That is genius.
- Thank you.
And...
excuse me.
I mean, you're very pretty,
but you're freakishly tall,
and you don't believe in ghosts.
So, when she said she thinks
she's in love with me,
she meant the opposite.
Exactly.
And look how well it worked.
You're back to normal.
Yes. Yes, I am.
And it is great.
It's awesome.
- So, Robin's not in love with me.
- Nope.
Why not?
Mr. Goat?
Mr. Goat?
That's it.
Stupid goat.
I do not understand your
fascination with this washcloth.
I guess that's what happens
when you have a brain the size of a...
Marshall, can you just go get Ted?
Lily, I was just about to jump.
Didn't you hear me saying "Okay"
over and over again?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Go ahead and jump.
No, it's fine.
Sorry, everybody.
Lily won't let me jump.
Thank God.
Hospital!
What happened exactly?
What happened is
you let a freaking wild animal
into our apartment.
I was savaged.
That is the sweetest, cutest
little goat in the whole world.
Sweetest, cutest little goat
in the whole world?
<i>I was pretty sleep-deprived
at this point,</i>
<i>so this probably isn't
how it really happened,</i>
<i>but here's how I rember it.</i>
So, you're the guy who tried
to make it with a goat?
If anything, that goat
tried to make it with me.
- Can I go, please?
- Sure, you can go.
But remember, buddy,
"baa" means "baa."
Great. Great. Now I'm going to be late
for my presentation.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Goat.
Mr. Goat? Ted, that goat's a girl.
- Her name's Missy.
- You got beat up by a girl.
So.
- You're in love with me.
- What? Yeah. Very much.
Okay, you can knock it off.
Lily told me.
Damn it.
I can't believe you would do that.
It's just...
Like, I care about you, Barney.
And...
This kind of stuff,
the emotional stuff?
It's not your thing.
I thought I'd save you the trouble.
Maybe I don't want
to be saved the trouble.
Maybe I want the trouble.
I haven't wanted the trouble
in a long time.
But with you, the trouble
doesn't seem so...
troubling.
I don't know.
I thought...
I guess I thought
you felt the same way.
Maybe I do.
I don't know.
I'm not exactly the biggest
confronter of feelings.
I mean, clearly, there's
something between us.
Maybe my head was saying,
"Nip it in the bud"
because my heart was...
saying something else.
Look...
I have feelings for you, Barney.
Maybe I even love you.
This is going pretty fast,
don't you think?
- What?
- We have a good friendship going.
Why screw up a good thing?
Friends?
Friends.
My God. You just did it again.
You just Mosby'd me.
- I did not.
- You did. You little minx.
Okay, you're right.
I did just Mosby you.
Why are you so afraid
of giving this a chance?
Because I am scared
of how much I like you.
This is a bad idea.
You're right.
This is a mistake.
- Yes. No.
- I love you.
- Let's be friends.
- Friends, then.
- I love you.
- Let's get married.
- No, you're smothering me.
- Okay, forget it.
You know what?
We can sort this out later.
- That sounds good.
- That sounds good. Let's go.
<i>It had been a long and crazy night,</i>
<i>but that morning, against all odds,</i>
<i>I made it to my presentation.</i>
Here you have it, gentlemen.
Rib Town.
Right?
Right?
Ted, listen. You're great,
and you've done a real...
special job here,
and you're going to make
some other restaurant
very happy someday,
but...
we have...
decided to go...
another direction here.
What?
Feast your eyes on...
Rib Town!
Sven.
I'll tell you one thing.
I'm never eating ribs again.
Yeah, right.
I am never...
eating ribs...
again!
In front of Ted!
This is a disaster.
How am I going
to come back from this?
Okay, I'm just going to ask this.
Do you really want
to come back from this?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Architecture is killing you, Ted,
and it's killing us to watch it
killing you.
You're like that goat
with the washcloth.
You want it so bad,
and every time the world tries
to take it away from you,
you keep grabbing it.
But you know what?
It's just a washcloth.
Why do you even want it?
Because I have to be an architect.
That's...
That's the plan.
Screw the plan.
I planned on being a famous artist.
Marshall planned on being
an environmental lawyer.
Robin planned on
being a TV reporter.
I am a TV reporter.
I'm on every morning at 4:00 a.m.
Is that still on?
Good for you.
Somebody watch it, please.
Barney planned on being a violinist.
Don't tell me things.
You can't design your life
like a building.
It doesn't work that way.
You just have to live it,
and it will design itself.
So, what, I should just do nothing?
Listen to what the world
is telling you to do
and take the leap.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I love you, Lily.
Metaphorical leap.
Metaphorical leap!
- Not cool.
- Don't do it.
Not cool.
- I did it!
- Baby, you did it.
- I can do anything!
- Yes, you can.
I'm getting a motorcycle!
You absolutely are not!
Okay, sorry.
Guys, come on over.
<i>That was the year
I got left at the altar.</i>
<i>It was the year I got knocked out
by a crazy bartender.</i>
<i>The year I got fired.</i>
<i>The year I got beat up by a goat.</i>
<i>A girl goat, at that.</i>
<i>And damn it if it wasn't
the best year of my life.</i>
<i>Because, if any one of those things
hadn't happened,</i>
<i>I never would have ended up and turned
out to be the best job I ever had.</i>
<i>But more importantly,</i>
<i>I wouldn't have met your mother,</i>
<i>because, as you know...</i>
<i>she was in that class.</i>
<i>Of course, that story
is only just beginning.</i>
<i>Les enfants, pour mon premier jour
en tant que professeur,</i>
<i>j'aurais aimé savoir deux choses.</i>
<i>La première, que votre mère
était dans cette classe.</i>
<i>La seconde ?</i>
<i>Pour l'expliquer,
il faut revenir au début de l'été,</i>
<i>quand, après un an à lutter
contre leurs sentiments réciproques,</i>
<i>Barney et Robin ont enfin...</i>
- Fais ton "whoo" d'intérieur.
- Désolée !
Ils se sont embrassés !
C'est enfin un couple.
Mon Dieu !
C'est notre premier double rencard !
Et c'est que le premier !
Et si nos enfants se mariaient ?
J'adore ça !
Lily, écoute.
Barney est grandiose.
Robin est plus que grand-iose.
Elle est mega-iose.
Elle est giga-iose.
Tu veux dire quoi ?
On le sent pas comme ça
pour l'instant.
Mais on restera amis.
C'est de ma faute ?
Dieu, non. Lily, c'est pas toi.
- C'est nous.
- Ouais. Nous.
Tu comprends, non ?
Bien sûr.
Tant que vous êtes heureux,
je le suis.
On aurait pris
des cours de cuisine ensemble
et on serait allé camper ensemble
et ensuite, on se serait assis
pour raconter des anecdotes
sur nos cours de cuisine
et nos voyages en camping.
Je sais bien.
Alors, le bateau
vogue vers du sexe ce soir ou...
<i>Après ça,
l'été est passé bien trop vite.</i>
<i>Quand soudain, c'était le vendredi
précédant ma rentrée de professeur.</i>
C'est quoi ?
C'est un petit cadeau qu'on te fait
appartenant
au meilleur professeur de l'histoire.
Un feutre.
Je suis Indiana Jones !
Ceci, mon ami,
est le Dominateur 8 000,
le meilleur fouet du marché,
selon mon vendeur de fouets.
Oui, j'ai un vendeur de fouets.
- Tu sais ce qu'on devrait faire ?
- Finir nos verres,
sortir dans l'allée,
et fouetter des trucs.
Tu me comprends.
Je dois y aller. J'ai un rencard.
- Tu vois encore ce type ?
- Mieux, je le vois nu.
J'y vais aussi.
J'ai chopé une Chinoise hier.
Je sais pas, c'est bizarre.
Je me sens de remettre ça.
- Tu as le premier coup !
- Très bien.
L'andouille.
J'ai dit quoi pour la clope ?
Fouette-lui sa dépendance !
Ce fouet m'excite !
J'ai la fièvre du fouet !
Fouette-le !
Ne vise même pas !
Fouette-le !
- Désolé.
- Le fouet, c'est pas un jouet.
On appelle ça le bon sens.
- Fouette-moi, si tu veux.
- Promis, une autre fois.

Merci à mpm et Collioure !
.:: La Fabrique ::.
Ça dure depuis combien de temps ?
Tout l'été.
Je le savais !
Vous formez un couple.
- Un couple ?
- Non. Lily...
- Calme-toi, Lilypad.
- Ouais.
Vous avez passé l'été ensemble.
Je capte pas.
Je t'explique.
Après s'être embrassés,
on s'est assis pour en parler.
- On devrait faire une mise au point.
- Oui, on devrait.
Ou...
Ou...
Maintenant,
on doit faire une mise au point.
Oui, on doit la faire.
Ou...
On a essayé d'avoir cette discussion
puis on a compris qu'on détestait ça.
Ouais, c'est naze.
Il faut discuter.
Et faire : "Je sais pas.
C'est pas que je t'aime pas.
"J'ai juste pas eu de relation
depuis très longtemps.
"J'espère que ça ne t'embête pas."
Qui a besoin de ça ?
Toi.
Vous pouvez pas continuer comme ça
sans au moins essayer
de définir vos sentiments.
On savait que tu dirais ça.
C'est pour ça qu'on a rien dit.
Ça et le fait que fabuler
nous excite à mort.
Vous devez définir la relation.
Vous devez en parler.
Ou...
Ou...
Je sais ce que vous pensez.
"Qui est ce gars de mon âge
debout dans la salle ?"
Même si c'est écrit professeur Mosby,
pour vous,
je suis Ted.
Une question. Génial.
- Balance.
- Voilà ma question,
"Ted". Pour qui tu te prends ?
On doit apprendre de toi ?
T'es un architecte raté !
Et si t'es prof,
où sont ton chapeau et ton fouet ?
À la maison.
Et ton pantalon ?
Mon Dieu.
C'était horrible. J'étais prof et...
C'est pas le moment.
Où sont tes capotes ?
Je pête un cable.
J'y arriverai jamais.
La première erreur
fut de répondre à cette fille.
On donne pas la parole le 1er jour.
C'est un signe de faiblesse.
La deuxième,
t'aurais dû te la taper.
T'étais en caleçon,
avec un amphi entier pour t'encourager
et elle peut pas tomber en cloque,
car c'est un rêve.
La leçon est terminée.
Erreur n° 3 : où était le chapeau ?
Si tu le portes pas, je le récupère.
Barney veut dire
qu'il est important de fixer les règles.
Tu es leur prof, pas leur ami.
Exactement.
Si leur place n'est pas claire,
personne n'y gagne.
Amen.
- Tu dois clarifier les choses.
- Courez le dire !
Définis la relation.
Lily, aparté.
Laisse-nous être heureux.
Tu ne l'es pas.
Tu penses l'être
parce que tu te sens heureux.
- C'est pas ça, être heureux ?
- Bien sûr que non.
Vous devez en discuter.
Pourquoi ? Donne-moi une raison.
- Je t'en donne vingt...
- T'en trouves même pas une.
Phares. Lapin.
Pour la dernière fois,
entre moi et Robin,
ça se passe du mieux possible.
Brad est là.
J'ai deux billets
pour le match de demain soir.
Tu es fan de hockey,
donc je me suis dit...
Qu'est-ce que je dois faire ?
Te menacer ?
- T'offrir une tablette de chocolat ?
- Allons, Brad...
Appétissante, la tablette.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Pourquoi ? T'as un mec ?
- Non, pas de mec.
- Super ! C'est réglé alors.
J'ai trouvé une raison.
<i>La nuit suivante,
Robin et Brad sont allés au match.</i>
Tu te demandes sûrement
pourquoi j'ai rien dit de la soirée.
Bordel, Hordichuk !
Rate encore une offrande comme ça
et je descends t'en coller une
dans ta tronche d'alcoolo !
Pas vraiment.
Honnêtement, je trouve ça bizarre
de sortir avec toi.
- Tu veux en discuter ?
- Quoi ?
Non, tant mieux.
Mettons-ça au clair.
Je cherche du sérieux.
Avant d'aller plus loin,
un truc à savoir sur mon entre-jambes.
Je suis né un peu différent.
- C'est à propos de Barney et moi.
- Barney et toi...
- Alors, vous êtes...
- On l'ignore encore.
Mon coeur dit : fonce.
Mon cerveau dit : mauvaise idée.
Vous devriez en discuter.
On n'aura pas la discussion !
Mais ayez cette discussion !
C'est l'histoire de cinq minutes
et tu fais l'amour après.
C'est génial ! Soutiens-moi, Ted.
- Je la trouve pas nécessaire.
- Quoi ?
Merci, Ted.
Car Robin est déjà sa petite amie.
Quoi ?
Au MacLaren's, il y a quatre ans...
Comment éviter qu'une fille
ne devienne ta nana ?
Facile. Les règles pour les filles
et les gremlins sont les mêmes.
- Les gremlins ?
- Les gremlins. Règle n° 1 :
ne jamais les mouiller.
En d'autres termes,
la laisse jamais se doucher chez toi.
N° 2 : les garder dans l'obscurité,
c.-à-d. ne les vois jamais
pendant la journée.
Et règle n° 3 :
ne jamais les nourrir après minuit.
Elle ne dort jamais chez toi
et pas de petit-déj' avec elle.
Jamais.
Et les brunchs, c'est cool ?
Non, Ted. C'est pas cool.
Nouveau sujet.
Comment choisir une cravate ?
Facile : souviens-toi
dans le film <i>Predator</i>...
J'ai fait ces trois choses
avec Robin.
Est-elle ma petite amie ?
Juste une fois,
appelez-moi pour une soirée Smoking.
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,
préparez vos lèvres</i>
<i>pour la caméra-bisou
des New York Rangers !</i>
Le bisou !
Écoute.
Embrasse-moi et si tu te sens coupable,
c'est que tu dois être avec Barney.
Pourquoi pas ? Viens là.
Ne nous battons pas ainsi.
On a chacun notre chance.
Faisons la paix.
C'est bon, mec. Je devrais pas
embrasser la copine d'un autre.
- Copine ? Attends.
- Tu pousses le bouchon.
Tu vas loin. C'est pas ma copine.
Copine, c'est un peu fort, Brad.
Sérieusement.
On en est à la violence physique !
- Vous pouvez avoir cette discussion ?
- À cause de ça ?
Voyons, c'est mon péché mignon.
Je suis toujours à frapper des gars,
des filles...
Je frapperais un bébé.
Peu importe.
<i>Enfin, mon premier cours est arrivé.</i>
<i>Le vrai, cette fois.
Je devais faire forte impression.</i>
<i>J'avais pensé à tout.
Sauf...</i>
<i>Professeur, un ou deux "F" ?</i>
<i>Professeur.</i>
<i>Proffesseur.</i>
<i>Ils me regardent tous. Professeur</i>.
<i>Je sais pas. Fais quelque chose.</i>
<i>Deux "F".</i>
<i>Ça a l'air bon.
Ça doit être ça.</i>
Désolé, j'ai été trop loin hier.
Tant que je dis pas <i>flügelhorn</i>,
tu peux y aller.
Non, je parlais de Brad.
C'est bon. Ne t'en fais pas.
Mince.
La poignée est cassée.
On est enfermés.
C'est toi qui as fait ça ?
<i>Flügelhorn.</i> C'est toi ?
Ted, t'es là ?
Ted n'est pas là, Robin.
Laisse-nous sortir.
Je voudrais bien.
Dès que Barney et toi aurez discuté.
Lily, allez. Laisse-nous sortir.
Non. Asseyez-vous,
définissez votre relation,
écrivez-la sur un bout de papier,
glissez-la sous la porte,
et si ça me va, vous pourrez sortir.
- On n'aura pas cette discussion !
- Alors vous mourrez là-dedans.
Tu vas nous enfermer ?
Devine quoi ?
On va peut-être passer
la journée à faire l'amour !
Devine quoi ?
Marshall est avec moi,
on va peut-être faire pareil.
<i>J'avais toujours pas décidé
quel professeur je voulais être.</i>
<i>Quelqu'un d'autoritaire ou de cool.</i>
<i>Je pensais décider sur le moment.</i>
<i>Et je l'ai fait. Environ 20 fois.</i>
Bonjour à tous.
Ça roule ?
Silence !
C'est "Architecture 101".
Je suis le professeur Mosby.
Vous pouvez m'appeler Ted.
Professeur Mosby.
T-Dog.
Ne m'appelez pas T-Dog.
Ne donne pas la parole le 1er jour.
C'est un signe de faiblesse.
Aussi, ne regarde pas ici.
Bonne chance. À plus.
<i>On y était,</i>
<i>le moment décisif.</i>
<i>Quel genre de professeur serai-je ?</i>
<i>Je devais décider.</i>
Gardez vos questions
pour la fin du cours.
Merci !
<i>Le professeur Mosby était arrivé.</i>
<i>Bien sûr,
si j'avais écouté cette fille...</i>
<i>Qui, au passage,
n'était pas votre mère...</i>
<i>Votre mère était assise...</i>
<i>Laissez-moi finir rapidement.</i>
<i>Voici ce qu'elle aurait dit.</i>
Désolée de vous couper,
mais ce n'est pas
"Architecture 101".
C'est "Économie 305".
Vous êtes dans la mauvaise salle.
<i>Oui, je m'étais trompé de salle.</i>
<i>Et ainsi commencèrent les 7 minutes
les plus humiliantes de ma vie.</i>
Voici la pensée du jour.
Chaque personne ici présente...
est déjà un architecte.
Architecte ?
"On traîne ensemble".
On traîne ensemble ?
Pas suffisant.
Pas suffisant !
Quelqu'un peut-il me dire
de quel sujet traite ce cours ?
D'économie ?
Ne riez pas.
Il n'a pas complètement tort.
Un architecte doit être économique
dans son utilisation de l'espace,
donc...
bien joué.
On dirait bien que quelqu'un
est en train de se construire
une bonne note.
"On voit où ça nous mène".
Je vais vous dire
vers où ça ne vous mène pas...
Hors de cette chambre.
Pas suffisant.
Pas suffisant !
- Pourquoi veux-tu être architecte ?
- Je veux pas être architecte.
Oui. Exactement.
C'est pas de la volonté.
C'est une nécessité.
Vous n'avez pas le choix.
Aucun d'entre vous ne l'a.
Pas de question !
"Nous sommes Barnman & Robin."
Tu dois admettre
que c'est plutôt marrant.
Pas suffisant.
Pas suffisant !
Si l'un d'entre vous
a la moindre envie
de faire autre chose de sa vie
qu'architecte,
vous me faites perdre mon temps
et le vôtre.
La porte est là.
Libre à vous.
Sérieusement. Sortez !
Partez pas tous !
L'architecture, c'est sympa !
- J'ai apporté un footbag !
- Excusez mon retard.
Je suis le professeur Calzonetti.
C'est économie 305.
Vous pouvez vous rasseoir.
Désolé.
Ici, c'est architecture 101.
Qui a invité son père ?
Jeune homme, ces 28 dernières années,
économie 305 a été enseigné ici,
bâtiment 14, salle 7.
Je suis certain
que 200 apprentis architectes
et leur prof
se sont tous trompés de salle.
T-Dog. Tu t'es trompé de salle, mec.
Les étudiants, laissez passer.
Désolé, chaud devant.
Pardon.
20 minutes de retard
le premier jour ?
C'est dur.
Attends le plus drôle.
<i>Je n'avais pas eu le temps de penser
à quel genre de prof j'allais être.</i>
<i>Je leur ai juste parlé
d'architecture.</i>
- Et c'était plutôt super.
- C'est génial, Ted.
- Félicitations.
- Merci.
Bien joué, Ted.
Tapes-en cinq à la porte !
- Tu l'as fait ?
- Oui, mon pote.
Ils ont toujours pas discuté ?
Je crois savoir
comment accélérer les choses.
Pas sympa !
Pancakes, bacon frais.
C'est tellement bon !
Je meurs de faim...
Ayons cette discussion débile.
- Allez.
- Bon.
Comment ça marche ?
Que doit-on dire ?
"Où crois-tu que ça va nous mener ?"
Mon Dieu, ça a l'air trop nul.
- N'est-ce pas ?
- Complètement.
Sinon, où crois-tu
que ça va nous mener ?
Je sais pas.
C'est pas que je t'apprécie pas.
Mais j'ai pas eu de copine
depuis très longtemps.
- J'espère que tu m'en veux pas.
- T'en vouloir ?
Je ressens la même chose.
Je suis nulle question relations.
Enfin, à part avec Ted.
Il a vraiment tout compris.
Je sais que ça fait cliché, mais...
il m'a dégoûté des autres hommes.
<i>Bien sûr, je n'ai pas assisté
à cette conversation,</i>
<i>mais j'imagine qu'elle a dit
quelque chose du genre.</i>
On devrait peut-être
redevenir simples amis.
Peut-être.
Mais...
- Je veux pas qu'on arrête le sexe.
- Super, moi non plus.
- L'amitié, ça va pas le faire.
- Nan.
On est pas doués en amitié,
ni en relations.
On est bons à quoi ?
Je sais à quoi.
Si on remet ça,
il va me falloir du Red Bull ou...
Non, pas ça.
Mentir, penses-y.
On leur a menti tout l'été.
Pourquoi ne pas continuer ?
Vraiment ?
Oui, on s'est posés.
On a discuté.
Barney est mon petit ami.
Et Robin est ma petite amie.
Je sais que ça a l'air dingue,
mais ça fait du bien de le dire.
On a tous les deux peur de s'engager,
mais...
le fait est qu'on ne peut pas vivre
l'un sans l'autre.
Si la seule solution est de se séparer,
alors il faut tenter le coup, car...
elle est géniale.
Et il est génial.
- Il est classe en costard.
- Elle tient l'alcool.
C'est mon petit ami.
Et c'est ma petite amie.
Suffisant !
- Elle a marché.
- Elle a mordu à l'hameçon.
- On est bons.
- Carrément.
On va petit-déjeuner ?
En fait, le brunch,
c'est pas si mal.
Je te suis, mon mignon.
- <i>Flügelhorn</i>.
- Ça sonnait faux.
Tu sais qu'ils mentaient, non ?
Ils ne réalisent pas
qu'ils n'ont pas menti.
Salut.
Bonsoir.
Salut. Te lève pas.
On s'est pas vus sur un yacht ?
Quoi ?
Je vous ai pas dit
que c'était soirée Smoking ?
C'est pas sympa, hein ?
<i>Kids, on my first day
as a college professor,</i>
<i>there were two things
I didn't know that I wish I did.</i>
<i>The first thing was that your mother
was in that classroom.</i>
<i>The second thing?</i>
<i>To explain that, we have to go back
to the beginning of the summer,</i>
<i>when, after a year of wrestling
with their feelings for each other,</i>
<i>Barney and Robin finally, well...</i>
- Use your indoor "whoo".
- Sorry!
It's just they kissed!
They're finally a couple.
Oh, my God, you guys!
This is our first double date!
First of millions!
What if our kids get married!
I love this!
Lily, listen.
- Barney's awesome.
- Robin's more than just awe-"some".
She's awe-"quite a bit".
She's awe-"a whole darn lot".
Wait, what are you saying?
We're just not feeling it right now.
But we'll totally still be friends.
Is it something I did?
God, no.
Lily, it's not you.
- It's... It's us.
- Yeah. It's us.
You understand, right?
Sure, of course.
As long as you're happy, I'm happy.
We were gonna take
cooking lessons together
and we were gonna go
on camping trips together
and then we were gonna sit around
telling funny stories
about our cooking lessons
and our camping trips.
I know, I know.
So, has the boat sailed
on sex tonight or...
<i>After that, the summer
went by way too fast.</i>
<i>Until the Friday before my first day
as a college professor.</i>
What's this?
It's just a little something
that we got for you
that used to belong
to my favorite professor of all time.
A fedora.
I'm Indiana Jones!
I'm Indiana Jones!
That, my friend,
is the Dominator 8000,
the best bullwhip on the market,
according to my whip guy.
Yeah, I have a whip guy.
- You know what we should do?
- Finish our drinks,
go out in the alley, and whip stuff.
God, you just get me.
I should get going.
I got a date.
- Are you still seeing that guy?
- Even better, seeing him naked.
I should go, too. I hooked up
with this Chinese girl last night,
and I don't know, it's weird.
I already feel like seconds.
Okay, Ted, you got first whip!
All right.
Hey, dummy.
What did tell you
about smoking in here?
Make him whip the habit!
I'so excited about this whip!
I got whip fever!
Just whip him, Ted!
Don't even aim!
Just whip him!
- I am so sorry.
- No, it's just the whip's not a toy.
There's such a thing
as common sense.
- You can whip me if you want.
- I will, some other time.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-
So, how long has this been going on?
All summer.
I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it!
You guys are boyfriend
and girlfriend.
- Girlfriend?
- No. Lily...
- Slow your roll there, Lilypad.
- Yeah.
You've been together all summer.
I don't get it.
Okay, it's like this.
After we kissed,
we sat down to have the talk.
- We should figure out what this is.
- Yes, we should.
Or.
Or...
Okay, now, we have
to figure this out.
Yes, we do.
Or. Or...
We kept trying to have the talk
and then we realized we hate the talk.
Yeah, the talk sucks.
You have to, like, talk.
And be all, "I don't know.
It's not that I don't like you.
"It's that I haven't had
a girlfriend in a really long time.
"I hope it doesn't make you mad."
Who needs it?
You needs it.
Guys, you can't just keep hooking up
and not at least try and figure out
what you mean to each other.
Yeah, we knew you would say that.
That's why we kept it a secret.
Well, that and the fact
that elaborate lies really turn us on.
You need to define the relationship.
You need to have the talk.
Or...
Or...
I know what you're all thinking.
"Who's this cool peer of mine
up in front the class?"
Well, I know the board
says "Professor Mosby," but to you
I'm Ted
Question. Awesome.
- Hit it.
- Yeah, here's my question.
"Ted", who the hell
do you think you are?
Yeah, "Ted".
We're supposed to learn from you?
You failed as an architect.
- Well...
- And if you're a professor,
- where's your hat and your whip?
- At home...
And where are your pants?
Oh, God.
It was awful.
I was teaching...
Ted, now's not a good time.
Where do you keep your condoms?
I'm freaking out,
I don't think I can do that.
Okay, look, mistake n°1
was taking that girl's question.
You don't take questions
on the first day. It shows weakness.
Mistake n°2
was you should've hit that.
Your pants were already off,
you had a classroom full
of people to cheer you on,
and you don't knock her up
'cause it's a dream.
Class dismissed.
Mistake n°3:
dude, where was the hat?
Because if you're not gonna wear it,
I'm taking it back.
I think what Barney's saying
is that definitions are important.
You're their teacher,
not their friend.
Exactly.
If people don't know their place,
nobody's happy.
Amen.
- You have to make things clear.
- Ron tell dat.
Define the relationship.
Lily, private convo time.
Can't you just let us be happy?
You're not happy.
You just think you're happy
because you feel happy.
- And that's not happy?
- Of course not.
You and Robin need to have the talk.
Why? Give me one good reason.
- I'll give you 20...
- You can't even think of one.
Headlights. Deer.
Lily, for the last time,
things with me and Robin
are as good as they can possibly be.
Brad's here.
I've got 2 tickets to the Rangers
vs Canucksame tomorrow night.
I know you're a hockey fan,
so I was thinking...
What do I have to do?
Put a gun to your head?
- Buy you a six pack?
- Come on, Brad, that's...
There's really six of them.
- I can't.
- Why not? You have a boyfriend?
- No, no boyfriend.
- Great! It's a date.
I just thought of a reason.
<i>The next night, Robin and Brad
went to a hockey game.</i>
You're probably wondering
why I've been quiet all night.
Damn it, Hordichuk!
You miss another gimme like that,
I'm gonna come down there
and put a slapper right up
your beerhole! Come on!
Not really.
The truth is, I feel kind of weird
being out with you.
Oh, man.
Is this the talk?
- What?
- No, this is good.
Let's get it all out of the way.
I'm looking for something serious.
- No, Brad, no, it's...
- But before we go any further,
you should know something
about my stuff below the belt.
I was born a little different.
God, no!
- This is about me and Barney.
- You and Barn...
- So you, you guys are...
- Well, we don't know what we are.
I mean, my heart says
"leap into it".
My brain says "it's a bad idea".
Sounds like
you need to have the talk.
We're not gonna have the talk!
Would you just have the talk, okay?
It's a five-minute conversation,
and then you get
to have sex afterwards.
It's great! Back me up, Ted.
- I don't think the talk is necessary.
- What?
Thank you, Ted.
Because Robin
is already his girlfriend.
What?!
MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...
How do you keep a girl
from becoming your girlfriend.
Simple: the rules for girls
are the same as the rules for gremlins.
- "Gremlins"?
- Gremlins. Rule n°1:
never get them wet.
In other words, don't let her
take a shower at your place.
N°2: keep them away from sunlight,
i.e. don't ever see them
during the day.
And rule n°3:
never feed them after midnight.
Meaning she doesn't sleep over
and you don't have breakfast
with her, ever.
What about brunch?
Is brunch cool?
No, Ted.
Brunch is not cool.
OK, new topic.
How do I pick a tie?
Simple: remember
in the movie <i>Predator...</i>
I've done all three of those things
with Robin.
Is she my girlfriend?
Just once, I wish you guys
would call me on Tuxedo Night.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
time to pucker up</i>
<i>for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam!</i>
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
OK, how about this? If you kiss me
and you feel bad about it,
you're meant to be with Barney.
Why not?
Lay it on me.
Hey, Brad.
We can't fight like this!
We both got some good shots in.
Let's call a truce!
It's okay, dude.
I shouldn't kiss
other guy's girlfriend.
- Girlfriend? Come on.
- That's putting it a bit strongly.
A bit strongly.
She's not my girlfriend.
A girlfriend's a bit much,
Brad, okay?
Okay, seriously.
We're at the point
of physical violence.
Now, will you please have the talk?
Because of that?
Come on. That's my thing.
I'm always punching guys.
Girls... I'll punch a baby.
I don't care.
<i>Finally, my first class had arrived.</i>
<i>For real this time.</i>
<i>I knew I had to make
a strong impression.</i>
<i>I had thought of everything.</i>
<i>Except...</i>
<i>Wait. Does professor
have one "F" or two?</i>
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Professor.</i>
<i>Pro-fess-or.</i>
<i>They're all staring at me.
Professor.</i>
<i>I don't know.
Just do something!</i>
<i>Two "F's."</i>
<i>That looks right.</i>
<i>I think that's right.</i>
Sorry, I went
a little too far last night.
We've been over this.
Unless I say "flügelhorn",
you haven't gone too far.
No, I meant punching Brad.
Right. Look,
don't even worry about it.
God.
The doorknob's broken off.
We're locked in here.
Did you do this?
Flügelhorn.
Did you do this?
Are you out there?
Ted's not here, Robin.
Let us out of here.
I'd be glad to.
Just as soon as you
and Barney have the talk.
Lily! Come on.
Let us out!
No. Sit down,
define the relationship,
write down that definition
on a piece of paper,
slip it under the door,
and if I like what I read,
you can go.
- We are not having the talk!
- Then you'll die in there.
You're gonna lock us in here?
Guess what?
Maybe we'll spend
the whole day having sex!
Well, guess what?
I brought Marshall with me,
so maybe we'll do the same.
Hey, guys.
<i>I still hadn't decided
what kind of professor I wanted to be.</i>
<i>Authoritative or cool guy.</i>
<i>I thought I would decide
in the moment.</i>
<i>And I did. About 20 times.</i>
Good morning.
'sup, dudes?
Silence!
This is architecture 101.
I am professor Mosby.
But you can call me Ted.
Professor Mosby.
T-Dawg.
Do not call me T-Dawg.
Never take questions
on the first day.
It shows weakness.
Also, don't look right here.
Okay, good luck. Byesies.
<i>This was it,</i>
<i>my crossroads moment.</i>
<i>What kind of professor
was I gonna be?</i>
<i>I had to decide.</i>
Please save all your questions
until the end of the lecture.
Thank you!
<i>Professor Mosby had arrived.</i>
<i>Of course,
if I had taken that girl's question...</i>
<i>Who, by the way, was not your mom...</i>
<i>Your mom was sitting...</i>
<i>Wait, let me finish
this story real quick.</i>
<i>Here's what that girl
would have said.</i>
I'm sorry to bother you,
professor Mosby,
but this isn't architecture 101.
This is economics 305.
You're in the wrong classroom.
<i>Yes, I was in the wrong classroom.</i>
<i>And thus began the most humiliating
seven minutes of my life.</i>
Here's your think-about-it
for the day.
Every single person in this room...
is already an architect.
Architect?
"We're just hanging out."
Just hanging out?
Not good enough.
Not good enough!
Can anyone here tell me
what this class is really all about?
Economics?
Don't laugh.
He's not...
He's not entirely wrong.
An architect must be economical
in his use of space,
so...
well done.
Looks like someone's
building towards an A, huh?
"We're seeing
where things are going."
I'll tell you
where things aren't going...
Out of that bedroom.
Not good enough.
Not good enough!
You...
Why do you want to be an architect?
I don't want to be an architect.
Yes. Yes, exactly.
It's not something you want to be.
It's something you need to be.
You don't have a choice, right?
None of you has a choice.
No questions!
"We're Barnman and Robin."
Come on, you got to admit,
that's kind of funny.
Not good enough.
Not good enough!
So if any of you
have even the slightest inclination
to do anything with your life
other than become an architect,
you're wasting my time and yours.
There's the door.
You can go.
I'm serious.
Get out. Now!
Wait!
Don't all leave!
Architecture's fun!
- I brought a hacky sack!
- Sorry I'm late, everyone.
My name is professor Calzonetti.
This is economics 305.
You may return to your seats.
Sorry.
This is architecture 101.
Who invited their dad, right?
Young man, for the last 28 years,
economics 305
has been taught right here,
in building 14, room 7.
Buddy, I'm sure
200 architecture students
and their professor
all got the room wrong.
T-Dawg,
you're in the wrong room, bro.
College kids, I'm on my way.
Sorry. Coming through.
Excuse me.
20 minutes late on your first day?
- That's rough.
- But here's the funny thing.
<i>I didn't have time</i>
<i>to think about what teacher
I was going to be. I just...</i>
<i>got up there
and talked about architecture.</i>
- And it was kind of great.
- That's awesome, Ted.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Nice job, Ted.
Ted, door five!
- Were you there?
- I got you, buddy.
They still haven't had the talk.
I think I know
how to speed things up.
Not cool!
Pancakes, fresh bacon.
It is so yummy.
Dude, I'm starving. Let's...
Let's just have the stupid talk.
- Come on.
- Fine.
How do these things even work?
What do we say?
"Where do you see
this relationship going?"
Oh, my God, that sounds so cheesy.
I know, right?
Totally.
But where do you see
this relationship going?
I don't know.
It's not like I don't like you.
I just haven't had
a girlfriend for a long time.
- I hope that doesn't make you mad.
- Mad?
I feel the same way.
I suck at relationships.
I mean, except with Ted.
Man, he really got it right.
I know it's a cliché, but...
he really ruined me for other men.
<i>Of course, I wasn't in the room
for this conversation,</i>
<i>but I have to imagine Robin
said something like that.</i>
Maybe we should go back
to being just friends.
Maybe.
But...
- I don't want to stop having sex.
- Good. Me, neither.
- Friends isn't gonna work.
- Nope.
We're not good at being friends,
at being in a relationship.
What are we good at?
I know something.
If we'll do it again,
I'll need some Gatorade, or...
No, not that.
Lying, think about it.
We spent the whole summer lying.
Why not just keep lying?
Really?
Really. We sat down.
We had the talk.
- Barney's my boyfriend now.
- And Robin's my girlfriend.
I know it sounds nuts,
but it feels good to say.
We're both afraid
of commitment, but...
the fact is,
we also can't live without each other.
And if the alternative
is not being together,
then it's worth taking
this risk 'cause...
she's awesome.
And he's awesome.
- He looks nice in a suit.
- She can handle her scotch.
He's my boyfriend.
And she's my girlfriend.
Good enough!
She bought it.
Hook, line, and sinker.
We are good.
Totally.
You want to get some breakfast?
Brunch actually
does sound kind of good.
Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.
Flügelhorn.
Yeah, that felt wrong.
You realize they were lying, right?
No, Ted.
They don't realize
they weren't lying.
Hello. Good evening.
Hello. Don't get up.
Didn't we meet on a yacht?
What?
Did I not tell you guys
that it was Tuxedo night?
Doesn't feel very good, does it?
<i>C'est l'histoire
de deux blind dates.</i>
<i>L'une en 2009...</i>
<i>Et l'autre, sept ans plus tôt.</i>
<i>Durant cette période,
mes techniques n'avaient pas évolué...</i>
<i>... jusqu'à l'automne 2009,
où j'ai eu un rendez-vous différent.</i>
<i>Car c'était exactement le même.</i>
<i>J'avais rendez-vous avec la même femme
que lors du précédent, 7 ans plus tôt.</i>
Enchantée.
<i>Et elle ne se souvenait pas.
Mais là encore...</i>
Enchanté.

- Allons-y.

Devinez qui a 4 tickets
pour l'exposition
"Les origines de Chewbacca" ?
Pourquoi ?
- J'ai dit : "devinez qui" ?
- Je sais.
C'est pas un peu tôt
dans notre relation
pour faire un truc
qui y mettrait fin ?
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Ça sera notre première sortie à quatre !
Ça a l'air génial !
Le vrai Chewbacca sera là ?
Peter Mayhew, tout en poil.
Qui vient ?
Y aura des dicos Wookie-Français ?
Même un simple livre
d'expressions courantes serait utile.
On va pas à l'exposition
"Les origines de Chewbacca".
C'est à Houston cette année.
C'est connu.
Je voulais
me débarrasser des filles.
Où tu m'emmènes ?
<i>C'était pas la première fois
que Barney kidnappait l'un de nous.</i>
Attends un peu.
"Les origines de Chewbacca",
c'est à Montréal cette année.
C'est connu.
Où tu m'emmènes ?
Mon pote du tribunal nous a dégoté
des places pour une injection létale !
Mais avant, on va manger un hot-dog.
Arrêtez !
Où tu m'emmènes ?
Pourquoi on est là ?
Maintenant que je suis avec Robin,
j'ai beaucoup appris sur les couples
en vous regardant, Lily et toi.
- Merci, mec.
- Vous êtes un couple épouvantable.
Lily t'a retiré toute virilité.
je pensais que c'était commun.
Robin et moi,
ça prouve qu'on peut avoir une copine
et des organes génitaux fonctionnels
en même temps.
Donc, si Robin savait que tu es ici,
ça la dérangerait pas ?
Tu plaisantes ?
Elle accourerait
avec un tas de petites coupures
et un poncho
pour le show gélatine de 22 h 30.
Au fait, j'ai appelé...
c'est au citron.
<i>Pendant ce temps, Jen et moi étions
dans mon restaurant pour 1er rencard.</i>
<i>À nouveau.</i>
Tu bosses où ?
Je suis en recherche...
Crise bancaire.
Je suis en recherche...
Explosion de la bulle internet.
Je devrais trouver
un secteur plus stable,
comme la banque.
- Et toi ?
- Je suis architecte.
J'espère, un jour,
pouvoir apposer mon empreinte
sur le chef-d'oeuvre
qu'est l'horizon de Manhattan.
J'enseigne l'architecture.
J'ai 50 % de réduction
à la librairie... c'est pas mal.
Marié !
C'est quoi, ton problème ?
Tu regardes juste.
C'est comme fantasmer
sur d'autres femmes.
C'est innocent.
Attends.
Me dis pas que tu fantasmes pas
sur d'autres femmes.
Je le fais !
C'est pas facile.
Faux.
Un jour, j'ai fantasmé sur la silhouette
sur les pare-boue de camion.
Il m'a fallu moins d'un kilomètre.
On n'est pas tous comme toi.
Quand je commence à avoir
une pensée comme ça...
<i>J'ai tellement l'impression
de la tromper que je culpabilise.</i>
<i>Je dois d'abord faire un autre rêve.</i>
Mauvaise nouvelle. Lily a un problème
de hoquet rare et mortel,
c'est médicalement valable.
Quoi ? Comment c'est possible ?
Aucune idée, mais c'est écrit ici
sur ce bloc-note qu'ont les médecins.
C'est la fin, bébé.
Je n'aimerai plus jamais.
Non, Marshall, dis pas ça.
Après un nombre d'années approprié,
tu trouveras quelqu'un d'autre.
Comme la livreuse canon
de l'autre fois.
Et... laboure-la
comme un champ de maïs.
Donc, Marshall, pour honorer Lily,
tu dois trouver
la livreuse canon de l'autre fois.
Et la labourer
comme un champ de maïs.
UN NOMBRE D'ANNÉES APPROPRIÉ
PLUS TARD
Une livraison pour Marshall Eriksen.
Je te le dédie, Lil.
Je signe où ?
Puis attention,
parce que c'est parti !
C'est le truc le plus triste
que j'ai entendu.
Mec, Lily t'a dans la vraie vie.
Elle a rien à faire
dans tes fantasmes.
Je connais rien d'autre,
j'y peux rien.
J'accepte ton invitation.
À compter de ce jour,
je serai le copilote de ton esprit.
Concentre-toi sur la prochaine danseuse.
Oublie complètement Lily.
<i>Messieurs, accueillez...</i>
<i>Jasmine.</i>
C'est moi ou cette danseuse
est le portrait craché de...
Ted, y a une stripteaseuse là,
c'est le sosie de Lily !
- Je peux pas parler.
- Moi aussi, je suis sans voix.
Tout est aussi ferme
qu'on l'imaginait !
Arrête de regarder.
Je dois y aller. Prends une photo.
Promis. Mais avant,
Marshall va me voir coincer un billet
entre les nénés de sa femme.
Je vais te tuer !
- Désolé pour ça.
- Des idées pour le menu ?
Ouais. On partage les huîtres ?
Je veux bien partager les huîtres.
Bien. Comme ça...
on aura le moule de mer
tous les deux.
C'est nul.
C'est ça l'idée !
On a déjà eu ce rencard.
On a déjà eu
exactement le même rencard.
Dans exactement le même restaurant.
Corrige-moi si j'ai tort,
mais ça s'était mal passé.
Je crois bien.
Je me souviens
t'avoir trouvé un peu snob.
Attends.
Tu habilles tes chats bizarrement.
Ils sont pas bizarres.
Voilà, tu fais le snob.
Mon Dieu.
Tu comprends ce que ça veut dire ?
Depuis notre premier rencard,
on a fait un tour complet
de tous les célibataires de New York
pour finir ici, ensemble.
On va mourir seuls, non ?
Tu as tes chats.
C'est dingue.
Une question.
Pourquoi tu me trouvais snob ?
Attends... On était assis ici...
Thon à la basquaise.
Ils ont écrit "thon" sans "h".
C'est bon de savoir
que ça sera bien le mien, pas vrai ?
Ce soir, le plat qui vous sera servi
sera en fait...
J'ai saisi.
Noter les fautes dans un menu
te rend assez prétentieux.
Je savais pas.
Et moi ? À part les chats,
de quoi j'avais l'air ?
C'est vrai... la note.
Elle est arrivée
et bien sûr, j'allais payer,
mais tu n'as pas fait
la danse de la note.
Les mecs veulent arracher la note
pour paraître importants.
Je savais pas.
C'est bien, on apprend des choses.
Tu sais quoi ?
Retraçons cette soirée
pour comprendre les erreurs commises
lors du premier rendez-vous.
Soyons honnêtes...
On effraie les gens, Jen.
C'est clair.
Je suis d'accord.
- Super.
- On est allés où ?
Au MacLaren's, je crois.
J'ai pas parlé tant que ça
de mes chats, non ?
Et après, il y a Chat-Gail Adams,
le bouffon du groupe.
Moins parler de ses chats.
Noté.
Vous devinerez jamais
qui on a vu ce soir.
On a vu le troisième double !
<i>J'explique.
Au cours des années,</i>
<i>on avait repéré deux inconnus
sosies des membres de notre groupe.</i>
<i>Robin lesbienne.</i>
<i>Et Marshall moustachu.</i>
<i>Avant l'été suivant, on aura trouvé
les deux doubles manquants.</i>
<i>J'y reviendrai.</i>
Mesdames,
voici Lily la stripteaseuse.
Ouais, j'ai pas pu avoir le visage.
Mais elle te ressemble.
Vous êtes allés au strip-club ?
Grillé.
Et une strip-teaseuse
me ressemblait ?
- Avant que tu t'énerves...
- Génial !
Les gars devaient être fous.
Ils voulaient la toucher.
Mais on ne fait que regarder,
sauf dans l'arrière-salle,
mais chéri, il faut payer.
Un strip-club ?
Marshall m'a forcé.
J'ai foiré quoi d'autre ?
Vas-y. Je suis là pour apprendre.
Je répétais que j'avais froid,
mais tu m'as pas proposé ta veste.
Il fait frisquet ce soir !
Pas vraiment.
Ah bon ?
Je sens plus mes doigts.
Je suis plutôt résistant.
Je pouvais pas dire
que j'avais froid.
Je voulais pas avoir l'air
d'une mauviette face à ton super ex
dont t'arrêtais pas de parler.
Après avoir bravé des feux,
Jim adorait rentrer
pour s'occuper de sa décapotable.
Ça ou boxer à mains nues.
Il a appris chez les Marines.
Ma tante était garde-côte.
Donc on parle pas des ex.
Même pas de la taille ridicule
de son sexe ?
Tu vois ?
Pourquoi t'as pas commencé par ça ?
Il y avait une douche sur scène ?
Des fois, c'est le cas.
Mon double irait là-dedans
avec une fille
faire des trucs dingues.
Tu vois ?
On a fait une virée entre potes
au strip-club
et nos copines sont d'accord.
Je le suis pas.
Elles comprennent que c'est sain
- de faire ça de temps en temps.
- C'est dégoûtant.
Car c'est bénin.
Une de tes putes t'a dit ça ?
Marshall devrait pas avoir d'ennuis
à avoir un fantasme.
Ennui ? Quels ennuis ?
C'est rien.
Dis-lui. On est entre amis.
Non, je crois pas.
Je pense à d'autres femmes.
Ça arrive.
Mais quand je le fais,
je me sens si coupable
que je t'imagine...
mourir avant,
car même dans mes fantasmes,
je pourrais jamais te tromper.
Tu es toute ma vie, bébé.
Et je t'aime.
Me tuer ?
Fantasme sur n'importe quelle fille,
mais tu peux éviter de me tuer ?
Tuer ? Non, chérie.
Tu as une maladie chronique.
Je te paie les meilleurs soins.
Je crée une fondation à ton nom.
On est à ça d'un remède.
Tu te souviens ?
Je me souviens.
On a bu un coup avec tes amis,
que j'ai adorés...
Ou détestés, ça dépend
si ce sont encore tes amis.
- Tu les as aimés.
- C'est la famille, Ted.
Entrons voir s'ils se souviennent.
Ce sont mes meilleurs amis.
Sois pas surprise
s'ils ne savent pas
ce que j'ai foiré.
Il a jonglé ? Une blague nulle ?
Attendu une ovation
pour un chèque de 19 $ ?
N'oublions pas
la faute de frappe sur le menu.
Continue ta prospection, mec.
C'est moins cher
qu'acheter une capote.
Vous savez ce que j'ai pensé ?
J'ai cru
que c'était un coureur de jupon.
- Moi ?
- Ted ?
On était assis là-bas...
Voici des photos de mes chats
habillés en méchants dans Batman.
Le Joker,
l'homme mystère, M. Freeze...
Et Catwoman ?
J'aurais dû la faire.
Excellent.
Attends !
Je me souviens.
Je matais pas une fille.
Excellent.
On matait Marshall moustachu.
J'ai cru que t'étais un abruti.
Désolée.
C'est cool de savoir
qu'<i>Ancien Ted</i> était pas un abruti.
<i>Nouveau Ted</i> est pas mal non plus.
Merci beaucoup.
Je me souviens de ça.
Et là, c'est le Chrysler Building.
Et là, l'Empire State Building.
Et à midi,
un couple potelé le fait
contre les vitres.
C'est plutôt mignon.
Regarde.
Pause en-cas.
C'est bien pour eux.
Laisser un mec manger sur ton dos,
c'est ça, l'amour.
Je sais que c'était pas le meilleur
premier rencard du monde.
Mais j'ai été ravi.
Moi aussi.
C'était super.
Où ça a foiré ?
Je me souviens.
Alors, ça te plairait
qu'on se revoie ?
J'aimerais bien. Tu m'appelles ?
Bien sûr.
- Promis ?
- Promis.
J'ai été tellement...
occupé.
Bonne nuit.
Désolé. Je sais
que cet appel a sept ans de retard,
mais j'étais stupide à l'époque.
Tu as vu mon bouc.
J'ai passé
un excellent moment ce soir,
et j'adorerais te revoir.
Y a deux types d'hommes.
Ceux qui n'appellent pas
alors que tu le veux
et ceux qu'on ne veut pas
et qui appellent toujours.
Et quelque part, maintenant,
tu es les deux.
Tu devrais pouvoir fantasmer
sur une autre femme
sans te culpabiliser
ou me supprimer.
Je voudrais,
mais je fais ça depuis si longtemps.
Je suis désorienté
entre la mort et le sexe.
Quand je passe devant le cimetière,
j'ai une érection.
On doit régler ça.
Quand Lily la strip-teaseuse arrive,
tu as ma permission
de fantasmer sur elle.
Et comme elle est pratiquement moi,
tu culpabiliseras pas.
Merci, mon amour.
J'ai de la chance de t'avoir.
Et elle.
Amenez Lily la strip-teaseuse !
Je viens pas si souvent ici.
À l'accoutumée. Je t'envoie l'habituelle
dès qu'elle s'est étirée.
Merci, gentille inconnue.
<i>Mesdames et messieurs...</i>
<i>Je t'ai pas vu arriver.
Je te mets un peu d'AC/DC, mec.</i>
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,
merci d'applaudir</i>
<i>Jasmine.</i>
Je suis sexy !
Rampe pour l'avoir, moi-strippeuse.
C'est géant !
Je peux ravoir un billet de 100 ?
- C'était un de 100 ?
- Elle rampe vite.
J'aimerais revenir en arrière
et mettre du plomb dans la tête
de Ted de 2002,
mais ce mec est une cause perdue.
Il a 24 ans.
Il pense ressembler à Johnny Depp
grâce à son bouc.
Il ignore
qu'il loupe une fille géniale.
Mais j'ai beaucoup appris depuis.
Notamment ce soir.
La seule chose qu'on ait apprise,
c'est qu'il y a sept ans,
sortir ensemble était une erreur.
Remettre ça ce soir
en était une autre.
Non.
J'ai passé un super moment ce soir.
Et il y a sept ans,
en y réfléchissant,
c'était pas si raté que ça.
Si ça s'était passé différemment...
Qui sait ?
T'es la meilleure.
Tu es la meilleure.
Ma copine est dans un strip-club,
avec moi et elle s'en fiche.
Je m'en fiche pas.
On sort ensemble maintenant !
Ça change tout.
On doit parler sérieusement
de tout ça.
La meilleure.
Un souci de nana ?
J'aimerais aider,
mais ma femme méga cool
vient de nous payer
une danse privée avec son double.
Si tu me cherches,
je me fais presser comme un citron,
dans la salle Champagne.
C'est la meilleure.
Quoi ?
Je me souviens
pourquoi j'ai pas appelé.
Pourquoi ?
J'arrive pas à croire que je vais
encore bousiller ça, mais...
J'aime trouver des fautes
dans les menus.
Quoi ?
Et je sais que ma blague est stupide,
mais la vérité c'est que...
Je vais pas m'arrêter subitement
de faire ces blagues.
Maintenant que tu en parles...
Je n'arrêterai jamais
de parler de mes chats.
Ils sont drôles, adorables,
et valent le fait
de prendre six Benadryl par jour.
On devrait pas...
attendre la personne qui...
ne fera pas que tolérer nos manies,
mais aussi les aimera ?
Même si ça signifie...
de se retrouver dans sept ans,
à une autre blind date ?
Mon Dieu,
j'espère que ça n'arrivera pas.
Bonne chance pour la suite.
Toi aussi.
Tu trouveras celle au moule de mer.
<i>Quand j'ai raconté cette blague
à votre mère,</i>
<i>elle a rigolé.</i>
<i>Et je jure
que c'était que 30 % par pitié.</i>
On dirait que Jasmine a du mal
à sortir de ces bottes.
T'as dit quoi, mec ?
Qui ?
Je suis cette Lily.
Nous mariés longtemps.
Je peux avoir sous pour shopping ?
<i>This is the story
of two blind dates.</i>
<i>One in 2009...</i>
<i>And one seven years earlier.</i>
<i>In all that time, my dating routine
remained more or less the same...</i>
<i>... until the fall of 2009,</i>
<i>when I finally had a date
that was different.</i>
<i>Because it was exactly the same.</i>
<i>I was on a blind date
with the same woman</i>
<i>I went on a blind date with
seven years earlier.</i>
It's nice to meet you.
<i>And she didn't remember it.
But then again...</i>
It's nice to meet you, too.
<i>Neither did i.</i>
Do you want...

Guess who just got four tickets
to the "Origins of Chewbacca"
Star Wars exhibit?
- Why?
- No, I said, "guess who?"
I heard you.
Yeah, isn't it a little
early in our relationship
to do something that
would end our relationship?
What are you talking about?
It can be our first
double date as couples!
It sounds awesome! Is the original
Chewbacca going to be there?
Peter Mayhew, in the fur.
Who's with me?
Do you think they'll have Wookiee
to English dictionaries there?
I mean, even just an everyday
phrase book would be helpful.
We're not going to
the "Origins of Chewbacca"exhibit.
It's in Houston this year.
Everyone knows that.
I just wanted to get
rid of the girls.
Where are you taking me?
<i>This wasn't the first time your uncle
Barney had kidnapped one of us.</i>
Wait a second.
The "Origins of Chewbacca"
exhibit's in Montreal this year.
Everyone knows that.
Where are you taking me?
My guy in the da's office scored us
front row seats
to a lethal injection.
We're still stopping
for chili dogs first.
Stop the cab.
Where are you taking me?
Why are we here?
Marshall, now that
Robin and I are together,
I've learned a lot about relationships
by watching you and Lily.
- Thanks, man.
- You're a terrible couple.
Lily has taken
all the man out of you.
I used to think that's just
every relationship.
What I've got with Robin
proves that you can
have a girlfriend and fully
functioning male genitalia
all at the same time.
Right. So, if Robin knew
that you were here,
she'ld be completely fine with it?
Are you kidding?
She'd sprint down here
with a purse full of singles
and a poncho
for the 10:30 jell-o show.
Bt-dub, I called ahead...
It's lime.
<i>Meanwhile, Jen and I were
in my favorite first date restaurant...</i>
<i>For the second time.</i>
What do you do?
I'm between jobs...
Banking cris.
I'm between jobs...
Internet bubble burst.
Makes me realize I should go
into something more stable...
Like banking.
- So what about you?
- I'm an architect.
Hopefully, one day,
I can use my own humble brush
on the masterpiece that is
Manhattan's skyline.
I teach architecture.
Get 50% off at the bookstore,
so that's pretty sweet.
Married!
What is wrong with you?
You're just looking.
It's like fantasizing
about other women.
It's harmless.
Wait.
Don't tell me you don't fantasize
about other women.
I do!
It's just not that easy.
False.
I once fantasized about
that silhouette chick
you see on a truck's mudflaps.
Took me less than a mile.
Not everyone is you, OK?
Even when I do start to have
a dirty thought like that...
It seems so much like cheating
on Lily that I feel guilty.
So first, I need to have
a different fantasy.
Bad news.
Lily has a rare and fatal
hiccup disorder
that's apparently
medically legitimate.
What?! How could this be?!
Beats me, but it says it right here
on this doctor clipboard
that doctors have.
It's time, baby.
I will never love again.
No, Marshall, you must.
And after
an appropriate number of years,
you should find someone else.
Someone like that busty delivery girl
from that one time.
And... plow her like a cornfield.
And so, Marshall, to honor Lily,
you must find that busty
delivery girl from that one time
and plow her like a cornfield.
Delivery for Marshall Eriksen.
This one's for you, Lil.
Where do I sign?
And then watch out,
because it is on!
That is the saddest thing
I've ever heard.
Dude, Lily gets you in real life.
- She has no business in your fantasies.
- It's all I know, OK?
- I can't help it.
- I accept your invitation.
From this day forward, I will be
the wingman of your mind.
Now, focus on the next dancer.
Put Lily completely out of your mind.
<i>Hello men, say hello to...</i>
<i>Jasmine.</i>
Is it just me or does that
stripper look exactly like...?
Ted, we found a stripper
who looks exactly like Lily!
- I can't talk right now.
- I'm speechless, too.
Everything's as perky
as we've always imagined!
Stop looking at her.
I got to go.
Take a picture.
I will. But first, I'm going
to make Marshall
watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant
between his wife's Tatas.
I'll kill you!
- Sorry about that.
- So, any thoughts on food?
Yeah. You want to share the oysters?
I would love to share the oysters.
Good. 'cause if you didn't...
... that would be mighty shellfish.
That's bad.
That's why it's funny!
We've been on this date before.
We've been on this exact
blind date before.
In this exact same restaurant.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
I don't remember that going that well.
Me, neither.
I remember thinking
that you were a little snobby.
Wait, you...
You dress your cats up
in weird costumes.
They're not weird.
See, you're being snobby again.
Oh, my god.
Do you realize what this means?
Since our first date,
we've done a complete lap
of all the single people in New York
only to end up back here,
with each other.
We're going to die alone, aren't we?
Well, you've got your cats.
This is insane.
Wait, I got to ask.
Why did you think I was snobby?
Wait... Okay... Yeah, we were
sitting over there...
Maine lobster.
They spelled "main" without the "e."
Good to know we're not getting
the crappy understudy lobsters, right?
Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half
lobster will be played by...
I get it.
Pointing out spelling errors in a menu
makes you seem kind of snooty.
I had no idea.
What about me?
Aside from the cats,
how did I come across?
That's right... the check.
The check came
and, of course, I was going to pay,
but you didn't do the check dance.
Guys want to wave the girl off
and, you know, look like a big shot.
I had no idea.
This is good. We're learning stuff.
You know what we should do?
We should retrace
the rest of that night
and figure out what else
we do wrong on first dates.
'Cause let's be honest...
We are scaring people off, Jen.
We really are.
Okay, I'm in.
- Great.
- Where'd we go next?
I think we went to Maclaren's.
I didn't really talk about
my cats that much, did i?
And then, there's Tabby-Gail Adams,
the jester of the group.
Tone down the kitty talk.
Check.
You will not believe
who we saw tonight.
We saw the third doppelganger!
<i>I should explain.</i>
<i>Over the years we had spotted
two strangers</i>
<i>who looked exactly like
members of our group.</i>
<i>Lesbian Robin.</i>
<i>And moustache Marshall.</i>
<i>By the following summer, we would find
the remaing two doppelgangers.</i>
<i>I'll get to that.</i>
Ladies, meet stripper Lily.
Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it.
But she looks just like you.
So you went to a strip club?
Busted.
And there was a stripper
who looked exactly like me?
Babe, look, before you get mad...
Awesome!
I bet the guys were going crazy.
I bet they wanted to touch her so bad.
But all you can do is look,
unless you go into the back room,
but honey, you got to pay.
So...
Strip club.
Marshall made me go.
So what did I do wrong next?
Let me have it.
I'm here to learn.
I kept dropping hints
that I was cold,
but you didn't offer me your jacket.
It's a little brisk out tonight!
Not really.
Really?
I can't feel my fingers.
I'm pretty impervious
to stuff like that.
I couldn't admit I was cold.
I didn't want to seem like a wimp
compared to your action hero ex,
who you wouldn't stop talking about.
After a day of fighting fires,
Jim would love to come home
and unwind working
on his '68 camaro.
That or bare-knuckle boxing,
which he learned
in the marine corps.
I had an aunt in the coast guard.
So no talking about the ex.
Not even about
his shockingly small wiener?
See?
Why didn't you lead off with that?
Was there a shower on stage?
Sometimes there's a shower on stage.
I bet stripper me would get
in there with another girl
and just go bananas.
See?
We got to have
a bros' night at a strip club
and our ladies
are totally cool with it.
I'm not cool with it.
Because they understand it's healthy
- for us to do that from time to time.
- It's disgusting.
Because it's harmless.
Did one of your whores
tell you that?
Marshall shouldn't have to go
to trouble
to have an innocent fantasy.
Trouble?
What trouble?
It's nothing.
Tell her.
We're all friends here.
No, we're not.
Sometimes I think about other women.
It happens.
But even when I do, I feel so guilty
that I have to imagine you...
passing away first,
because even in a fantasy world,
I could never cheat on you.
You're...
You're just my life, baby.
And I love you.
You kill me off?
Fantasize about other girls
all you want,
but could you maybe not murder me?
Murder?
No! Baby, no.
You develop a chronic illness!
I spare no expense for your care!
I even set up a foundation in your name.
We're, like, this close to a cure.
Remember?
I do remember.
We went in here for a drink
with your friends, who I loved...
Or hated, depending
if you're still friends with them.
- You loved them.
- They're family, Ted.
Let's go in
and see what they remember.
They are my best friends, so...
don't be surprised
if they suddenly "can't think"
of anything I do wrong.
Did he juggle? Bad puns?
Expect a standing ovation
for picking up a $19 check?
Let's not forget
the menu typo gold mine.
Keep pannin' that river, buddy.
It is a lot cheaper
than buying a condom.
Actually, you know what it was?
I remember him coming across
as kind of a player.
- Me?
- Ted?
We were all sitting over there...
And here's a picture of my cats
dressed up like Batman villains.
You got the Joker,
the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...
What about Catwoman?
That would've been good.
Nice.
Wait, no!
I remember that.
I was not checking out a girl.
Nice.
We're checking out
moustache Marshall.
Gosh,
I thought you were such a jerk.
I'm so sorry.
It's nice to know "past me"
wasn't a total jackass!
"Present you" isn't so bad, either.
Thank you very much.
I remember this.
And there's the Chrysler building.
And the Empire State building.
And at 12:00,
a rotund couple going
at it against the glass.
That's kind of sweet.
Look.
Snack break.
Good for them.
Letting a guy eat pizza off your back,
that's love.
So...
I know this wasn't
the best first date of all time, but...
I'm glad we stuck it out.
Me too.
That was really great.
What went wrong?
I remember now.
So would you maybe...
Want to go out again?
I would.
Will you call me?
Absolutely.
Promise?
Promise.
I have been so...
busy.
Good night.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm seven years late
with this call,
but I was an idiot back then.
You saw the goatee.
The truth is,
I had a great time tonight,
and I'd love to see you again.
There are two kinds of guys.
The guys that you want to call you,
who don't,
and the guys you don't want to call you,
who always do.
And somehow, right now...
you're both.
You should be able to fantasize
about another woman
without feeling guilty, or,
you know, killing me off.
I wish I could,
but I've been doing this
for so long,
I'm all confused
about death and sex.
Every time I drive past a cemetery,
I'm sportin' a partial.
All right, we got to fix this.
When stripper Lily gets out here,
you have my permission
to fantasize about her.
And since she's basically me,
maybe you won't feel guilty.
Thanks, baby.
I'm so lucky I have you.
And stripper you.
Bring out stripper Lily!
I don't come here that much.
Here's the usual
and I'll send over the other one
as soon as she's done stretching.
Thank you, kindly stranger.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
<i>Didn't see you come in.
I'll load up some AC/DC for you, buddy.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together</i>
<i>for Jasmine.</i>
I am hot!
Crawl for it, stripper me.
This is awesome.
Baby, can I get another hundred?
That was a hundred?
She crawls fast.
Look, Jen, I wish I could go back
and talk some sense into 2002 Ted,
but that guy's a lost cause.
He's 24.
He thinks a facial hair
makes him look like Johnny Depp.
He has no idea what a great girl
he's missing out on.
But I've learned a lot since then.
I've learned a lot tonight.
The only thing that we've learned
is that, seven years ago,
it was a mistake for us to go out.
I guess it was a mistake for us
to go out tonight.
No, it wasn't.
I had a great time tonight.
And seven years ago,
if you think about it,
we didn't miss by that much.
If a couple things had gone
a little bit differently...
Who knows?
You're the best.
You are the best.
My girlfriend is at a strip club with me
and she couldn't care less.
I do care, Barney.
We're dating now!
That changes things.
We've to have
a serious talk about this.
Just the best.
Girlfriend trouble?
I wish I could help,
but my unbelievably cool wife
just bought us
a private dance
with her stripper body double.
So if you need me,
I'll be grinded like some pepper,
in the champagne room.
Just the best.
Now what?
I just remembered
why I didn't call you.
Why?
I can't believe
I'm gonna screw this up again, but...
I like finding typos in menus.
What?
And I know my shellfish pun is stupid,
but the truth is...
I'm not suddenly gonna stop
making stupid jokes.
Now that you mention it...
I'm never going to stop
talking about my cats.
They're funny, and adorable,
and totally worth
having to take six benadryl a day.
Shouldn't we...
hold out for the person who...
doesn't just tolerate
our little quirks,
but actually kind of likes them?
Even if it means...
finding ourselves on another blind date
with each other, seven years from now?
Dear God,
I hope that doesn't happen.
Well...
Good luck out there, Jen.
You too, Ted.
You'll find your shellfish lady.
<i>And kids,</i>
<i>when I told your mother
that shellfish joke,</i>
<i>she did laugh.</i>
<i>And I swear,
it was only, like, 30% pity.</i>
Looks like Jasmine's having a hard time
getting out of those boots.
What did you say, buddy?
Who?
I am this Lily.
We married long time.
May I have monies for shopping?
<i>Les enfants, votre oncle Barney
a eu pas mal de noms par le passť.</i>
Connard !
Enfoirť !
Barack Obama Jr. ?!
Et "yes...
we can."
<i>Mais il y a un nom auquel
aucun d'entre nous ne s'attendait.</i>
Petit ami.
Barney Stinson est mon petit ami.
Je l'ai dit, genre cent fois
c'est toujours bizarre ŗ dire.
Tout est bizarre ŗ dire
aprŤs cent fois.
Bol.
Mais ŗ part Áa, tout se passe bien ?
Je ne sais pas.
Barney a ťtť cťlibataire
trop longtemps.
L'autre nuit,
je me rťveille ŗ 4 h du matin...
Barney, tu es rťveillť ?
Ce n'est pas un coup d'un soir.
On est ensemble. Reviens te coucher.
C'est arrivť trois fois. Et il n'y a pas
que Áa, il y a d'autres choses.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
C'ťtait juste un truc aprŤs l'autre
au boulot aujourd'hui, et aprŤs...
j'apprends que ma tante
est ŗ l'hŰpital.
C'est juste, je me sens dťpassťe
et c'est si...
Ce qu'il faut que tu fasses
c'est parler de tout Áa.
Merci.
Et aprŤs, quand tu auras
fini de tťlťphoner ŗ Lily,
Je serais en bas au bar
prÍt ŗ faire l'amour. OK ?
Je ne suis pas la personne la plus
dťmonstrative du monde, mais...
- un petit effort ferait du bien.
- Je comprends.
J'imagine qu'il y a pas mal de choses
qui jouent contre Barney.
Je veux dire, tu as eu
des petits amis plutŰt incroyables.
Non, ce n'est pas Áa.
Je ne sais pas.
Il n'est peut-Ítre pas fait pour Áa.
C'est peut-Ítre une grosse erreur.
- Elle a vraiment dit Áa ?
- Et elle le pensait.
Crois-moi. J'ťtais avec Robin pendant
un an... si tu ne veux pas la perdre,
tu dois faire plus d'efforts.
Sois plus attentif
ŗ ses ťmotions. Sois...
- juste prťsent.
- Oui, carrťment.
Juste un truc, et c'est mon avis...
j'aime mes testicules attachťs
ŗ mon corps, plutŰt que se baladant
ŗ cŰtť d'un eyeliner dans le sac
de Robin. Stinson sort !
<i>Mais aprŤs un truc marrant arriva.</i>
<i>Les deux semaines suivantes,
Barney fut attentionnť</i>
<i>prťvenant...</i>
<i>doux.</i>
<i>En bref, le petit ami parfait.</i>
<i>Ce qui, pour Robin,
ne voulait dire qu'une chose.</i>
- Il me trompe.
- Quoi ?!
Pourquoi m'offrirait-il des fleurs ?
Il se tape quelqu'un d'autre.
Barney n'est pas
le genre de mec qui... continue.
En plus,
il dit qu'il travaille tard.
Mais ŗ son bureau ils disent
toujours qu'il est dťjŗ parti.
- «a ne prouve rien.
- Oui. Des preuves.
C'est le bon mot.
Je suis contente que tu en aies parlť.
La mallette de Barney.
Il l'a oubliť ici ce matin.
- Et que prťvois-tu de faire avec ?
- Nous, nous...
toi et moi... allons l'ouvrir
et chercher des preuves.
Ted a probablement une massue
qui traÓne quelque part.
ArrÍte ! ArrÍte ! Regarde-moi.
…coute-moi. Robin Scherbatsky
est beaucoup de choses :
amie, confidente, invitť surprise
dans des rÍves qui prÍtent ŗ confusion
me rappelant que la sexualitť
d'une femme n'est pas trŤs fixe.
Mais elle n'est pas une salope
harceleuse folle et jalouse.
Laisse tomber.
J'ťtais en bas dans le box
dans tous les trucs que
Lily et moi avons laissť
en dťmťnageant. Dťsolť Robin.
On aurait du ranger Áa
depuis longtemps.
- Il y a un box ?
- Tu n'es pas en colŤre. Bien.
Bťbť, devine ce que j'ai trouvť.
- C'est super, chťrie.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce truc ?
Marshall a eu Áa ŗ la fac. C'ťtait
sa table de nuit pendant des annťes.
Jusqu'ŗ ce qu'on dťcouvre que Lily
est allergique ŗ la rťsine de tonneau.
- La rťsine de tonneau ?
- Joue le jeu.
Tu as besoin d'aide pour jeter Áa ?
Je ne vais pas juste la jeter.
Mabel fait partie de la famille.
Alors... qu'est-ce que tu vas
faire de Mabel ?
Je veux la donner ŗ un chanceux nouveau
propriťtaire. Tu connais quelqu'un ?
Laisse-moi rťflťchir. Est-ce que
je connais un clown pro du rodťo ?
Bizarre, j'en connais. Mais mÍme Lenny
ne s'approcherait pas de ce truc.
Il n'en aura pas l'opportunitť,
car je vais mettre cette vieille Mabel
dans le Triangle des Bermudes.
<i>Le "Triangle des Bermudes"
ťtait le nom qu'on avait donnť</i>
<i>il y a des annťes au trottoir
juste devant notre immeuble.</i>
<i>ņ chaque fois qu'on voulait donner
quelque chose, on le mettait lŗ.</i>
<i>C'ťtait un mystťrieux.</i>
C'est trop excitant.
En ce moment il y a quelqu'un
qui n'a pas idťe que ce soir
il rentrera avec...
le meilleur tonneau.
Espťrons qu'il ne soit pas allergique
ŗ la rťsine de tonneau comme Lily.
N'en fais pas trop. Putain !
- ņ plus tard, chťrie. Bonne chance.
- ņ plus, bťbť.
- Bon, on peut sortir d'ici maintenant ?
- Je prends mon manteau.
Un cahier d'ťtudiant ?!
Mon Dieu, il me trompe
avec une ťtudiante.
Je savais qu'il y avait une pťtasse
mais j'imaginais qu'elle serait conne.
"Anniv', 23 juillet. Equipe de hockey
prťfťrťe, les Canucks de Vancouver.
Age, 29 ans, mais dit aux gens
qu'elle en a 26."
Mon Dieu, ces notes sont sur moi.
Ou une version de moi ŗ 29 ans.
J'espŤre qu'il n'est pas trop tard !
Je veux voir le regard plein de joie
sur le visage du nouveau propriťtaire !
Elle est encore lŗ !
Allez Mabel, on va te trouver
un nouveau foyer.
Voilŗ un mec !
Il est passť... juste devant.
Il rentre sŻrement en vitesse prendre
un diable ou un truc dans le genre.
Tu ferais mieux
de te dťpÍcher, mon pote.
Qu'est-ce que vous faÓtes avec
le cahier secret de Barney sur Robin ?
Laissez-moi dire Áa autrement.
Est-ce que...
vous avez perdu du poids les filles ?
Qu'est-ce que tu sais lŗ-dessus ?
Pourquoi Barney aurait un cahier
plein d'informations sur moi ?
<i>En vťritť...</i>

Pourquoi est-ce que Ted
donne des cours sur moi ?
Tout a commencť
il y a quelques semaines.
... plutŰt que se baladant ŗ cŰtť
d'un eyeliner dans le sac de Robin.
Stinson sort !
Stinson revient.
Disons...
qu'ťventuellement,
je veuille changer qui je suis
pour devenir un meilleur petit ami,
ce que je ne souhaite pas !
De quels types de changements
est-on en train de parler ?
Il y en a tellement de choses
que tu dois savoir sur elle.
Pour commencer,
ne pleure jamais devant elle.
Et quoique tu fasses,
ne pleure pas
devant elle quatre fois.
- De quoi vous parlez ?
- De club de Foot virtuel.
Ils ont rťalisť qu'ils ne pouvaient
pas parler de Áa au bar, et
comme tu vis avec Ted,
ils devaient trouver un endroit sŻr.
D'oý... la salle de classe de Ted.
"Guide pour sortir
avec Robin Scherbatsky."
LeÁon 1.
MÍme s'il elle fait preuve
d'une forte personnalitť,
ce que Robin veut,
en son trťfonds...
Je m'ennuie.
- Tu as dit que tu voulais mon aide.
- On dessine des seins sur le tableau ?
- On l'a dťjŗ fait Áa.
- Non, genre, des vraiment ťnormes.
Non. J'ai aussi besoin de Áa.
Je ne suis prof que peu.
 tre ici...
est un bon entraÓnement.
On peut faire cours dehors ?
Ce que Robin veut profondťment...
Quoi ? J'envoie des tweets sur toi.
Tu devrais Ítre flattť.
Comment on ťpelle...
avec ou sans "H" ?
Tu ťtais... genre, le pire
ťtudiant au monde, n'est-ce pas ?
Ils disaient que
j'avais des troubles de l'att...
quelque chose.
On peut faire cours dehors ?
Barney, je ne vais dire Áa
qu'une fois,
alors ťcoute bien.
Je tiens ŗ toi
ainsi qu'ŗ Robin.
Et je veux que Áa marche.
Donc si tu me donnes
quelques semaines d'attention,
je te donnerais une vie de bonheur.
Tu peux faire Áa pour moi ?
Je devrais prendre Sports Illustrťs
ŗ 70 % moins cher qu'en papeterie ?
On peut faire cours dehors ?
Je dois trouver un moyen
d'atteindre cet enfant.
"LeÁon numťro 2."
"Le Top 10 des expressions faciales
de Robin Scherbatsky et leur sens."
Maintenant, remarque les yeux vides,
le teint p‚le, suggťrant la nausťe.
- Que signifient-ils ?
- Vous veniez de coucher ensemble ?
C'ťtait pas moi.
Mec ! J'ai vraiment travaillť dur
sur ces diapos, OK ? On pourrait...
Cette expression est la faim.
Si jamais tu vois Robin comme Áa,
fais-lui vite manger quelque chose,
ou une de ces deux choses arrivera.
Un :
ricanements ťtranges hors contexte
ou deux :
endormissements soudains
dans des endroits improbables.
Mais...
L'expression faciale
la plus importante de toutes ?
C'est un immeuble.
C'est pour mon cours.
Le Flatiron Building.
Une anecdote. Il a ťtť crťť par
Daniel Burnham de l'ťcole de Chicago
dans le style des Beaux-arts.
Cette oeuvre...
L'expression faciale
la plus importante de toutes.
Narines ťcartťes.
Yeux grands ouverts
qui ne clignent pas.
Si jamais,
tu vois ces traits, Barney,
cours.
Et surtout...
ne prends pas une photo.
Elle te frappera.
Et tu pleureras...
pour la troisiŤme fois...
de la soirťe.
Ce qui nous amŤne
ŗ un sujet important,
dťsamorcer la bombe.
"Dťsamorcer la bombe" ?
Qu'est-ce que Áa veut dire ?
"Trois faÁons de distraire Robin
d'Ítre en colŤre contre toi."
"Me distraire" ?
C'est condescendant.
Ils commencent vraiment
ŗ me taper sur les nerfs !
"Changer de sujet de conversation
par l'un des suivants,
sauf si vous voulez que Robin
lance ses chaussures."
"Le titre de compťtition
des Canucks de Vancouver de 2004."
Quoi ?!
Mais Áa ne me distrait pas.
C'est parler
de la petite ťquipe de nazes
qui a gagnť malgrť
le but contestable de la fin
et, franchement, du talentueux
Trevor Linden de fin de carriŤre.
"L'entretien et le nettoyage
d'une arme."
Tu dois nettoyer ton arme.
Mon oncle avait un vieux fusil sale,
Áa lui a arrachť ses deux pouces
en tirant sur un castor.
Tu veux distraire quelqu'un,
fais-leur regarder mon oncle
manger du maÔs en ťpi.
"Les manchots empereurs".
Tu savais qu'avant l'accouplement,
les manchots empereurs m‚les
et femelles se saluent ?
M. Manchot.
Mme Manchot.
Sacrť manchots,
ils sont si fantaisistes.
De quoi on parlait ?
On dirait qu'on a un preneur.
Oh, allez, mec.
Tu sais que t'en a envie
un mec comme toi,
une barbe, pas de moustache.
T'es typiquement le genre de mec
ŗ vouloir un tonneau. Vas-y.
Ce n'est pas une bouche d'incendie !
Quelle honte, monsieur.
Quelle honte !
Je parie que vous ne pourriez mÍme pas
avoir une moustache si vous le vouliez.
- Toi non plus, poussin.
- Il ne le sait pas, bťbť ! Mon Dieu !
Ted apprend seulement ŗ Barney
des choses horribles sur moi.
Je ne sais pas. Regarde Áa.
C'est plutŰt mignon.
On sait tous que Robin n'est pas
vraiment dťmonstrative.
Elle ne dit pas "je t'aime"
comme une personne normale.
ņ la place, elle rigole,
secoue la tÍte, souris un peu
et dit :
"Ce que tu es bÍte."
"Ce que tu es bÍte" ?
Si elle te dit que tu es bÍte,
tu es un homme comblť.
Et si elle dit "je t'aime",
c'est qu'elle a dťjŗ rompu avec toi
dans son esprit.
Je pense que c'est bien
que Ted te connaisse autant.
C'est dommage qu'il y ait
une page intitulťe...
"Les ťtonnantes zones ťrogŤnes
de Robin Scherbatsky."
Le genou droit...
Chatouilleux.
Le genou gauche...
Le gauche aime Áa ?
Le gauche aime Áa.
Je n'arrive pas ŗ croire que je reÁois

Tu as un problŤme avec ce cours ?
Je m'ennuie mortellement
et je n'apprends rien.
Ton attitude, c'est Áa le problŤme.
Tu n'ťcoutes rien de ce que je dis.
Vous comprenez Áa, professeur ?
Ou je dois le retourner pour vous ?
<i>Il ne me montrait pas vraiment
son pouce, les enfants.</i>
Tu crois que tu n'apprends rien ?
- Interro surprise.
- Quoi...
Quand Robin a ses rŤgles, quel genre
de chocolat dois-tu lui apporter ?
- Question piŤge. Des caramels.
- Correct ! Pourquoi ?
Le caramel est aux canadiennes
ce que le chocolat est aux amťricaines.
Quel est le boulot rÍvť de Robin ?
Devenir la plus connue des journalistes
femmes de tous les temps.
Et si elle y arrive,
sera-t-elle vraiment heureuse ?
Le besoin ancrť de Robin
pour la reconnaissance vient
de la distance ťmotionnelle de son pŤre,
et aucun succŤs ne remplacera
ce dont elle a vraiment besoin,
c'est ŗ dire six mots de son pŤre,
"Robin, je suis fier de toi, he ?"
Mais je pense que tu as raison.
Tu n'as rien appris.
Pardon de t'avoir fait
perdre ton temps.
"O Capitaine ! Mon Capitaine !"
C'ťtait bien, hein,

T'as vu ? La fin ? En larme.
Est-ce que je peux dire
que mon besoin le plus profond
n'est pas de voir mon pŤre dire,
"Je suis fier de toi, he" ?
Alors pourquoi tu pleurs ?
- Je ne pleurs pas.
- Oh, ma puce.
- Tu veux un caramel ?
- ArrÍte.
Attends une seconde. C'est marquť que
les cours ont lieu le mardi ŗ 18 h 15.
- Et ?
- C'est en ce moment.

Ne fais pas d'erreur.
Robin Scherbatsky
est un exemple classique
typique...
d'accapareuse de couette.
- Des questions ?
- Oui, moi.
Oui, Robin ?
Narines ťcartťes.
Yeux grands ouverts
qui ne clignent pas.
Je m'en occupe.
Les manchots empereurs,
dingues, hein ?
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez ?
Tu as caftť ?
J'ťtais vulnťrable.
J'ai dit au revoir ŗ
un trŤs bon ami aujourd'hui.
Mec, c'est un tonneau !
- Tu te sťpares de Mabel ?
- J'ai tellement de questions.
Pourquoi ferais-tu Áa ?
ņ quoi pensais-tu ?
Et c'est qui lui ?
C'est Shin-Ya.
Il est venu ťcouter le cours.
"…couter" ?
J'ai essayť de lui expliquer
que ce n'ťtait pas un vrai cours,
mais je ne pense pas
qu'il parle bien franÁais.
CŰtť positif,
il a ťtť utile pour te jouer
- pendant les exercices de jeu de rŰle.
- Attends. Tu as fait des jeux de rŰle
oý j'ťtais jouťe par Shin-Ya ?
Ils m'on fait porter une perruque.
C'ťtait trŤs humiliant.
Je n'arrive pas ŗ te croire, Ted.
Tu penses rťellement Ítre
une sorte d'expert sur moi ?
C'est un expert.
C'est un super prof !
LŤche-cul.
La moitiť de ce qu'il y a
dans ce cahier est faux.
Vraiment ? Nommes-en une.
"Les ťtonnantes zones ťrogŤnes
de Robin Scherbatsky ?"
Laisse-moi clarifier
quelque chose pour toi, Ted.
Le gauche aime Áa ?
Le droit est chatouilleux,
je suppose.
Mais le gauche, ouais,
contente que t'y sois retournť.
Parce que c'est vraiment
trŤs trŤs agrťable.
Notť.
- Tu mentais ?
- On commenÁait ŗ sortir ensemble.
Je voulais Ítre gentille.
Et toi.
Cette semaine je me suis mis
dans la tÍte que tu me trompais.
J'ai mÍme ouvert ta mallette
pour trouver des preuves.
C'est une ťnorme violation
de ma vie privťe !
Continue.
Tu sais, dans un sens,
j'avais raison.
Tu as trichť. Tu ne peux pas faire des
antisŤches sur comment sortir avec moi.
«a ne marche pas comme Áa.
Si on ne peut pas trouver un moyen
honnÍte et rťel d'Ítre ensemble
je ne vois pas
ŗ quoi Áa sert d'essayer.
Si vous avez rompu,
Shin-Shin a le droit d'essayer ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
…coute.
Toutes ces choses
que j'ai dites ŗ Barney...
C'ťtait personnel entre toi et moi.
Je suis vraiment dťsolť.
Je suppose que je suis impressionnťe
par tout ce dont tu te souviens.
C'est marrant.
Quand tu sors avec quelqu'un,
c'est comme si
tu avais un long cours
sur qui cette personne est
et aprŤs, quand tu romps,
toutes ces choses deviennent inutiles.
C'est l'ťquivalent ťmotionnel
d'un diplŰme de lettres.
Je pense que j'ai juste aimť l'idťe
de pouvoir utiliser mes connaissances
sur Robin Scherbatsky.
Puisque tu me connais assez bien...
est-ce que je me fais
des illusions avec Barney ?
Je ne sais pas.
Nťanmoins, je te dirai cela.
J'ai vu Barney travailler trŤs dur
pour se faire des femmes.
Je l'ai vu travailler trŤs dur
pour s'en dťbarrasser.
Je ne l'avais jamais vu travailler
aussi dur pour en garder une.
J'allais lui donner un 20.
Enfin, un 17.
Shin-Ya a un peu ruinť le coup.
Avant que tu dises quelque chose,
fini le cours d'Intro sur Robin.
Voilŗ, je me dťbarrasse du cahier.
Mais il y a... quelque chose
que je voulais te dire.
Robin, j'ai ťtť avec
beaucoup de femmes...
blondes, brunes,
rousses,
gros seins,
petits seins,
seins moyens,
certains seins ťtaient gros,
mais c'ťtait pas beau.
Le truc... des seins qui pointaient dans
des directions opposťes... Le truc...
J'ai vraiment peur
que tu me laisses tomber
et c'est pour Áa que je l'ai fait
et je suis dťsolť.
Ce que tu es bÍte.
Tu sais...
Ce cahier... contient beaucoup
d'infos personnelles,
et je pense qu'il y a mon adresse.
Et celle de ton de travail.
Si vous ne voulez pas du tonneau,
vous pouvez aller ailleurs ? Car...
Vous effrayez
les preneurs potentiels.
ConÁu par Daniel Burnham, de l'ťcole de
Chicago, dans le style des Beaux-arts,
ce joyau architectural ťtait
le premier en son genre...
- Professeur Mosby ?
- Oui, Susan ?
C'est une femme en train
de boire de la biŤre sur les toilettes.
Oui. C'ťtait...
la femme de Daniel Burnham.
C'ťtait une femme trŤs,
trŤs tourmentťe. On continue.
<i>Kids, your uncle Barney had been
called a lot of names over the years.</i>
Jerk!
Bastard!
Barack Obama Jr.?!
And yes...
we can.
<i>But there's one name none of us
ever expected to hear him called.</i>
Boyfriend.
Barney Stinson is my boyfriend.
I've said it, like, a hundred times
it still sounds weird to say.
Anything sounds weird
if you say it a hundred times.
Bowl.
But other than that,
things are good?
I don't know.
I think Barney's been single
for too long.
Like, the other night,
I wake up at 4:00 a.m...
Barney, are you awake?
This is not a one-night stand.
We're dating. Come back to bed.
That's happened three times. And
it's not just that, it's other things.
What's wrong?
It was just one thing after another
at work today, and then...
I found out my aunt's
in the hospital.
I'm just, I'm feeling
so overwhelmed and it's just...
What you need to do
is talk through this stuff.
Thanks.
And then, once you're
off the phone with Lily,
I'll be down in the bar
ready to have sex. Okay?
Look, I'm not the touchy-feely-est
person in the world, but...
- a little more effort would be nice.
- I understand.
I guess, in a lot of ways,
Barney doesn't stack up.
I mean, you've had some pretty
incredible boyfriends.
No, that's not it.
I don't know.
Maybe he just
doesn't have it in him.
Maybe is whole thing's
a big mistake.
- She really said that?
- And she meant it.
Trust me. I dated Robin for a year...
if you don't want to lose her,
you gotta try a little harder.
Be more attentive to where
she is emotionally. Just...
- be present.
- Yes, totally.
Only thing, and this is just me...
I like my testicles attached
to my body, rather than rolling around
next to some eyeliner
in Robin's purse. Stinson out!
<i>But then a funny thing happened.</i>
<i>Over the next couple weeks,
Barney was thoughtful,</i>
<i>considerate...</i>
<i>sweet.</i>
<i>In short, the perfect boyfriend.</i>
<i>Which, to Robin,
meant only one thing.</i>
- He's cheating on me.
- What?!
Why else would he buy me flowers?
He's gettin' some on the side.
Barney's not the type of guy
who would... go on.
Plus, he keeps saying
he's working late.
But when I call his office,
they say he left hours ago.
- That doesn't prove anything.
- Yes. Proof.
Good word.
I'm glad you brought that up.
Barney's briefcase.
He forgot it here this morning.
- And what do you plan on doing with it?
- We, we...
you and I... are going to open it up
and look for evidence.
Ted probably has a sledgehammer
around here somewhere.
Stop! Stop! Eye contact.
Listen to me.
Robin Scherbatsky is many things:
friend, confidant, occasional
guest star in some confusing dreams
that remind me a woman's
sexuality is a moving target.
But she is no crazy,
jealous stalker-bitch.
Let go.
I've been down in the basement storage
area going through all the stuff that
Lily and I left behind when
we moved out. I'm sorry Robin.
We should've cleared it out
for you much sooner.
- There's a basement storage area?
- You're not upset. Good.
Baby, guess what I found.
- That's great, honey.
- What the hell is that?
Marshall got it in college.
He used it as a nightstand for years.
Until we found out that Lily
was allergic to barrel resin
- Barrel resin?
- Just go with it.
- You need a hand throwing it out?
- No, I'm not...
I'm not just going to throw her out,
okay? Mabel's like family.
So... what are you going
to do with Mabel?
I want to give her away... to a lucky
new owner. Do you know anyone?
Let me think.
Do I know any rodeo clowns?
That's weird, I do. But even Lenny
wouldn't go near that mess.
He's not going to have the chance,
because I am putting old Mabel
in the Bermuda Triangle.
<i>"The Bermuda Triangle"
was the name we'd given</i>
<i>years earlier to the curb right
in front of our building.</i>
<i>Whenever we wanted to give something
away, we'd put it right there.</i>
<i>It was uncanny.</i>
This is so exciting.
Right now there's some out there
who has no idea that tonight
they're going home with just...
just the best barrel.
Let's just hope they're not allergic
to barrel sin like Lily here.
Be cool, baby. Damn!
- See you, sweetie. Good luck.
- Bye, babe.
- Now, can we please get out of here?
- I'll grab my coat.
A college notebook?!
My God, he's cheating on me
with some college girl.
I knew there was a skank but
I thought she'd at least be dumb.
"Birthday: July 23. Favorite hockey
team: the Vancouver Canucks.
Age: 29, but tells people
that she's 26."
My God, these are notes about me.
Or some 29-year-old version of me.
I hope I'm not too late!
I want to see the look of joy
on the new owner's face!
She's still there!
Okay Mabel, let's find
you a new home.
Here comes a guy!
He has walked,
walked right on by it.
He's probably rushing home to
get a handcart or something.
Hey, better hurry up, pal.
What are you guys doing with
Barney's secret Robin notebook?
Let me rephrase that.
Did you...
two ladies lose some weight?
What do you know
about this, Marshall?
Why would Barney have a notebook
full of information about me?
<i>The truth was...</i>
<i>Barney was taking a
night school class taught...</i>
<i>by me.</i>
Welcome
to Robin 101.

<i>How I Met Your Mother
5x03 - Robin 101</i>
<i>par la "Have You Met Team"
pour www.forom.com</i>
Why is Ted teaching
a class about me?
It all started a few weeks ago.
... rather than rolling around next
to some eyeliner in Robin's purse.
Stinson out!
Stinson back in.
Say...
hypothetically, I did
want to change who I am
to become a better boyfriend to Robin,
which I do not!
What kind of changes
are we talking about?
Why, I mean, there's just so much
you need to know about her.
Okay, for starters,
don't ever cry in front her.
And whatever you do,
don't cry in front
of her four times.
- What should you talking about?
- Fantasy football.
They realized they couldn't talk about
this stuff at the bar, and
since you live with Ted,
they had to find someplace safe.
So... Ted's classroom.
"How To Date Robin Scherbatsky."
Lesson one.
Now, even though she puts up
a tough exterior,
what Robin really wants,
deep down...
I'm bored.
- You said you wanted my help.
- Can we draw boobs on the chalkboard?
- We did that all ready.
- No, like, really big boobs.
No. Look, I need this, too.
I've only been a professor a few weeks.
Being up here...
it's good practice for me.
Can we have class outside?
What Robin really wants deep down...
What? I'm tweeting about you.
You should be flattered.
How do you spell...
"H's" or no?
You were just... like, the worst
student in the world, weren't you?
They said I had A-D...
something.
Can we have class outside?
Barney, I'm only gonna
say this once,
so listen up.
I love you
and I love Robin.
And I want to make this work.
So if you give me
a few weeks of attention,
I could give you
a lifetime of happiness.
Can you do that for me?
Do you think I should get Sports
Illustrated for 70% off the cover price?
Can we have class outside?
I got to find a way
to reach this kid.
"Class number two."
"Top ten Robin Scherbatsky facial
expressions and their meaning."
Now, notice the vacant eyes,
the pale, queasy expression,
suggesting nausea.
- What do these mean?
- You guys just had sex?
Wasn't me.
Dude! I worked really hard
on these slides, okay? Can we just...
This look is hunger. If you ever see
Robin looking like this,
get some food in her quick,
or one of two things will happen.
One:
weird, out-of-context laughter
or two:
spontaneously falling
to sleep in strange places.
But...
the most important facial
expression of all?
That's a building.
That's for my class.
The Flatiron Building.
Fun story about it. It was designed
by Chicago's Daniel Burnham
in the Beaux-arts style.
This architectural...
The most important facial expression
of all.
Flared nostril ridges.
Wide, unblinking eyes.
If you ever,
ever see this face, Barney,
run.
And don't... take a picture of it.
She will punch you.
And you will cry...
for the third time...
that night.
Which brings us
to an important point:
defusing the bomb.
"Defusing the bomb"?
What does that even mean?
"Three topics to distract Robin
from being mad at you."
"Distract me"?
That is so condescending.
These guys are really
starting to piss me off!
"Immediately switch the conversation
to one of the following,
unless you want Robin to start
throwing her shoes."
"Vancouver Canucks
2004 division title."
What?! That's not distracting.
That's just talking about the story
of a scrappy little underdog team
that prevailed despite
very shaky goal ending
and, frankly, the declining
skills of Trevor Linden.
"Proper gun cleaning
and maintenance."
You have to clean your gun.
My uncle had a filthy old shotgun,
blew both his thumbs off
trying to shoot a beaver.
You want to distract someone,
make them watch my uncle
try to eat corn on the cob.
"Emperor penguins."
Did you know that
before intercourse,
the male and female emperor
penguins bow to each other?
Mr. Penguin.
Mrs. Penguin.
Oh, God, silly penguins,
acting all fancy.
What were we talking about?
Looks like we got a taker.
Oh, come on, dude.
You know you want to
a guy like you, beard, no mustache.
You're exactly the kind of guy
who could use a sweet barrel. Do it.
That's not a fire hydrant!
For shame, Sir.
For shame!
I bet you couldn't even grow
a mustache if you wanted to.
- Neither can you, sweetie.
- He doesn't know that, baby! God!
Ted's only teaching Barney
horrible things about me.
I don't know. Check this out.
This is actually kind of sweet.
Now, we all know Robin's not
what you'd call "touchy-feely."
She doesn't say, "I love you",
like a normal person.
Instead, she'll laugh,
shake her head, give you
a little smile and say:
"You're an idiot."
"You're an idiot"?
If she tells you you're an idiot,
you're a lucky man.
And if she does say "I love you",
she's already broken up
with you in her mind.
I think's nice
that Ted knows you that well.
Too bad it's next
to a page entitled...
"Robin Scherbatsky's
surprising erogenous zones."
Right knee...
ticklish.
Left knee...
Does lefty like that?
Lefty like that.
I can't believe I'm taking
sexual advice from Ted Mosby.
That's like taking
fashion advice from...
well, Ted Mosby.
Here's a good one.
"Top five things never
to do around Robin."
"Never, ever play the
"Guess Who" game with her".
What do you mean?
Guess who?
It's me!
Number four: "Unless you want
to see it 80 times a day,
for the next month, never
show Robin a YouTube clip
of an animal playing
a musical instrument."
Do you have a problem
with this class?
It's boring as hell and
I'm not learning anything.
Maybe the problem is your attitude.
You're not listening to a word I say.
Can you hear this, Professor?
Or should I turn it up for you?
<i>It may not have been
a thumbs-up, kids.</i>
You think you're not
learning anything?
- Pop quiz.
- What...
When Robin's PMS-ing, what kind
of chocolate should you get her?
- Trick question. Get her butterscotch.
- Correct! Why?
Butterscotch is to Canadian women
what chocolate is to American women.
What is Robin's dream job?
To become the most successful
female TV journalist of all time.
And if she achieves that,
will she truly be happy?
Robin's deep-seated need
for attention can traced back
to her father's emotional distance, and
no amount of success will ever make up
for what she truly needs, which is
six simple words from her Dad,
"Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?"
But I guess you're right.
You haven't learned anything.
Sorry to have wasted your time.
"O Captain! My Captain!"
How good was Dead Poet's Society?
I know, right? The end? Tears.
Can I just say that
my deepest need in life
is not to have my father to say,
"I am proud of you, eh?"
Than why are you crying right now?
- I'm not crying.
- Oh, sweetie.
- Can I get you some butterscotch?
- Stop it.
Wait a second. It says here that
the class meets at 6:15 on Tuesday.
- So?
- That's right now.
Now, as you can see,
well over 50% of the blankets
have been dragged onto her side.
Make no mistake.
Robin Scherbatsky
is a classic,
textbook...
cover hog.
- Any questions?
- I have one.
Yes, Robin?
Flared nostril ridges.
Wide, unblinking eyes.
I got this.
Emperor penguins... crazy?
What the hell do you
two think you're doing?
Did you sells out?
I was vulnerable.
I said good-bye to
a very dear friend today.
Dude, it's a barrel!
- You're giving Mabel away?
- I have so many questions.
Why would you do this?
What were you thinking?
Who the hell is that guy?
That's Shin-Ya. He's sort of
been auditing the class.
"Auditing"?
I tried to explain to him
it wasn't a real class,
but I don't think he speaks
much English.
On the bright side, he came
in handy standing in for you
- during the role-playing exercises.
- Wait. You did role-playing exercises
where I was played by Shin-Ya?
You know, I can't believe you, Ted.
You actually think you're
some kind of an expert on me?
He is an expert.
He's a great teacher!
Kiss ass.
You know, half the stuff in this
notebook is patently wrong.
Really? Name one wrong thing.
"Robin Scherbatsky's surprising
erogenous zones"?
Let me clear something up
for you, Ted.
Does lefty like that?
The right one's ticklish, I guess.
But the left one, yeah,
I'm glad you're back there.
Because that is just some
sweet, sweet lovin'.
Noted.
- That was a lie?
- We had just started dating.
I was being nice.
And you.
You know, I got it into my head
this week that you were cheating on me.
I even broke open your briefcase
to look for evidence.
That is a huge
violation of my privacy!
Go on.
You know, in a way, I was right.
You cheated. You can't get
some crib sheet on dating me.
That's not how it works.
If we didn't figure out how to be with
each other in a real, honest way,
I don't see the
point of even trying.
What do you want?
Look.
All that stuff I told Barney...
It was personal between you and me.
I'm really sorry.
I guess I'm impressed
by how much you remembered.
It's funny.
When you date someone,
it's like you're
taking one long course
in who that person is
and then, when you break up,
all that stuff becomes useless.
It's the emotional equivalent
of an English degree.
I guess I just liked the idea of
putting all my Robin Scherbatsky
knowledge to good use, you know?
Since you know me pretty well...
am I fooling myself
with this whole Barney thing?
I don't know.
I will say this, though.
I've seen Barney work
very hard to get women.
I've seen him work very
hard to get rid of women.
I've never seen him work
this hard to keep one around.
I was going to give him an A.
Well, B+...
Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.
Before you say anything, I am done
with this stupid Robin 101, okay?
Here, I'll get rid of the notebook.
But there's... there's something that
I did want to say to you.
Robin, I have been
with a lot of women...
blondes, brunettes,
redheads,
big boobs,
small boobs,
medium boobs,
some boobs that were big,
but kind of in a bad way.
The point is... boobs that pointed
in opposite direc... The point is...
I'm really scared that
you're going to dump me
and that's why I did this
and I'm sorry.
You're an idiot.
You know...
That notebook... does contain
a lot of personal info,
and I think it has my home address.
And your work address.
Guys! If you don't want the barrel,
can you sit somewhere else? Cause...
You're scaring away
potential takers.
Designed by Chicago's Daniel Burnham
in the Beaux-arts style,
this architectural gem
was the first of its kind...
- Professor Mosby?
- Yes, Susan?
That's a woman drinking beer
on the toilet.
Right. That...
was Daniel Burnham's wife.
She was a troubled,
troubled woman. We are moving on.
<i>C'était l'automne 2009
et j'étais un professeur.</i>
<i>Donc j'avais décidé
de changer un peu de look.</i>
<i>Et les gens le remarquait.</i>
Du tweed.
Le textile des eunuques.
Je me suis toujours demandé pour ces
vestes en tweed ont les coudes rapiécés.
Parce que ceux
qui les portent disent tout le temps,
"Bon Dieu.
Pourquoi je ne baise jamais ?"
Tu as tort.
Les femmes aiment le look prof.
Ce n'est pas faux.
Je me souviens que je trouvais
mon prof de maths de 3ème très sexy.
Je me demande
si Harold est encore en prison.
Quoi ?
Fraude Fiscale.
Entre autres.
Vous deux, Marshall et moi
voulons vous inviter
pour une soirée couple.
Bien sûr. Pourquoi pas ?
<i>Pendant longtemps, Marshall et Lilly
était le seul couple marié</i>
<i>dans un groupe de célibataire.</i>
<i>On se sent isolé.</i>
<i>Donc ils cherchaient sans relâche
un autre couple pour se voir à quatre.</i>
<i>Il n'y avait qu'un seul problème.</i>
- Bienvenus.
- Du gouda ?
<i>Ils étaient nuls pour ça.</i>
C'est génial. On s'amuse.
Vous vous amusez, hein ?
Alors, on devrait s'avancer
et se bloquer le nouvel an ?
On est en avril.
C'est vrai. Désolé.
On prend un peu trop d'avance.
Parlons de Thanksgiving.
Nos parents sont
impatients de vous rencontrer !
On devrait y aller.
Attendez, si vous partez maintenant
le Colonel Moutarde va s'en sortir.
Il est tard. Il faut qu'on y aille.
Il reste la tarte.
Ce soir, c'était fantastique.
On devrait se refaire ça.
Désolé, Marshall
mais Falguni et moi
on ne t'aime pas tant que ça.
Toi non plus.
<i>Mais au moment où
Lily et Marshall allait abandonner,</i>
<i>deux de leurs meilleurs amis
se sont mis ensemble.</i>
<i>Et l'espoir réapparaissait
dans leurs coeurs.</i>
<i>Donc quand Lily a dit...</i>
Marshall et moi voulons
vous inviter pour une soirée couple.
Bien sûr, pourquoi pas ?
<i>Barney et Robin n'avaient aucune idée
de ce qui les attendait.</i>
D'accord. C'est partie.
Revoyons ce qu'on a prévu.
Barney et Robin entre ici,
s'arrêtent ici pour les margaritas.
C'est bien pour commence à discuter.
On peut leur parler
de notre voyage à Cabo.
Génial parce que j'ai une histoire
sur Sammy Hagar
et une gaufre belge, parée.
Puis on passe à l'apéritif. Et,
suivant comment ça se passe,
des jeux de mimes avant le dîner.
Ouais, mais...
on y jouera en...
On écoutera ?
OK, tu te mettras avec Robin.
Bébé, on peut le faire.
- Bienvenus.
- Du gouda ?
<i>De mon côté, ma théorie à la noix disant
que les femmes aiment le look prof</i>
<i>s'avérait être vraie.</i>
C'est dur de noter les copies ?
Faut rendre ça marrant.
Par exemple...
chaque fois que je vois une faute
d'orthographe, je bois un coup.
Je suis plein là,
la faute au système scolaire publique.
<i>Des fois les choses semblent
magiquement bien tomber.</i>
Donc, tu as dit que
tu vivais juste au-dessus ?
<i>Que ce soit
du côté simple rencard...</i>
Soyez prudents.
<i>... ou du côté soirée à quatre.</i>
- Réussi !
- La meilleure soirée au monde !
La pire soirée au monde !

C'était comment
hier soir avec Lily et Marshall ?
- Brutal.
- À quel point ?
C'était comme un rencard
avec une fille
triste et potelée
que notre mère nous a fait appeler.
Ils étaient si nerveux
qu'ils n'étaient pas sensé
la plupart du temps.
Entrez.
Vous voulez une margarita ?
À Cabo, j'ai vu Sammy Hagar
mangé une gaufre belge !
Et ils n'arrêtaient pas de nous fourrer
des plateaux de bouffe sous le nez.
Laisse-moi deviner, Marshall
a été lourd, avec le fromage ?
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Pauvre Marshall.
Lily fait sa cuisine de gourmet,
et Marshall n'a le droit de faire
qu'un petit bout de fromage.
Melon entouré de jambon.
Vous allez adorer ce gouda.
Coquilles St Jacques grillées

Sérieusement,
n'oubliez pas le gouda.
Et raviolis de homard
dans de l'huile de truffe.
Tic-tac fait l'horloge du gouda.
On n'avait pas compris
qu'il y aurait à dîner.
On a pris des tacos en venant ici.
PS, pas si bons, d'ailleurs.
Et si tout ne marchait pas comme
ils le voulaient ils étaient en panique.
Comment ça,
le minuteur ne marche plus ?
Que va-t-on utiliser
pour le jeu de mimes, chéri ?
J'y travaille, chérie.
Distrais-les.
Maintenant, Robin...
Tu travailles à la télévision.
Nous rencontrons
quelques problèmes techniques.
T'as saisi ?
On rigole tout le temps.
Pas vrai ? Rigole, Marshall.
Allez, ils étaient juste contents.
Ils recherchent un couple
meilleur ami depuis toujours.
En plus, je suis sûr
qu'ils n'étaient pas si mal.
Montre-lui.
C'est un site web que Marshall
a déjà fait sur notre soirée d'hier.
Ça s'appelle :
lameilleuresoireeaumonde.com.
<i>C'était la meilleure soirée au monde</i>
<i>Des rires pleuvaient
comme les giboulées de Mars</i>
<i>On a parlé pendant des heures...</i>
- <i>Meilleure soirée au monde</i>
- C'est pas bon.
<i>Puis on a fait des jeux de mimes</i>
<i>Lily a fait de la crème brulée...</i>
<i>Et maintenant qu'on est
le meilleur couple d'amis</i>
<i>Il ne reste qu'une chose</i>
<i>À dire...</i>
<i>Êtes-vous libre ?...</i>
<i>Êtes-vous libre samedi prochain ?</i>
<i>- C'est le 17.
- Êtes-vous libre ?</i>
Ou bien vendredi ou dimanche.
Ou n'importe quel jour, en fait.
Pas besoin de dire qu'on a changé
tous les deux d'adresse mail.
Je ne comprends pas.
Si la soirée d'hier était si horrible
pourquoi Lily et Marshall
pensent que c'était génial ?
On ne pensait pas qu'on allait
s'amuser à ce point-là.
Tant pis pour tous les autres
samedi soirs de ma vie
parce que celui-là
les a réduits à néant.
- On se refera ça bientôt.
- Oui, on s'appelle.
Ce sont vos amis ! Comment pouvez-vous
leur mentir comme ça ?
C'est ce qu'on dit à la fin
d'un rencard merdique.
Super soirée, hier soir.
On se refera ça bientôt.
On s'appelle.
Pas vrai ?
- C'était qui ?
- Je ne veux pas me vanter, mais
on dirait que les nanas
aiment vraiment ce truc de prof.
Hier soir, elle m'a repéré au bar.
Et là...
Elle est s'est endormie sur le canapé,
mais, bon,
ça arrive.
- Non, ça n'arrive pas.
- Si, si, bien sûr.
Elle était simplement fatiguée
d'avoir été autant excitée.
Mais tu l'as entendue.
Elle veut qu'on se revoit, bientôt.
Laisse-moi te poser une question.
Où vit cette fille, exactement ?
Westchester. Pourquoi ?
- Tu es l'Aubergiste Abstinent.
- Oh, mon Dieu ! Tu as raison !
C'est carrément
l'Aubergiste Abstinent !
Putain mais c'est quoi
"l'Aubergiste Abstinent" ?
Plusieurs hommes...
je dirais même, plusieurs âmes...
ont leurs propres récits
de l'Aubergiste Abstinent.
Pourquoi, j'en ai rencontré une
il y a à peine un an.
J'ai même composé un poème
à son sujet.
- Tu veux l'entendre ?
- Pas vraiment.
"C'était la nuit du réveillon
et le temps se faisait menaçant.
Il était 3 h du matin
et j'étais coincé dans le Queens.
<i>La taverne se vidait,</i>
<i>Les lampes à gaz faiblissaient."</i>
<i>Le chariot à chevaux
était tout à fait enneigé..."</i>
Attends.
Si c'était l'année dernière,
pourquoi fais-tu comme-ci
il s'agissait d'Oliver Twist ?
C'est un poème.
<i>"La dernière tournée approchait</i>
<i>Et mes chances s'amenuisaient.</i>
<i>Alors je me tournai vers la gauche</i>
<i>Et étouffai un cri.</i>
<i>Elle avait une barbe
de poils de pêches</i>
<i>Et pesait 16 pierres.</i>
<i>Elle engloutit des ailes de poulets</i>
<i>Et avala les os.</i>
<i>J'étouffai un cri</i>
<i>Et vomis dans ma bouche.</i>
<i>Je demandai,</i> "Où vis-tu ?"
<i>Et elle dit,</i> "A un bloc au sud."
<i>J'avalai ma fierté</i>
<i>Et six verres de whisky.</i>
<i>Et priai les dieux</i>
<i>Qu'elle ne fût pas trop folâtre.</i>
<i>De retour dans sa cave,
elle nous prépara un en-cas.</i>
<i>Sous ses puissants pas,
le sol en bois craqua.</i>
<i>Mais quand elle revint,</i>
<i>elle trouva un homme
profondément assoupi.</i>
<i>Et ainsi elle devint</i>
<i>l'Aubergiste Abstinente."</i>
Et toi aussi.
Tu dis que cette fille m'a utilisé
pour avoir un endroit où dormir ?
Ted, tu as dis
que tu vivais juste au dessus.
Elle a vu la veste en tweed
ce qui veut typiquement dire
que tu n'es pas intéressé, voire
probablement incapable de faire l'amour.
Et elle s'est dit,
"Hé, logement gratuit."
Pas moyen.
Je ne suis pas
l'Aubergiste Abstinent.
Cette fille n'avait aucune intention
de sortir un jour avec toi.
Ce qui est drôle, car d'habitude
c'est l'Aubergiste qui offre
un service de refus.
Hé, les gars. Bonne nouvelle.
Vous pouvez ignorer tous les e-mails
et texto qu'on vous a envoyé.
On l'a fait. Continue.
Parce qu'on a pris
de l'avance et réservé
ce week-end à quatre
dans le Vermont !
Attendez, vous étiez sérieux ?
On ne rigole jamais à propos des B&B,
surtout pas en pleine saison du sirop.
Samedi, c'est cueillette de pommes,
brocante, et après
une balade en campagne.
Et le dimanche, on se lève à 6 h pour
la randonnée de la chute des feuilles.
Vous devriez préparer vos grosses
chaussettes car il fait froid là-haut.
Je suis désolé qu'on ait évité
vos appels
mais on vous respecte trop
en tant qu'amis
pour vous faire tourner en rond.
Vous méritez la vérité.
La marine américaine a trouvé une forme
de vie extra-terrestre intelligente
au fond de l'océan.
Pour des raisons
que je ne peux expliquer,
Robin et moi avons été choisis
pour mener l'expédition.
Ça ressemble un peu au genre
de trucs que tu sors aux filles
quand tu es trop lâche
pour les larguer.
Tu sais, ça y ressemble exactement.
Mais si c'est vrai, c'est génial.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Écoutez, tous les trucs de couples,
c'est pas notre truc.
Avec Barney on est à peine équipés pour
sortir ensemble, encore moins pour vous.
En plus,
le truc des extra-terrestres.
- Allez, Marshall. On y va.
- On y va.
- Non... Lily...
- Vous savez quoi ?
J'espère que ces extra-terrestres
sous-marins sont sans pitié.
Comme ça
vous vous entendrez à merveille.
Je pense qu'ils ont marché.
Dire qu'ils ont rompu avec nous.
On est tellement adorables.
Non, on ne l'est pas.
On est moches et dégoûtants.
- Je croyais qu'on avait tout bien fait.
- Je sais !
Je sais.
Il y avait le gouda.
On avait mon histoire de gaufre. Je leur
ai envoyé un super montage photo.
Rien.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Marshall, je te l'ai dit et répété.
Tu dois arrêter de les envoyer
à tout le monde.
<i>C'était vrai.</i>
<i>Marshall était devenu un drogué
de la création de montages</i>
<i>photos et audio documentant
des événements quelconques.</i>
<i>Donc, pendant des mois,
tous les amis de Marshall</i>
<i>et ses collègues recevaient
des mails comme ceux-là...</i>
<i>J'ai commandé
un repas chinois aujourd'hui</i>
<i>De la sauce moo shu a tout sali</i>
<i>Retourné le coussin</i>
<i>Maintenant tout va bien.</i>
<i>Chat-sitting pour la mère de Lily</i>
<i>Chat-sitting pour la mère de Lily</i>
<i>On va bien rigoler</i>
<i>Ça va tous nous rapprocher.</i>
<i>Funérailles de chat...</i>
<i>Funérailles de chat...</i>
<i>C'était un accident</i>
<i>Et pas totalement de ma faute</i>
<i>Funérailles de chat...</i>
<i>Tu nous manqueras, Whiskers.</i>
Je ne peux pas croire
que tu leur en aies envoyé un.
Ils doivent penser
qu'on est timbrés.
Si je me souviens bien, ils ont rompu
après que tu leur aies parlé du Vermont.
C'était beaucoup trop tôt. D'abord
une croisière autour de la ville,
ensuite un voyage au Vermont. C'est une
erreur de débutant et tu vaux plus.
Et toi qui oublies de vérifier
le minuteur pour les jeux de mimes ?
Je t'ai donné une tâche, Marshall.
Une tâche.
Une tâche ?
Une tâche ?
Vraiment ?
Je suppose que le gouda
a marché tout seul jusqu'ici,
s'est coupé lui-même,
et s'est arrangé tout seul
en un parfait demi cercle
autour de non pas trois,
ni quatre...
mais cinq
différentes sortes de solides
crackers au fromage ?
C'est toi
le solide cracker au fromage !
Lily et Marshall ne sont pas
venus au bar de la semaine.
Ils le prennent vraiment mal.
Je pourrais t'écouter me faire
culpabiliser toute la journée,
mais ne dois-tu pas retourner
à l'auberge ?
Qui surveille la réception ?
Sérieusement, ce sont vos amis.
Vous devez vous excuser.
De ton point de vue, Ted,
en tant qu'Aubergiste,
tu fais ce truc bon marché
de ne changer les draps
qu'à la demande ?
Combien d'eau t'économises
réellement ?
Tu sais que j'ai raison. Ignorer
un problème ne le fait pas s'en aller.
Ça l'empire.
- T'as raison.
- Merci.
Toute cette abstinence
t'as rendu sage.
Pour l'amour de Dieu !
Les pastilles à la menthe
sur l'oreiller !
Et ne fais pas payer le wifi.
Ça fait gourmand.
<i>Mais finalement, même Barney et
Robin ont fini par admettre</i>
<i>qu'ils devaient à Lily et Marshall
des excuses.</i>
On voulait dire qu'on était désolés.
J'aurais préféré que vous appeliez.
Je le jure, il était vraiment là,
en train de manger une gaufre belge.
Il ne peut pas en avoir profité
autant que j'apprécie ce gouda.
Écoutez...
Maintenant ça va être difficile.
On vous appellera.
Attends, on voulait juste...
Ça faisait longtemps. Asseyez-vous.
On ne peut pas.
On est avec Py et Shea.
C'est juste qu'on ne vous a pas vu
depuis une semaine.
On pourrait traîner tous les six.
Ça serait bizarre.
On est un peu en rencard à quatre.
On ne voudrait pas que vous vous sentiez
comme la quatrième et la cinquième roue.
Qui sont ces gens ?
Ils arrivent d'Hawaï.
Py est un vrai gourmet
et Shea, eh bien...
C'est juste...
Shea... Shea c'est juste...
Bref, on ne reste pas longtemps.
On prend juste une petite bière
et on emmène ces dingues pour
une croisière autour de la ville.
On dirait que
ça devient plutôt sérieux.
On ne veut pas
se porter la poisse, mais...
on pense que
c'est peut-être les bons.
- Qui a besoin d'eux ?
- Pas nous.
<i>Vivre seuls</i>
<i>On pense à tous ceux qu'on a connus</i>
<i>Mais quand on les appelle</i>
<i>Personne n'est là</i>
Une table pour deux.
Que vous deux ?
<i>Complètement seuls</i>
<i>On ne veut pas être</i>
<i>Complètement seuls</i>
<i>Plus jamais</i>
<i>Complètement seuls...</i>
Et si on appelait
ce couple bizarre vers chez toi,
tu sais, avec les furets ?
Ils voudront peut-être venir
et joué au Taboo.
Après minuit ? C'est mort.
On ne peut pas les appeler
pour un Taboo. C'est pathétique.
T'es en jogging ?
Peut-être. C'est un Armani.
Les gars,
j'ai une mauvaise nouvelle.
Donc je vais la dire simplement.
Vous êtes un couple.
Et même si vous vous battez,
les couples ont besoin d'autre couple.
C'est pour ça que
Marshall et Lily vous manquent.
Vous ne pouvez pas l'admettre ?
- C'est génial, Lily !
- Je sais !
Quand j'ai eu cette main-gauche-jaune,
j'étais genre, "Quoi ?".
- Vous êtes les meilleurs.
- Je te le renvoie !
Pour les jeux de mimes.
Comment on sait que vous n'allez pas
nous blesser encore une fois ?
Vous ne le savez pas.
Vous savez ? On a deux...
amis super sympa
dans notre appartement
qui sont parfaits pour nous.
Alors que faites-vous...
là sous la pluie avec nous ?
Merde.
Pourquoi cette attirance
vers un mauvais garçon...
et une mauvaise fille ?
Je pense
qu'on peut les faire changer.
Venez-là, vous deux.
On n'évitera plus jamais le gouda.
<i>Complètement seuls...</i>
J'ai un petit poème pour toi.
Tu veux l'écouter ?
- Pas vraiment.
- "C'était la nuit avant celle-ci,
J'avais des heures à tuer.
<i>Je m'assis à la taverne,
notant des parchemins avec un plume."</i>
Une plume ?
Barney, c'est un poème.
<i>Une demoiselle peuplée du balcon
me lança un sourire.</i>
<i>Sa robe disait "grande classe"
mais ses yeux disait "péchés".</i>
<i>Elle dit, "Vous êtes professeur ?"</i>
<i>Et je dis, "En effet".</i>
<i>"Emmenez-moi", gémit-elle.
"Le tweed m'excite".</i>
<i>Avec hâte nous galopâmes
de suite dans ma chambre.</i>
<i>Nous tombâmes sur le divan,
et mec, c'était trop bon.</i>
<i>Je lui délaçai le corsage.
Notre passions grandit.</i>
<i>Et ainsi se termine le conte</i>
<i>de l'Aubergiste Abstinent."</i>
Pas moyen.
T'as tout inventé.
Tu reviens te coucher, professeur ?
Mon Dieu, j'aime être célibataire.
T'es prêt pour le brunch
avec Lily et Marshall ?
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fais ?
<i>It was the Fall of 2009
and I was a professor now.</i>
<i>So I decided to change
my look a little bit.</i>
<i>And people were noticing.</i>
Tweed.
Textile of the eunuch.
I've always wondered why those
tweed jackets have elbow patches.
Because the people who wear them
are constantly going,
"Geez. Why can I get laid?"
You are wrong.
The ladies dig the professor look.
There is something to that.
I remember thinking my tenth grade
math teacher was very sexy.
I wonder if Harold's still in jail.
What?
Tax evasion.
Among other things.
So guys, Marshall and I wanted
to invite you to our place
for a little couples' night.
Sure. Why not?
<i>For years, Marshall and Lily
had been the only married couple</i>
<i>in a group full of single people.</i>
<i>It got lonely.</i>
<i>So they were always searching
for another couple to double-date.</i>
<i>There was only one problem.</i>
- Welcome.
- Gouda?
<i>They sucked at it.</i>
This is great. We're having fun.
You're having fun, right?
So, should we just go ahead
and lock the four of us in
for new year's?
It's april.
Right. Sorry.
We're getting ahead of ourselves.
Let's talk Thanksgiving.
Our parents really want to meet you!
Well, we should probably be going.
Wait. But, wait, if you leave now,
Colonel Mustard just gets away with it.
It's getting pretty late.
We're going to go.
There's still pie.
Tonight was fantastic.
We should do it again.
I'm sorry, Marshall
but Falguni and I
are just not that into you.
And you.
<i>But just when Lily and Marshall
were about to give up,</i>
<i>two of their best friends
in the world got together.</i>
<i>And hope returned to their hearts.</i>
<i>So when Lily said...</i>
Marshall and I wanted to invite you to
our place for a little couples' night.
Sure, why not?
<i>Barney and Robin had no idea
what they were about to walk into.</i>
Okay. Game time.
Let's review the flow of the room.
Barney and Robin enter here,
stop here for margaritas.
That's a great conversation starter.
We can tell them about
our trip to Cabo.
Great, cause I got that story
about Sammy Hagar
and the Belgian waffle
locked and loaded.
Then we'll move on to the
hot apps station. And,
depending on how things are going,
some lively pre-dinner charades.
Right, but...
we'll play that one by...
Sounds like?
Okay, you can be Robin's partner.
Baby, we can do this.
- Welcome.
- Gouda?
<i>Meanwhile, my half-baked theory
that ladies dig the professor look</i>
<i>was actually proving to be true.</i>
So is it hard to grade papers?
You've just got to make it fun.
For example...
every time I spot a grammatical error,
I do a shot.
I'm trashed right now
and I blame our public school system.
<i>Sometimes things just seem
to magically fall into place.</i>
So, you said
you live right upstairs?
<i>Whether it's in the dating world...</i>
Take care.
<i>... or the double-dating world.</i>
- Nailed it!
- Best night ever!
Worst night ever.

<i>How I Met Your Mother
5x04 - The Sexless Innkeeper</i>
<i>par la "Have You Met Team"
pour www.forom.com</i>
How was the big couples'
night with Marshall and Lily?
- Brutal.
- Really? How?
It was like we were
on a date with a sad,
chubby girl our mom made us call.
And they were so nervous,
that they weren't even
making sense half of the time.
Come on in.
Would you like a margarita?
In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar
eating a Belgian waffle!
And they kept shoving platters
of food in our faces.
Let me guess, did Marshall get, like,
super intense about the cheese?
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- Poor Marshall.
Lily's this gourmet cook,
and all she lets Marshall do is
pick out one sad block of cheese.
That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.
You guys are going to want
to get in on this gouda.
That's seared scallops
with a mango chutney.
Seriously, don't sleep on the gouda.
And that's lobster ravioli
in a black truffle oil.
Tick-tock goes the gouda clock.
We didn't realize
there was gonna be dinner.
We sucked down
a couple tacos outside the subway.
PS, not sitting great.
And if anything didn't go according
to plan, they would freak out.
What do you mean,
the egg timer is broken?
What are we going to use
for charades, sweetie?
I'm working on it, darling.
Okay? Just stall them.
Now, Robin...
You work in television.
We're experiencing some
technical difficulties.
You get that?
We're still laughing.
Right? Laugh, Marshall.
Come on, they just got excited.
They've been looking for couple
best friends forever.
Plus, I'm sure
they weren't that bad.
Show him.
This is a web site Marshall
already made about last night.
It's called:
itwasthebestnightever.com.
<i>It was the best night ever</i>
<i>Laughter raining down
like April showers</i>
<i>We talked for hours...</i>
- <i>Best night ever</i>
- That's not good.
<i>Then we played charades</i>
<i>Lily made some creme brulee...</i>
<i>And now that we're
best couple friends</i>
<i>There's only one thing</i>
<i>Left to say...</i>
<i>Are you free?...</i>
<i>Are you free next Saturday?</i>
- That's the 17th.
- <i>Are you free?</i>
Friday or Sunday would also work.
Or basically any other day.
Needless to say, we've both
changed our e-mail addresses.
I don't understand.
If last night went so horribly,
why do Lily and Marshall
think it was such a hit?
We knew we were gonna have fun tonight
but we had no idea how much.
Tough luck, every Saturday night
I've ever had,
cause this one just
blew you out of the water.
- Let's do it again, soon.
- Yeah, we'll call you.
They're your friends! Why would you
just blatantly lie to them like that?
That's what you say
at the end of a crappy date.
Great time last night.
Let's do it again, soon.
I'll call you.
Right?
- Who was that?
- I don't want to brag, but
it seems chicks are really digging
the whole professor thing.
Last night,
she picked me up at the bar.
And then...
She actually wound up falling asleep
on the couch. But, hey,
that happens.
- No, it doesn't.
- Sure, it does.
You know, she was just exhausted
from being turned on.
But you heard her.
She wants to do it again, soon.
Ted, let me ask you a question.
Where does this girl live, exactly?
Westchester. Why?
- You're the Sexless Innkeeper.
- Oh, my God! You're right!
He's totally the Sexless Innkeeper!
What the hell is
"the Sexless Innkeeper"?
Many a man...
nay, many a soul...
has their own tale of
the Sexless Innkeeper.
Why, I had run-in
with one just last year.
I even composed a poem about it.
- Would you care to hear it?
- Not really.
"It was the night before new year's
and the weather grew mean.
It was 3:00 in the morning
and I was stranded in queens."
<i>"The tavern grew empty,</i>
<i>the gas lights grew dim."</i>
<i>"The horse-drawn carriages
were all but snowed in..."</i>
Wait. If this was last year,
why are you acting like
it was Oliver Twist?
It's a poem.
<i>"Last call was approaching</i>
<i>and my fortunes looked bleak."</i>
<i>"Then I turned to my left</i>
<i>and stifled a shriek."</i>
<i>"She had a peach fuzz beard</i>
<i>and weighed 16 stone."</i>
<i>"She gobbled up hot wings</i>
<i>and swallowed the bones."</i>
<i>"I muffled a scream</i>
<i>and threw up in my mouth."</i>
<i>I asked,</i> "Where do you live?"
<i>And she said,</i> "One block south."
<i>"I swallowed my pride</i>
<i>and six shots of whiskey."</i>
<i>"And prayed to the gods</i>
<i>that she wasn't too frisky."</i>
<i>"Back in her cave,
she prepared us a snack."</i>
<i>"Neath her mighty hooves,
the floorboards did crack."</i>
<i>"But when she returned,</i>
<i>she found a sound sleeper."</i>
<i>"And thus she became</i>
<i>the Sexless Innkeeper."</i>
And so are you
Wait, you're saying that girl
just used me for a place to crash?
Ted, you mentioned that
you live right upstairs.
She saw the tweed jacket
which basically says
you're not interested in, nor probably
even capable of, having sex.
And she thought,
"Hey, free lodging."
No way.
I'm not the Sexless Innkeeper.
That girl had no intention
of ever hooking up with you.
Which is funny, because usually
it's the Innkeeper
who offers turndown service.
Hey, guys. Good news.
First of all, you can ignore all the
e-mails and texts we've sent you.
We have. Go on.
Because we went ahead and booked
that couples weekend
for all of us in Vermont!
Wait, you guys were
serious about that?
We never joke about B&B's, especially
at the height of syrup season.
Saturday we've got apple-picking,
antiquing, then
a hanted hay ride.
And then on Sunday, we're up
at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike.
Now, you better pack your long Johns,
cause it is cold up there.
I'm sorry that we have been
dodging your calls
but we respect you guys
too much as friends
to give you some song and dance.
You deserve the truth.
The US Navy has found
intelligent alien life
at the bottom of the ocean.
For reasons I can't explain,
Robin and I have been tapped
to lead the expedition.
That kind of sounds like
the stuff you say to girls
when you're too much
of a coward to dump them.
You know, that's exactly
what it sounds like.
But if that's true, that's awesome.
What's going on?
Look, all the couple-y stuff,
it's just not us.
Barney and I are barely equipped
to date each other, let alone you guys.
Plus, the alien thing.
- Come on, Marshall. Let's go.
- Let's go.
- No... Lily...
- You know what?
I hope those underwater aliens
are cold-blooded.
Cause then you guys will
get along just fine.
I think they bought it.
I can't believe they
broke up with us.
We're so lovable.
No, we're not.
We're ugly and gross.
- I thought we did everything right.
- I know!
I know. We had the gouda.
We had my waffle story. I even sent
them a awesome photo montage.
Nothing.
Oh, dear God.
Marshall, we've been
over and over this.
You have to stop
sending those to people.
<i>It was true.</i>
<i>Marshall had become addicted
to creating songs</i>
<i>and photo montage is documenting
various mundane events.</i>
<i>So for months,
all of Marshall's friends and</i>
<i>professional colleagues
were getting e-mails like this...</i>
<i>Ordered Chinese food today</i>
<i>Some moo shu pork sauce got away</i>
<i>Flipped the cushion</i>
<i>Now everything's okay.</i>
<i>Cat-sitting for Lily's mom</i>
<i>Cat-sitting for Lily's mom</i>
<i>It's gonna be fun</i>
<i>It's gonna bring us all
closer together.</i>
<i>Cat funeral...</i>
<i>Cat funeral...</i>
<i>It was an accident</i>
<i>And not entirely my fault</i>
<i>Cat funeral...</i>
<i>We'll miss you, Whiskers.</i>
I can't believe you sent them
one of those.
They think we're insane now.
If I recall, they didn't dump us until
you brought up that Vermont trip.
It was way too early.
First, a boat ride around the city,
then a trip to Vermont. It's a rookie
mistake, and you're better than that.
What about you forgetting to check
the egg timer for charades?
I gave you one thing to do,
Marshall. One thing.
One thing?
One thing?
Really?
I guess that gouda
just walked itself
right through the door...
sliced itself up,
and arranged itself
in a perfect semi-circle
around not three,
not four...
but five
different kinds of sturdy,
cheese-bearing crackers?
You're a sturdy,
cheese-bearing cracker!
Lily and Marshall haven't been
to the bar all week.
They're taking this really hard.
I could listen to this
guilt trip all day,
but don't you have to
get back up to the inn?
Who's working the front desk?
Seriously, they're your friends.
You got to go apologize.
To your point, Ted,
as an Innkeeper,
do you do that cheapy thing
where you only change
the linens upon request?
How much water
is that actually saving?
Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring
a problem doesn't make it go away.
Usually, it just makes it bigger.
- You're right.
- Thank you.
All that sexlessness
has made you wise.
For God's sake!
Mint on the pillow!
And don't charge for wi-fi.
It seems greedy!
<i>But eventually,
even Barney and Robin had to admit</i>
<i>they owed Lily and Marshall
an apology.</i>
We wanted to say we're sorry.
I wish you had called.
I swear, he was right there
just eating a Belgian waffle!
He can't have enjoyed it as much
as I'm enjoying this gouda!
Listen...
Now's not a good time.
We'll call you.
Wait, we just want...
Long time no see.
Have a seat.
We can't.
We're here with Py and Shea.
It's just... we haven't seen
you guys all week.
Maybe all six of us could hang out.
It might be weird.
We're kind of on a double date.
Wouldn't want you to feel
like a fifth and sixth wheel.
Who the hell are these people?
They just moved here from Hawaii.
Py is a total foodie
and Shea, well...
She's...
Shea... Shea is just...
Anyhoo, we can't stay long.
We're just gonna grab a quick beer
and then take these kooks
for a boat ride around the city.
It sounds like this is
getting pretty serious.
We don't want to jinx it, but...
we kind of think
they might be the two.
- Who needs 'em?
- Not us.
<i>Livin alone</i>
<i>We think of all the friends
we've known</i>
<i>But when we dial the telephone</i>
<i>Nobody's home</i>
Two for dinner.
Just the two of you?
<i>All by ourselves</i>
<i>Don't want to be</i>
<i>All by ourselves</i>
<i>Anymore</i>
<i>All by ourselves...</i>
Why don't we call that
weird couple down the hall
from you? You know, with the ferrets?
Maybe they want to come over
and play taboo.
After midnight? No way.
We can't Tabooty-call them,
it's pathetic.
Are you wearing sweat pants?
Maybe. But they're Armani.
Okay, guys, I've got
some bad news for you.
So I'm just going
to come out and say it.
You're a couple.
And no matter how hard you try to
fight it, couples need other couples.
That's why you miss
Marshall and Lily.
And can't you just admit that?
- That was amazing, Lily!
- I know!
When I got that left-hand-yellow,
I was like, "What?!"
- You guys are the best.
- Right back at you!
For charades.
How do we know you two
won't hurt us again?
You don't.
You know what? We have two...
very nice people
up in that apartment
who are perfect for us.
Then what are you doing,
standing out in the rain with us?
Damn it.
Why is there something
so attractive about a bad boy...
and girl?
I think we can change them.
Come here, you two.
We'll never sleep
on the gouda again.
<i>All by ourselves...</i>
I got a little poem for you.
You want to hear it?
- Not really.
- "It was the night before this one,
I had hours to kill.
<i>I sat in the tavern,
grading parchments with quill."</i>
With quill?
Barney. It's a poem.
<i>A busty, young lassie
flashed me a grin.</i>
<i>Her garb said "classy",
but her eyes whispered "sin".</i>
<i>She said, "You're a teacher?"</i>
<i>I said, "Yes, indeed".</i>
<i>"I must have you", she moaned.
"I'm turned on by tweed".</i>
<i>With haste we did scamper
to my chamber anon.</i>
<i>We fell to the couch,
and, bro, it was on.</i>
<i>I unlaced her bodice.
Our passions grew deeper.</i>
<i>And thus ends the tale</i>
<i>of the Sexless Innkeeper."</i>
No way.
You made that up.
Are you coming back to bed,
professor?
God, I love being single.
You ready for brunch
with Lily and Marshall?
What have I done?
<i>Les enfants,
tante Robin a grandi au Canada.</i>
<i>Parfois, elle s'habillait
un peu différemment.</i>
Allons-y !
<i>Parfois, elle parlait
un peu différemment.</i>
Ted, cette facture est plus grosse
que les biceps de Louis Cyr.
T'as laissé le garburateur tourné
cette nuit ?
<i>Elle fréquentait d'autres bars</i>
<i>et s'amusait un peu différemment.</i>
Tu veux y aller ?
Tu veux y aller !
Moquez-vous du Grand Nord à plaisir.
C'est le meilleur pays du monde.
Petite démo.
USA !
Tu sais que ça prouve rien.
Scande un truc, les gens suivront.
Canada !
Ils savent se retenir.
Riz aux crevettes !
À donf.
En parlant de nourriture,
j'ai une mauvaise nouvelle.
Je viens de lire
que Gazzola fermait.
Gazzola ?
La Mecque des pizzas
les plus mal cuites
située au 316 Kinzie Street
à Chicago, dans l'Illinois.
À la fac, Ted et moi,
on se tapait le trajet
du Connecticut jusqu'à Chicago,
juste pour une pizza.
22 heures. Sans carte.
On sautait dans la Fiero
et on partait.
On était tel Lewis et Clark,
s'ils pissaient dans des cannettes
et avaient un bang taillé dans un melon.
Ces balades Gazzola,
c'est là qu'on est devenus potes.
- On mangeait que du jerky.
- On buvait que du Tantrum.
<i>Le Tantrum !</i>
<i>Le Tantrum était une boisson
avec un fort taux de caféine</i>
<i>et qui était en vente libre.</i>
<i>Elle a été interdite après une étude
approfondie de l'AFSSA.</i>
On a vidé une caisse entière
une fois.
J'ai été daltonien
pendant deux semaines.
C'est pour ça que je m'évanouis
quand j'entends des cloches.
C'est sûrement une bonne chose
que Gazzola ferme.
Ces balades étaient brutales.
Les longues heures dans la voiture,
le mal des transports, l'odeur.
- Départ à quelle heure ?
- Vers 9 h ou 9 h 30.

Je suis prêt à prendre la route.
J'ai des lingettes.
J'ai plein de jerky
et six cannettes de Tantrum.
Enfin, quatre.
Une s'est percée et j'ai bu l'autre.
Tantrum !
Je bouillonne !
Marshall et moi n'avons rien partagé
depuis si longtemps.
Depuis qu'il est marié,
il a transformé le "je" en "on".
- Comment ça ?
- Réfléchis.
Ça fait un bail. Ça gaze ?
On va bien.
- T'as regardé le match des Jets ?
- Oui, on l'a regardé.
Alors, le doc ?
Notre problème d'hémorroïdes
est passé.
Vous allez pas le croire.
Je viens de parler à mon avocat.
Vous savez le mec avec qui j'ai eu
un accrochage au Hoser Hut ?
Il a porté plainte.
Allez !
Je lui ai cassé le nez.
Et là, apparemment,
je peux être expulsée.
Purée, ça craint !
Je vais faire des pompes.
Il ne reste qu'un moyen
pour éviter l'expulsion.
Selon mon avocat,
je peux me faire naturaliser Américaine.
Parfait. Problème résolu.
Bienvenue.
C'est pas aussi simple.
Je suis Canadienne.
J'y suis née.
Ma famille y vit.
C'est ce que je suis.
Je sais, et ça nous fait bien rire.
Mais Robin, si tu veux vivre ici,
travailler ici,
et envoyer des chaises
sur les gens ici, c'est nécessaire.
Il y a un test de citoyenneté
demain.
- Je vais y penser.
- Non, tu dois le faire.
Je t'aiderai à réviser.
On va y passer la nuit.
On va faire de l'exercice,
puis on révisera.
Sérieusement.
On va bûcher, puis on révisera.
- Sérieusement. On va piocher dans...
- C'est bon.
- Ça fuse.
- Oui.
Mais tu sais, ça va pas être facile.
C'est pas comme le test canadien.
Comment tu sais s'il est facile ?
C'est le Canada.
Question une :
"Veux-tu être Canadien ?"
Question deux : "T'es sûr ?"
Ted, regarde !
Café noir à gauche
et Tantrum à droite !
- T'as un annuaire ?
- Bien sûr !
Pourquoi il y a encore des annuaires ?
Y a tout sur le net.
Très bien, en route.
- Tu as invité Lily ?
- On l'a fait !
- T'as vu son "on".
- J'ai entendu.
C'est parti !
Vous voulez parler des pétasses ?
Je rigole. On dit "femmes".
Prochain arrêt : Chicago.
Je dois faire pipi.
- T'aurais pas pu y aller avant ?
- Je l'ai fait, mais j'ai souvent envie.
T'inquiète pas, on sera sur la route,
comme dans le temps.
<i>Mais...</i>
Un petit pois ?
Petit...
Voilà, j'ai une petite envie.
Toujours tout droit.
Un petit peu sur la gauche.
On va passer devant les flics.
Un buggy jaune !
Jaune... Je dois faire pipi.
Merci !
Tu peux pas y retourner,
c'est humainement impossible.
J'allais dire
qu'on pourrait écouter un truc.
Je dois avoir un CD
de canulars téléphoniques.
<i>Adieu Sparky.</i>
C'est l'histoire
d'un homme et son chien.
Ça a fait pleurer Bernard Pivot.
Adieu Sparky, <i>de Nick Leotti.</i>
<i>Lu par Kenny Rogers.</i>
<i>Chapitre un :
la première fois que j'ai vu Sparky,</i>
<i>ça m'a rappelé mon peigne préféré :</i>
<i>il lui manquait plein de dents,
mais je l'aimais quand même.</i>
<i>Maman était en rogne</i>
<i>quand il faisait ses besoins</i>
<i>sur son rhododendron.</i>
Je dois faire pipi.
- Nombre d'étoiles sur le drapeau ?
- 50, une par état.
Nom des dix premiers amendements ?
La Déclaration des Droits.
Je sais tout ça. Je suis prête.
Pour le test, peut-être,
mais prête pour être Américaine ?
Jamais.
Pour être une vraie Américaine,
virons la Canadienne.
C'est pourquoi
j'ai créé ces questions.
Première question : qui est-ce ?
- La reine Elizabeth II.
- Non, la réponse est Elton John.
Deuxième question :
c'est quoi, ce machin ?
Du curling. C'est un sport qui...
Faux. La réponse était :
"Je m'en fous, c'est nul.
"Achetons un truc dangereux
"et attaquons le fabricant."
Ça, c'est américain.
<i>... car Sparky adorait les balles,</i>
<i>quelle qu'elle soit.</i>
<i>Balle de tennis, de base-ball,
de football,</i>
<i>de golf, de cricket,</i>
<i>de ping-pong, balle d'Aquin.</i>
<i>Du raisin, pas une vraie balle,
mais qui en a la forme.</i>
<i>Une balle de fusil n'est pas ronde,
mais est bien une balle...</i>
<i>Balle rebondissante...</i>
<i>Fin du disque sept.</i>
<i>Le livre audio continue
sur le disque huit.</i>
<i>Disque huit.</i>
<i>Balle de squash...</i>
Lily, dis-moi
que tu dois faire pipi !
En fait, oui.
<i>C'était le pire des voyages,
mais ça a empiré.</i>
À la prochaine sortie,
tu pourras faire à l'hôtel.
Hôtel ?
Le manoir Crumpet figure au registre
des maisons d'hôtes historiques.
Nous avons ouvert à Noël 1881.
Et nous avons accueilli
beaucoup de couples depuis.
Les célibataires
peuvent aussi s'amuser ici, non ?
Je peux vous arranger
un petit quelque chose.
Vous aimez les bancs ?
<i>En une nuit, Barney avait fait de Robin
une vraie Américaine.</i>
Je vais dire... Jefferson ?
Correct. Le voisin d'Archie Bunker
était bien George Jefferson.
Je déchire tout.
Amérique, me voilà !
Attends, t'emballe pas.
Pour prouver que t'es aussi américaine
que la tarte aux pommes
et l'obésité infantile
qui en découle...
Qui est-ce ?
Lui, Barney,
c'est un acteur américain,
adoré par des millions de gens,
le Ernest de l'émission pour enfants
<i>Hé Vern, c'est Ernest.</i>
Il s'appelle...
Jeff Foxworthy.
Jeff Foxworthy ?
Non, c'est Jim Varney.
Tu sais pas ça ?
C'est Jeff Foxworthy, idiot.
Fin de l'histoire. Boucle-la.
Non seulement t'as faux,
mais en plus, tu es agressive,
et tu m'insultes.
Tu es une Américaine.
Le voilà de retour
du puits aux souhaits.
Faut croire qu'il a pas été exaucé.
Pourquoi on n'est pas sur la route ?
On est plus à la fac,
on n'a pas à conduire toute la nuit.
Et il y a un spa.
Qu'est-ce que vous proposez ?
Tous nos soins
sont conçus pour les couples.
Seriez-vous intéressés
par un gommage pour deux
à la semoule de maïs ?
<i>Et ce qui devait arriver arriva...</i>
<i>Marshall et Lily ne formaient plus
qu'une seule personne.</i>
On adorerait un gommage
à la semoule de maïs !
Je vais arrêter le Tantrum.
<i>Je vais être une Américaine, yeah.</i>
<i>Je vais peut-être braquer un magasin.
Ou non. Je choisis.</i>
Apprends l'anglais !
<i>Le Hoser Hut.</i>
<i>J'irais bien boire un verre.</i>
<i>C'est du passé. Oublie.</i>
<i>Je pourrais prendre une bière.
Où est le mal ?</i>
<i>C'est un pays libre.</i>
Ça me manque.
Désolé pour ce que j'ai dit.
On va s'acheter des bières ?
Lily dort.
Je reporterai ma pédicure.
Et puis merde ! Mais une light,
on a une randonnée demain matin.
Tu prends l'autoroute ?
On va la chercher où, cette bière ?
À Chicago.
On peut pas laisser Lily.
Elle va flipper à son réveil !
Elle aura un massage et un muffin.
Ça ira.
Relax. Amuse-toi.
Je viens d'abandonner ma femme.
Comment veux-tu que je m'amuse ?
QUATRE MINUTES PLUS TARD
- Tu crois qu'elle est en colère ?
- Je m'en tape.
<i>Quand Barney retrouva tante Robin,
ce n'était pas joli à voir.</i>
Bonjour.
J'ai fait quoi hier soir ?
Tu es redevenue Canadienne.
À quel point ?
Celui-là.
Ça devait être une vue
du ciel de Toronto...
Tu es à Toronto.
Ça me revient.
J'étais au Hoser Hut...
Et j'ai rencontré
cette équipe féminine de curling.
On a bu. Et l'instant d'après,
elles m'invitaient au double concert
Bryan Adams/Rich Little à Toronto.
Comment tu m'as trouvée ?
Tu m'as appelé en disant
que tu ne reviendrais jamais.
Alors, j'ai pris l'avion,
traversé l'Atlantique...
- Il faut pas traverser l'Atlantique.
- Tu dérailles.
Écoute...
T'as dérapé. Ça arrive.
Le test est dans quelques heures.
Je passerai pas le test.
T'as pas dessaoulé.
J'apprécie ton aide, mais...
je trompe qui ?
Je suis canadienne.
Pour toujours.
C'est ridicule.
On va prendre un café, te dégriser,
et te ramener à New York
pour le test.
Mais, avant tout ça,
on va le faire dans ce lit,
car chambre d'hôtel.
Allons prendre un café.
Caoutchouteux, plutôt tiède...
Assez dégueu.
La pizza vaut-elle
les 22 heures de route ?
Comme dans le temps !
Je me sens jeune,
à part la douleur à la poitrine.
Mais la croûte est trop bonne.
C'est quoi, son secret ?
Pas de secret.
C'est de la semoule de maïs.
Semoule de maïs...
<i>On adorerait un gommage
à la semoule de maïs !</i>
- Je saisis pas que vous fermiez.
- Moi, qu'on soit encore ouvert.
Je t'ai eu !
De plus en plus gros.
C'est comme un pays entier
sans tailleur.
- Deux cafés.
- 3,50 $.
Qu'avez-vous pensé du match ?
- Lequel ?
- Les Leafs qui battent Edmonton.
Beauchemin a mis 5 buts
dans la prolongation.
- Je l'ai raté.
- Pardon, vous êtes Américaine.
- Voilà votre monnaie.
- Je suis pas Américaine.
Dollars américains,
vous ratez le match.
Aucune civilité pour le café.
Vous semblez pas Canadienne.
De quoi ?
À part que le billet de 5 $
qu'ils t'ont rendu est bleu.
Je suis pas Américaine,
et je suis pas non plus Canadienne.
Des gamins jouent au hockey
au verso.
Comme si vous vouliez
qu'on se moque de vous.
J'en peux plus.
Faut pas la regarder.
- On n'aurait pas dû laisser Lily.
- Si t'es si inquiet, appelle-la.
Je lui ai laissé 20 messages.
J'ai dit "Je suis désolé.
Pardon. C'est la faute de Ted !"
- Qu'est-ce qui est de ma faute ?
- Tout ça !
Le voyage était plaisant
avant que tu m'enlèves.
- J'ai même pas pu mettre de caleçon !
- On mettait jamais de caleçon !
C'était le fun de ce voyage !
On laissait tout derrière.
Y avait que nous !
- Maintenant, t'as disparu en Lily.
- C'est faux.
T'es pas énervé
parce qu'elle sera en colère,
mais car tu préférerais
être avec elle
plutôt qu'avec moi à savourer...
Un de mes champignons
s'est fait la malle.
Tu sais quoi ?
Ce sera pas le seul à se tirer.
Les clefs.
Regarde ces pièces !
Celle-là a un élan,
celle-ci un castor,
et tous ont Elton John au verso.
En arrivant aux États-Unis,
je me suis juré de ne pas changer.
Et pourtant, me voilà,
dans le lieu
le plus canadien possible.
Dans un Tim Hortons,
au coin du panthéon du hockey
et ça colle pas.
Comme si j'étais apatride.
Ça suffit.
Votre attention, Canada !
Je suis Barney d'Amérique.
Je suis ici pour régler
votre pays mal foutu.
D'abord, ayez une vraie monnaie.
J'ignore de quel jeu elle est tirée,
mais c'est un gag !
Numéro deux,
et c'est là que le bât blesse,
arrêtez de laisser des supers nanas
comme Robin Scherbatsky s'en aller,
car devinez ?
Vous voulez pas d'elle ?
Je lui plante mon drapeau,
si vous saisissez l'allusion,
ce dont je doute,
et je l'emmène loin d'ici.
Vous pouvez redevenir inutiles.
Ce café est excellent.
C'est une "cravate".
<i>Sparky était mon meilleur ami,</i>
<i>mais après mon mariage,</i>
<i>le vieux Sparky commençait
à se sentir mis de côté.</i>
<i>Pendant si longtemps,
nous n'avions été que deux,</i>
<i>mais il avait soudain l'impression
qu'Helen avait pris sa place.</i>
<i>Ce qu'il ne réalisait pas,
c'était que,</i>
<i>même si j'aimais Helen,
je l'aimais toujours lui aussi.</i>
<i>J'avais assez de place dans mon coeur
pour eux deux.</i>
<i>J'aurais dû nous réserver
des moments de jeu à deux</i>
<i>pour m'assurer que Sparky sache
qu'il était un bon chien.</i>
<i>Je regrette tout ça,</i>
<i>parce que le vieux Sparky

<i>et s'est fait écrabouiller

- Désolé !
- Navré !
- J'aurais pas dû m'énerver !
- J'aurais pas dû amener Lily.
Elle pisse constamment,
même à l'appartement.
Toujours potes ?
Les meilleurs.
On fait péter du Van Halen
comme avant ?
- On réécoute l'histoire de Sparky ?
- Réécoutons-le.
Ces docteurs canadiens
m'ont momifié,
remboîté la mâchoire,
remis l'épaule en place,
et me l'ont même pas facturé.
Idiots.
Je suppose qu'ils sont pas idiots.
Le café était magique.
Le Canada n'est pas si mal.
S'ils se débrouillent bien,
ils pourront devenir un état un jour.
Barney, j'ai repensé à tout ça.
Quand tu t'es dressé
contre ces gens, j'ai pensé...
"L'Amérique, c'est cool."
Et quand ces mecs t'ont dérouillé,
j'ai pensé...
"Le Canada, c'est chouette."
Après que tu te sois évanoui,
j'en ai peut-être profité un peu.
J'ai choisi la double nationalité.
Je serai Américaine et Canadienne.
Tu peux faire ça ?
Oui, abruti.
Au lieu d'être une femme apatride,
j'aurai deux pays.
Je vois.
Tu saisis ?
Je peux à nouveau voir
de l'oeil gauche.
Désolé de t'avoir laissée.
T'étais parti ?
<i>Il s'est avéré que le manoir Crumpet
avait choyé Lily</i>
<i>jusqu'à un état de relaxation
proche du coma.</i>
<i>Elle n'avait pas relevé
notre absence.</i>
J'ai passé un bon moment.
Tant mieux. Ça me rend triste
que tu n'aies pas eu de pizza.
Pas de souci.
<i>Si elle ne le pensait pas à ce moment,
ce fut le cas 19 minutes plus tard.</i>
Mon ventre !
Maudit sois-tu, Gozzola !
C'est comme une boule de plomb
brûlante !
Bébé, arrache-la.
Arrache-la !
C'était un sacré voyage !
C'était plutôt dément.
C'est pas génial
de reboire du Tantrum ?
Tu sais qui a adoré ? Lily.
Lily en a bu 4 canettes.
Pas vrai ?
Où est Lily ?
Tantrum !
Je dois pisser.
<i>Kids, as you know,
aunt Robin grew up in Canada.</i>
<i>That meant sometimes
she dressed a little differently.</i>
Okay, let's do this!
<i>Sometimes she talked
a little differently.</i>
Ted, this hydro bill is bigger
than Louis Cyr's biceps.
What, you leave the garburator
on all night, eh?
<i>She hung out at different bars</i>
<i>and enjoyed leisure time
a little differently?</i>
You want to go?
You want to go?!
Make fun of the great
white north all you want.
It's the best country in the world.
Social experiment.
U.s.a.!
You know what,
what does that even prove, okay?
You chant anything,
people will join in.
Canada!
Okay, they won't chant anything.
Shrimp fried rice!
Shrimp fried rice!
Totally.
Anyway, speaking of food,
Marshall, I've got some bad news.
Just read online, Gazzola's is closing.
What's that?
A filthy mecca of spectacular
if undercooked pizza
located at 316 kinzie street,
chicago, illinois.
Back in college, Ted and I used
to take these crazy road trips
from Connecticut  to Chicago
just for a Gazzola's pizza.
- 22 hours.
- No map.
We'd just jump in
the Fiero and drive.
We were like Lewis and Clark,
if they peed in empty soda bottles
and had a bong made
out of a cantaloupe.
Man, those Gazzola trips,
that's...
that's when we really became bros.
We ate nothing but jerky.
Drank nothing but Tantrum.
Tantrum.
<i>Tantrum was a soft drink with
the highest caffeine content</i>
<i>legally available over the counter.</i>
<i>It was eventually discontinued
after an extensive study by the FDA.</i>
Man, we went through
a whole case of Tantrum one trip.
I was color-blind for
two weeks after that.
That's the reason that I pass out
when I hear church bells.
It's probably a good thing
they're closing Gazzola's.
Those trips were brutal, right?
The long hours in the car,
the motion sickness, the smell.
What time are we leaving
for Gazzola's ?
I was thinking 9:00, 9:30.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-
.:: La Fabrique ::.
I am ready to hit the road.
I got baby wipes.
I got a variety of jerky.
I got six cans of Tantrum.
Well, four. One burned through the can,
the other one I drank already.
Tantrum!
I am so psyched!
Marshall and I haven't done something,
just the two of us, for so long.
Ever since he got married, he's
turned from an "I" to a "We."
- What do you mean?
- Think about it.
Haven't seen you all week.
How you doing?
We're doing great.
- Did you watch the jets game?
- We most certainly did.
How'd things go at the doctor?
We no longer have
a hemorrhoid problem.
You will not believe this.
I've been talking to my lawyer.
You know that guy I had a slight
disagreement with at the hoser hut?
He's filing assault charges.
Come on!
I broke his nose with a chair.
And now, apparently,
I may end up getting deported.
My god, that sucks! I'm gonna go do
push-ups in the kitchen.
Well, there's only one possible
way to avoid getting deported.
My lawyer said I could
become an American citizen.
Perfect. Problem solved.
Welcome aboard.
Well, it's not that simple.
I'm a Canadian.
I was born there.
My family's there.
It's who I am.
I know, and it's provided us
with a lot of laughs.
But, Robin, if you want to live here,
work here
and throw chairs at people here,
you have to do this.
Well, there's a citizenship
test tomorrow.
- I'll think about it.
- No, no, you have to do it.
I'll help you study.
We're gonna stay up all night long.
I'm gonna drill you,
and then we're gonna study.
No, seriously.
We're gonna do some cramming
and then we're gonna study.
- Seriously. We're gonna bone up on...
- Okay, Barney. Sorry.
- It's a rich area.
- It is.
But you know,
it's not going to be easy, this test.
It's not like the Canadian
citizenship test.
How do you know
the Canadian test is easy?
It's Canada.
Question one: do you want
to be Canadian?
Question two: really?
Ted, Ted, check it out!
I got black coffee on the left,
I got Tantrum on the right!
- Do you have a phone book?!
- Yes, I do!
Why they make phone books anymore.
Everything's online, right?
All right, let's hit the road.
- You invited Lily?
- We most certainly did!
- He did the "We" thing.
- Yeah, I heard him.
Road trip!
So you guys want to talk
about bitches?
I'm kidding.
They're called women.
All right, next stop: Chicago.
I have to pee.
- Couldn't you have gone before we left?
- I did. I just pee a lot. You'll see.
Don't worry, we'll get out on the road,
it'll be just like old times.
<i>It wasn't.</i>
Sugar snap pea?
Pea...
That reminds me, I have to pee.
OK, straight, straight, straight.
Now, wait, a little to the left.
We'll pass a state trooper.
Punch buggy yellow!
Yellow... that reminds me,
I have to pee.
Thank you!
You can't have to go again.
It's not humanly possible.
I was just going to say maybe we should
listen to something.
That's a great idea.
I think I have some jerky boys.
<i>Good-bye, Sparky.</i>
It's an audio book
about a boy and his dog.
It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck Cry.
<i>Good-bye Sparky, by Nick Leotti.</i>
<i>Read to you by Kenny Rogers.</i>
<i>Chapter one:
when I first saw Sparky,</i>
<i>he reminded me of my favorite comb;</i>
<i>he was missing a lot of teeth,
but I loved him anyway.</i>
<i>Mother was fit to be tied</i>
every time he used
her prized rhododendron
to do his business.
That reminds me, I have to pee.
"How many stars are on the flag?"
50, one for each state.
"What are the first ten amendments
to the constitution called?"
The bill of rights.
I know all this. I'm ready.
Ready for the test maybe,
but ready to be an American?
Not on your sweet life.
For you to be an American,
we got to get the Canadian out of you.
That's why I've created
these questions.
Question one: "Who is this?"
- Queen Elizabeth II.
- No, the answer is Elton John.
Question two:
"what the hell is this?"
Curling, it's a sport played...
Wrong. The answer is
"I don't care, it's dumb."
Let's go buy something
that's bad for us
and then sue the people
who made it. That's American.
<i>... because Sparky loved
chasing a ball,</i>
<i>and it didn't much matter what kind.</i>
<i>Tennis ball, baseball, wiffle ball,</i>
<i>golf ball, basketball,</i>
<i>beach ball, gum ball,</i>
<i>a grapefruit, which isn't
actually a ball,</i>
<i>but it's round like a ball...</i>
<i>A football, which isn't round,</i>
<i>but it's still technically a ball...</i>
<i>Indian rubber ball...</i>
<i>This ends disk seven.</i>
<i>The audio book continues
on disk eight.</i>
<i>Disk eight.</i>
<i>Lacrosse ball, volleyball...</i>
My god, Lily, please
tell me you have to go pee!
Yeah, I do.
<i>It was the worst trip ever,
but then it got worse.</i>
Well, don't worry, the
il l next exit's the hotel.
We can go there.
Crumpet manor is listed
in the American registry
of historic bed-and-breakfasts.
Our door is opened
on christmas day, 1881.
And we have catered
to couples ever since.
Well, I mean, single people
can have fun here, too, right?
I suppose I could arrange
a little recreation.
Do you enjoy sitting on a bench?
<i>And by the end of the night, Barney
had turned Robin into a real American.</i>
I want to say... Jefferson?
Correct. Archie Bunker's neighbor
was George Jefferson.
Boo-ya! I am nailing this.
God, I'm buzzing on America right now!
All right, hold your horses.
Now to prove that you are
as American as apple pie
and the childhood obesity
it leads to...
Who is this?
That, Barney,
is the American actor,
beloved by millions,
<i>the "Hey, Vern" guy from the
popular series Of Ernest films.</i>
And his name...
Jeff Foxworthy.
Jeff Foxworthy?
No, it's Jim Varney.
You're kidding me.
You don't know that?
That's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass.
End of story.
Now shut your stupid face.
Not only are you wrong,
but you are belligerently
sticking to your guns
and insulting me in the process.
You are an American.
Look who's back
from the wishing well.
It didn't work, I'm still here.
Marshall, what are we doing?
We should be on the road.
Look, Ted, we're not
in college anymore,
We don't have to drive all night.
They have a spa.
What kind of
treatments do you offer?
All our spa treatments
are designed for couples.
Would you be interested
in the two-person,
cornmeal body scrub?
<i>And then finally, it happened...</i>
<i>Marshall and Lily globbed
into one big married glob.</i>
We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!
I got to dial back on the Tantrum.
<i>I'm gonna be an American, y'all.</i>
<i>Maybe I'll rob a liquor store.
Maybe I won't. My choice.</i>
Learn English!
<i>The Hoser Hut.</i>
I could duck in for a drink.
That life's behind me.
Forget it.
I could in for just one beer.
What's the harm in that?
It's a free country.
God, I miss it.
Sorry about what I said before.
You want to go to the store
and get some beer?
Lily is asleep.
I suppose
I could reschedule my pedicure.
What the hell?
But only light beer
because we have a hike in the morning.
Why are we pulling to the highway?
Where exactly are we going
to get this beer?
Chicago.
What are you doing?
We can't just leave Lily.
When she wakes up, she'll freak!
She'll have a back rub and a crumpet.
She'll be fine.
Relax. Have some fun.
I just abandoned my wife.
How am I supposed to have fun?
- You think Lily's pissed?
- If she's pissed, she's pissed.
<i>When Barney finally tracked down
your Aunt Robin,</i>
<i>it wasn't a pretty sight.</i>
Good morning.
What happened last night?
You...
went Canadian.
How Canadian?
This Canadian.
That's supposed to be
a dramatic view of the Toronto sky...
you're in Toronto.
It's coming back to me.
I went into the Hoser Hut...
And I met this women's curling team.
We started drinking. And the next thing
I know, they're inviting me
to a Bryan Adams/Rich Little
double bill in Toronto.
How did you find me, anyway?
You called me,
said you were never coming back.
So, I jumped on a plane,
flew across the Atlantic...
Canada isn't across the Atlantic.
You're talking nonsense.
Listen...
You slipped up. It's fine.
The test is in a few hours.
I'm not taking the test.
God, you're still drunk.
Look, I appreciate your help, but...
who am I kidding?
I'm Canadian.
I always will be.
Now, that's ridiculous.
We're gonna get some coffee in you,
we'll sober you up,
and get you back to New York
for that test.
But, before any of that,
we're gonna do it on this bed,
'cause... Hotel room.
Let's get some coffee.
A little rubbery,
room temperature...
Kind of gross.
You're making me wonder
if this pizza's worth the 22-hour drive.
Just like old times!
I feel so young again
except for the chest pains.
But the crust is so good.
What is the secret to this crust?
It's no big secret.
It's made of cornmeal.
Cornmeal...
We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!
I can't believe
you guys are closing.
I can't believe we're still open.
Gotcha!
These are getting bigger.
It's like an entire country
without a tailor.
Give me two coffees.
$3.50, please.
What did you think
of the game last night?
What game?
The Leafs beat Edmonton.
Beauchemin went five hole in OT.
- I guess I missed it.
- Sorry. You're American.
- Here's your change.
- I'm not American.
American money?
Didn't watch the Leafs game?
No "please" or "thank you"
for the coffee?
You sure don't seem like a Canadian.
What's wrong?
Other than the fact
that this five-dollar bill
they gave you is blue.
I'm not American, and apparently,
I'm not Canadian either.
And there's kids playing hockey
on the back. It's like you want us
to make fun of you.
I don't want this anymore.
Don't look at it.
That's a rookie mistake.
We shouldn't have left Lily.
If you're worried,
why don't you call her?
I have.
I left her, like, 20 messages.
I said, "I'm sorry.
Please forgive me. It's Ted's fault!".
- What exactly is "Ted's fault"?
- This! This whole thing!
We were having a nice trip,
and then you kidnapped me.
- You didn't let me put on underwear!
- We never used to put on underwear!
That was the fun
of a bro's trip to Gazzola's!
We left everything, and everyone behind.
It was just you and me!
But now it's
like you've disappeared into Lily.
Not true.
True. You're not upset
because you're worried she's mad.
but because you'd rather be with her,
eating muffins,
than here with me,
eating this delicious...
I think one of my mushrooms
just crawled away.
Well, you know what? That mushroom's not
the only thing that's leaving.
Car keys, please.
Look at this money!
This one has a moose,
this one has a beaver,
and they have Elton John on the back.
When I moved to the States,
I swore I wasn't going to change.
And yet, here I am,
in the most Canadian place
in the universe...
Tim Horton's, around the corner
from the Hockey Hall of Fame,
and I don't belong.
It's like I don't have a country.
That's it.
Attention, Canada!
I am Barney from America.
And I'm here to fix
your backward-ass country.
Number one,
get real money.
Don't know what board game
this came from, but it's a "jhoke."
Number two,
and this is the biggie,
quit letting awesome chicks
like Robin Scherbatsky get away,
because, guess what?
You don't want her?
I'm planting my flag in her,
if you know what I mean,
which you probably don't,
and getting her
the hell out of here.
You may now return
to being pointless.
This coffee is excellent.
It's called a "tie".
<i>Sparky was my best friend,</i>
<i>but after I married Helen,</i>
<i>old spark started to feel
a little left out.</i>
<i>For so long,
it had been just me and him,</i>
<i>but now he suddenly felt
like Helen had taken his place.</i>
<i>What Sparky didn't realize was,</i>
<i>even though I loved Helen,
I still loved him, too.</i>
<i>I had room in my heart
for both of them.</i>
<i>But maybe I should have put aside</i>
<i>some special ball-tossing time
just for the two of us,</i>
<i>to make sure Sparky knew
that he was a good boy.</i>
<i>I wish now I had,</i>
<i>'cause old Sparky ran out
in front of a Cadillac,</i>
<i>and got splattered like a watermelon
in one of them Gallagher shows.</i>
- I'm sorry, Ted!
- I'm sorry.
- I never should have been mad at you!
- I never should have brought Lily.
She pees all the time,
even at the apartment.
Still bros?
Best bros.
You want to crank some Van Halen
just like old times?
- Or listen to the Sparky book again?
- Let's listen to it again.
Those Canadian doctors banded me up,
reset my jaw,
put my shoulder back in its socket,
and they didn't even bill me.
Idiots.
All right,
I guess they're not idiots.
The coffee was extraordinary.
I guess Canada's not so bad.
They play their cards right,
maybe they can become a state someday.
Barney, I've thought about this.
When you stood up
and told off those people, I thought...
"America's cool."
And then when those guys pounded
the stuffing out of you, I thought...
"Canada's pretty cool, too."
In fact, after you passed out,
I may have taken a few pokes myself.
So, I've decided, dual citizenship.
I'm going to be American
and Canadian.
Wait, you can do that?
Yeah, dummy.
Instead of being a woman
with no country,
I'm going to be a woman with two.
I see.
You understand?
I can see out of my left eye again.
I'm so sorry that we left you.
Did you go somewhere?
<i>Yes, kids, it turns out Crumpet Manor
had pampered Lily</i>
<i>into a nearly comatose
state of relaxation.</i>
<i>She didn't even notice we were gone.</i>
So, I had a great time, too.
That's good.
And I'm so sorry
you didn't get any pizza.
That's okay.
<i>And if she didn't mean it then,
she certainly meant it 19 minutes later.</i>
My stomach!
Damn you, Gozzola's!
It's like a hot ball of lead!
Baby, cut it out of me.
Cut it out!
That was a wild trip!
I know. It was kind of crazy.
But how great is it
to drink some Tantrum again?
You know who had fun, was Lily.
Lily drank
like, four cans of the stuff.
Right?
Where's Lily?
I have to pee.
<i>Ŕ l'automne 2009,
un couple avait emménagé au-dessus.</i>
<i>On ne les avait pas rencontrés,
mais on les entendait... tout le temps.</i>
<i>Ils n'arrętaient pas...
Disons qu'ils n'arrętaient pas</i>
<i>"de jouer du biniou".</i>
C'est absurde.
Ils jouent encore du biniou.
Je sais. Ça fait six heures.
Ce doit ętre ce biniou tantrique
que Sting adore.
Elle lui crie sans cesse
de jouer plus fort,
mais il semble
qu'il la binioute déjŕ assez fort.
Y a un verre d'eau dans ma chambre
qui vibre comme dans <i>Jurassic Park</i>.
Vous avez des voisins !
Rangez-moi ce biniou !

<i>Je suis descendu au bar
pour ętre au calme.</i>
<i>Mais ça n'a pas marché.</i>
Je déteste ętre
celui qui te l'annonce.
- Marshall et Lily vont divorcer.
- Non.
Écoute ce que j'ai vu hier.
Bébé, tu peux laver ça ?
Bien sűr.
Je dois partir.
Elle le fait laver sa vaisselle
immédiatement, Ted.
Je leur donne trois semaines
grand max.
C'est pas si grave.
Certainement pas assez
pour que tu me tiennes les mains.
Ils ont de gros soucis.
Je comprends.
Tu souffres
d'une maladie peu connue...
Peu car je viens de l'inventer,
qu'on appelle
Arrogance du Nouveau Couple.
Vous en ętes ŕ la phase
de la lune de miel.
Tout est parfait.
Toutes les chansons parlent de vous.
Les autres couples sont nuls.
Profites-en, l'ANC ne dure qu'un temps.
Sauf si tu es aussi génial.
Robin et moi, on tient le compte
du nombre de lits oů on l'a fait.
- On en est ŕ 83 et demi.
- Et demi ?
Lit ottoman datant du 19e
chez un antiquaire.
- Ça va ?
- Champion.
Tu tiens le coup ? Un calin ?
Tu veux parler d'hier ?
T'es en lieu sűr.
Le fait que Lily
te fasse faire ta vaisselle
indiquerait la fin de votre mariage.
Pourquoi ?
Lily veut garder l'évier clean
alors je le fais. Et alors ?
Je vais te dire oů est le problčme.
Tu sais ŕ quel point
j'ai toujours excellé dans le célibat ?
Maintenant,
j'excelle dans la conjugalité.
Meilleur que toi et Lily.
Regarde-toi.
T'as une copine depuis cinq minutes
et tu viens parler ŕ un vieux briscard.
Fiston,
j'étais en couple,
t'avais encore les cheveux longs
et tu jouais du Dave Matthews
sur ton synthé.
Je suis un bon petit ami
męme en dormant.
Je peux faire un massage de pieds
d'une main
et préparer un thé ŕ la camomille
qui te ferait chialer de l'autre.
J'en ai plus oublié
sur le pop-corn light
et les films de Sandra Bullock
que tu n'en sauras jamais.
Merci quand męme, gamin.
- Une petite question.
- J'écoute.
Ça te dérange d'avoir un évier
plein de vaisselle sale ?
Pas vraiment.
Alors, c'est le problčme de Lily,
pas le tien.
Mais si je lui dis ça,
ça mčnera ŕ une dispute, donc...
Vous vous disputez.
Robin et moi, jamais.
Bien sűr que si.
Voilŕ le secret :
dčs que je sens
qu'on va se disputer...
Pourquoi tu as un sac de culottes
étiqueté "Avril 2008"
dans ton placard ?
Dčs qu'il y a risque de dispute,
tu te lčves et tu pars ?
100 % efficace.
Tu peux pas te disputer si t'es pas lŕ.
Héritage de Gandhi.
Tu te trompes.
J'y crois pas que Robin supporte ça.
T'inquičte pas.
Elle a sa technique, elle aussi.
Les cravates passent ŕ la machine ?
Non, sűrement pas.
Pourquoi ?
C'est quoi, ça ?
Purée, c'est quoi, ça ?
Donc toi, tu t'en vas.
Robin se déshabille.
Je connais rien de plus stupide
pour résoudre un conflit.
Le déshabillage est pas mal.
- C'était bizarre.
- Prends-moi pour un fou,
mais quand un problčme arrive,
Lily et moi, on en parle vraiment.
Y a tant ŕ faire avec une bouche.
Pourquoi gâcher ça en parlant ?
Mais si t'insistes,
voilŕ ce que je dirais pour la vaisselle
si j'étais le mari de Lily.
Barney, t'es rentré !
- Viens-en au fait !
- D'accord.
Merci, poupée.
Chéri, tu vas laver ça ?
Content que tu demandes.
Je t'explique.
Tu n'aimes pas voir l'évier plein.
Mais en quoi cela me concerne-t-il ?
Si un jour,
je regarde le plafond du salon
et je me dis : "Je veux une réplique
de la chapelle Sixtine ici".
Est-ce ŕ toi de le peindre ?
Bien sűr que non.
Exactement.
Donc, selon la męme logique,
si tu n'aimes pas la vaisselle sale,
n'est-ce pas ŕ toi de la laver ?
Merci de m'avoir expliqué.
J'étais perdue.
Car tu es une femme.
- Je sais męme pas pourquoi on rit.
- Bien sűr que non.
C'est une blague ?
Attends, Ted. Laisse-le parler.
Une fois que j'ai son attention,
je sors l'artillerie lourde.
Écoute, je t'aime.
Mais, bébé, avec le peu d'énergie
qu'il me reste aprčs le travail,
je veux t'inonder d'amour,
pas nettoyer la foutue vaisselle.
T'as raison. Je m'en occuperai.
Juste aprčs avoir fait ça.
Tourne-toi.
Ferme.
- Tu le frappes ou je le fais ?
- Il a raison.
Non, il a tort.
Marshall, regarde-moi.
N'entre pas
dans le cirque Barney Stinson
plein de miroirs déformants
et de fausse logique.
T'as eu ta boucle d'oreille
comme ça en 2003.
- Elle était cool.
- C'est clair.
Reste avec moi. Barney a tort.
Non.
Je déteste
laver ma vaisselle immédiatement.
- Tu disais que tu t'en fichais.
- Je déteste ça.
Ça me met
dans une hystérie dévastatrice.
Je déteste ça.
Je t'en prie.
Bien, te voilŕ.
Dis-moi la vérité.
Barney affirme
que vous vous disputez jamais.
- Il a raison.
- T'as vu !
Impossible.
Je vous aime tous les deux,
mais vous ętes les deux
plus mauvais bagages sentimentaux
de l'histoire des couples.
Vous en avez eu au moins une.
Tu sais quoi ? C'est vrai.
On a eu une petite dispute
pour savoir qui était le plus génial.
Match nul et on a fait l'amour.
Au fait, je suis contente
d'aller skier ce week-end.
Il me faut une pause.
Les voisins me rendent folle.
Ça devient grave.
- J'irai leur parler.
- Merci.
On a nos affectations du week-end.
Ted, tu vas tenir tęte ŕ tes voisins.
Toi, ŕ Lily.
Robin, j'ai besoin de toi
pour une position tordue
sur la peau de bęte du chalet.
Amusez-vous.
Tu vois ?
Avec ses folles théories bien ficelées
qui pourraient marcher.
Je ne le répéterai qu'une fois.
- C'est une mauvaise idée.
- Ça pourrait marcher.
- Deux fois. C'est une mauvaise idée.
- Barney a exposé des idées logiques,
Lily est raisonnable.
Si je lui explique, elle comprendra
et j'aurai ce que je veux.
Non, elle se fâchera,
et vous vous disputerez.
- On parie une baffe ?
- OK.
Bébé, tu peux laver ta vaisselle ?
Content que tu demandes.
Je peux dormir ici ?
Je te prépare le canapé.
Les skieurs sont de retour !
- Comment ça s'est passé ?
- C'était parfait.
On a passé le week-end
ŕ se câliner prčs du feu.
Pas de pistes noires,
mais beaucoup de coeurs rouges.
Je vais défaire ma valise.
Il vous arrive quoi ?
Depuis quand ętes-vous si écoeurants ?
C'est pas excellent
de la voir enfin comblée
aux niveaux émotionnel,
spirituel et sexuel ?
Je suis sorti avec elle un an.
Et ton week-end ?
Horrible et tout est de ta faute !
J'ai suivi ton conseil ŕ la noix.
Bébé, tu peux laver ta vaisselle ?
Content que tu demandes.
Et voilŕ pourquoi...
Donc, c'est comme ça, OK ?
Bien sűr.
Tu veux que j'aille laver
ma vaisselle.
Peut-ętre...
que je veux...
que tu peignes le plafond,
d'accord ?
Genre, je dirais...
"Je lave ma vaisselle
si tu vas lŕ-haut
"et tu peins des bébés ŕ poil
au plafond."
Tu vois ?
C'est comme...
Je sais pas ce qui s'est passé.
Je suis avocat.
Les débats, c'est mon job,
mais face ŕ Lily,
je me mets... ŕ cafouiller.
Comment faire ?
Avec ses yeux et ses nichons.
Qu'est-il arrivé au
"Ma journée m'a épuisé,
"et je veux utiliser mon énergie
pour t'inonder d'amour" ?
J'aurais... dű le noter.
Écoute, je...
Je gagne plus que toi.
Pardon ?
Danse pour moi.
Ça sonnait bien quand tu le disais,
mais quand c'est moi,
ça finit en dispute.
Et quand on commence
ŕ s'engueuler, les disputes...
se mettent ŕ muter
et ŕ se multiplier.
<i>Ça commence avec la vaisselle,
mais aprčs...</i>
Donc tu dis que tu ne devrais pas
faire la vaisselle
parce que tu travailles
plus que moi ?
Je dis pas ça... mais c'est vrai.
<i>Et tout d'un coup, on se dispute
sur qui travaille le plus.</i>
J'enseigne en maternelle.
Je façonne les dirigeants de demain.
Vous mangez des cookies
et faites du collage.
<i>Et ça s'amplifie.</i>
Tu préfčres ętre tuée...
<i>Jusqu'ŕ ce qu'on ne puisse plus
les suivre.</i>
Si tu dois y aller en pleine nuit,
allume la lumičre des toilettes
ou assieds-toi.
Ma mčre ne te déteste pas.
Elle est neutre ŕ ton sujet.
J'ai pas peur de ton imitation
de <i>Shining</i>.
Mais je préfčre pas l'entendre,
surtout la nuit.
Danny est pas lŕ, Mme Torrance.
Pitié, ne fais pas ça.
Lily se bat ŕ la déloyale.
Elle est petite,
mais vicieuse comme un blaireau
que ton frčre a attrapé,
a affamé pendant 5 jours
et mis dans ton sac de couchage.
Je devrais m'excuser.
Tu as besoin d'une motivation.
Redouble d'efforts !
Imagine, Marshall.
Ne plus jamais avoir
ŕ faire la vaisselle,
mais la vaisselle reste propre,
ça enlčverait toute l'anxiété
des en-cas.
Plus de tirage de t-shirt
pour faire un bol improvisé
pour tes friandises salées.
Ce monde t'appartient, Marshall.
Tends les bras, saisis-le,
trempe-le dans une sauce barbecue,
profite.
Il a raison.
T'en es lŕ ŕ cause de Barney.
Y a pas d'issue.
Lave cette foutue vaisselle.
Ces plats sont ma virilité !
Et je veux la laisser sale
dans l'évier,
- couverte de ketchup et de pâtes...
- Tu manges quoi ?
Alors, c'est mon droit !
Je laverai ma virilité
quand je le voudrai !
Il s'est assis oů ?
Barnaval !
Ro-Ro !
Des surnoms adorables ?
Sérieusement,
qu'est-ce qui vous arrive ?
Rien.
On est juste heureux.
Comme l'a dit Gandhi :
"Un sourire est gratuit, mon sucre".
Je doute que tu saches
qui est Gandhi.
Tu as parlé ŕ nos voisins ?
Oui. Je suis allé lŕ-haut
pręt ŕ en découdre.
Des vieux ?
Des ancętres.
Et ensuite ?
J'ai pas osé leur dire d'arręter,
parce que : tant mieux pour eux.
Alors je leur ai souhaité
la bienvenue, eu un bonbon,
acquiescé poliment
ŕ des trucs racistes et suis parti.
<i>Les jours qui suivirent,
Barney et Robin furent plus heureux</i>
<i>que jamais.</i>
<i>Marshall et Lily
continučrent de se battre.</i>
Je me fiche que la vaisselle
soit pas faite.
- Si ça t'importe, fais-la.
- Super.
Alors, je m'en fiche
que tu aies un orgasme.
Si ça t'importe, fais-le toi.
J'ai passé 18 ans
sans toucher une femme.
- Je peux le refaire.
- Tu devras peut-ętre.
<i>Et je continuais ŕ entendre
plus de biniou</i>
<i>qu'ŕ un défilé de la St Patrick.</i>
Je sais pas quoi faire.
On n'a jamais eu
de dispute si longue.
C'est comme si j'existais pas.
Dimanche matin,
elle a fait des pancakes.
Pancakes et tranches de bacon.
C'est ta faute.
Tu as suivi les conseils conjugaux...
de Barney.
Peut-ętre qu'il a tout compris.
Lui et Ro-Ro
sont le meilleur couple maintenant.
- On a été détrônés.
- Tu sais quoi ?
Je marche pas.
Tout ce mielleux, c'est pas eux.
Et je sais par expérience
que Robin déteste les surnoms.
Merci, Robi-Rubis.
J'aime pas les surnoms.
T'as fini avec la page sport,
Sherby ?
Sérieux, arręte.
Robin, c'est T-Moz.
Sur toi non plus.
Elle a l'air d'aimer maintenant.
Avouons-le,
on devait mettre un terme ŕ T-Moz.
T-Moz était génial.
Je pense le relancer.
Les binious sonnent bizarre aujourd'hui.
Y a de l'écho.
C'est la salle de bains.
Ils jouent sur le sičge de douche.
<i>C'est lŕ que j'ai réalisé</i>
<i>comment avoir un scoop
sur Barney et Robin.</i>
- Comment vont Marshall et Lily ?
- Je m'en fais vraiment pour eux.
Toi et ton coeur gigantesque.
Assez.
La fęte est finie.
Que veux-tu dire ?
Qui est-ce ?
On va y venir.
Je savais qu'un truc clochait.
Vous étiez trop heureux,
trop propres, trop "surnoms".
Ça collait pas.
Vous vous disputez jamais ?
Foutaises.
Vous vous disputez...
tout...
le temps.
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Grâce ŕ Phil.
Qui est Phil ?
Votre voisin du dessous.
C'est moi.
12 B.
Et il a...
tout entendu.
Phil m'a dit
que Ro-Ro et le Barnaval
se disputaient...
beaucoup. Vous m'expliquez ?
Tout se passait bien.
Nos méthodes antidispute
marchaient ŕ merveille
jusqu'ŕ ce week-end au ski.
J'ai montré ŕ Marshall
que l'argument de Lily était nul
et il n'aura plus
ŕ faire la vaisselle.
Tape-m'en deux.
Un conseil de merde.
T'es de l'avis de Lily ?
Tu es...
<i>On va se disputer
et je peux pas m'enfuir.</i>
<i>Je peux pas me déshabiller.
Il caille, je ferais de l'hypothermie.</i>
- <i>Je dois pouvoir sauter ?</i>
- <i>Juste mon pantalon ?</i>
Le truc d'antidispute est fini.
On dirait.
- Comment tu peux ętre de son avis ?
- J'arrive pas ŕ croire...
Et ça n'a pas arręté.
On se dispute tout le temps depuis.
Ces disputes qu'on a pas eues...
elles arrivent toutes maintenant.
- Le sac de culottes.
- La cravate qu'elle a détruite.
La caméra trouvée
dans la tęte de lit.
C'est comme ça
qu'un quarterback garde la forme.
Le lundi, il s'assoit sur de la glace
et regarde la cassette du match.
- On n'arrive ŕ mon excellence...
- Pour la 1 000e fois...
Je le savais ! Vous aviez l'air
trop mignons et parfaits !
On en avait juste marre
que tout le monde nous dise
combien on est mauvais en relations.
C'était bien d'ętre
le couple idéal un moment.
Je le savais.
Faut se lever de bonne heure
pour la faire au T-Moz.
Arręte.
Le dîner est pręt.
T'en as fait pour moi ?
Non, mais c'est ton plat préféré.
On a besoin de conseils.
<i>Et Barney et Robin
leur racontčrent leurs disputes.</i>
<i>Et disons qu'en comparaison,</i>
<i>leur histoire de vaisselle
semblait ridicule.</i>
<i>Ŕ la fin,</i>
<i>Lily et Marshall
eurent la męme réaction.</i>
Je ferai ma vaisselle immédiatement
jusqu'ŕ la fin de mes jours.
Ça m'est égal.
Mais si c'est un plat au fromage,
fais-le tremper.
Bien sűr, chéri.
Je t'aime.
Je t'aime aussi.
Voilŕ.
Comment vous faites
pour tout arranger ?
Je sais pas. Parfois,
il faut mettre son ego de côté.
Et se rappeler que l'amour
que vous avez envers l'autre
est plus important
que d'avoir raison.
Plus important que d'avoir raison !
Arręte.
Sérieux, c'est quoi, le secret ?
La lune de miel
est peut-ętre passée, mais...
maintenant, vous pouvez passer
aux choses sérieuses.
Et franchement,
c'est la meilleure partie.
Bonne nuit.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
J'imagine qu'on va devoir parler
et arriver aux choses sérieuses.
Ou il y a un banc dans l'ascenseur.
C'est mieux.
- On est pas le couple n° 1, et alors ?
- Carrément, c'est pas une compétition.
On a gagné !
Le meilleur couple du monde !
Devine quoi ?
Ces verres...
sont en plastique.
On peut trčs bien les balancer.
Donc pas de vaisselle sale
dans l'évier.
T'es cochon.
Peut-ętre que je devrais te mettre
dans l'évier.
<i>Et une fois
que cette dispute s'arrangea,</i>
<i>les autres disputes</i>
<i>s'arrangčrent aussi.</i>
<i>In the fall of 2009, a new
couple had moved in upstairs.</i>
<i>We hadn't met them yet,
but we could hear them...</i>
<i>all the time.</i>
<i>They were always...
Let's just say they were always</i>
<i>"playing the bagpipes."</i>
Okay, this is ridiculous.
I can't believe those
two are still bagpiping.
I know. It's been six hours.
Must be that tantric bagpipe
that Sting is into.
She keeps yelling out for him
to play the bagpipes harder,
but it sounds like he's
bagpiping her pretty hard.
There's a glass of water in my bedroom
that's vibrating like Jurassic Park.
You have neighbors!
Shut the bagpipes up!

<i>I decided to go to the bar
to get some peace and quiet.</i>
<i>That didn't work out so well.</i>
I hate to have to be
the one to tell you this.
Marshall and Lily
are getting a divorce.
- No, they're not.
- Just listen
to what I witnessed yesterday.
Baby, you mind washing that?
No problem.
I should go.
She makes him wash his dishes
right away, Ted.
I give 'em two,
maybe three weeks tops.
That's not a big deal.
And it's certainly not a big enough deal
for you to be holding my hands.
They're in big trouble.
I see what's going on.
You, my friend,
are suffering
from a little known condition...
"little known" because I just
made it up,
called "New Relationship Smugness".
You and Robin are
in the honeymoon phase.
Everything's perfect.
Every song on the radio's about you.
Every other couple sucks.
Enjoy it.
N.R.S. doesn't last forever.
It does when you're this awesome.
Check it out.
Robin and I have been keeping
a tally of how many beds
we've done it in.
We're up to 83-and-a-half.
A half?
19th century ottoman
in an antique shop.
- What's up?
- Tiger.
How ya holding up?
Do you need a hug?
You want to talk about yesterday?
Safe space.
He thinks Lily
asking you to wash your dishes
right away is a sign your
marriage is crumbling.
What? Why?
Lily likes a clean sink, so I do
the dishes;what's the big deal?
I'll tell you what the big deal is.
You know how I was always
the best at being single?
Now I am the best at relationships.
Even better than you and Lily.
Look at you.
Had a girlfriend for 5 minutes,
You think you can play
with the big boys... adorable. Son,
I've been in a relationship
since you had a ponytail
and were playing Dave Matthews
on your mama's Casio.
I'm a good boyfriend in my sleep.
I can rock a killer foot rub
with one hand
and brew a kick-ass pot of chamomile
in the other that would make you weep.
Hell, I've forgotten more
about microwaving
fat-free popcorn and watching
Sandra Bullock movies
than you'll ever know,
but thanks for your concern, rook.
- Let me ask you one question.
- Sure.
Do you mind if there is
a sink full of dirty dishes?
Not really.
Then it's Lily's problem, not yours.
But if I said that to her,
it would only lead to a fight, so...
You fight.
See, Robin and I never fight.
- Of course you do.
- No.
And here's the secret:
every time it looks like
we're about to get into a fight...
Why is there
a bag of panties labeled
"April 2008" in your closet?
So any time you think you might have
a fight, you just get up and leave?
100% effective.
Can't fight if you're not there.
That's what Gandhi taught us.
That's not true.
I can't believe that
Robin puts up with that.
Don't worry. She's got a great way
to avoid fights, too.
Are ties machine washable?
No, they most certainly
are not. Why?
What is in your hand?
My God, what's in your hand?!
Okay, so you walk away.
Robin gets naked.
Those are the two stupidest ways
to handle conflict I've ever heard.
The naked thing ain't bad.
- That felt kind of weird.
- Okay, call me crazy.
But when a problem comes up,
Lily and I actually talk about it.
There are so many great things to do
with the human mouth.
Why waste it on talking?
But if you insist,
here's what I would say
about the dishes
if I were Lily's husband.
Barney, you're home!
Dude!
- Get to the point!
- All right.
Thanks, doll.
Sweetie, are you going to wash that?
I'm glad you bring that up. No.
And here's why.
Lily, I know you don't
like a dirty sink.
But does that make it my job
to keep it clean?
I mean, if one day I look up
at the living room ceiling
and think, "Hey, I'd like a replica
of the Sistine Chapel up there."
Would it be your job to paint it?
No.
Of course not.
Exactly! So, baby,
by the same logic,
if you don't like looking
at a sink full of dishes,
shouldn't it be your job
to clean them?
Thanks for explaining that.
I get so confused.
That's because you're a woman.
- I don't even know why we're laughing!
- Of course you don't.
You're kidding me with this.
Hang on, Ted.
Let's hear the man out.
Once I have her attention,
it's time to bring out the big guns.
Look, I love you.
But, baby, with the little
energy I have left after work,
I want to shower you with love,
not wash some silly dishes.
You're right.
I'll do the dishes.
Right after I do this.
Now turn around.
Firm.
- Are you going to hit him or should I?
- He's right.
No, he's not.
Marshall, look at me.
Do not get drawn into
Barney Stinson's circus tent
of funhouse mirrors
and flawed logic.
This is exactly how you
got the earring back in '03.
- That earring looked cool.
- It did look cool, didn't it?
Stay with me!
Barney is wrong.
No, he isn't.
I hate doing my dishes right away.
- You just said you don't mind!
- I hate it, Ted!
I hate it with a boundless,
burning fury!
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!
You're welcome.
Hey, guys.
Good.
There you are.
You'll tell me the truth.
Barney says that you two never fight.
- I guess that's true.
- Told ya.
No way.
I love you both,
but you are the two most
emotionally ill-equipped
individuals in the history
of relationships.
You two must have had
at least one fight.
You know what?
We did.
There was one small dispute
about which one of
us was more awesome.
We just called it
a tie Sand had sex.
Speaking of which, I am so glad
we're going skiing this weekend.
I need a break. The upstairs neighbors
are driving me crazy.
Yeah, it's bad.
- I'm gonna say something to them.
- Thank you.
We all have our assignments
for the weekend.
Ted, you're going to stand up to
your neighbors and you to Lily.
Robin, I'm gonna need you
in sort of a crouched position
on the bear-skin rug
at our ski chalet. Ready?
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.
Have fun.
You know?
With his crazy, well-
thought-out theories
that probably would work.
Marshall, I'm just gonna
say this one more time.
- It's a bad idea.
- I think it could work.
Two more times.
It's a bad idea.
Listen, Barney lays out
some logical points
Lily is a reasonable woman.
I think that if I explain it to her,
she'll get it and I'll get my way.
No. She'll get mad,
and you'll get in a huge fight.
- Slap bet?
- Slap bet.
Baby, could you wash your dishes?
Lily, I'm glad
that you bring that up.
Can I stay here tonight?
I'll make up the sofa, buddy.
The ski bunnies are back!
Hey, guys.
- How was your trip?
- So perfect.
We just spent the whole
weekend cuddling by the fire.
No black diamonds,
but a lot of red hearts.
- Okay, I'm gonna go unpack.
- Hey, you.
Man.
What the hell has gotten into you two?
When did you become so nauseating?
Isn't it great
to finally see her fulfilled
emotionally, spiritually
and sexually?
I dated her for a year.
How was your weekend?
Terrible, and it's all
your fault, okay?
I took your stupid advice!
Baby, could you wash your dishes?
Lily, I'm glad
that you bring that up.
And here is why...
So, it's like this, okay?
Sure.
You want me to go ahead
and wash my dish.
But maybe...
I want you...
to paint the ceiling,
right?
Like, maybe I should say...
"I'll wash my dish
if you get up there
"and just...
you paint naked babies on the ceiling."
You know?
It's just like...
I don't know what happened.
I'm a lawyer.
I argue for a living,
but when it comes to Lily,
I just get all... flustered.
How could you not?
I mean, the girl's all eyes and boobs.
What happened to the
"I'm tired after my draining day,
"and I want to use my leftover energy
showering you with love" argument?
I should have written that down.
Look, Lily, I...
I make more money than you.
Excuse me?!
Dance for me.
Dude.
It all made so much sense
when you said it,
but when I said it,
it turned into a fight.
And once Lily and I start fighting,
the fight starts...
to mutate and multiply.
<i>Sure, it started with the dishes,
but then...</i>
So you're saying
that you shouldn't have to wash dishes
because you work harder than me?
That's not what I'm saying...
but it's true.
<i>And then all of sudden,
we're fighting about who works harder.</i>
I teach kindergarten.
I am molding
the future leaders of tomorrow.
You eat cookies and glue stuff.
<i>And soon more fights spin off.</i>
I can't believe
you'd rather be killed...
<i>Until there're more fights going on
than you can keep track of.</i>
If you need to go
in the middle of the night,
either turn the bathroom light on
or sit down.
My mother does not hate you.
She is neutral about you.
I am not scared
of your shining impression.
I just don't need to hear it,
especially at night.
Danny's not here,
Mrs. Torrance.
Please don't do that.
Man, Lily fights dirty.
She's small,
but vicious like a badger
that your brother's caught
and starved for five days
and then put in your sleeping bag.
I should go home and apologize.
What you need is a surge.
Fight harder.
Picture it, Marshall.
Never having to wash another dish
as long as you live,
yet all the dishes are always clean.
Why, this would take all the anxiety
out of snacking.
No more holding open your shirt
to form a makeshift bowl
for your salty treats.
That world is yours, Marshall.
Reach out, take it,
dip it in some ranch dressing,
enjoy.
Yes, right.
Barney's stupid ideas are
what got you into this quagmire.
There's no exit strategy.
Just wash your stupid dishes.
Those dishes are my manhood!
And if I want to leave
my manhood dirty in the sink,
caked with ketchup and pasta...
- What are you eating?
- Then damn it, that's my right!
I'll wash my manhood
when I'm good and ready!
Where was he not sitting?
Barnstormer!
Ro-Ro!
Now you have adorable nicknames?
Seriously,
what's going on with your two?
Nothing.
We're just happy.
It's like Gandhi said
"A smile don't cost nothing, sugar."
I'm not sure you know who Gandhi is.
So, did you talk to our neighbors?
I did. I went up there
ready to set them straight.
They're old?
Really old.
So what did you do?
I didn't have the heart
to tell stop,
because, well, good for them.
So I just welcomed them to the building,
had a hard candy,
nodded politely at some racist comments
and then left.
<i>Over the next couple of days,
Barney and Robin continued to be happier</i>
<i>than ever.</i>
<i>And Marshall and Lily
continued to fight.</i>
I don't care
if the dishes aren't done.
If you care, you do it.
Great.
Then I don't care
if you have an orgasm.
If you care, you do it.
I went 18 years
without the touch of a woman.
I can do it again.
You might have to.
<i>And I continued
to hear more bagpiping</i>
<i>than a St. Patty's Day parade.</i>
I don't know what to do.
Lily and I
have never had a fight this long.
It's like I don't even exist.
On Sunday morning,
she made pancake, Ted.
Pancake and bacon strip.
It's your own fault.
You took relationship advice...
from Barney.
Well,
maybe Barney has it all figured out.
He and Ro-Ro
are the best couple now.
- We have been dethroned.
- You know what?
I'm not buying it. All that cutesy,
lovey-dovey crap, that's not them.
And I know for a fact
that Robin hates nicknames.
Thanks, Robbsy-Wobbsy.
I don't do nicknames.
Finished with the sports page,
Sherbs?
Seriously, stop.
Robin, it's T-Mose.
I don't like them on you either.
Well, she obviously likes them now.
And, come on,
somebody had to put an end
to T-Mose.
T-Mose was awesome.
I'm thinking of bringing it back.
Bagpiping sounds different today.
It's all echo-y.
They're in the bathroom.
I think they're bagpiping
on the shower chair.
<i>And just like that,
I realized exactly</i>
<i>how to get
the real scoop on Barney and Robin.</i>
How are Marshall and Lily?
I worry about those two,
I really do.
You and your big, giant heart.
Enough.
The jig is up.
Whatever do you mean?
Who's this guy?
We'll get to that.
You see, I knew something was wrong.
You two were too happy,
too shiny, too nickname-y.
Didn't add up.
You two never fight?
Horse apples.
You fight all...
the...
time.
How would you know that?
Phil told me.
Who the hell is Phil?
Your downstairs neighbor.
I'm Phil.
12-B.
And he's heard...
everything.
So Phil tells me
that Ro-Ro and the Barnstormer
have been fighting...
a lot.
Care to explain?
Everything was going great.
Our no-fighting techniques
were working perfectly
until we went on that ski trip
last weekend.
So I showed Marshall
that Lily's argument was bananas,
and now he'll never have to wash
another dish.
High two.
That's terrible advice.
You agree with Lily?
You...
<i>We're about to get in a fight,
and I can't run away.</i>
<i>I can't take my clothes off.
It's freezing up here.</i>
<i>I get hypothermia.</i>
<i>Maybe I can jump it?</i>
<i>Maybe just my pants?</i>
This no-fighting thing is over.
I think so.
- How could you possibly agree with her?
- I can't believe that you made Lily...
And it didn't end there.
We've been fighting ever since.
All those fights we kept not having...
they all came back around.
- The bag of panties.
- The tie Robin murdered.
The tiny camera
I found in the headboard.
That's
how a quarterback stays sharp.
Monday morning, he sits on a bag of ice
and studies the game tape.
- Barney, for the millionth time...
- You don't get to be as good as I am...
I knew it! I knew you guys
were acting too cute and perfect!
Look, we were just sick
of everyone pointing out
how crappy at relationships
we both are.
It was sort of nice
to be the perfect couple for a minute.
I knew you were lying.
You got to wake up pretty early
to slip one by the T-Mose.
Stop it.
Dinner's ready.
Did you make any for me?
No, but it's your favorite.
We need your advice.
<i>So Barney and Robin told them
all about their fighting.</i>
<i>And let's just say,
that in comparison,</i>
<i>their little dishes spat
seemed pretty tame.</i>
<i>And by the end,</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall both
had the same reaction.</i>
I'll wash my dishes right away
from now until the day I die.
I don't care
when you wash the dishes.
But if it's with cheese-based
like a nice ziti, at least soak it.
Of course, baby.
I love you.
I love you, too.
See?
How did you just do that?
How'd you just fix everything?
I don't know. I guess sometimes
you just have to set your ego aside.
And remember
that the love that you have
for that other person
is way more important than winning.
More important than winning.
Stop, stop it.
Seriously, what's the secret?
Look, the honeymoon period may be over,
but...
now you can get into the real stuff.
And honestly,
that's the best part.
Good night.
So what do we do now?
I guess we got to start talking more
and get into the real stuff.
Or...
there's a bench in the elevator.
That's better.
So what
if we're not the best couple?
Totally.
It's not a competition.
We win!
Best couple in the world!
Guess what?
These glasses...
are plastic.
So we can just throw them away.
That means
no dirty dishes in the sink.
You're dirty.
Maybe I should leave you
in the sink.
<i>And once
that first argument got worked out,</i>
<i>all those other arguments,</i>
<i>well,</i>
<i>they got better, too.</i>

Barney est heureux avec Robin.
<i>Mais les semaines suivantes,

<i>Barney et Robin ont cessť
d'avoir de folles aventures.</i>
- Vous avez fait quoi hier ?
- Je voulais aller ŗ un concert.
Lui, ŗ une fÍte.

Alors,
on a regardť un film sur le c‚ble.
C'ťtait lťgend...

C'ťtait pas mal.
<i>Barney n'ťtait plus le mÍme.</i>
Je drague la fille lŗ-bas.
J'ai besoin d'aide pour atterrir.
Dťsolť, je suis co-pilon ce soir.
<i>Tout ce qu'il disait ťnervait Robin.</i>
Comment allez-vous ?
Super.
-  tre en couple, c'est gťnial.
- Tais-toi.
Le partage, les compromis,
la monogamie, c'est top.
Au final, oui !
<i>Plus Áa empirait,</i>
J'ai plus faim... chťri.
<i>plus ils disaient

<i>En fait, Barney et Robin
ne se laissaient qu'un peu aller.</i>
<i>Mais aprŤs quelques semaines,</i>

- Ils s'aiment.
Barney et Robin s'aiment,
mais ce n'est plus Barney et Robin.

…coute, c'est simple.
Barney mange trop,
car il dťteste Ítre liť comme Áa.
Et Robin stresse, car elle dťteste

Non, c'est le couple idťal.
C'est Áa le problŤme.
Ils sont trop identiques.
C'est dur d'avoir deux leaders

- On est deux leaders dans le nŰtre.
- Bien sŻr, chťri.
Pourquoi ils se sťparent pas ?
Ils sont trop tÍtus.
Aucun des deux ne veut Ítre

- Ils jouent ŗ la poule mouillťe.
- Barnay a mangť la poule mouillťe.
Ted, c'est qu'un mauvais moment.
Faut du temps

Je vais te poser
une question directe.
- Tu es heureux avec Robin ?
- Tu dťconnes ?
Comment Ítre malheureux avec elle ?
C'est Robin !
Alors ?
C'est dingue que tu me demandes Áa.
Oui, on se dispute tout le temps,
mais tu sais ce qu'on dit :
chaque moment est un combat.
Alors ?
Et tu sais
ce qui va avec les disputes ?
La baise de rťconciliation.
Qui est...
diffťrente
quand tu es
dans une relation longue durťe.
Face, on fait l'amour,
pile, on commande une pizza
et on reste affalťs.
Super.
Laisse la piŤce dťcider.
- C'ťtait quoi, la pizza ?
- Pile.
C'ťtait pile.
Le sexe... pas vrai ?
Dieu merci, on le fait presque plus.
J'ai encore faim.
T'as faim ?
On doit les sťparer.
Tu as raison. Barney et Robin
sont malheureux ensemble,
mais ils refusent de l'admettre.
- On doit les sťparer.
- Comment ?
On libŤre...
le Kraken.
<i>Les enfants, comme vous le savez,
cette annťe-lŗ,</i>
<i>j'avais appris que Lily
avait cassť non pas une,</i>
<i>ni deux,</i>
<i>mais sept
de mes anciennes relations.</i>
Oubliez Áa. J'ai arrÍtť.
- Je suis <i>out</i>.
- Mais tu es la meilleure.
…coute-moi, j'ai renoncť ŗ Áa.
Je fais du lťgal.
Je suis entremetteuse, maintenant.
- Arrange-moi un coup.
- Je dťbute.
S'il te plaÓt. Tu dois les sťparer.
Cette relation les dťtruit.
Je le sais,
mais j'ai retenu ma leÁon.
Plus d'ingťrence.
Laisser les choses se faire.
- C'est 2 contre 1.
- Oui, mais le 1, c'est moi.
Pas besoin d'elle,
on peut le faire seuls.
Comment ?
Quand je sortais avec Robin,
quel est le truc
qui l'a vraiment faite paniquer ?
Ted, tu peux pas me faire Áa !
- De quoi tu parles ?
- «a ! Je parle de Áa.
«a fait quoi dans mon champagne ?
Si on fait croire ŗ Robin
que Barney va faire sa demande,
- elle paniquera et ils se sťpareront.
- T'es fou. Pourquoi pas tenter Barney ?
On trouve un canon pour le draguer.
D'accord, la bague.
- Un van.
- Quoi ?
Pour la planque, un van.
On aurait pris une pizza,
regardť dans les jumelles et dit :
"J'ai pas signť pour Áa",
des trucs comme Áa.
Voilŗ le serveur.
- Tais-toi.
- Quoi ?
Je croyais que t'avais parlť.
C'est une bague ?
Tu...
«a vient pas de moi.
Ils ont dŻ se tromper de table.
Tu nous imagines mariťs ?
Notre relation est bien ťtablie.
La plupart de tes affaires
sont dťjŗ chez moi.
- On paierait moins d'impŰts.
- «a aiderait ta naturalisation.
"Scherbatsky", c'est dur ŗ ťpeler.
Ma mŤre serait si heureuse.
- Je crois bien.
- Pourquoi pas ?
- On va se marier !
- Pas si fort.
Vous avez fait quoi ?
Je suis hors de moi !
C'est pas bien.
- Tu seras ma demoiselle d'honneur ?
- J'adorerais !
Vous Ítes dingues ?
Ils jouaient au jeu de la poule mouillťe
et vous avez fait quoi ?
Vous agitez une bague de fianÁailles
sous leur nez.
C'est bon.
Je prends le relais.
Je sors de ma retraite
pour une derniŤre rupture.
Le plan ?
Ils sont tellement tÍtus
qu'une seule dispute suffira pas.
Il faut leur rappeler
leurs quatre plus grosses disputes
en une seule fois.
Numťro un,
la bataille de la vaisselle sale.
Numťro deux,
le conflit de l'ex-copine.
Tu la connais ?
Je crois pas.
Je ne l'ai jamais...
Tiens, c'est Meg.
Et je vous compare sŻrement pas
dans mon esprit en ce moment.
Tu peux ramasser ?
Numťro trois,
l'altercation <i>Star Wars</i>.
Il serait pas temps
de jeter ta stupide poupťe ?
C'est pas une poupťe,
c'est un Stormtrooper.
Il a une couche.
C'est pas une couche,
c'est son armure.
Stormtrooper ?
PlutŰt Storm-chiard.
ArrÍte.
On dirait que ton Storm-chiard
a besoin d'Ítre changť.
Et la plus importante,
la guerre Canada-USA.
Cette chanson est enfin finie.
Qui c'ťtait, cette vieille ?
Tu sais que Neil Young
est mon artiste prťfťrť.
Elle jouait la femme d'Al Bundy
dans <i>Mariťs Deux Enfants</i>,
ou c'ťtait un sosie sonore ?
Neil Young est un trťsor canadien.
Ne te moque pas de Neil Young.
Je ne me moquerais jamais
d'une vieille sans dťfense
aux cordes vocales paralysťes.
- En public ? Tu y tiens ?
- J'attends.
Je sais.
On leur envoie des photos
leur rappelant ces disputes par mail.
Gamin !
Voilŗ le plan.
Ils dÓnent...
<i>D'abord,
on ravive le dťbat Canada-USA,</i>
<i>quand Alan Thicke
s'arrÍte ŗ leur table.</i>
- Alan Thicke ?
- Oui.
Robin le connaissait
quand elle chantait.
Ils sont toujours en contact.
J'ai pris son numťro dans son portable.
Sťrieusement... amateurs.
<i>Donc Alan Thicke relance
la bataille Canada-USA.</i>
<i>ņ ce moment-lŗ,
Meg la folle se pointe.</i>
Puis un Stormtrooper
passe devant la vitre.
Et quand ils sont
sur le point d'exploser,
un serveur passe
avec une bassine remplie de quoi ?
De vaisselle sale.
Ceci est ton chef-d'oeuvre.
On va avoir un van de surveillance.
Un break ?
Vraiment ? T'as louť un break ?
- Un van coŻtait 25 $ de plus.
- Un break ?
Fťlicitations, Will Robinson !
C'est l'anniversaire de qui ?
Grimpez.
C'est quoi, Áa ?
Ils avaient plus de Stormtrooper,
alors j'ai pris un autre robot.
Un autre ?
Un Stormtrooper, c'est pas un robot.
Bien sŻr que si.
"Nous devoir tuer Luke Skywalker".
- Personne dit Áa dans <i>Star Wars</i>.
- Ton imitation ťtait nulle.
Une commande
de pizza ŗ la saucisse ?
Une des vidťos de Barney
commence comme Áa.
Barney commande...
cinq d'un truc.
- Je sais pas si Áa va rentrer.
- Lŗ, vous citez la vidťo.
Ils commandent.
- Le serveur sort un second carnet.
- Faut que Áa rentre. On surveille.
Sans van ?
- Merci.
- Un van coŻte plus cher.
Envoie une part, Will Robinson !
Si vous le tachez,
Áa va coŻter plus cher.
ArrÍte de faire ton crevard.
- Donne une part au Stormtrooper.
- C'est pas un Stormtrooper !
Je suis en retard.
Je cherchais un van.
- Merci !
- 25 $ !
- Je vais saluer Robin ?
- Pas encore, montez.
Alors attendez.
Quand ils explosent
l'…toile de la Mort,
en sachant qu'il y a
des milliers de Stormtroopers,
c'ťtait des gens ?
C'ťtait l'…toile de la Mort.
Ils connaissaient les risques.
Je veux pas jouer au
"Je suis Alan Thicke",
mais j'ai vraiment un dÓner, donc...
Bon, vous la prenez cette saucisse ?
T'ťtais dans le film ?
Le type au bronzage paysan ?
TrŤs envie de pizza, Will Robinson !
Allez, je suis Alan Thicke !
J'ai pas signť pour Áa.
Vous savez quoi ? ArrÍtez, tous !
Alan Thicke, fermez-la !
Marshall, c'est un break, remets-toi !
Ted, arrÍte avec le porno !
Et par pitiť, que quelqu'un
donne de la pizza au Stormtrooper !
- C'est pas un Stormtrooper !
- Merde !
- Ils nous voient !
- Danger !
- T'es sŻre qu'ils nous ont vus ?
- Oui.
Je peux aller voir Barney ?
Je suis super impatiente !
Vous pensez vraiment
qu'il va faire sa demande ?
Oublie Áa, on s'est fait avoir.
Si on tente un truc,
on sera grillťs.
On devrait tous rentrer...
C'est mon chef-d'oeuvre.
Et alors s'ils nous ont vus ?
«a va marcher.
- On trouvera autre chose.
- Je rťpŤte,
"Je suis Alan Thicke".
Vous Ítes Alan Thicke ?
Alan Thicke, ŗ vous.
Allez-y.
<i>Alors, Lily a continuť son plan.</i>
<i>D'abord, Alan Thicke.</i>
<i>Puis Meg la folle.</i>
<i>Ensuite, le robot.</i>
<i>Et enfin, la vaisselle sale.</i>
<i>Mais au final...</i>
Ils s'embrassent ?
Ils devraient pas s'embrasser !
Pourquoi Áa marche pas ?
Parce qu'ils s'aiment.
C'ťtait juste une mauvaise passe.
Qu'est-ce que je fous ?
C'ťtait une erreur.
L'un d'entre vous veut bťdave ?
Je pensais pas dire Áa ce soir,
mais...
ņ Barney et Robin,
le couple heureux.
<i>ņ ce moment, on a appris</i>
<i>que les relations, c'est du boulot,</i>
<i>mais que tout s'arrange au final.</i>
Oý est Barney ?
On a rompu.
<i>Et Áa, c'est le moment oý
on a dťsappris la leÁon</i>
<i>qu'on venait juste d'apprendre.</i>
<i>Plus tŰt, quand Lily pensait</i>
<i>que Barney et Robin l'avaient repťrťe,
voici ce qu'ils ont vu.</i>
Pourquoi cet obŤse
et cette vieille nous reg... ?
Mon Dieu. C'est nous !
Regarde-nous.
On a toujours ťtť comme Áa ?
Robin, je suis pas heureux.
J'aimerais l'Ítre.
Rien ne me rendrait plus heureux
qu'Ítre heureux, mais...
je le suis pas.
Qu'est-ce qu'on a loupť ?
On s'aime.
Si Áa marche pas, alors quoi ?
On est pareils.
On aime le scotch.
On est gťniaux.
C'est peut-Ítre Áa.
Peut-Ítre qu'on est trop gťniaux.
Exactement.
Deux gťniaux s'annulent,
et je suis fatiguť
de me faire annuler.
Moi aussi.
On se sťpare ?
Je pense.
Merde.
On passe ŗ l'ťtape suivante.
Celle oý on arrive pas
ŗ redevenir amis.
C'est peut-Ítre pas une rupture.
C'est peut-Ítre...
deux amis...
qui se retrouvent.
C'est toujours gťnial
de voir une compatriote.
Bonne nouvelle ! Je te pardonne
pour l'injonction d'ťloignement.
C'est pas un Stormtrooper ?
C'est pas un Stormtr...
On s'en va ?
ņ plus, les mecs.
ņ plus, Alan.
Vous habitez toujours sur la 73e†?
Comment vous savez Áa ?
Se retrouver
comme amis...
J'aime bien.
Un dernier pour la route ?
Et, qui sait ?
Peut-Ítre qu'ŗ tes 40 ans,
si t'as trouvť personne...
J'ai dťjŗ fait ce pacte avec Ted.
Bien sŻr, suis-je bÍte.
Alors, peut-Ítre qu'ŗ tes 39 ans,
si t'as trouvť personne...
<i>Au final, ils avaient juste besoin
de laisser les choses se faire.</i>
Comment va Barney ?
Bien, je suppose.
Il lui faudra un peu de temps
pour se remettre, mais...
Vous avez pas eu un frisson ?
Papa est rentrť.
- Content qu'on ait pu se revoir.
- Faudrait se refaire Áa.
C'est super d'Ítre toujours amis
si longtemps aprŤs
avoir fait ce clip.
Le clip ?
La vidťo de "Sandcastles" !
«a aussi, on l'a fait ensemble.
Comment Áa "aussi" ?
On a fait cette ťmission de variťtťs
canadienne ratťe.
C'ťtait tellement gÍnant.
Imagine ce qui se passerait
si quelqu'un mettait la main dessus ?
Toi alors !
<i>Kids, as long as
I'd known your uncle Barney,</i>
<i>he'd always had some pretty
strong opinions on relationships.</i>
Your girlfriend?
She's your girlfriend?!
She's a girl and a friend?
Do not humanize the enemy, Ted.
But nice to meet you.
<i>And yet, in the fall of 2009,</i>
<i>he was the one with the girlfriend.</i>
Go ahead.
Open it.
Open it! Open it!
It's my porn collection!
Just kidding.
That would be weird.
- It's your porn collection.
- Yes, it is. I'm giving you my porn.
Now that things are so great with Robin,
I don't need it anymore.
You are voluntarily...
giving up your porn?
- You really are serious.
- Well, that's obvious.
- What does that mean?
- Nothing, it's just,
you got relationship gut.
What?!
No, I do not "got relationship gut."
That is ridiculous.
It's no big deal.
Once you're dating someone,
it's natural to let things
go a little bit. Trust me,
we've been there.
Boy, did I pudge out for a while.
We should get going.
Good-bye, my sweet, beloved friends.
You have always been there for me.
You'll be missed.
He's talking to the porn.
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.
God, look at these videos.
<i>Space orgy</i>?
<i>Horny co-ed surprise party 23</i>?
You'd think after the first 22 parties,
co-eds wouldn't be surprised anymore.
So...
We can get rid of these for you.
It's not a problem.
I'll take care of them.
Are you sure?
No biggie.
We can just swing by the back alley
and drop the box in the dumpster.
I see six of the words you just said
on this video label.
Seriously, it's not a big deal.
I'll take care of it.
- 'cause, I mean...
- Leave them!
You know, in a way, it's sad, right?
I mean, Barney's giving up his porn.
He's got relationship gut.
They eat at the same
diner every night.
It's, like, the end of Barney Stinson
as we know him.
- Yeah, well, so what? They're happy.
- Yeah, well, we gotta go.
- So what'd you get?
- I got <i>Squat</i>.
What are you...?
I thought I saw you take one.
I did.
It's called <i>Squat</i>.
<i>Archisexture</i>.
That is not how you spell
"Buckminster fuller."
<i>Kids, pornography is bad,</i>
<i>and so I was getting rid of that
vile pornography right away...</i>
I am getting rid of this vile
pornography right away.
<i>... when something terrible
happened.</i>
<i>Archisexture...</i>
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>If you're watching this tape...
And I knew you'd pick this one.</i>
<i>Then you are now
in possession of my porn.</i>
<i>This can only mean
one of two things.</i>
<i>Either I'm dead,
or I'm in a committed relationship.</i>
<i>If I'm dead,
I want you to honor my memory</i>
<i>by taking my body to the Hamptons</i>
<i>and recreating</i> Weekend at Bernie's.
<i>I want to dance.</i>
<i>I want to have sex with a girl.</i>
<i>And I want to go fishing.</i>
<i>If, on the other hand, I'm
in a committed relationship,</i>
<i>then as your best friend,
I have only one request,</i>
<i>please, for the love of god,</i>
<i>get me out of it!</i>
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-
.:: La Fabrique ::.
<i>I might look happy,
but don't believe it.</i>
<i>Barney Stinson
is meant to be single.</i>
<i>So please,</i>
<i>if you value my best-friendship...
That's right, Marshall,</i>
<i>I'm his best friend,
how does that feel?</i>
<i>Then get me out of this.</i>
<i>And finally, since you were
expecting some porn...</i>
<i>No, no, no, baby, don't worry.</i>
<i>The flashing green
light means it's off.</i>
Are we sure he was finished talking?
Look, there's no reason we should
take this seriously, right?
Of course not.
This is an old tape.
Barney is happy with Robin.
<i>But over the next couple weeks,
I started to notice things.</i>
<i>Barney and Robin stopped having
crazy adventures.</i>
- So what'd you guys do last night?
- I wanted to go to a concert.
He wanted to go to a party.
Obviously, we couldn't
do what just one of us wanted,
we just stayed in,
watched a movie on cable.
It was legen...
Wait for it...
... of the fall.
Legends of the fall!
It was okay.
<i>Barney stopped being himself.</i>
Barney, I'm...
I'm chatting up this girl
over there, and I could use a
little help landing the plane.
Sorry, Ted, I'm my own
wingman tonight.
<i>And Robin got annoyed
at everything he said.</i>
So, how are you two?
So great.
- Relationships are the best.
- Shut up.
- The sharing, the compromise,
- Shut up, shut up, shut up...
- the monogamy, can't beat it.
- Shut up, shut up...
Catchphrase! Yes!
<i>But the worse they got...</i>
I'm full... Sweetie.
<i>... the more they kept saying
things were great.</i>
<i>Now, the truth is Barney and Robin
kind of let themselves go a little bit.</i>
<i>But I swear after few more weeks,</i>
<i>to us, they seemed like this.</i>
I'll be there...
in a minute.
- They're killing each other.
- They love each other.
They love each other, but they're not
Barney and Robin anymore.
- They're the fat guy and the old lady.
- My favorite '70s detective show.
Look, it's so clear.
Barney's been overeating because
he hates being tied down like this.
And Robin's stressing out because
she hates what Barney's turned into.
No, they're a perfect match.
Well, maybe that's the problem.
Maybe they're too similar.
It must be tough having 2 alpha dogs
in 1 relationship.
- We've 2 alpha dogs in our too.
- Sure we do, sweetie.
If they're not happy,
why don't they just break up?
They're too stubborn.
Neither one of them wants to be
the first to admit that they want out.
- They're playing relationship chicken.
- He ate the relationship chicken.
Ted, it's just a rough patch.
It takes time getting used
to being with someone else.
And they're both...
- What's the nice word for selfish?
- Independent.
Independent. Every relationship
goes through this.
It's true,
I have this astronaut friend...
Totally loved his fiancée.
And then, the day before his
mission she caught him
with, like, four other chicks,
a couple of dudes.
Things got really tense.
Finally, she ended up sneaking
onto the space shuttle...
- Are you talking about <i>Space Orgy</i>?
- Yes.
Ted, it's just a rough patch.
Just let things run their course.
- She's right.
- Two-to-one, Ted. Leave them alone.
<i>So I did leave them alone.
But that weekend...</i>
Have you noticed how beef ribs
used to always be disgusting,
and then recently, they found a way
to make them really delicious instead?
Okay, Barney, I'm going to go
ahead and ask you this head-on.
- Are you happy with Robin?
- Are you kidding?!
How could I not be happy
with Robin? It's Robin!
You're happy?
I can't believe you would ask me that.
I mean, yes, we fight all the time,
but you know what they say
about relationships,
every moment's a battle.
You're happy?
And you know what goes
hand in hand with fighting?
The makeup sex.
Which is...
different
when you're in a loving,
long-term relationship.
Heads we have sex,
tails we order a whole pizza
and just lay here moaning.
Great.
Let the coin decide.
- Which was pizza again?
- Tails.
It was tails.
Sex... am I right?
Thank god that's mostly over.
I'm still hungry.
You hungry?
We have to break them up.
You're right. Barney and Robin
are miserable together,
but they're too stubborn
to admit it.
- We have to get them to break up.
- How do we do that?
We unleash...
the kraken.
<i>Kids, as you know, earlier that year</i>
<i>I'd learned that lily had
broken up not one,</i>
<i>not two, but seven
of my past relationships.</i>
Forget it.
I'm retired.
- I'm out of the game.
- But nobody's better than you.
I'm telling you,
I swore off that racket.
I've gone legit.
I'm a matchmaker now.
- Set me up with someone.
- I'm just starting out.
Please. You've, got to break them up.
This relationship is killing them.
I know it is,
but I've learned my lesson.
No more interfering.
Let things run their course.
- It's two-to-one.
- Yes, but the one is me.
We don't need her.
We can break them up on our own.
How?
Remember when
Robin and I were dating?
What was the one big thing that
really freaked her out?
No, no, no, no, no.
Ted, you cannot do this to me!
- What are you talking about?
- This! This is what I'm talking about.
What is this doing in my champagne?
If we make Robin think for even a second
that Barney is proposing,
- she'll lose it and they'll break up.
- That's crazy. Why don't we...
lead Barney into temptation?
We'll find a hot woman
to hit on him...
Okay, the ring thing.
- Stakeout van.
- What?
We should've gotten a stakeout van.
We could've ordered pizza,
looked through
big binoculars and said,
"this ain't what I signed up
for", stuff like that.
Here comes the waiter.
- Please shut up.
- What?
I thought you said something, sorry.
Is that an engagement ring?
Are you...?
It's not me. They must have delivered it
to the wrong table.
Can you imagine us getting married?
Well,
we are committed to each other.
Most of your stuff
is already at my apartment.
- It might make taxes easier.
- It'd speed up your citizenship.
"Scherbatsky" is so hard to spell.
My mom would be so happy.
- I guess so.
- No reason not to.
- We're getting married!
- Not so loud, geez.
What did you do?
I am furious right now!
This is so wrong!
- Lily, will you be my maid of honor?
- My god! I would love to!
Are you out of your mind?!
They're playing relationship chicken,
and what did you do?
You put an engagement ring
in front of them!
Okay, that's it.
I'm taking over.
Coming out of retirement,
for one, last breakup.
- How are we'll do it?
- They are in so deep,
just one fight ain't going to do it.
We need to reignite
the four biggest fights
they've ever been in all at once.
Number one,
the battle of the dirty dishes.
Number two,
the ex-girlfriend conflict.
Don't you know that girl over there?
I don't think so.
In fact, I have definitely not...
It's Meg.
I am certainly not comparing you two
in my mind right now.
Will you get that for me?
- What's the problem? I'm not...
- You're embarrassing me in public.
Number three,
the <i>Star Wars</i> altercation.
Isn't it time
you got rid of your stupid doll?
It's not a doll.
It's a stormtrooper.
He's wearing a diaper.
It's not a diaper, Robin,
it's protective armor.
Stormtrooper?
More like storm-pooper.
Stop it.
It sounds like your storm-pooper here
needs a changing.
- I'm sick of it, of the jokes...
- What? I didn't say anything
I cant joke?
And of course the biggie,
the Canadian/American war.
Thank god, that song's over.
Who the hell
was that old lady singing?
You know that Neil Young
is my favorite musician.
Right. Now, was that the same old lady
who played Archie Bunker's wife
in all in the family,
or just a sound-alike?
Neil Young is a Canadian treasure.
Do not make fun of Neil Young.
I would never make fun
of a defenseless old lady
with vocal cord paralysis...
- Here we go. In public? Really?
- Ever. I'll go there.
- What's the problem?
- Everything I say...
I got it.
We e-mail them pictures
reminding them of each of these fights.
You child.
Here's how it goes down.
They're at the diner...
<i>First, rekindling
the canadian-american debate,</i>
<i>Ontario native Alan Thicke
stops by the table.</i>
- Alan Thicke?
- Right.
Robin knew him back
when she was a singer.
And they still keep in touch.
I already got his number off her phone.
Seriously... Amateurs.
<i>So Alan Thicke restarts
the Canada/U.S. Fight.</i>
<i>Right at that moment,
crazy Meg shows up.</i>
<i>Then, a stormtrooper happens</i>
<i>to walk by the window.</i>
<i>And just
when they can't take anything more,</i>
<i>a busboy walks by
with a tray full of what?</i>
<i>Dirty dishes.</i>
This is your masterpiece.
We're getting a stakeout van!
A station wagon?
Really?
You rented a station wagon?
- A van cost, like, 25 bucks more.
- A station wagon?
Greetings, Will Robinson!
Where's the birthday boy or girl?
Climb on in.
What is this?
They didn't have any stormtroopers,
so I get a different robot.
This'll still work.
Different robot?
Stormtroopers aren't robots.
Of course they're robots!
"Must kill Luke Skywalker."
- Nobody says that in <i>Star Wars</i> at all.
- That's a really lousy robot voice.
Someone order
an extra large sausage?
One of Barney's videos
starts off just like that.
Barney's ordering...
five of something.
- I don't know if it'll fit.
- Now you're just quoting the video.
Still ordering.
- Waiter's taking out a second pad.
- We need it. We're on a stakeout.
- Shouldn't you be in a van?
- A van cost more.
Score me a slice, Will Robinson!
You get a stain on that costume,
they're gonna charge us.
Dude,
will you just chill about money?
- Let the stormtrooper have a slice.
- It's not a stormtrooper!
Sorry I'm late.
I was looking for a van.
- Thank you!
- $25!
- So should I go say hi to Robin?
- Not yet, get in the car.
So wait, wait, wait.
When they blew up the Death Star,
knowing full well there're
thousands of stormtroopers on it,
those were people?
It was called the Death Star.
They knew what they're getting into.
I don't want to play
the "I'm Alan Thicke" card,
but I really do have a dinner
to get to, so...
Someone has got
to take this sausage!
Were you in that video?
Were you the guy with the farmer tan?
Jonesin' for some'za, Will Robinson!
Come on, I'm Alan Thicke!
This ain't what I signed up for.
You know what?
Everyone, stop!
Alan Thicke, shut up!
It's a station wagon. Get over it!
Ted, stop talking about porn!
And for the love of god,
somebody get the stormtrooper pizza!
It's not a stormtrooper!
Crap!
They see us!
Danger!
Danger!
Are you sure they saw us?
Can I go talk to Barney now?
I'm so excited!
Do you really think
he's going to propose to me?
Forget it, we've been made.
If we try anything,
they'll know it's us.
I think
we should all just go home...
This is my masterpiece.
So what if they saw us?
It'll still work.
- Stop. We'll think of something else.
- Let me repeat,
"I am Alan Thicke".
You're Alan Thicke?!
Alan Thicke, you're up.
Get on out there.
<i>And so,
Lily followed through with her plan.</i>
<i>First, Alan Thicke.</i>
<i>Followed by crazy Meg.</i>
<i>Then, the robot.</i>
<i>And finally, the dirty dishes.</i>
<i>But by the end of it...</i>
They're kissing?
They shouldn't be kissing!
Why isn't this working?
Because they're in love.
It really was just a rough patch.
What the hell am I doing?
This whole thing was a mistake.
So, any of you dudes
want to get high?
I never thought
I'd be saying this tonight, but...
To Barney and Robin,
the happy couple.
<i>That was the moment we learned</i>
<i>that relationships take hard work,</i>
<i>but eventually,
everything will work out.</i>
Where's Barney?
We broke up.
<i>And that was the moment
we unlearned that other lesson</i>
<i>we had just learned
a few seconds earlier.</i>
<i>You see, earlier that night,
when Lily thought</i>
<i>Barney and Robin had spotted her,</i>
<i>this is what they really saw.</i>
Why do that fat guy
and old lady keep sta...?
My god. That's us!
Look at us.
Did we always look this awful?
Robin, I'm not happy.
I mean, I wish I was.
Nothing would make me happier
than being happy, but...
I'm not.
What are we doing wrong?
We love each other.
If this doesn't work, what will?
We're so similar.
We both like scotch.
We're both awesome.
You know, maybe that's it.
Maybe there's just
too much awesome here.
Exactly.
Two awesomes cancel each other out,
and I'm tired
of being cancelled out.
Me, too.
Are we breaking up?
I think so.
Crap.
Now comes the next part.
The part where you and I
can't go back to being friends.
Well, maybe this isn't a breakup.
Maybe this is...
two friends...
getting back together.
It's always so great
to see a fellow hoser.
Good news! I forgive you
for the whole restraing order thing.
Is that a stormtrooper?
That's not a stormtr...
You want to get out of here?
See you guys.
See you, Alan.
So you still on 73rd Street?
How do you know that?
Getting back together
as friends...
I like that.
One more for the road?
And who knows?
Maybe, when, like, you turn 40,
if you haven't found anyone...
I already have that deal with Ted.
Right. Stupid.
Well, maybe when you turn 39,
if you haven't found anyone...
<i>It turns out that they really did need
to let things run their course.</i>
So, how's Barney doing?
He's okay, I think.
It might be awhile
before he fully recovers, but...
Did you guys just feel a chill?
Daddy's home.
- I'm glad we could catch up.
- Let's do it again soon.
I love that you guys
are still friends
so long after
you did that music video.
The music?
The "sandcastles" video!
We did that together, too.
- What do you mean "too"?
- We had this...
failed Canadian TV variety show.
That was so embarrassing.
Imagine what would happen
if anybody ever got their hands on that?
You!
<i>Les enfants, le secret pour draguer
est très simple :</i>
<i>soyez confiant,
bien dans votre peau,</i>
<i>sûr de savoir qui vous êtes.</i>
<i>Barney était très bon
pour cette dernière,</i>
<i>même si souvent,
ce quelqu'un était quelqu'un d'autre.</i>
T'as vu ce type
en tenue de plongée ?
Tu penses aller lui parler ?
Tant mieux.
C'est le plus gros salopard
de la Terre.
- Tu le connais ?
- C'est un de mes amis.
- Pourquoi la tenue de plongée ?
- C'est une longue histoire.
Il vient de se séparer...
<i>Il y a deux grandes écoles
sur la gestion post-rupture.</i>
<i>Certains se jettent dans...</i>

Chaque femme de New York City.
Exactement, Barney Stinson
est de retour sur le marché.
Mères, enfermez vos filles.
Filles, enfermez vos milfdus.
- Milfdus ?
- Je peux trouver.
Milf d'un soir.
Exact ! Entièrement d'accord.
Tu trouves pas ça précipité ?
Lily, avec Robin, il y avait un...
truc que j'aurai aimé utiliser plus.
C'est... plutôt gros,
étonnamment lourd,
un peu en cuir, et noir.
Ceci, mes amis...
est le Manuel.
Synchro : ShalimarFox, -Titou-
Adaptation : ZeK, H3AV3N,
tactactac, HelenScott
.:: La Fabrique ::.
Le Manuel contient
chaque arnaque, escroquerie,
tour, tromperie, baratin,
stratagème et feinte
que j'ai utilisés...
ou espère utiliser
pour draguer des filles
et leur montrer comment faire.
T'as écrit un autre livre ?
On a un... Stephen King ici.
Tout est là.
Depuis les techniques simples
comme le "Ne Bois Pas Ça".
Ne bois pas ça.
Quelqu'un y a mis un truc.
Quoi ? Qui ?
Lui.
Merci.
Aux manoeuvres plus avancées
comme le "Mme Stinsfire".
Après notre entretien disciplinaire
pour comportements obscènes,
nous avons une nouvelle
maîtresse de maison.
Je vous présente Mme Stinsfire.
Bonjour, les filles !
Ça doit marcher à chaque fois.
Et le "Lorenzo Von Matterhorn" ?
Bonne question.
Le "Lorenzo Von Matterhorn"
marquera mon retour
sur le devant de la scène.
Ou tu sais, du lit.
En fait, mon lit est sur une scène.
J'ai mis une plateforme
et des lampes.
C'est une production amatrice.
Barney sort !
Et toi, Robin ? Tu ressors ?
- Où est ton Manuel ?
- Mon Manuel ?
Mec, en deux volumes, juste ici.
- Ça se lit bien.
- Ouais, je le lis en ce moment.
Je lâche un peu tout ça.
- Marshall, ça va arriver.
- À mort.
- Quoi ?
- Tu vas tomber amoureuse.
Très vite.
Peu probable.
Je me concentre sur ma carrière.
- Finis, les rencards.
- On joue à Pyramide ?
"Ce qu'on dit
avant de trouver l'élu."
Kelly Harris,
avec qui j'ai étudié, a dit :
"Le droit est si dur,
je veux me concentrer sur mes études."
Six mois plus tard ?
Mariée !
C'est tout...
Travis Frenchroy,
barman de remplacement, me dit :
"J'en ai marre des relations.
"Je veux me concentrer
sur ma fan fiction de <i>Star Trek</i>."
Six mois plus tard...
Marié !
Puis-je répondre ?
- C'est très bien pour...
- Matthew Blitz,
comptable dans ma boîte, dit :
"Je vais mourir seul.
"Je vais me concentrer
sur les taxes de cette année."
Six mois plus tard ?
Union civile
et attend la nouvelle législation
pour l'instant au Sénat de NY.
Proteste si tu veux,
mais ça arrivera.
- C'est une loi naturelle.
- Décrétée par la nature.
J'aimerais
ne pas vouloir de relation.
Je pourrais pas être célibataire
si je voulais l'être.
- Bien, tu es prêt.
- Prêt pour quoi ?
Il y a 3 ans, Shelly a commencé
à enseigner à mon école.
Dès que je l'ai vu, j'ai pensé :
- "Elle est pour Ted".
- Pourquoi t'en parles que maintenant ?
Tu sais,
j'aime pas les rencards arrangés,
mais ce Ted a l'air génial.
Il est tellement gentil,
attentionné et intelligent.
Allez ! Encore un
et la couronne est à toi !
Je le vois pas.
Il doit être parti aider les pauvres.
On change de bar ?
La fille avec Lily est jolie.
Elle était jolie.
Elle l'est toujours.
Et maintenant, tu es prêt.
Mec, tu pourrais rentrer
bien plus de morceaux de poulets.
- Et comment.
- Je m'en occupe,
mais promets-moi
de ne rien faire de stupide.
Je promets de rien faire de stupide.
<i>J'ai tenu ma promesse.</i>
<i>Mais seulement car...</i>
<i>elle n'est jamais venue.</i>
- Je sais. Désolée, je me sens mal.
- T'as intérêt !
En fait, non.
J'avais hâte de rencontrer Ted,
mais je suis arrivée en avance,
et j'ai rencontré ce type génial.
Vraiment trop génial.
Tu l'as rencontré au MacLaren's ?
- C'est ça.
- Et comment il s'appelle ?
Je devrais pas le dire.
Et puis zut.
C'est Lorenzo Von Matterhorn !
Espèce d'enfoiré.
Il a couché avec Shelly ?
Tu devais être énervée.
C'est clair.
Barney, j'avais mis Shelly de côté
pour Ted depuis trois ans.
Ted a rien raté du tout.
Elle est intello, agaçante
et ennuyeuse au pieu.
Elle aurait été parfaite pour Ted.
Si j'avais su
qu'elle était pour Ted,
j'aurais rien fait, mais...
étant donné les circonstances,
Ted sera fier de moi.
J'ai joué le coup
du "Lorenzo Von Matterhorn".
Le "Lorenzo Von Matterhorn" ?
J'ai posé la même question.
- Le "Lorenzo Von Matterhorn" ?
- Content que tu demandes.
<i>Pour réussir
le "Lorenzo Von Matterhorn",</i>
<i>vous aurez besoin de :
quelques bases de web-design,</i>
<i>et d'un pseudo très particulier.</i>
<i>Réfléchissez à votre pseudo
maintenant.</i>
<i>Trouvé ? Bien.</i>
<i>Choisissez une cible.</i>
<i>De préférence une fille
avec un beau...</i>
<i>portable.</i>
Eh oui, c'est moi.
Je vous connais ?
Je suis Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
Vous êtes célèbre ?
Vous ignorez qui je suis ?
Enfin un peu de renouveau.
Enchanté...
Encore une fois,
je suis Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
Ça s'écrit comme ça se prononce,
avec deux T.
<i>Puis, dès votre départ,
elle prend son portable</i>
<i>et recherche "Lorenzo Von Matterhorn"
sur internet.</i>
<i>Et là, elle découvre...</i>
<i>Des faux sites internet,</i>
<i>tous dédiés à l'incroyable vie</i>
<i>de Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.</i>
<i>Il y a le faux article sur sa vie
de milliardaire solitaire.</i>
<i>La newsletter
du club des explorateurs</i>
<i>qui décrit
son périple au Pôle Nord en ballon.</i>
<i>Le faux journal médical
avec les articles des médecins</i>
<i>disant que rétrécir son sexe
n'est pas envisageable.</i>
<i>Et à votre retour...</i>
Je déteste être direct,
mais je peux t'offrir un café ?
Avec plaisir.
Combien ça coûte un café, 50 $ ?
<i>Et c'est parti.</i>
C'est horrible.
Tu lui as brisé le coeur.
Elle est inconsolable.
Pourquoi être inconsolable ?
Le ballon de Lorenzo
ne disparaîtra pas avant une semaine.
Elle serait troublée si on lui avait dit
que c'est que des mensonges.
- C'était que des mensonges ?
- C'était que des mensonges.
- L'expédition en ballon ?
- Mensonges !
L'île qui a la forme de son visage
au large de Dubai ?
- Mensonges !
- 3e au tournoi de laser quest ?
Non, ça, c'est vrai. J'y étais.
- T'es allée au Vatican ?
- Mensonges !
J'espère que t'es contente de toi.
- Comment ça ?
- Tu lui as brisé le coeur.
- Moi ?
- Toi.
Elle ne se fiera plus aux hommes.
C'est foutu pour Ted.
Et pour Julio Von Matterhorn,
le jumeau de Lorenzo.
Vous y croyez ?
Il dit que c'est de ma faute !
Et au fait, Ted,
elle veut toujours sortir avec toi.
Laisse-moi réfléchir. Ai-je envie
de sortir avec une conquête de Barney ?
On se fait un canon.
Jamais...
Ça doit t'ennuyer, non.
C'est sa vie.
Si elles sont assez stupides
pour le croire,
- tant pis.
- J'avoue !
Vous avez vu
celui qui s'appelle "SNASA" ?
Tu es astronaute ?
Je fais partie d'un programme spatial
gouvernemental top secret
appelé NASA Secrète
ou SNASA.
SNASA.
Tu vas sur la Lune ?
Pas celle que tu connais,
je suis allé sur...
la Slune.
La Slune.
Si tu craques pour celle-là,
tu me brises le coeur,
mais désolée, t'es un sconnard.
Et après ?
Tu viens de sortir
d'une relation honnête.
Tu es un grand garçon maintenant.
Tu dois arrêter
ces trucs bas de gamme.
Bas de gamme ?
Rien de tout ça n'est bas de gamme.
Sauf le "Bas De Gamme".
Je suis le bassiste
des "Bas de Gamme".
Et même que celui-là implique
de coûteuses extensions capillaires.
Si tu permets,
je dois me préparer pour ce soir.
Je vais jouer
le "Il Ne Viendra Pas".
Merci de demander.
<i>Pour faire le "Il Ne Viendra Pas",
voilà ce qu'il faut :</i>
<i>l'observatoire
de l'Empire State Building.</i>
<i>Tu y es ?</i>
<i>Bien.</i>
<i>Depuis des générations,
les New Yorkais utilisent cet endroit</i>
<i>pour les retrouvailles romantiques
avec leurs amants lointains.</i>
<i>Tout ce qu'il faut faire,
c'est aborder les filles en disant...</i>
Il ne viendra pas.
- De quoi parlez-vous ?
- Peu importe.
Il ne viendra pas.
Il ne viendra pas.
Elle ne viendra pas ?
Pardon.
<i>Jusqu'à ce que...</i>
Ah bon ?
Mais on était d'accord.
On a toujours dit
qu'on viendrait ici.
Cette nuit.
Je suis trop stupide.
Je vais chercher le journal.
- Va plutôt chercher un mari.
- Clair.
Arrêtez ça, sérieux.
Je ne recherche pas une relation.
En prenant le journal,
vérifie les annonces de mariage.
Pour le tien.
C'est comme ça.
Combien de fois
je suis allé au congélateur
chercher des gaufres
sans en trouver ?
- Des centaines ?
- Millions.
Mais quand je vais chercher
une glace...
Ou la télécommande, car on se dispute
et que Lily l'y a cachée...
Je trouve quoi ?
Des gaufres.
Ça marche comme ça.
Tu vas chercher le journal,
tu reviendras avec des gaufres.
Et dans ce cas,
les gaufres, c'est un mec.
Et aussi,
tu peux ramener des gaufres ?
Dans ce cas, les gaufres...
sont des gaufres.
Code rouge ! Urgence.
Confinement. Personne ne sort.
- Il se passe quoi ?
- J'ai essayé le "Il Ne Viendra Pas",
et ça a marché. Un triomphe.
Vous auriez dû voir cette fille.
Je m'en vais.
Chez moi, je vais dans ma chambre
pour allumer la caméra...
Pour allumer les bougies...
Et quand je ressors,
elle est partie,
tout comme le Manuel !
Je pense qu'on sait tous
qui est le coupable.
On le sait.
Al-Qaida.
Andouille.
C'était moi.
Espèce d'enfoiré.
Tu as volé le Manuel ?
La fille
de l'Empire State Building ?
Une copine actrice.
Une actrice.
Bien sûr.
Ça explique sa diction parfaite
malgré son côté cochonne.
Je suis à deux doigts
de prendre ce Manuel
et de le mettre sur internet
que le monde entier le voie.
- Tu ferais pas ça.
- Non,
tant que tu arrêtes les arnaques,
escroqueries, tours,
tromperies, baratins et stratagèmes.
- T'as laissé les feintes.
- Non plus !
Merde.
Je vous coupe, mais regardez.
On m'a quitté sur l'autel.
Mon Dieu, c'est horrible.
Ça marche ?
C'est pas le pire.
Vous avez vu
le "Mon Sexe Exauce Les Voeux" ?
Vraiment ?
- Un génie en sort ?
- Seulement si tu l'astiques assez.
Et après ?
Ça dit que ça commence à chanter
et que les objets dansent avec lui.
C'est mal pensé.
C'est pas "Mme Stinsfire".
Qu'est-il arrivé ?
Quelques heures plus tard...
Il va pleuvoir.
Si ça vous intéresse,
je serai au MacLaren's
en train de jouer un acte du Manuel
intitulé l' "Homme-Grenouille".
C'est tout.
C'est fini.
Je publie le Manuel sur internet.
Tu peux le publier ?
Bien sûr, mais écoute ça.
J'ai lu le Manuel
en long et en large.
Il n'y a pas d' "Homme-Grenouille".
Alors, vous voulez savoir
ce qu'est l' "Homme-Grenouille".
En fait,
c'était sur la dernière page
du Manuel,
mais je l'ai arrachée au cas où.
Pas de souci.
Vous allez le voir joué.
Vous voyez la blonde ?
Cible verrouillée.
- Ne fais pas ça.
- Lâche-moi la grappe, p'tite frappe.
C'est Robin qui devrait s'énerver.
Elle adore le Manuel.
J'aime pas le Manuel.
De quoi tu p...
Le Manuel, c'est de l'or.
Admets qu'il est exceptionnel.
Écoute, on vient de rompre.
Les déguisements sont mignons,
mais...
On vient de rompre.
Je savais pas que tu ressentais ça.
Je suppose
que j'étais tellement absorbé par...
Merde, elle nous regarde.
Vite, dispersion.
C'est fini.
T'as vu ce type
en tenue de plongée ?
Ce qui nous ramène à maintenant.
Attendez.
Pourquoi il porte ça ?
On sait pas.
Et ça nous bouffe, Claire.
Ça nous bouffe !
Demandons-lui.
C'est quoi, l' "Homme-Grenouille" ?
Voici Claire, au fait.
Lieutenant Frank Lyman.
J'entraîne des dauphins démineurs
pour les...
Vous savez quoi ?
Je peux pas le faire.
Je suis navré.
Cette rupture est plus dure
que ce que je pensais.
Le Manuel n'était qu'un moyen
de me vider l'esprit.
C'est bon.
Ça a été dur pour moi aussi.
Regarde-moi.
J'ai dit "non" aux relations.
- Elle va se marier.
- J'ai un speech à faire.
Je vais essayer mon smoking.
Je vais cogner vos têtes
l'une contre l'autre.
Je suis contente que t'arrêtes.
Et, honnêtement,
le vrai Barney est tellement mieux
que n'importe lequel des faux Barney
du Manuel.
C'est vrai ?
Claire, tu en as entendu beaucoup
sur le vrai Barney.
- Tu veux prendre un café ?
- Avant de le lui refuser,
tu devrais savoir
que sous ce costume en néoprène
avec ce qui ressemble
à des chaussettes à l'entrejambe...
- Un tube de Pringles, continue.
- ... se cache un mec super.
Il est sympa
et c'est un de mes meilleurs amis.
Il était avec cette bonnasse.
C'est un mec bien.
- Allez, sors avec lui.
- C'est qu'un café, non ?
OK, allons boire un café.
<i>Et à la fin de la soirée...</i>
Je suis fier.
S'exposer ainsi
demande un tas de Pringles.
J'ai un texto de Barney.
"Regarde sous la table."
C'est une page du Manuel.
Ça dit quoi ?
C'est l' "Homme-Grenouille".
<i>Un : parler du Manuel à une amie.</i>
<i>Deux : manipuler sa collègue,
qu'elle soit furieuse et le vole.</i>
<i>Trois :</i>
<i>mettre le costume de plongée
et lui parler de l' "Homme-Grenouille"</i>
<i>qui sera fait sur une fille, au pub.
L'amie, qu'on appellera Lily,</i>
<i>aborde la fille
et lui parle du Manuel.</i>
<i>Ça devient délicat quand elle demande
ce qu'est l' "Homme-Grenouille".</i>
<i>Enlever son masque, faire un speech
sur son insécurité profonde</i>
<i>qui n'existe pas,
parce qu'on déchire.</i>
<i>Lily se sent mal et t'encense
devant la fille qui accepte un café.</i>
<i>Et...</i>
<i>c'est...</i>
<i>parti.</i>
Espèce d'enfoiré.
Je t'appelle.
Pour ceux qui tiennent les comptes,
le "Ted Mosby" fonctionne.
C'est parti.
Tu veux pas de relation.
Mais l'amour de ta vie
s'apprête à entrer
et c'est...
ce mec.
- Je serai pas amoureuse de ce mec.
- Normal, parce que ça va être...
ce mec.
Je sais pas.
Le blazer bleu me fait rien...
T'as raison. C'est ce mec !
Donne-lui une chance.
Teste des petits bisous,
vois si y a quelque chose.
- Je vais travailler.
- C'est ça.
J'y vais vraiment.
- Va la travailler.
- <i>Et l'ironie, c'était que...</i>
Robin ?
- Don, le nouveau coprésentateur.
- <i>C'est là qu'elle a rencontré Don.</i>
Maudit sois-tu, Marshall.
<i>Kids, the secret to dating
is very simple:</i>
<i>be confident, be comfortable
in your skin,</i>
<i>be assured of who you are.</i>
<i>Barney was really good
at that last one,</i>
<i>even though a lot of the time
who he was was someone else.</i>
Hi. Do you see that guy
over there in the scuba suit?
You thinking of going
and talking to him?
Good. He's seriously the biggest jerk
on the face of the earth.
- How do you know him?
- He's one of my best friends.
- So what's with the scuba suit?
- Well, it's a long story.
He just went through a breakup...
<i>There's two basic philosophies of

<i>Some people throw themselves into...</i>
My career. That's my number one
focus right now.
From now on, no more dating.
Just work.

That's right, Barney Stinson
is back on the market.
Mothers, lock up your daughters.
Daughters, lock up your milswancas.
- Milswancas?
- Wait, I can get this.
Mothers I'd like to sleep with
and never call again.
Correct!
Circle gets the square.
Don't you think you're kinda
rushing back into this?
Lily, since I started dating
Robin, there's a certain
thing haven't used as much
as I would like to.
It's... Kinda big,
surprisingly heavy,
kind of leathery, and it's black.
This, my friends...
Is the Playbook.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-
.:: La Fabrique ::.
The Playbook contains
every scam, con, hustle,
hoodwink, gambit, flimflam,
stratagem and bamboozle
I've ever used...
or ever hope to use...
To pick up chicks
and give them the business.
You wrote another book?
We got a... Stephen King over here.
It's all in here.
Everything from basic moves like
"the don't drink that."

Don't drink that.
I saw some guy slip something in there.
What? Who?
That guy.
Thank you.
To more advanced maneuvers
like "the Mrs. Stinsfire."

Now kappas, after our
disciplinary hearing
for lewd behavior last semester,
we have been assigned
a new housemom.
I'd like you to meet mrs. Stinsfire.
Hello, girls!
I can't picture a way
that wouldn't work.
What's "the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn"?
I'm glad you asked.
"the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn" will be
my grand return to the stage.
Or you know, the bed.
Actually, my bed
is kind of on a stage.
I put a platform
and got some lights.
It's a real production.
Barney exits!
How about you?
You getting back out there?
- Where is your Playbook?
- My Playbook?
Bro, two-volume set, right here.
- It's a great read actually.
- Yeah, I'm reading it right now.
I told you,
I'm taking a break from all that.
- Marshall, it's totally gonna happen.
- So gonna happen.
- What?
- You're gonna fall in love.
So soon.
Not likely.
I'm focusing on my career.
- I'm done with dating.
- Okay, we playing the pyramid?
"Things people say right before
they meet the love of their life."
Kelly Harris, girl I went
to law school with said...
Law school's so hard,
I just want to focus on my studies.
Six months later?
Married!
That's all w...
Travis Frenchroy, backup
bartender tells me...
I'm so over the whole dating game.
I just want to focus
on my <i>Star Trek </i>fan fiction.
Six months later...
Married!
May I respond?
That's all well and good for...
Matthew Blitz,
accountant at my office says...
I'm gonna die single and alone.
I might as well just focus
on this year's taxes.
Six months later?
City union and planning to get married
pending the passage of legislation
currently on the floor of the NY
sate senate.
Protest all you want,
but it's gonna happen.
- It's a law of nature.
- Lawyered. Of nature.
I'd love to have
no interest in a relationship.
There's no way I'd be single right now
if I wanted to be single.
- Okay, now you're ready.
- Ready for what?
Three years ago, this girl Shelly
started teaching at my school.
The moment I saw her, I was like,
"this is the girl for Ted."
Why am I just hearing about her now?
You know, I usually
hate being set up
but this Ted just sounds so great.
He is. He's so sweet and thoughtful
and intelligent.
Come on! One more chicken finger
and the crown is yours!
I don't see him anywhere.
He must be out doing charity work.
So, different bar?
That girl with Lily's pretty cute!
Yeah, she was cute.
Yeah, still is.
And now you're ready.
Bro, now you can fit like, three times
as many chicken fingers in your mouth.
- You know it.
- OK, I will set it up,
but promise me you won't
do anything stupid.
I promise I won't do
anything stupid.
<i>And I kept that promise.</i>
<i>But only because...</i>
<i>She never showed up.</i>
- I know. I'm sorry, I feel terrible.
- You should feel terrible!
- I do feel terrible! I do!
- You should!
- I do, I do!
- You should! You should!
I don't.
Look, I was really
looking forward to meeting Ted,
but I got to the bar an hour early
and I met this amazing guy.
Like, seriously amazing.
And you met him at Maclaren's?
- Yeah, right at the bar.
- What's his name?
I shouldn't say.
What the heck.
It's Lorenzo Von Matterhorn!
You son of a bitch.
So, he hooked up with Shelly?
You must've been pissed.
Damn straight.
Barney, I've had Shelly
set aside for Ted for three years.
Dude, Ted was not missing out.
She's brainy and annoying,
kind of boring in the sack.
I guess she would've
been perfect for Ted.
Had I known that
she was there to meet Ted,
of course I wouldn't have done it,
but...
Given the circumstances,
I think Ted'll be proud of me.
I pulled off
"the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn."
Okay, what's the
Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?
My question exactly.
- What's the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?
- Glad you asked.

To perform the
Lorenzo Von Matterhorn,
here's what you'll need:
basic knowledge of web site design
and a very unique fake name.
So, think of your fake name
right now.
Have you got it? Good.
Now, select your target.
Preferably a girl
with a real nice...
Phone.
Yeah, it's me.
Do I know you?
I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
Are you, like, famous or something?
You really don't know
who I am, do you?
What a refreshing change of pace.
Nice to meet you...
Once again,
I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
Spelled like it sounds, two "t"s.
Ciao.
Then, as soon as you're gone,
she gets out her phone
and does an internet search
for Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
And that's when she discovers...
A series of fake web sites,
all devoted to the incredible life
of Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
There's the fake business article
about him, the reclusive billionaire.
The fake explorers club
newsletter describing
his balloon trek to the north pole as
a feat of pure daring and imagination.
The fake medical journal featuring
the heartbreaking story of doctors
telling him penis reduction surgery
isn't an option.
And by the time you get back...
Hi, Shelly, I hate to be forward,
but can I buy you a cup of coffee?
Please.
What does coffee go
for these days, $50?
And it is on.
That's awful.
You realize you broke
her heart, right?
She's inconsolable.
Why would she be inconsolable?
Lorenzo's balloon won't disappear
over the arctic for another week.
She would be upset only if someone
told her it was a bunch of lies.
- It was all just a bunch of lies?
- It was all just a bunch of lies.
- The balloon expedition?
- Lies!
The man-made island shaped
like his face off the coast of Dubai?
- Lies!
- Finishing 3 in laser tag competion?
Li... actually, that one's true.
I went to that.
- You went to the Vatican?
- Lies!
Oh, my god!
Well, I hope
you're happy with yourself.
- What?
- You broke that girl's heart.
- Me?
- You!
She'll probably never
trust a guy again.
You ruined her for Ted.
Not to mention Julio Von Matterhorn,
Lorenzo's twin brother.
Can you believe that?
He blames me!
And by the way, Ted,
I bet she'd still go out with you.
Let me think. Do I want to go out with
a girl Barney hooked up with?
Guys, help me out with
the harmonies.
- Hell no...
- Hell no...
You must be a
little bothered by this.
It's his life.
If these girls are dumb
enough to fall for this crap,
- they have it coming.
- Agreed.
Have you seen
the one in there labeled "the SNASA"?
You're an astronaut?
I'm actually
in a top secret government space program
called secret NASA
or SNASA.
SNASA.
Do you go to the moon?
Well, not the moon you're familiar with,
though I have been to the...
smoon.
The smoon.
If you fall for that one,
my heart breaks for you,
but I'm sorry, you're a smoron.
So, what happens next?
Well...
Come on, Barney, you just...
You just got out
of an honest to God relationship.
You're a real boy now.
You can't go back
to these cheap tricks.
Cheap tricks?!
Not one of these is a cheap trick.
Except for "the Cheap Trick".
I'm the bass player for Cheap Trick.
And even that one involves
expensive hair extensions.
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm off to prepare
for tonight's main event.
I will be performing
"the he's not coming".
Glad you asked.
<i>To perform "the he's not coming",
here's what you'll need,</i>
<i>the observation deck
of the Empire State Building.</i>
<i>Are you up there?</i>
<i>Good.</i>
<i>For generations, this has been
the spot New Yorkers have chosen</i>
<i>for their romantic reunions
with long-estranged lovers,</i>
<i>so all you have to do is walk up
to every girl you see and say...</i>
He's not coming.
- What are you talking about?
- Never mind.
He's not coming.
He's not coming.
She's not coming?
Sorry.
<i>Until sooner or later...</i>
He's not coming.
He's not?
But we agreed.
We always said we'd meet here.
On this night.
I'm such a fool.
I'm going to go get the paper.
- More like, go get a husband.
- Totally.
You guys need to stop that,
seriously.
The last thing I am looking
for right now is a relationship.
When you pick up newspaper, be sure
to check the wedding announcements.
For yours.
Robin, it's like this.
Do you have any idea
how many times I've gone to the freezer
looking for frozen waffles
and not found them?
- Thousands?
- Millions.
But when I go to the freezer
looking for a popsicle...
Or the remote control
because we are having a fight
and she's hidden it there...
You know what I find?
Frozen waffles.
That's how it works.
You go out there looking for a paper,
you're coming back with frozen waffles.
And, in this case,
frozen waffles is a guy.
Also,
could you pick up
some frozen waffles?
In that case, frozen waffles...
are frozen waffles.
Guys, code red!
Emergency.
Lockdown.
Nobody's leaving.
- What happened?
- I tried the "he's not coming",
and it worked.
Gangbusters.
You should have seen this girl.
I'm leaving.
We get up to my place, and I go
into my room to set up the camera...
To light the candles...
And when I come out,
she's gone, and so is the playbook!
I think we all know
who is responsible for this.
We do.
Al-Qaeda.
You idiot.
It was me.
You son of a bitch.
You stole the playbook?
So,
the girl on the Empire State Building?
A friend of mine, an actress.
An actress.
Of course.
That explains her impeccable diction
and her sluttiness.
Barney, I've got half a mind
to take that playbook
and put it up on the internet
for the whole world to see.
- You wouldn't.
- I won't,
as long as you agree
to no more scams,
no more cons, no more hustles,
no more hoodwinks,
no more gambits, no more stratagems
and no more bamboozles.
- I notice you left out flimflams.
- No flimflams!
Damn it.
My God.
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but look at this.
I got left at the altar.
My god, that's horrible.
I wonder if that would work.
That's not even
the worst one in here.
Have you guys seen
"my penis grants wishes"?
Really?
- A genie comes out of it?
- Only if you rub it hard enough.
- So, then, what happened?
- It says here he breaks into song,
and then the furniture comes to life
and dances with him.
It's not very well thought out.
It's no "Mrs. Stinsfire".
What happened in real life?
Well, a few hours later...
I heard it was gonna rain.
If anyone's interested,
I will be at MacLaren's pub
performing a play out of the Playbook
entitled "The Scuba Diver".
That is all.
That's it.
I'm putting the Playbook up
on the internet.
Can you put the Playbook
up on the internet?
Of course, baby,
but here's the weird thing.
I have literally been through this book
cover to cover.
There is no play
called "The Scuba Diver".
So, now you guys want to know
what "The Scuba Diver" is.
Well,
it was on the last page
of the Playbook,
but I ripped it out just in case.
Don't worry.
You're about to see it in action.
See this blond?
Tizzarget acquizzired.
- Barney, don't do this.
- Give it a rest, pest.
If anyone should be mad,
should be Robin.
- She loves the Playbook.
- I don't love the Playbook.
What are you talk...
The Playbook, it's gold.
You gotta admit it's spectacular.
Look, Barney, we just broke up.
I mean, the costumes are cute but...
We just broke up.
I didn't know you felt that way.
I guess I've been so wrapped up
in my own stuff that I...
Crap, she's looking over here.
Quick, everyone, scatter.
That's it.
You see that guy over there
in the scuba suit?
And that brings us to right now.
But... Wait.
So, why is he wearing scuba gear?
We don't know.
And it's killing us, Claire.
It's killing us!
Let's go ask him.
So, what's "The Scuba Diver"?
And this is Claire, by the way.
I'm Lieutenant Frank Lyman.
I train bomb sniffing dolphins
for the balt...
You know what?
I can't do this.
I am so sorry.
This breakup's been tougher on me
than I thought.
This Playbook was just a way
to take my mind off of things.
It's okay.
It's been tough on me, too.
I mean, look at me.
I've sworn off relationships.
- She getting married.
- Gotta work on my toast.
Gotta make sure my tux fits.
I will bang your heads together
like coconuts.
I'm so glad you're stopping this.
And, frankly,
the real Barney is way cooler
than any of the fake Barneys
in this Playbook.
Is that right?
Claire, you've probably heard a lot
about the real Barney tonight.
- Want to grab a cup of coffee?
- Claire, before you turn him down,
I think you should know
that under this neoprene suit
with what appears to be a tube sock
stuffed in the crotch...
- Can of Pringles, but go on.
- ... is an amazing guy.
He's fun and one of my best friends.
And he landed this hottie.
He's a good guy.
- Come on, go out with him.
- It's just a cup of coffee, right?
All right. Let's get some coffee.
And by the end of the night...
I'm proud of him.
To be that vulnerable
takes a lot of Pringles.
I got a text from Barney.
"Look under the table."
It's a page from the Playbook.
What does it say?
It's "The Scuba Diver".
<i>One: tell a meddlesome female friend
about the Playbook.</i>
<i>Two: run a play on one of her coworkers,
making her so angry she steals it.</i>
<i>Three:</i>
<i>put on the scuba suit and tell her
you gonna do "The Scuba Diver"</i>
<i>on the hot girl standing by the bar.
Your friend, let's call her Lily...</i>
<i>talks to the girl
and tells her everything about the book.</i>
<i>Here's where it gets tricky.
When they ask what "The Scuba Diver" is,</i>
<i>take off your mask, give them spiel
about your deep-seated insecurities</i>
<i>which don't exist,
because you're awesome.</i>
<i>Then, Lily talks you up to the girl
who agrees to go get coffee with you.</i>
<i>And it...</i>
<i>is...</i>
<i>on.</i>
You son of a bitch.
I'll give you a call.
All right. Bye-bye.
For those of you keeping score,
"The Ted Mosby" works.
Here we go.
You say you don't want a relationship.
The love of your life
is about to walk through the door
and it's...
that guy.
- I'm not falling in love with that guy.
- Right, because it's going to be...
That guy.
I don't know. The blue blazer's
just not doing it for me...
You're right, It's that guy!
You should give her a chance.
Make out with her a little,
see if there's something there.
- I'm going to work.
- Yeah, you are.
I'm actually gonna work.
- Go, work it.
- <i>And the ironic part was...</i>
Robin?
- Don, your new cohost.
- <i>That was the day she met Don.</i>
Damn it, Marshall.
<i>En novembre 2009,</i>
<i>Marshall et Lily ont organisé
leur 1er Thanksgiving chez eux.</i>
<i>Marshall avait trouvé
la dinde parfaite.</i>
Bébé, elle est magnifique.
Elle fait 11 kg, elle est bio.
Tu vois mon oncle chauve, Heinrek ?
On dirait sa tęte.
Ma dinde !
<i>Alors quand on est arrivés,
Marshall était assez déprimé.</i>
On a la dinde.
Vous avez la pathétique
dinde de secours.
Pourquoi j'ai pas écouté
la voix préenregistrée
de l'ex-maire Ed Koch qui dit
de ne pas oublier ses affaires.
- Tu comprends pas.
- On est allés aux objets trouvés,
et lŕ, dans leur frigo...
C'est ta dinde ?
C'est ma dinde !
Viens lŕ,
magnifique petite enfoirée !
Je vais la mettre au four.
Vous ętes les meilleurs !
C'était un travail d'équipe.
Je sais pas quoi dire.
C'est Thanksgiving,
mais un merci ne suffit pas.
T'aurais fait la męme chose
pour nous.
Oui, et vous savez pourquoi ?
Car je vous aime.
Je vais vous montrer ŕ quel point.
Je vous lčgue
la quatričme baffe.
Quoi ?
<i>Les enfants,
vous vous souvenez du pari-baffe.</i>
Quand Barney a perdu, Marshall
a gagné le droit de le gifler 5 fois
aussi fort qu'il le peut.
Il en a déjŕ utilisé trois.
La troisičme baffe datant
d'exactement 2 ans auparavant,
le jour de Thanksgiving 2007.
Un jour dont l'Histoire se souvient
sous le nom de Baffegiving.
- Tu veux dire...
- On pense ŕ la męme chose ?
Probablement pas.
Sauf si vous pensez
ŕ "Baffegiving 2 :
la revanche des Gifles",
et dans ce cas, oui,
c'est exactement ma pensée !
Impossible !
- Les baffes sont intransférables.
- Lily est l'arbitre.
Transférables.
Tu réalises
qu'il ne t'en restera qu'une ?
Tu veux vraiment
l'utiliser aujourd'hui ?
La vie est courte.
J'ai pensé <i>Baffe Diem</i>.
Rčgle une :
la baffe sera donnée avant la nuit,
pour pas gęner le repas de Lily.
Deux : vous devez décider
qui va la donner.
Trois :
on attachera Barney ŕ cette chaise,
maintenant rebaptisée
"Trône ŕ baffes".
- Ça vous va ?
- Parfait.
Pas du tout !
<i>Ça allait ętre
le meilleur des Thanksgiving.</i>
<i>Jusquŕ...</i>
On attend quelqu'un d'autre ?
<i>C'était quelqu'un
que Lily n'avait pas vu depuis 3 ans.</i>
Papa.
-Titou-, H3AV3N, ZeK, HelenScott,
Tactactac, ShalimarFox
.:: La Fabrique ::.
<i>Lily et son pčre ont toujours eu
des relations compliquées.</i>
<i>Mickey ręvait d'inventer
le futur jeu de société ŕ succčs.</i>
<i>Mais ses idées étaient bizarres.</i>
Papa ?
Tu as raté mon récital de danse.
Oui, mais regarde.
Je viens de terminer
mon nouveau jeu de société :
"Prince de Tijuana".
T'as raté mon gala de gym.
Mais ça, c'est le bon.
"Batterie de voiture :
combien de temps tiendras-tu ?"
Tiens.
J'ai fait un cauchemar.
Viens jouer au nouveau jeu de papa :
"Le clown démoniaque
est sous le lit".
<i>Mickey a toujours déçu Lily.</i>
<i>Elle faisait avec,</i>
<i>jusqu'ŕ ce qu'un jour, en 2006,</i>
<i>quand elle visita ses grand-parents.</i>
Alors, Rita, pas trop excitée
de déménager en Floride ?
Il y a eu un petit changement.
On reste ici pour l'instant.
On a un léger souci financier.
La paille s'est cassée.
- Quelle agréable surprise !
- Et ton appartement ?
J'ai eu une dispute avec mon coloc.
- Il s'est passé quoi ?
- Il voulait un loyer.
Ça a mal fini.
Tu devrais payer un loyer,
pas vivre dans la cave de tes parents.
C'est pas mon premier choix.
Avec les vieux schnoques lŕ-haut,
mon style s'en ressent.
Ils savent pas ce que veut dire
la "chaussette sur la poignée".
- Ils t'ont surpris avec une fille ?
- Si on veut.
Je vais au boulot.
- T'es ŕ la retraite.
- Avec une bouche en plus ŕ nourrir,
j'ai dű retourner ŕ l'aciérie.
Oů est mon bandage herniaire ?
Non seulement tu les empęches
de déménager en Floride,
mais en plus,
tu renvoies grand-pčre travailler ?
Jusqu'ŕ ce que les jeux Aldrin
soient scotchés
par ma nouvelle bombe :
"Organisateur de combat canin ".
<i>Lily a regardé son pčre d'une façon
que Marshall avait rarement vu.</i>
<i>Un regard que nous espérons
ne jamais recevoir.</i>
<i>Le regard "Tu es mort pour moi".</i>
<i>Ce qui nous ramčne
au Thanksgiving de l'année 2009.</i>
J'ai apporté "Maladies".
- Pourquoi il est lŕ ?
- Je sais pas, mais laissons-le entrer.
Je veux pas le voir.
Fais-le partir.
Attends un peu, on va arranger ça.
Prends ton temps, <i>amigo</i>.
Je vais bien tant que j'ai Maladies.
La maladie de Parkinfun.
- J'espčre que Lily va bien.
- Moi aussi.
Elle en parle pas beaucoup,
mais c'est trčs douloureux pour elle.
Dites-moi lequel va me gifler.
- Quoi ?
- Ça me rend dingue !
Ted attrape des chips, je cligne.
Robin se recoiffe, je cligne.
Cligner autant
est mauvais pour ma peau.
J'ai des pattes d'oie.
Des pattes d'oie !
Lily, ça fait trois ans.
C'est assez long, non ?
L'avoir dans ma vie
ne fait que me stresser.
C'est plus facile pour lui
qu'il soit "mort pour moi".
Je t'ai supporté quand notre voisin,
M. Ossias, était "mort pour toi".
- C'est notre journal.
- Vous l'aurez dans 15 minutes.
Comptez 20,
j'ai mangé un steak hier.
Aussi quand ta demoiselle d'honneur,
Whitney, était "morte pour toi".
T'es sublime !
Ta robe est superbe !
Merci.
Je préfčre avec des bretelles.
J'ai męme compris
quand M. Park était "mort pour toi".
Un café.
Mais que si vous avez du déca.
Faut que je dorme cette nuit.
1,50 $.
- Un café normal.
- 1,50 $.
Le mien est bien un déca ?
Vous avez utilisé la męme cafetičre.
Je lui a menti.
Espčce d'enfoiré.
C'était pas un déca !
Je t'ai soutenue
contre tous ces gens,
mais lŕ, c'est ton pčre.
On peut pas lui donner
un peu de dinde ?
Je peux pas lui demander de partir
pour Thanksgiving.
Tu n'as pas ŕ demander.
Dis-lui que c'est trčs important
qu'il soit lŕ.
Et avant que tu t'en rendes compte,
il sera ŕ un salon du jeu ŕ Toledo,
donnant l'argent de ton dentiste
ŕ un gars qui dit ętre Milton Bradley.
Il essayait de subvenir
aux besoins de la famille.
Non, ma mčre le faisait,
en cumulant deux boulots.
Cet homme m'a brisé le coeur
chaque jour pendant 20 ans.
On lui donnera un bout un peu brűlé.
Sérieusement, Robin,
c'est ŕ toi de le gifler.
Tu gifles super bien.
En fait, j'ai envie
que tu m'enseignes comment gifler.
Je veux avoir mon gifl-ôme.
Ne te sous-estime pas.
T'es une rock star de la baffe.
Tu aurais dű t'appeler
El-gifle Presley.
C'est de la torture.
Mettez-moi sur la chaise...
- Trône ŕ baffes.
- Et finissez-en !
- Il est tout ŕ toi.
- Non, j'insiste.
- Je vais le faire.
- Attends, quoi ?
Le gifler.
Fin de la discussion et c'est tout ?
Tu l'as dit.
J'étais juste poli.
Si quelqu'un doit le gifler,
ça doit ętre moi.
Je crois pas.
C'est intéressant.
Il est de la famille.
Je suis désolé,
mais on n'oublie pas la famille.
C'est facile ŕ dire
quand tu viens de la famille
la plus ridiculement proche du monde.
On est pas ridiculement proches.
Ah bon ?
Et le dîner familial
chaque dimanche ?
Tout semble délicieux,
maman Eriksen.
Merci, papa Ours.
Tu dis les grâces ?
<i>J'en serais enchanté, mčre.</i>
<i>Joignez vos mains.</i>
<i>Seigneur...</i>
Pardonne-moi, mais c'est bizarre.
Une famille doit ętre unie.
J'aimerais que la nôtre le soit aussi.
Y compris ton pčre.
J'y crois pas
que tu sois de son côté.
Laisse-moi ętre claire.
Cet homme ne passera jamais
le seuil de cette maison, jamais !
Ça prendra encore cinq minutes.
Je l'espčre, <i>amigo</i>.
Je suis en train de perdre
contre les hémorroďdes.
Une des maladies ?
Il reste une heure avant la nuit,
oů aucun de nous deux
ne pourra plus le gifler.
Laisse-le-moi.
C'est moi qui ai pensé ŕ appeler
les objets trouvés.
C'est pas faux.
Ta réponse ?
- J'ai filé un billet de 20 au mec !
- Devinette philosophique.
Idée contre action.
Débattez longuement.
- J'ai porté cette énorme dinde.
- J'ai payé le taxi.
T'as couché avec un de mes potes !
Quoi ?
- T'as dit que tu t'en fichais.
- J'ai menti !
Pourquoi t'as rien dit ?
Parce que je t'aime !
Tu as tellement envie de le gifler
que tu mentirais
sur le fait de m'aimer ?
J'en ai grave envie !
Ton pčre a merdé ŕ un moment,
mais il a changé.
Il habite plus chez tes grands-parents.
Il a un travail.
- Il rčgle ses dettes fiscales.
- Comment tu sais ça ?
Les signaux.
On a pris un verre
la semaine derničre.
Elle me manque.
Ma princesse.
Elle parle de moi ?
Sans arręt.
Elle raconte
cette histoire super mignonne...
- Donc jamais ?
- Pas un mot.
Ça peut changer.
Ça peut s'arranger, non ?
J'ai toujours cru
que ça s'arrangerait au mariage.
J'ai męme écrit un discours.
Mais pas d'invitation.
J'ai męme pas vu de photo.
<i>Et lŕ, sous mes yeux,</i>
<i>ton pčre a fondu en larmes.</i>
C'est décidé !
Vous venez ŕ Thanksgiving !
Tu l'as invité ?
Il chialait.
J'étais censé faire quoi ?
Et un connard
l'a traité de chochotte,
j'ai trouvé que c'était pas mérité.
J'y crois pas.
Tu t'es pris pour qui ?
Nous sommes mariés.
Il fait partie de ma famille.
Entre.
Ted, tu devrais te dépęcher.
Ta vésicule biliaire va péter.
Mickey, ça fait une demi-heure.
On devrait aller la chercher.
Elle a juste besoin d'un peu d'air.
Finissons la partie.
Faites un autre tour.
Le premier ŕ 7 !
Bon sang !
Je le connais depuis plus longtemps.
Je la mérite.
Elle est ŕ moi, Mosby.
Je l'ai jamais claqué Barney...
au-dessus de la ceinture.
- J'ai toujours eu envie de le gifler.
- Tu penses que moi, non ?
Minute !
Cette baffe était censée
ętre merveilleux cadeau...
Elle nous divise.
Mon Dieu, tu as raison.
Ce fruit si pur s'est changé
en une torgnpomme empoisonnée.
Tu sais quoi ?
Tu peux l'avoir.
T'es sűre ?
Claqbsolument.
On devrait chercher Lily.
La vésicule biliaire va péter.
C'est décidé. Barney, allez.
Sur le trône.
Allez.
Je suppose que c'est...
la meilleure décision.
En fait...
Les hommes ont plus de force.
Ne l'écoute pas.
C'est décidé.
Et c'est ce que t'as
toujours voulu, non ?
Un homme fort
pour prendre soin de toi ?
Évidemment.
Petite, t'étais une dure.
Ŕ jouer au hockey avec les mecs,
t'abîmant les genoux sur la glace.
Mais ce que t'arrivais pas
ŕ leur dire...
Ce que tu pouvais męme pas
t'avouer...
c'est que ce dont tu ręvais...
c'était cette jolie robe blanche...
dans cette belle église.
Et au bout de l'allée centrale,
envahie de jolies fleurs blanches,
un homme pour s'occuper
de tes baffes pour toi.
Laisse-le-moi !
- Qu'est-ce qu'il s'est passé ?
- Ta vésicule biliaire a éclaté.
Tu recules de trois cases.
Tu viens ici,
tu regardes ta fille partir
et tu t'en fiches.
Tu as détruit
le repas de Thanksgiving !
Lily y a passé la journée !
Mollo. C'est pas de la vraie bile.
Juste de la peinture de Chine.
Et de la bile de cheval.
<i>Ŕ cet instant,</i>
<i>Marshall jeta un regard ŕ Mickey
qu'on n'avait jamais vu.</i>
- Qu'est-ce qu'il fait ?
- T'as avalé de la peinture ?
C'est mon regard de la mort.
Celui de Lily est meilleur...
Sors de chez moi !
Chez M. Park ?
Je pensais pas te trouver lŕ.
Désolé.
Écoute.
Je pensais
que la famille était un droit.
Mais non, c'est un privilčge
qui doit ętre mérité.
J'ai viré ton pčre.
Et je te le promets,
je ne l'inviterai plus jamais.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Je suis venue lŕ
parce qu'il faisait froid
et que c'était
le seul endroit ouvert.
Je comptais ignorer M. Park.
Et j'ai découvert...
que M. Park est mort.
Il est vraiment mort !
Je me suis jamais
réconciliée avec lui,
un type qui comptait pas pour moi...
On doit aller voir mon pčre.
<i>C'est comme ça
qu'ŕ Thanksgiving 2009,</i>
<i>tante Lily a fait un miracle.</i>
<i>Elle a ramené un homme ŕ la vie.</i>
Votre attention.
Avant de commencer, Barney,
si tu veux bien t'asseoir
sur le trône ŕ baffes.
Mme l'arbitre,
m'attacher ŕ une chaise est...
Moins de blabla, plus de baffes.
Il reste deux minutes avant la nuit.
Vous vous ętes décidés ?
Qui va lui offrir une belle baffe ?
Ted.
Pourquoi moi ?
L'an dernier,
tu t'es fait larguer devant l'autel.
Tu as perdu ton boulot.
Mais t'as bien remonté la pente.
Je suis fičre de toi.
Tu as mérité de claquer quelqu'un
de toute ta force.
Merci.
C'est le pire.
Maman !
Tu viens de rompre...
Męme si je sais
que vous ętes en bons termes...
tu es sűre qu'au fond de toi,
tu veux pas lui mettre une baffe ?
Si.
Je le savais.
C'est l'Enfer, ici.
Trčs bien.
Ça fait mal !
Je peux pas.
Je peux pas t'en priver.
Moi non plus.
Dieu merci.
J'aimerais faire un geste.
Pas question !
Je suis contente
que ça s'arrange entre vous et Lily.
Et pour vous accueillir
dans notre famille...
j'aimerais vous offrir cette claque.
Sérieux ?
C'est un peu bizarre.
Je viens de rencontrer Barney,
je n'ai rien contre lui, mais...
Combien de fois a-t-on l'occasion
de mettre une claque ŕ quelqu'un ?
Doucement !
Désolé, j'y arrive pas.
Dieu merci.
Je sais que je n'ai pas été
un bon pčre.
C'est pas vrai.
Pour tous les ballets manqués,
les expositions
oů j'aurais dű venir...
le cadeau de mariage
que je t'ai jamais offert...
Je t'offre cette...
baffe.
C'est l'arbitre.
Elle est censée ętre impartiale.
L'arbitre dit que c'est d'accord.
C'est pas bon.
Pitié.
Laisse-moi...
Ferme les yeux.
Ce sera bientôt fini.
Je gambade dans les prés.
J'y arrive pas.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que...
cette baffe a eu le but escompté.
Elle nous a rapprochés.
Et ça nous a forcés ŕ reconnaître,
la fragilité et la grandeur
en nous-męme
et en chacun.
Pitié.
Et c'est pour cela...
qu'il n'y aura pas de baffe
aujourd'hui.
C'est le meilleur Thanksgiving...
Et de quatre !
De la dinde ?

<i>In November 2009,</i>
<i>Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily
hosted the first Thanksgiving.</i>
<i>Marshall had found
the perfect turkey.</i>
Baby, it is beautiful.
It's 22 pounds.
It's organic.
Remember my bald Uncle Heinrek?
It looks exactly like his head.
My turkey...
<i>So, when we showed up for the big day,
Marshall was pretty bummed out.</i>
Well, we got the turkey.
You didn't.
You got the pathetic replacement turkey.
Damn it, why didn't I listen
to the precorded voice
of former mayor Ed Koch
reminding me to take my belongings?
- You don't understand.
- We went to the port authority,
and there,
sitting in their fridge...
Is this your turkey?
That's my turkey!
Come here,
you handsome little bastard!
I'm gonna go put this in the oven.
You are the best friends ever!
It was totally a team effort.
I don't know what to say.
It's Thanksgiving,
but thanks doesn't seem like enough.
You would've done
the same thing for us.
I would, and you know why?
Because I love you.
I'm going to show you just how much.
I bequeath unto you
the fourth slap.
What?
<i>Kids, you remember
Barney and Marshall's "slap bet".</i>
When Barney lost, Marshall won the right
to slap Barney five times
as hard as he could.
So far, he'd used three slaps.
With the third being doled out
exactly two years earlier
on Thanksgiving day 2007.
A day that history came to know
as "Slapsgiving".
- Are you saying...
- What we think you're saying?
Probably not.
Unless you think I'm saying
"Slapsgiving two:
revenge of the slap",
in which case, yes,
that's exactly what I'm saying!
No way!
- Slaps aren't transferable.
- Lily is the slap bet commissioner.
Slaps are transferable.
You realize you'll only have
one left after this.
Are you sure
you want to spend this slap today?
Life is short.
I figured, <i>Slap-e Diem</i>.
Rule number one:
the slap must occur before sundown,
so as not to interfere
with Lily's meal.
Two, you have to decide
who gets to do it.
Three...
We're going to tie barney to this chair,
which shall henceforth be referred
to as the slapping throne.
Sound fair?
- Totally.
- Absolutely not!
<i>It was all set to be
the best Thanksgiving ever.</i>
<i>Until...</i>
Are we expecting somebody else?
<i>It was someone Lily hadn't seen
or spoken to in three years.</i>
Dad.
Synchro : -Titou-
.:: La Fabrique ::.
<i>Now, Lily and her dad, Mickey,
had always had a tough relationship.</i>
<i>Mickey's dream was to invent
the next great American board game.</i>
<i>But his ideas were a little off.</i>
Daddy?
You missed my ballet recital.
Yes, but, look!
I just put the finishing touches
on my new, hit board game,
"Tijuana Slumlord".
You missed my gymnastics meet.
But this is the one!
"Car Battery:
"how long can you hold on?"
Grab these.
I had a nightmare.
Here, come play daddy's new game:
"There's a clown demon
under the bed!"
Her whole life,
Mickey disappointed Lily.
<i>And she put up with it,</i>
<i>until one day in 2006</i>
<i>when Lily went to visit
her grandparents.</i>
So, Rita, are you excited
about the big move to Florida?
Actually, slight change of plans.
We're staying here
for the time being.
We had a slight financial hiccup.
The straw to my juice box broke!
- What a pleasant surprise.
- What happened to your apartment?
I had a little falling out
with my roommate.
- What happened?
- He wanted me to pay rent.
Got kind of ugly.
You should be paying rent,
not living in your parents' basement.
It's not my first choice.
Having the old farts right upstairs
is crimpin' my style a bit.
Clearly, they're not getting
the whole "sock on the doorknob" thing.
- They caught you with a girl?
- In a way.
I'm off to work.
- You're retired.
- Now I have an extra mouth to feed,
I had to go back to the steel mill.
Where's my truss?
So, not only did you stop them
from moving to Florida,
but now you forced Grandpa
to go back to work?
Just until I get Aldrin Games
unlimited off the ground
with my new sensation:
"Dog Fight Promoter".
<i>Lily gave her dad a look that Marshall
had only seen a few times before.</i>
A look we all prayed never to be
on the receiving end of:
her "you're dead to me" look.
Which brings us
back to Thanksgiving of 2009.
I brought "Diseases"!
- Why is he here?
- Dunno.
But we should let him in
and find out.
No, I don't want to see him!
Get rid of him!
Just hang tight, okay?
We'll, we'll work this out.
Take your time, <i>amigo</i>.
I'm okay as long as I have "diseases"!
The fun's infectious.
- God, I hope Lily's okay.
- Me, too.
She doesn't talk about it much,
but this thing causes her a lot of pain.
Just tell me which one of you
is gonna slap me!
- What?
- I'm dying over here!
Ted reaches for a chip, I flinch!
Robin fixes her hair, I flinch!
I'm doing so much flinching.
It's bad for my skin.
I'm getting crow's feet.
Crow's feet!
Lily, it's been three years, okay?
That's long enough.
Having him in my life
causes me nothing but stress.
It's just easier for him
to be dead to me.
I supported you when our neighbor,
Mr. Ossias, was "dead to you".
- That's our newspaper.
- You'll get it back in 15 minutes.
Make it 20.
I had a steak last night.
And I was fine when your bridesmaid,
Whitney, was "dead to you".
You look so amazing!
That dress is gorgeous!
Thanks, guys.
I'm just not a fan of strapless.
I even understood when Mr. Park
was "dead to you."
One coffee, please.
But only if you have decaf.
I don't want to be up all night.
Dollar fifty.
- Coffee, regular.
- Dollar fifty.
Excuse me.
Are you sure mine was decaf?
You just used the same pot.
I lie to him. Okay?
You son of a bitch.
That was not decaf!
I supported you
with all of those random people,
but this is your father.
Can't we at least
just give him some turkey?
Come on.
Please, I can't ask the guy
to leave on Thanksgiving.
You don't have to ask.
Just tell him that it's really important
that he be here.
And before you know it,
he'll be at a game convention in Toledo,
giving your braces money to some guy
claiming to be Milton Bradley.
He was just out
trying to provide for the family.
No, that's what my mom did
by working two jobs.
That man broke my heart
every single day for 20 years.
Well, then we'll just give him
some dark meat.
No, seriously, Robin,
you should get the slap.
You're a great slapper.
In fact, I want to study slapping
under your tutelage.
I want to be your slap-prentice.
Don't sell yourself short there.
You're a slapping rock star.
Your name should be Eric Slapton.
This is torture.
Just put me in the chair...
- Slapping throne.
- And get it over with!
- He's all yours.
- It's you, I insist.
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Wait, what?
I'll slap him.
What, so that's just, like,
the end of the discussion?
You said I could slap him.
I was just being nice.
If anyone's gonna slap him,
it's gonna be me.
No, it's not.
This is interesting.
Lily, he's family, okay?
And I'm sorry,
but you just don't cut off family.
That's easy for you to say
when you come from the most
ridiculously close family in the world.
We are not ridiculously close.
Really?
What about the Eriksen family dinner
every single sunday?
Everything looks delicious,
Mother Eriksen.
Thank you, Papa Oear.
Would you say grace?
<i>Well, I would be happy to, mother.</i>
<i>Everyone, please join hands.</i>
<i>Dear Lord...</i>
I'm sorry, but that's weird.
A family should be that close.
I want our future family to be close.
And that includes your dad.
I can't believe
you're taking his side.
Let me be clear on this.
That man will never cross
the threshold into this home, ever!
It's just gonna be,
like, five more minutes.
Hopefully soon, <i>amigo</i>.
I'm fighting a losing battle
with hemorrhoids here.
That's one of the diseases?
Ted, there is an hour
before the sun sets,
at which point,
neither one gets to slap Barney.
So just let me have it.
I had the idea to call
the port authority lost and found.
That's a good point.
Rebuttal?
- I'm the one who slipped the guy a 20!
- Philosophical conundrum.
Idea versus execution.
Please discuss at length.
I carried that huge turkey
all the way up here.
I paid for cab fare.
You slept
with one of my best friends!
What?
- You said you were okay with that.
- I'm not!
Why didn't you say
something at the time?
Because I'm still in love with you!
Do you really want
to slap Barney so bad
you would lie
about being in love with me?
I really want to slap him!
Your dad has made
some mistakes in the past,
but he's a different person now.
He's out of your grandparents' house.
He's got a job.
He's paying off his IRS debts.
How do you know all that?
Body language.
We met for a drink last week.
I miss her a ton.
Little princess.
She ever talk about me?
Like, all the time.
She tells
this one really sweet story about...
- So never?
- Not a word.
But...
It doesn't have to be that way.
We can fix this, right?
You know, I always thought
it'd get fixed at the wedding.
I even wrote a toast.
But then, no invite.
Hell, I haven't even seen
a wedding photo.
<i>And then, right before my eyes,</i>
<i>your father broke down crying.</i>
That's it!
You're coming to Thanksgiving!
You invited him?
The guy was, like, blubbering.
What was I going to do?
Then, some jerk at the next table
called him a sissy
which I thought
was totally uncalled-for.
I can't believe you.
What gives you the right to do that?
You and I are married.
And that means he's my family, too.
Ted, you better roll quickly.
Your gall bladder's about to burst.
Mickey, it's been half an hour.
I think we should go look for Lily.
She just needs some time to cool down.
Let's finish the game.
Play another round.
Best of seven!
Damn it, Robin!
I've known Barney the longest.
I get to slap him.
That slap is mine, Mosby.
I've never slapped Barney...
above the waist.
I've wanted to slap Barney
since the moment I met him!
You don't think
that I want to slap Barney?
Wait a minute!
This slap was supposed to be
a wonderful thing, a gift,
and...
it's turned us against each other.
My God, you're right.
This once pure fruit has turned
into a poison slapple.
You know what?
Seriously, you take it.
Are you sure?
Slapsolutely.
I really think
that we should go look for Lily.
Gall bladder about to pop.
It's decided. Barney, come on.
Get in the throne.
Are you...
Come on.
Well, I guess that is the...
best decision, Robin.
I mean...
Men are stronger than women.
Don't listen to him.
It's been decided.
And that's what
you've always wanted, isn't it?
A strong man to take care of you?
I mean, sure.
Growing up, you were a scrapper.
Playing hockey with the boys,
skinning your knees on the ice.
But what you couldn't tell
your teammates...
What you couldn't
even tell yourself...
was that all you really wanted...
was that pretty white dress...
in that pretty white chapel.
And at the end of that center aisle,
strewn with pretty white flowers,
a man to do
all your slapping for you.
Let me at him!
- What just happened?
- Sorry, Ted.
Gallbladder burst.
You move back three spaces.
You come in here,
and you watch your daughter leave,
and you don't even care.
And now
you've destroyed Thanksgiving dinner!
Lily worked all day on this!
Relax. It's not real bile.
It's just lead-based paint
from China.
And horse bile.
<i>And at that moment,</i>
<i>Marshall gave Mickey a look</i>
<i>none of us had ever seen him
give anyone.</i>
- What's this? What's he doing?
- Did you swallow some of that paint?
This is my "you're dead to me" look.
Lily's is so much better...
Get out of my house!
Mr. Park's? This is the last place
I expected to find you.
I'm sorry.
But just hear me out.
I used to think
that family was a right.
But it's not. It's a privilege,
and it has to be earned.
I kicked your dad out.
And I promise, baby,
I will never make you see him again.
What?
Baby, what happened?
Marshall,
I came in here because it was cold
and this was the only place
that was open.
I wasn't even gonna look Mr. Park
in the eye.
And then I found out...
Mr. Park died.
He really is dead to me!
And if I feel this bad
about never making up with Mr. Park,
a guy who meant
literally nothing to me...
We got to go get my dad.
<i>So that's how on Thanksgiving 2009,</i>
<i>your aunt Lily performed a miracle.</i>
<i>She brought a man
back from the dead.</i>
Everyone.
Before we get started, Barney,
we're going to need you
on the slapping throne.
Slap bet commissioner, surely tying me
to a chair is a breach...
Less yappin', more slappin'.
Ted, Robin.
It's two minutes until sundown.
Have you decided which one of you
is going to get
to slap Barney right in his face?
It's gonna be Ted.
What? Why me?
Last year,
you got left at the altar.
You lost your job.
But you've come
such a long way since then.
I'm so proud of you, Ted.
You deserve
to slap someone in his face,
as hard as you can.
Thanks.
This is the worst.
Mama!
You went through
your breakup, and...
While I know you and Barney
left it on good terms, isn't there...
some part of you, deep down,
that wants to slap him
right in his face?
There is.
I know there is.
This is basically hell on earth.
All right.
It hurts!
I can't do it.
I can't take this from you, Ted.
No or I, you.
Thank God.
So, I'd like to make a gesture.
No way!
I'm glad you and Lily
are trying to work things out.
So, to welcome you
to our little family...
I'd like to offer you this slap.
Really?
Well, I feel a little weird.
I just met barney,
and I don't have anything
against the guy, but...
how often do you get a chance
to slap someone right in his face?
Soft!
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.
Thank God.
Lily...
I haven't been much
of a father to you.
You are kidding me.
So for all the ballet recitals
I missed,
for all the art shows
that I should've been at...
for the wedding gift
I never got a chance to give to you...
Princess...
I give this slap...
to you.
She is the slap bet commissioner.
She's supposed to remain impartial!
Slap bet commissioner says
it's okay.
This is not good.
Please.
Let me...
Just close your eyes.
It'll be over soon.
Running through a meadow.
I can't do it.
Why can't I do it?
Because...
this slap has done
exactly what I hoped.
It's brought us all closer together.
And it's caused us to recognize
both the frailty and the greatness
in ourselves
and each other.
Give me a break.
And that is why...
There will be no slap today.
This is the best Thanksgiving...
That's four!
So, turkey?
<i>From Aldrin games unlimited, it's...
Slap Bet!</i>
<i>The slap-happy game
that's a real hit.</i>
<i>You just got slapped,</i>
<i>across the face, my friend...</i>
<i>For kids of all ages.</i>
<i>You just got slapped,</i>
<i>that really just happened...</i>
<i>Everybody saw it,</i>
<i>everybody laughed and clapped,</i>
- <i>'cause it was awesome...</i>
- I win!
<i>The way that you just got slapped.</i>
<i>Slap yourself silly with Slap Bet,
the happy hitting game from Aldrin.</i>
Encore un autre.
Y a quoi dedans ?
Y a quoi dedans ?
Hein ?
Brad Pitt dans <i>Seven</i> ?
Non ?
Je suis dingo.
Y a quoi dedans ?
Depuis qu'il a emménagé avec Lily,
sa mère lui envoie
ses vieilles affaires.
Merci, maman.
T'as vraiment fait fort cette fois.
J'avais vraiment besoin
du bras droit de <i>Musclor</i>,
et de ce livre à trous.
"Un péteux joue à la pétanque
et fait une pétarade de pets."
- C'est extra.
- C'est pas mal.
Merci, maman.
Il y a une ouverture.
- Quoi ?
- Il y a une ouverture.
Une ouverture !
T'attends quoi ?
Cours, Ted, cours !
- Lily, une ouverture !
- Poussez-vous !
Cours, Ted, cours !
J'étais...
tu sais...
Comment tu vas ?
Bien, je suppose.
En fait, ça va pas.
Je viens de rompre.
J'en suis désolé.
On boit un verre ?
D'accord.

- Vous avez adoré.
- C'était le plus...
- T'as franchi l'ouverture ?
- Je l'ai franchie !
Quoi ? Quelle ouverture ?
Tu sais, on a tous un mec
ou une fille qui, quoi qu'il arrive,
semble être ton âme soeur ?
- Mike Schatz.
- Lily.
Cette fille, là-bas.
Pour moi, cette fille était,
et est toujours...
- Maggie Wilks.
- On allait à la fac ensemble.
Elle était géniale.
Tout le monde l'adorait.
Je pense savoir de quoi il s'agit.
Dites-moi quand arrêter.
C'était pas tant son physique.
- Elle était...
- La voisine idéale.
La voisine idéale !
Et ça a pas changé.
Tous ceux qui la rencontrent
tombent sous le charme.
C'est le hic.
Depuis qu'on se connaît,
il n'y a eu que trois ouvertures
dans son célibat.
<i>Après sa rupture avec son mec de la fac,
j'ai attendu un mois.</i>
<i>Pour ne pas être
le lot de consolation.</i>
<i>Le lot de consolation
est resté deux ans.</i>
<i>À leur rupture,
j'ai attendu une semaine.</i>
<i>Trop tard...</i>
<i>Ils sont sortis ensemble trois ans.</i>
Le coup d'après, j'étais au taquet.
Je me suis pointé
une heure après sa rupture.
Son seul déplacement
entre sa rupture et mon arrivée
a été de chercher son courrier.
<i>Encore trop tard.</i>
<i>Ils sont sortis ensemble quatre ans.</i>
<i>Pour pas que ça se reproduise,
j'ai supplié sa voisine, Mme Douglas,</i>
<i>de m'appeler dès qu'ils rompraient.</i>
Et en ce moment,
une Maggie Wilks célibataire
vient nous rejoindre ici.
J'ai envoyé un taxi conduit par une nana
pour éviter tout contact avec un homme.
Y aura pas non plus de contact ici !
Dans tes dents !
Je suis chaud, ce soir.
Je le sens bien.
Ma salopette.
Je l'ai portée
pendant tout le lycée.
Y a pas à dire,
t'étais puceau avant d'avoir Lily.
- Tu pouvais t'en passer.
- Elle a raison.
Si tu l'avais portée au lycée,
même moi, j'aurais pas couché avec toi.
Rappelle-toi,
j'étais prête à me lancer.
Personne, et je dis bien personne,
ne peut coucher avec ça.
Je relève le défi.
Moi, Barney Stinson,
esprit sain dans un corps sain,
porterai cette salopette
jusqu'à avoir forniqué.
Je suis sortie avec lui.
Stratégie.
Maggie se pointe.
Salutations rapides.
Tout le monde se barre.
C'est ma seule cartouche.
- Je veux pas la ficher en l'air.
- Qui te remplace ce soir ?
Purée !
Salut, toi.
Voici ma coloc, Robin.
- C'est un plaisir.
- Plaisir partagé.
J'avais zappé.
Je donne un cours ce soir.
Tu veux assister
à un cours d'architecture ?
Pas du tout.
Je vais rester
avec Marshall et Lily.
Parfait.
Assieds-toi et détends-toi.
Tout le monde est détendu.
Tout le monde se sent
très décontracté.
Vous vouliez
que je trouve la fille idéale ?
La voilà.
Ne laissez aucun mec l'approcher.
Donc pas de serveurs,
ni d'aide-serveur pour débarrasser.
Si elle brûle,
qu'une pompière s'en occupe.
On ne peut pas choisir, ça.
Bon sang, Marshall !
Peu importe le moyen,
Maggie Wilks doit être célibataire
à mon retour.
Mon compte est ouvert,
n'en abusez pas.
- Cible sécurisée ?
- Oui.
Ça alors, c'est dingue.
On est sortis des toilettes
en même temps.
Retournons à la table.
Mince alors.
Regarde, la table où on était assis.
Dégage !
Je me fiche de ce défi.
Mais avec le costume,
ça fait lopette.
Non.
Y a aucun rapport avec lopette.
Ni avec le salaud obèse
qui venait réparer l'auto de ma mère,
puis montait avec elle à l'étage.
C'est une salopette. Je la mets,
en n'étant ni salaud ni lopette.
C'est pas un bonjour,
mais sa façon de diriger ses chevaux.
Je pourrais rester ici toute la nuit
à faire des blagues
comme quoi tu es un fermier.
Je relève le défi.
Bonsoir. Ce soir,
cours rapide sur les ponts.
6 types : à poutre, en porte-à-faux,
en arc, en suspension, et 2 autres.
Le sol est de chaque côté,
l'eau au milieu. À la semaine prochaine
Le cours dure 1 heure.
Qui a vraiment envie
de m'écouter parler de ponts ?
Vraiment ?
Je viens de repenser
à quel point Ted est génial.
Ce jeu à boire est bizarre.
Un verre ?
Il a une grosse cruche
avec trois X dessus.
Qu'ai-je fait ?
Une des choses importantes
à se rappeler
quand vous concevez un pont...
Enfin, oui.
Quand vous concevez un pont,
n'oubliez jamais :
Mais Attention...
Gare aux Gros Investissements
d'Énergie.
Ça vaut aussi pour votre vie.
Cette Maggie, elle est spéciale ?
C'est cette fille que j'ai en vue
depuis un moment, et ce soir,
c'est peut-être la seule chance
que j'aurai de sortir avec elle.
Elle est bonne ?
Oui, Jamie. Elle est très belle.
Si on pouvait terminer ce cours...
Maggie est enfin disponible,
mais vous, professeur Mosby ?
Vous êtes prêt à vous engager ?
À fond.
Enfin, je pense.
Peut-être.
Qu'en dites-vous ?
J'avais complètement oublié.
- C'est quoi ?
- Une rédaction écrite de mes 15 ans.
Écrire une liste d'objectifs
au futur vous de 30 ans.
"Cher futur moi."
<i>D'abord, t'as intérêt

<i>ou le van de l'</i>Agence tous risques.
<i>Priorité </i>numero uno.
<i>Ta queue de cheval devrait arriver

<i>Tu peux encore dunker, bien sûr,</i>
<i>et tu t'appelles

<i>Ta femme...

<i>blonde, 1 m 80,</i>
<i>une poitrine d'enfer,

- Désolé.
- Ça va.
Tu as juste décrit ta mère.
Continue.
<i>Tu as la classe...
Tu portes des salopettes délavées,</i>
<i>car c'est toujours à la mode.</i>
<i>Et surtout,

<i>Si tu deviens un vendu,</i>
<i>jette-toi du haut d'une falaise,</i>
<i>car tu crains.</i>
<i>Et je "licky boom-boom down".</i>
Trop marrant.
Je suis devenu un vendu.
Je travaille pour la GNB,

Allez, <i>Tonnerre Vanille</i>,
tout le monde doit grandir.
Je me souviens qu'à la fac,
Maggie voulait devenir
biologiste marine le jour
et éducatrice la nuit
pour les gosses de banlieue.
Tu fais quoi alors ?
Tout ça.
Tu vas où ?
J'ai un truc à faire au boulot.
Ce sera rapide.
Il a quoi ?
Il va démissionner.
Excuse-moi, je dois l'en empêcher.
Je pars du bar, mais t'inquiète pas.
Maggie reste avec Robin.
Maggie est avec Robin ?
Respire.
Je contrôle la situation.
Tu ne saisis pas.
Cette fille
est un vrai aimant à mecs.
Je touche ma bille en aimant à mecs.
Ton amie est peut-être un aimant

Je suis de celles qui peuvent
aimanter les voitures dans les casses.
C'est qui ?
C'est Jim, un collègue.
Enchanté.
Être prêt, ça veut dire quoi ?
Je pensais l'être, l'an passé.
Elle m'a quitté devant l'autel.
Je vais être franc.
J'ai la frousse.
Louis, puis Betty.
On a tous la frousse, professeur.
Avoir la frousse, ça veut juste dire
que c'est une étape importante.
Sans frousse, on ne tente rien.
Si on ne tente rien,
qu'est-ce qu'il nous reste à faire ?
Non ?
T'es prêt !
T'es si marrant !
Marrant ? Je le trouve hilarant.
J'ai tellement ri
que j'en ai mouillé ma culotte.
Je dois filer.
Je vais au vernissage de l'expo
dont ils parlaient au boulot :
Les Chiens Érotique.
- J'ai une invit' si...
- Moi ?
Avec plaisir !
Bon, c'est l'heure.
Dernier conseil.
Mais Attention...
Gare aux Gros Investissements
en Énergie !
Petite info.
Tu l'as laissée avec Barney !
Ted, pète un coup.
Je suis ton pote.
T'es un coq.
Même si nous avons eu des déboires
à ce propos,
je te promets
d'être un parfait gentleman.
Merci.
J'adore ta salopette.
T'as dix minutes,
ou je prends l'ouverture.
- Dix minutes ?
- Ouep.
Parce qu'on est potes.
<i>Pendant que je me dépêchais
pour arriver au bar,</i>
<i>Robin faisait son possible
pour séparer Jim de Maggie.</i>
On retourne au bar voir Maggie ?
Pas question !
J'adore les photos érotiques canines.
T'as vu celui qui fait le cani-lingus
dans la partoutouze ?
J'appelle un taxi.
Pas sympa de laisser Maggie seule.
Buvons un verre avant.
Regarde-moi.
Je suis une...
vilaine coquinette
qui irait jusqu'à un baiser
pour rendre service à un ami.
La vue te plaît ?
Je vais appeler Maggie.
Mais lâchez-la un peu !
Elle est avec Ted ce soir.
Ted ? Et David alors ?
C'est fini.
- Elle est célibataire ?
- Ça a l'air d'être une première.
Je peux essuyer ?
S'il vous plaît ?
- Je hais Barney Stinson !
- Moi aussi !
<i>Lily arriva enfin à la GNB,
mais l'endroit était désert.</i>
Je pensais que tu démissionnais.
J'avais oublié le basket.
Si je pouvais faire un seul truc,
je ne serais pas un corrompu,
donc je suis venu dunker.
Ça va mieux ?
J'ai à peine touché le filet.
Et là, j'ai trop mal aux jambes
pour les plier.
Je vais...
T'as osé !
Je me suis surpassé
pour coucher avec une salopette.
Reste sur mon chemin
et Barney gagnera.
C'est pas ce que tu veux.
Cette ordure s'en vantera à mort.
Dieu merci, Maggie...
Où crois-tu aller ?
- Lui dire que je l'aime.
- Fais la queue.
Je couche avec elle,
puis il lui dit qu'il l'aime,
et après, tu fais ce que tu veux.
Ça vous va ?
Tu as raté la nuit de ta vie.
La nuit...
de ta vie.
- Je l'aime depuis 5 ans.
- Et moi, depuis 12 ans.
Je porte cette salopette
depuis une heure et demie.
Tu ne peux plus dunker.
Mais tu as fait plus en 30 ans
que ce boutonneux de 15 ans
l'aurait imaginé.
Tu as fait
la fac de droit de Columbia.
Tu as eu le bon sens
de couper ta queue de rat.
Et...
tu as épousé une bombe
qui ressemble pas à ta mère.
Je pense que ça mérite
que je descende le panneau.
Vas-y, <i>Tonerre Vanille</i>.
Recule.
Et si à la place,
on allait dans ton bureau
t'allonger tranquillement
pendant que je fais la folle ?
On pourrait peut-être faire ça ici ?
Bien sûr.
Elle m'aime !
On doit tirer ça au clair.
Y a une ouverture, là.
Si vous me laissez y aller,
y en a une autre dans dix minutes.
Où est Maggie ?
Elle est partie. Je l'ai renvoyée.
On dirait des vautours affamés.
Laissez-la être célibataire.
- Jalouse !
- Comment t'as pu !
Elle a raison.
Maggie mérite du temps pour elle.
Personne n'aime être seul,
surtout après une rupture,
mais c'est là qu'on découvre
qui on est vraiment et...
ce qu'on recherche.
Elle le mérite.
<i>Et je le pensais.</i>
<i>D'où ma honte vis-à-vis de la suite.</i>
C'est au coin de la rue.
Désolé, le cours a duré...
- Qui est-ce ?
- C'est Adam.
C'est fou.
On a grandi côte à côte.
On s'est pas vus depuis...
Longtemps.
<i>Et Maggie Wilks nous raconta</i>
<i>le second plus beau conte de fées
que j'ai entendu.</i>
Je viens d'arriver
et je devais la trouver.
On a beaucoup de choses à rattraper.
Bien sûr.
<i>Alors,</i>
<i>j'ai laissé la meilleure voisine...</i>
<i>au voisin.</i>
À la prochaine.
<i>Il n'y eut pas de "prochaine".</i>
<i>Il n'y eut plus d'ouverture.</i>
J'ai trouvé ! Au bar country Hudada,
les salopettes doivent marcher !
- Copilote ?
- Je veux pas chevaucher.
Je veux ça.
J'avais oublié ce que ça faisait
de courir après l'amour, mais...
Je pense que je suis prêt.
Moi, j'en suis là.
Je veux coucher avec une fille
pour enlever cette salopette.
Allez, quoi !
Tu dois m'aider !
Je dois enlever ce truc !
J'adore votre salopette.
<i>Cher Marshall de 60 ans.</i>
<i>Tu dois travailler
à rendre le monde meilleur,</i>
<i>ou du moins, essayer.</i>
<i>Pas de pression, mec...
Monsieur.</i>
<i>Aussi,</i>
<i>si on peut voyager dans le temps,</i>
<i>tu pourrais me faire un signe</i>
<i>le mardi 8 décembre, à...</i>
20 h 29.
Quelqu'un a rapporté
ces ailes de poulet
parce qu'elles étaient trop épicées.
"Trop épicées ? Vous êtes folle ?"
Du coup, poulet gratos.
<i>Mon vieux Marshall,
tant que tu seras marié à Lily,</i>
<i>tout ira bien.</i>
C'est offert.
Pardon pour le poulet trop épicé.
Ce n'est pas ça.
J'en ai juste mangé plus tôt.
Well...
got another one.
- Boy.
- What's in the box?
What's in the box?
What's in the box?
What's in the box?!
Right?
Brad Pitt... <i>Seven</i>?
Nothing?
Yeah, I'm the jerk.
What's in the box?
Since Marshall
and Lily got their own place,
his mom keeps sending them boxes
of his stuff she's trying to get rid of.
Thanks, Mom.
You really nailed it this time.
I really needed <i>He-Man</i>'s right arm
and this old book of Mad Libs.
"Fart went to the fart
to fart fartly."
That's nice.
That's good stuff.
Thanks, Mom.
The window is open.
- What?
- The window is open.
The window is open.
What are you waiting for?
Run, Ted, run!
Lily, the window is open.
Make a hole, people.
Run, Ted, run!
I was just...
you know...
How are you?
I'm fine, I guess.
Actually, no, I'm not fine.
I just broke up with my boyfriend.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
You want to hang out tonight?
Sure.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-
.:: La Fabrique ::.
- So fun. You guys liked it.
- It was the most...
- Please tell me you got in the window.
- I got in the window.
What is going on?
What is the window?
You know how everyone has that guy
or girl who, no matter what happens,
you always rember them
being the perfect one for you?
- Mike Schatz.
- Lily.
That girl right over there.
Well, that girl for me was,
and still is...
- Maggie Wilks.
- We all went to college together.
She was awesome.
Everybody loved her.
I think I know what
we're dealing with here.
Tell me when to stop.
It wasn't that Maggie was hot.
- She was...
- The ultimate girl next door.
She was the ultimate girl next door.
Still is.
Every guy who meets Maggie
falls madly in love with her.
And that's the problem.
Since I've known her,
she's only been single for, like,
three brief windows of opportunity.
<i>When she moved here and broke up
with her boyfriend, I waited a month.</i>
<i>You know, so I wouldn't
be the rebound guy.</i>
<i>Well, the rebound guy
lasted two years.</i>
<i>After they broke up,
I only waited a week.</i>
<i>I was still too late.</i>
<i>She dated that guy for three years.</i>
The next time,
I wasn't messing around.
I was at her door not one hour
after they broke up.
The only thing she did
between becoming single
and the moment I got there was
go downstairs and check her mail.
<i>I was still too late.</i>
<i>And she dated that guy
for four years.</i>
<i>I wasn't going to let this happen again,
so I begged her neighbor, Mrs. Douglas,</i>
<i>to call me the second
she and David broke up.</i>
And now, a very single
and available Maggie Wilks
is on her way to this very spot.
I sent a cab with a female driver,
so she'd have
no other interaction with a man
until she got to me.
Where she'll still have
no interaction with a man.
What up?
I feel good tonight.
Tonight's going to be good.
Hell, yeah!
It's my overalls.
I wore these babies all throughout
high school. These were my jam.
God, you really were a virgin
before you met Lily, weren't you?
- That's unnecessary.
- She's right, baby.
If you had worn
these things in college,
even I wouldn't have slept with you.
And, if you recall,
I was good to go.
No one...
I mean no one...
could get laid wearing these.
Challenge accepted.
I, Barney Stinson,
being of sound mind
and amazing body,
will wear these overalls
until I have sex with a woman.
I actually dated that guy.
Quick game plan.
Maggie shows up, couple minutes
of hugs and hi's,
and then everybody's out of here.
This is my one shot.
I am not gonna screw this up.
- Who'd you get to cover your class?
- Crap!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my goodness.
Stranger.
Maggie, this is my roommate, Robin.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.
I totally forgot,
I have to teach a class tonight.
Want to come with me and check out
a real "elive architecture class?
Not even a little bit.
You know, I'll just hang here
with Marshall. It'll be fun.
Fantastic.
Well, have a seat.
Relax.
Yeah, this is casual.
This is all very, very, very casual.
You want me to find the perfect girl
so we can all grow old together?
That is her.
Do not let any guy near her, okay?
That means no waiter takes her order,
no busboy clears her table.
If she bursts into flames,
I want a firewoman putting her out.
I don't think 911 takes requests.
Damn it, Marshall!
Whatever you have to do,
keep Maggie Wilks single
until I get back.
I left my tab open.
Don't abuse it.
- Target secure?
- Target secure.
Oh, my gosh.
How weird.
We all walked out of the bathroom
at the same time.
Let's all walk back
to the booth together.
Oh, my.
Look at this, the table
where we are sitting.
Back off!
Okay, not that I care
about this challenge,
but it's cheating to wear
overalls over a suit.
No, it's not. They're not called
over T-shirts, Robin.
They're not called over shirtless fat
guys who used to come fix my mom's car
and then hang out with her
upstairs for a little while.
They're called overalls, okay?
And I can wear them over
whatever I want.
He's not saying hello.
He's just telling you
what he feeds his horsies.
Man, I can sit here and make
you-look-like-a-farmer jokes
all night.
Challenge accepted.
Good evening. Tonight, we're gonna have
a nice, quick class on bridges.
There are 6 types: Beam, cantilever,
arch, suspension, and 2 others.
You got land on both sides, water
in the middle. See you all next week.
We get you for the whole hour.
Come on.
Who really wants to sit here
and listen to me yap about bridges?
Really?
I just thought about
how awesome Ted is again.
This is a weird drinking game.
Can I buy you a drink?
He's got a big brown jug
with three X's on it.
What have I done?
One very important thing
to keep in mind
when designing a bridge...
I mean, yes.
Yes, when you're designing a bridge,
always rember:
make adjustments...
... go get it energized.
That's good advice for life, too.
So, Professor Mosby,
is this Maggie someone special?
She's just this girl I've been
into for a really long time,
and, tonight could be the one chance
I have to go out with her, so...
Is she a hottie?
Yes, Jamie.
She's very attractive.
And if we can just
end class right now...
Maggie may finally be available,
but what about you, Professor Mosby?
Are you ready
for a serious relationship?
Totally.
I mean, I think so.
Maybe.
I don't know.
What do you guys think?
Oh, my gosh.
I totally forgot about this.
- What is it?
- It's a homework assignment
from when I was 15.
Write a letter
to your 30-year-old self
with a list of goals
you hope to achieve.
Dear Future Me.
First off,
you'd better be driving either
a kick-ass Camaro or the A-Team van.
That's priority numero uno.
And by now your rat tail should
hang down to your freakin' knees.
You can still slam-dunk, obviously,
and you've legally changed
your name to "Vanilla Thunder."
Your wife...
let me break it down:
blonde, six feet tall,
has an awesome rack and caters
to your every need.
- Sorry, babe.
- That's OK.
You just described your mother.
Keep going.
You're still rocking... you're still
rocking the stone-washed overalls,
because this look is working.
And most importantly,
you'd better be saving the world.
If you became some lame,
corporate sellout,
just throw yourself off a cliff
because you suck.
And I licky boom-boom down.
Yeah, hilarious.
I became a lame, corporate sellout.
I work for GNB, the most evil bank
in the history of the world.
Come on, Vanilla Thunder, everyone's
got to grow up and get a real job.
Yeah, I remember back
in college Maggie wanted to be
a marine biologist by day and mentor
inner-city kids by night.
Those things.
Baby, where are you going?
I gotta do something at work.
It won't take long.
What's up with him?
I think he's going to quit his job.
I'm sorry, Maggie.
I gotta go stop him.
Ted, I had to leave the bar,
but it's okay.
I left Maggie with Robin.
You left Maggie with Robin?
Relax.
- I've got things under control.
- You don't understand the situation.
This girl is like
a super-powered man magnet.
I know a little something
about man magnets.
Your friend may be
one of those magnets
that can hold up a picture of your kids
on the fridge,
but I'm one of those magnets
that can pick up cars in a junkyard.
Who's this?
Jim, a good friend of mine
from work.
Nice to meet you.
What does being "ready" even mean?
I thought I was "ready" last year.
I wound up getting left at the altar.
I'll be honest, guys.
I'm a little scared.
Louis, then Betty.
We're all scared, Professor Mosby.
Doesn't being scared let you know
you're on to something important?
I mean, if you're not scared,
you're not taking a chance.
And if you're not taking a chance,
then what the hell are you doing?
Right?
You're ready, bro.
Jim, you are so funny.
Funny? I think he's hilarious.
In fact, I laughed so hard,
I think I may have just peed my pants.
I'd better take off.
To the opening of a photography exhibit
they were talking about at work:
Les Chiens Erotique.
- I have an extra ticket...
- Me?!
I'd love to!
All right, I gotta go.
One last piece of advice.
Make adjustments...
Go get it energized!
- Ted, change of plans.
- You left her with Barney?!
Ted, will you take it easy?
- I'm your bro.
- You're an animal.
And even though our bro-lationship
has suffered its setbacks in this area,
I assure you I will be
the perfect gentleman.
Thanks.
I really like those overalls.
You have ten minutes
or the window's closing.
Ten minutes?
Because we're bros.
<i>While I was racing through New York,
trying to get back to the bar,</i>
<i>your Aunt Robin was doing her best
to keep Jim away from Maggie.</i>
Wanna go back to the bar
and see if Maggie's still there?
No way!
I love erotic dog photography.
Did you see the one over there
of the corgies doing it people style?
I'll get us a taxi.
I feel bad leaving Maggie all alone.
Let's have a glass of wine first.
Look how filthy I am.
I am just a...
a filthy, filthy girl
who would totally go to second base
with a guy as a favor to a friend.
You like that?
I'm going to call Maggie,
see what she's doing.
Give it a rest, jeez!
She's hanging out with Ted tonight.
Ted? What about David?
They broke up.
Maggie's single?
That doesn't sound familiar.
Can I help wipe that off?
Please?
I hate Barney Stinson!
Me, too!
<i>Lily finally got to GNB,
but the place was deserted.</i>
Thought you came here to quit your job.
I forgot about the hoop.
I thought if I could just do
one thing in that letter,
I wouldn't feel like
such an old sellout,
- so I came out here to dunk.
- Did it make you feel better?
I barely grazed
the bottom of the net,
and now my legs hurt so bad,
I can't even fall down.
I'm gonna.
How could you?
I challenged myself
to get laid wearing overalls.
And if you stand in my way,
then you're letting Barney win.
You don't want that. That son of a bitch
will never let us hear the end.
Thank God.
Maggie...
Where do you think you're going?
- To tell that girl I love her.
- Get in line, bub.
I'll have sex with her,
then he'll tell her he loves her,
and then you can do whatever you want.
Do we agree on the order?
Mister!
You just missed out
on the night of your life.
The night...
of your life.
- I've been in love for five years.
- I've been love for 12 years.
I've been in these overalls
for an hour and a half.
Maybe you can't dunk anymore.
But you've achieved more
in your 30 years
than that 15-year-old dweeb
could ever dream of.
You put yourself
through Columbia Law School.
You had the sense
to chop off that stupid rat tail.
And...
you married a smoking-hot chick
who looks nothing like your mother.
I think that earns you
an entire foot closer to dunking.
There you go, Vanilla Thunder.
Step back.
How about instead of dunking,
we go up to your office,
and you lie very still
while I go bananas all over you?
Could we maybe instead
just do it right here?
Sure, baby.
She loves me!
We have to figure this out.
We're dealing
with a small window of opportunity.
If you let me in there,
that window's gonna open up again
in ten minutes.
Wait, where's Maggie?
She's gone.
I sent her home.
You were like vultures fighting.
Let her be single for once.
- Jealous bitch!
- Robin, how could you?
No, she's right.
Maggie deserves
some time to herself.
Nobody likes to be alone,
especially after a breakup,
but that's when we discover
who we really are and...
what we really want.
She deserves that.
<i>And kids, I meant that.</i>
<i>Which is why I'm not proud of
what happened next.</i>
It's around the corner.
Sorry.
Class ran a little...
- Who's this?
- This is Adam.
It's so crazy.
We grew up next door to each other.
We haven't seen each other since...
A long time.
<i>And then Maggie Wilks told us</i>
<i>the second-greatest love story
I've ever heard.</i>
I just moved to town
and I had to look her up.
I guess
we've got a lot of catching up to do.
Of course.
<i>So, kids,</i>
<i>I missed out
on the ultimate girl next door...</i>
<i>to the guy next door.</i>
See you next time.
<i>There was no "next time".</i>
<i>Maggie's window never opened again.</i>
I got it!
That country bar, Giddy-Ups!
The overalls have gotta work there.
Wingman me?
I don't want Giddy-Ups.
I want that.
I forgot what it feels like
to chase the real thing, but...
I think I'm ready again.
Let me tell you where I'm at.
I want to have sex with a girl
so I can take off these overalls.
Come on.
You gotta help me!
I gotta get these damn things off!
I just love your overalls.
<i>Dear 60-year-old Marshall.</i>
<i>You should be working somewhere
that's making the world a better place,</i>
<i>or at least trying to.</i>
<i>No pressure, dude.
I mean, sir.</i>
<i>Also,</i>
<i>if time travel is possible,</i>
<i>maybe you could give me
a little sign</i>
<i>on Tuesday, December 8, at...</i>
8:29 p.m.
So, someone sent back
these chicken wings,
because they were too hot.
And I'm like,
"Too hot? Are you crazy?"
So, free wings.
<i>Old Man Marshall, as long as
you're still married to Lily,</i>
<i>you're doing just fine.</i>
Sir, this is on us.
Sorry the wings were so hot.
It wasn't that they were too hot.
It's just that I had wings earlier.
Much earlier.

<i>D'accord, je vais pas vous mentir.</i>

Allez, Marshall, fęte ça.

Eh merde.
J'ai merdé.

Je suis sűr qu'il adore.
<i>Le lendemain, Marshall aurait tué
pour une cigarette.</i>
<i>Ça le rendait fou,
donc il voulut aller prendre l'air.</i>
Tu viens te suicider ?
J'ai viré du monde.
Pas besoin d'un autre suicidé.
Une cigarette ?
Non, merci.
Dommage.
Vous savez quoi, Jeffrey ?
Ça me manque
de fumer avec quelqu'un.
De nos jours,
les gens sont remplaçables.
Partager une clope,
ça crée des liens.
Vous savez quoi ?
Je vais en prendre une.
Et c'est Marshall, au fait.
Dites-moi, Marshall Eriksen.
Aimeriez-vous voir
une photo du chien
le plus mignon du monde ?
Le voilŕ.
- Coucou.
- T'as fumé.
Oui, j'ai fumé.
C'était ma troisičme.
Tu sais ce que ça veut dire ?
Je suis un fumeur.
J'ai męme acheté des clopes,
un briquet et une lampe des Vikings.
Aucun rapport,
mais j'ai flashé dessus.
Enfin, Marshall.
On a déjŕ quatre lampes des Vikings,
et fumer tue.
Je créais des liens avec mon patron.
T'aurais dű me voir.
C'est un joli chien.
Ce sont vos enfants ?
On s'en fout.
Regardez ce que j'ai acheté.
Le voilŕ. Mais oui.
Caressez-le.
C'est bon, il adore ça.
Grattez-le sous le menton.
Je me fiche de tes excuses.
Tu sais ce que je pense du tabac.
Donne-moi les cigarettes.
Le briquet.
Ça, c'est bon.
Quoi ?
<i>Ajoutez Lily sur la liste.</i>
<i>Quand Marshall craquait,</i>
<i>Lily était emportée avec.</i>
Tu fais quoi ?
Si tu veux savoir, je contacte la mairie
pour inviter le maire.
T'es adorable,
mais il ne viendra pas.
Ma coloscopie était plus populaire
que le show.
- C'était tordu, au moins.
- Pourquoi tu agis comme ça ?
T'es vexé d'avoir été oublié
par les chaînes nationales.
- Moi, je bataille pour y aller.
- J'y ai bossé.
Vraiment ?
C'était la meilleure fęte du travail
de ma vie.
Pour les infos,
t'as un super fauteuil.
Comme sur un nuage.
C'était bien,
car c'était aprčs ma coloscopie.
Et le vestiaire !
- Y a un vestiaire ?
- Tu peux parier ton casque lŕ-dessus.
Pas besoin de se changer
au KFC d'en face.
C'était le paradis.
Dčs que tu t'y habitues,
ils trouvent quelqu'un
qui n'est pas en plein divorce.
Et qui ne "pue pas l'alcool".
Et d'un coup,
tu te retrouves dans un local,
entouré d'incompétents.
Et ŕ faire les infos en slip.
Le slip, c'était ton idée,
et j'aime pas la diffusion.
Superbe, les gars.
Plaisant ?
Je veux le tuer.
Des gens regardent l'émission.
Vous la regardez, ça fait déjŕ deux.
Vous l'avez toujours pas regardée ?
- On la rate jamais.
- On l'a vue.
De quelle couleur est le plateau ?
- Noir.
- Gris.
Argenté, sur les côtés.
Mon plateau, pas votre meuble.
Si mes amis ne regardent pas,
qui va le faire ?
Des tas de gens.
Les insomniaques alités.
Les clodos campant
devant un magasin.
Les patients aux urgences,
oů la télé est encagée
pour ne pas changer de chaîne.
Personne te suit ?
Męme Leonard ne regarde pas.
C'est dingue qu'ils fument.
Ça caille.
Tu te souviens
quand on pouvait fumer ici ?
Je crois que cette nana me sourit.
C'est une chaise. Mais vas-y, fonce.
Marco !
Polo !
Ça nous divise.
Fumeurs et non-fumeurs.
- C'est pas sain.
- T'as raison.
On y va.
Quoi ?
<i>J'en suis pas fier.</i>
Regardez-vous.
Des fumeurs.
Comme nous.
Je suis pas fumeur.
Je fume qu'en certaines occasions.
Postcoďtal, avec des Allemandes...
Parfois en simultané.
Coďtal,
anniversaires,
pour embęter ma mčre,
précoďtal, sur un bateau,
quand les Mets sont éliminés,
et,
attendez... car je l'ai fait,
les frayeurs de grossesses.
Et lŕ ?
Je suis toujours en précoďt.
Fumer n'est pas forcément mal.
Au moins,
ça nous fait prendre l'air.
Et la toux fait bosser mes abdos.
Je... suis...
au top !
<i>Bien que c'était sexy,
en une semaine, on a craqué.</i>
Ça va, chérie ?
Ma gorge est un peu douloureuse.
TROIS ÉTAGES PLUS HAUT
Je lui envoie un coup de journal
dans le pif.
Ma femme dit :
"Tu peux pas faire ça ŕ ton fils."
Je sais pas.
Michael, appelle le SAMU.
Tout de suite.
C'est Marshall.
J'espčre qu'il va bien.
Preum's pour sa place.
Faut qu'on arręte.
Tu m'ôtes les mots de la bouche.
Si seulement.
Je me revois ŕ 13 ans.
Si je pouvais y retourner...
Je déteste ce petit con.
Moi aussi.
C'est fini.
Arrętons.
Vas-y.
Je suis fier de vous.
J'ai entendu dire
qu'il était trčs difficile
d'arręter de fumer,
alors, au nom des non-fumeurs,
chapeau bas, je suis lŕ pour vous.
Passez-moi vos cigarettes.
Je m'en débarrasserai, une par une.
Tu arrętes, poupée.
Je t'appelle pas poupée d'habitude,
mais avec cette voix, ça le fait.
Poupée.
Question :
qui interviewe le maire demain ?
Moi ?
Don, carre-la-toi
pendant que je m'en carre une.
Allume-moi.
En fait,
on a décidé d'arręter de fumer.
C'est génial.
J'en avais marre que vous me taxiez.
On ne peut y arriver
que tous ensemble.
- Tu peux coucher avec Marshall.
- Non.
Désolée, faut se sacrifier.
Je veux pas coucher avec Marshall.
J'ai vu tes regards.
Je peux pas arręter.
Pas avant l'interview de ma vie.
- C'est trop stressant.
- C'est trop stressant !
- Une seule.
- Une clope !
Réfléchis deux secondes.
Bloomberg est le maire anti-fumeur.
Tu veux te pointer
en sentant la fumée ?
Autant interviewer un végétarien
en sentant le McRib.
Tu dois encore en rajouter ?
Tu arrętes. On arręte tous.
D'accord.
Super.
On doit juste tenir 24 heures.
Aprčs, ce sera du gâteau.
26 HEURES PLUS TARD
Tu dois te les ronger si fort ?
Je me les ronge pas.
J'essaie d'aspirer
les restes de nicotine.
- Passe-moi les oignons.
- T'as des bras de T-Rex ou quoi ?
Que font les cigarettes, lŕ ?
Elles pensent ŕ nous ?
Arręte de taper du pied
avant que je m'énerve.
Je suis vraiment désolé.
Et si je tapais ton cul, plutôt ?
<i>On ignorait pourquoi on se battait.</i>
<i>On voulait juste fumer.</i>
<i>Plus que tout au monde.</i>
<i>Ça n'allait pas fort pour Robin.</i>
Désolé du retard.
Le micro-ondes a bloqué l'ascenseur.
Tu fais quoi ?
Don, sérieux, pas ce soir.
Je suis tendue, j'arręte de fumer
pour mon interview...
Pauvre petite licorne de porcelaine.
- Pourquoi faire ça ?
- Pourquoi ?
Parce que moi, j'y tiens.
Je tiens ŕ l'émission,
je tiens ŕ ma carričre.
Pas comme toi, débile amateur.
Tu es négligé, tu es malpoli.
Si seulement tu bossais
autant que ces élastiques
sur tes slips.
Ça devient perso.
Ça deviendrait perso si je disais
que tu passes de ville en ville,
car t'es un perdant...
Un perdant paresseux et grossier.
Le maire vient pas.
Je suis un perdant ?
Tu as raison, j'en suis un.
Au moins, je l'ai accepté.
Un raton laveur a réconforté
les patients d'un hospice.
J'étais comme toi.
Ŕ toujours en vouloir plus
sans l'obtenir.
C'est une impasse.
Tu seras jamais
présentatrice vedette.
Et t'arręteras pas
de fumer non plus.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je savoure une cigarette.
Tu y viendras.
C'est bon.
- Tu veux une latte ?
- Restons pros.
- S'il te plaît ?
- Pros ?
Tu sais qui est derričre la caméra ?
Une chaise.
Nous avons une émission
que męme le caméraman regarde pas.
C'est pour ça que le maire a annulé.
Et que Mike est allé chercher du poulet.
C'est aussi pour ça
qu'on peut s'en fumer une ŕ l'antenne.
Pourquoi ?
Ŕ cause des millions
de téléspectateurs influençables ?
Si cela dérange un spectateur,
appelez-nous.
Le numéro est ŕ l'écran.
Allez, Robin...
Profite un peu.
Ça doit ętre Mike.
Il oublie toujours. Trčs croustillant.
Ne fume pas !
On regarde tous
et on est tous trčs influençables.
Et je te jure que si tu fumes,
on va tous s'y mettre.
Vous regardez ?
Bien sűr, chérie,
et tu es merveilleuse.
Tu n'as pas ŕ fumer.
Résiste, chérie.
Merci d'avoir appelé.
- Elle a réussi !
- Bien joué.
On ne va pas fumer.
J'ai un paquet planqué lŕ-haut.
Je suis réveillé. Et je fume !
Faut jamais réveiller
un fumeur-nambule !
C'est bon.
J'ai acheté un paquet.
Super émission.
Mais ce Don, un vrai âne.
En fait, il s'est excusé.
Je parle de quand il s'est levé.
C'était plutôt transparent.
- Tu devrais sortir avec lui.
- Pas dans cette vie.
<i>Ils sortirent ensemble 3 mois aprčs.
Mais on en reparlera.</i>
Regardez, le soleil se lčve.
C'est le moment parfait
pour un truc.
Pour une derničre cigarette.
La derničre des derničres, ŕ jamais.
Faisons-le.
D'accord.
La derničre cigarette.
On compte jusqu'ŕ trois.
<i>On a tous un peu arręté aprčs ça.</i>
<i>Mais ce n'était
la derničre de personne.</i>
<i>Mais on a tous arręté de fumer
pour de bon.</i>
<i>Robin a fumé sa derničre
en juin 2013.</i>
<i>Barney, en mars 2017.</i>
<i>Lily, le jour oů elle essaya
d'ętre enceinte.</i>
<i>Et Marshall,
le jour de la naissance de son fils.</i>
<i>Et ma derničre cigarette ?
Aprčs 15 jours avec votre mčre.</i>
<i>Et j'ai jamais repris.</i>
Désolé pour les coups.
Je voulais m'excuser
en te donnant ça.
Sexy !
- Un jour, tu l'épouseras.
- Sans blague.
On a de la chance.
Carrément.
Ŕ plus.
Ne fais pas ça.
Profites-en.
<i>Kids, back in 2009,
your Aunt Robin was the host</i>
<i>of a morning show
for local New York cable.</i>
<i>And it was on early.
How early?</i>
Mike? Wake up.
<i>But then, everything changed.</i>
- See my show?
- I meant to watch it.
I just got so busy with the whole
"being sound asleep" thing.
It took all night,
eight hours down the drain.
It's fine.
But get this:
After the broadcast...
Hi. Are you Robin?
I'm Don, your new co-host.
<i>Don was Don Frank,</i>
<i>seasoned veteran of no fewer
than 39 local morning news teams</i>
<i>from all over the country.</i>
<i>The guy was an industry legend.</i>
You are so going to hit that.
No, I just think we're going
to be great together on the air.
And on the sofa and on the bed
and on the coffee table.
All right, I'm gonna
go up on the roof
and stand there for 5 minutes.
Have fun.
<i>And that's exactly what she did.</i>
<i>She just stood there.</i>
<i>All right, I'm gonna level with you.</i>
<i>That's not what she did.
Here's what she did.</i>
All right, all right...
I'm going to go have a cigarette.
What?!
<i>I promised her I'd never tell you this,
but once upon a time, your Aunt Robin</i>
<i>did enjoy the occasional cigarette,</i>
<i>and occasionally
that occasional cigarette...</i>
<i>was more than just occasional.</i>
I left something
like this in my apartment.
Robin, come on, take it to the roof.
We said no smoking in the apartment
after you torched
the throw rug doing push-ups.
All right, all right.
Geez.
Yeah, Robin, I mean, God,
not only is that a
filthy habit, but also,
- can I bum one?
- Sure.
What?!
Synchro: ShalimarFox
.:: La Fabrique ::.
<i>Kids, your Uncle Marshall definitely
doesn't want you to know this,</i>
<i>but he also smoked off and on.</i>
<i>It all started when he was 13,
on a camping trip in Minnesota.</i>
Come on, Marshall, let's celebrate.
It's summer vacation.
But just one.
This is my first
and last cigarette ever.
<i>And that was the first of many,
many "last cigarettes ever."</i>
That's it.
I am done, I am out.
Last...
cigarette...
... ev-arrh!
<i>So, by that point,
I'd heard it all before.</i>
Last cigarette ever.
What are you doing?
You haven't smoked in six months.
Is this about the McRib?
It's gone, dude, let it go.
I'm worried about work, okay?
They just hired a new head
of the legal department,
and he's going
to be letting people go.
So that's why you're worried?
The new head of the legal
department is Arthur Hobbes.
As in "Artillery Arthur"?
As in your former boss?
<i>Arthur Hobbes was the meanest boss</i>
<i>Marshall or anyone else
had ever had.</i>
<i>The last time Marshall
worked for him, it ended like this.</i>
I quit!
So does he hold it against you?
Worse.
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm Marshall Eriksen.
We had a fairly intense
screaming match.
Wherein I suggested
that you take your head
and store it within yourself
in a fashion that,
while, while space-saving,
might limit its exposure
to, to sunshine.
Well, that describes
95% of my employees
and everyone in my family...
except for my dog.
He's such a good boy.
I'll see you later...
Randall Wilkerson.
Gary Dinkersfield, right.
- Great, he doesn't remember you.
- Not great.
Arthur Hobbes hating him,
that's no big deal. He hates everyone.
It's the people he doesn't know
that he cuts loose.
He just fired What's-His-Face.
He fired What's-His-Face, Ted,
and What's-His-Face was invaluable.
I understand you getting upset, but
it's not worth killing yourself over.
Yeah, wait till you get
laid off, then kill yourself.
Like What's-His-Face.
Although I guess now
it's more like Where's-His-Face.
Look, it was just two cigarettes.
Okay, I can handle two.
As long as I don't have three
within 24 hours,
then I'm not going
to get hooked again.
What's Lily going to say
when she finds out you smoked?
She's not going to find out.
I have a system.
<i>Yes, Marshall's system.</i>
- Hello.
- You smoked.
Damn it!
<i>The next morning,
your Aunt Robin was thrilled</i>
<i>to be finally going on the air
with a real pro.</i>
In three, two, one...
- Hi, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
- And I...
am Don Frank.
Two teens were arrested late
last night for stealing a police cart.
No, I'm sorry,
not a police cart, a policecar.
Screw it.
Brain fart.
Don't you hate those?
Look at that, the teleprompter's
still running.
Something about a woman
giving birth on an uptown bus.
Well, no point
in jumping in halfway.
I'll just wait till it's done.
And she cut the cord
with a Metropass.
We'll be right back.
And we're clear.
What the hell was that?
Don, you said "brain fart."
Robin, you seem like a nice kid,
but this is my 39th local news show.
I've learned 3 things:
avoid the all-you-can-eat
sushi buffet in Bismarck,
do not go to the bathroom
with your lapel mic still on,
and three, at this hour,
your entire viewing audience is
one half-drunk slob sitting
in his underwear, so...
Back in five, four...
Well, let's do a great show
for that half-drunk slob.
Well, that half-drunk slob
appreciates it.
<i>The next day, Marshall found
himself craving a cigarette.</i>
<i>It was driving him crazy, so he
decided to get some fresh air.</i>
You're not up here to jump?
I fired a lot of people today.
I don't need another jumper in my file.
Cigarette?
No, no, thank you.
That's too bad.
You know what I miss, Jeffrey?
Getting to know
somebody over a smoke.
People are so interchangeable now,
but you share a butt with
somebody, you got a real bond.
You know what?
I will, I will take one.
I'm Marshall, by the way, it's Marshall,
Marshall Eriksen.
Tell me something, Marshall Eriksen.
How would you like to see
a picture of the cutest dog
in the world?
There he is. He's a good boy.
You smoked.
Yes, I smoked,
and it was my third of the day.
You know what that means?
I'm a smoker now. It's all over.
I even bought a pack on the way home
and a lighter and a Vikings lamp
which has nothing to do with anything,
I saw it in the window and I liked it.
Damn it, Marshall.
We already have four
Viking lamps and smoking kills.
It was a way to bond with my boss, OK?
You should have seen me up there.
That is a cute dog.
Are those your kids?
Yeah, whatever.
Look what I got at the mall.
There he is.
There he is.
Go ahead, you can pet him now.
Yeah, yeah, come on, he likes it.
Scratch him under the chin.
I don't care what your reasons are.
You know how I feel about smoking.
Now, give me the cigarettes.
And the lighter.
That's the stuff.
What?!
<i>Add your Aunt Lily to the list.</i>
<i>Whenever Uncle Marshall fell
off the wagon,</i>
<i>your Aunt Lily got dragged
right down with him.</i>
What you doing?
If you must know, I am reaching out
to City Hall to try to get
the mayor on our show.
Oh, my goodness, you are adorable,
but the mayor's not coming
on a show nobody watches.
My colonoscopy had
more viewers than this show.
At least that had
some twists and turns.
I don't know
why you're acting like this.
Maybe you're just bitter because
you never had a shot at a network job,
but I think I still do,
so I really need to focus.
I've been on a network.
You were on a network?
It was the best Labor Day
weekend of my life.
When you do the news,
you're in these ergonomic chairs.
It feels like you're sitting
on a cloud.
Which was nice 'cause it was
right after my colonoscopy.
- And the dressing rooms?
- There's dressing rooms?
You bet your sweet headset
there's dressing rooms, Mike.
No changing in the KFC
bathroom across the street.
No, sir.
It was heaven.
But the second you get used to it,
they go find someone
who isn't "going through a bitter
divorce" and doesn't "reek of gin,"
and before you know it,
you're stuck in a dead-end gig,
surrounded by people going nowhere,
doing the news in your tighty whities.
Okay, the underwear thing
was your choice,
and I don't like
that it's catching on.
Looking good, fellas.
Feels good, right?
God, I want to kill him.
Of course people watch the show.
You guys watch the show,
that's, like, two right there.
Oh, my God.
You guys still haven't seen my show.
- What? We never miss it.
- We've seen it!
Really? What color is the set?
It's... black.
- Right. Yeah.
- With, like, silver around the edges.
Not your TV set, my show set.
If even my best friends don't watch,
who's going to watch?
Lots of people.
You got bedridden insomniacs.
Bums camping
outside a department store.
People waiting in the ER,
where the TV is in a cage,
so you can't change the channel.
Do you have any stalkers?
Even Leonard won't watch my show.
Can't believe they are smoking.
It's freezing out.
Remember when you used to be able
to smoke in bars?
I think that hot girl over there
is smiling at me.
That's a chair.
But yeah, hit that.
Marco!
Polo!
Well, it's dividing our group
into smokers and non-smokers.
- And that's not healthy.
- You're right.
Let's smoke.
What?!
<i>I'm not proud of it.</i>
Look at you two.
Smokers.
Just like the rest of us.
I am not a smoker.
I only smoke in certain situations.
Postcoital, when I'm with Germans...
Sometimes those two overlap...
Coital, birthdays,
to annoy my mom,
precoital,
on a sailboat,
the day the Mets are mathematically
eliminated every year,
and, of course...
wait for it, 'cause Lord knows I have...
pregnancy scares.
Why are you smoking?
I'm always precoital, Ted.
You know,
maybe smoking's not so bad.
At least it gets us
out in the fresh air.
And all the coughing
really works my abs.
I... am...
ripped!
But, as glamorous as it was,
within a week,
we all hit our breaking point.
You okay, sweetie?
Actually, my throat's a bit sore.
So, I'm whapping him across the nose
with the newspaper, right? Yeah.
My wife says,
"You can't treat your son
like that."
I don't know.
Michael, call 911.
Right away.
Marshall, by the way.
I hope Arthur's okay.
Dibs on his office if he's not.
We have to quit smoking.
Honey, you said a mouthful.
I wish I never started.
I mean, I think back to myself
at 13 years old.
If I could only go
back to that moment...
I hate that little bastard.
Me, too.
Okay, that's it.
Let's quit.
Let's do it.
I am proud of you.
I have heard how difficult it is
for smokers like yourself to quit, so,
so, on behalf of nonsmokers,
I salute you, and I am here to help.
So, hand in your cigarettes.
I will get rid of them one at a time.
You're quitting, dollface.
I don't normally call you dollface,
but it kind of works in this voice.
Dollface.
I was just wondering,
is anyone else interviewing the Mayor
tomorrow on TV,
or is it just me?
Don can suck it while I suck this.
Light me, Marshall.
Actually, we've decided
that we're all quitting smoking.
That's fantastic.
I'm sick of you
bumming my cigarettes.
No, come on, Robin.
We can't do it unless we do it together.
You can sleep with Marshall.
Sorry, baby,
you got to take one for the team.
I don't want to sleep with Marshall.
I've seen the looks.
I can't quit right now.
Not before the interview of my life.
- It's too stressful.
- It's too stressful!
- Just one more.
- A cigarette!
Think about this for a second.
Bloomberg is the antismoking mayor.
You wanna show up to that interview
smelling like smoke?
It'd be like interviewing a vegetarian
smelling like a McRib.
Really? I'm not going through enough
right now?
You're quitting.
We're all quitting.
Fine. I'll quit.
Great.
We've to get through the first 24 hours.
After that, it's a cakewalk.
You have to bite your nails so loud?
I'm not biting my nails.
I'm trying to suck the leftover nicotine
out of my fingertips.
- Can you pass the onion rings?
- You got dinosaur arms? They're there.
What cigarettes are doing right now?
Think about us?
If you don't stop tapping your foot,
it's coming off.
Ted, I'm so sorry.
Maybe I should move it
a little bit closer to your ass!
<i>None of us knew
what we were fighting about.</i>
<i>We just knew we wanted to smoke.</i>
<i>More than anything in the world.</i>
It wasn't going very well
for Robin, either.
Sorry I'm late.
One used the microwave,
and the elevator stopped.
What are you doing?
Don, seriously, not tonight.
I'm on edge cause I quit smoking
for my interview, so just...
You precious little
porcelain unicorn, you.
- Why would you do that?
- Why?!
Because I care, Don.
I care about the show,
I care about my career.
Unlike you, you unprofessional jerk!
You're sloppy, you're rude.
I wish you worked half as hard
as the elastic on those underpants.
This is getting personal.
It would be personal if I would say
that the reason you bounce
from market to market
is because you're a loser...
a lazy, obnoxious, loser.
The Mayor canceled.
You think I'm a loser?
You're right. I'm a loser.
But at least I've accepted it.
A raccoon has been cheering up patients
at a local senior center.
I used to be just like that.
Always wanting more
and never getting it.
It's a dead end, Robin.
You're never gonna be
a network anchor.
Just like you're never gonna
quit smoking.
What are you doing?
I'm enjoying a cigarette.
That'll get you there.
That's good.
- You want a drag?
- Can we be professionals?
- Please?
- Professionals?
You know who's working the camera?
A chair.
We're on a show
where even the cameraman doesn't watch.
That's why the Mayor canceled.
And that's why Mike
is on a fried chicken run.
And that's why you and I can enjoy
a cigarette right here on the air.
Why?
Because of our millions and millions
of impressionable viewers?
If any viewers have a problem with this,
please give us a call.
The number's on the screen.
Come on, Robin...
Live a little.
That must be Mike.
He always forgets extra crispy.
Don't smoke!
We're all watching
and we're all very impressionable.
And I swear to God, if you smoke,
we're all going to smoke.
You guys are watching?
We sure are, sweetheart,
and you look fabulous.
You don't have to smoke.
Resist it, honey.
Thanks for the call, guys.
- She did it!
- Good for her.
We're not gonna smoke.
I've a pack stashed up on the roof.
I'm awake.
And I'm smoking!
You know how dangerous it is
to wake a sleep smoker?
It's fine.
I bought a pack on my way home.
Great show.
Yeah, but that Don guy, what a tool.
He actually apologized to me.
No, I mean when he stood up.
Those briefs were pretty revealing.
- You should date that guy.
- Not in this lifetime.
<i>They were dating within two months.
But more on that later.</i>
Look, the sun's coming up.
You know what right now
is a perfect time for?
A last cigarette ever.
A real last cigarette ever.
Damn it, let's do it.
All right.
Last cigarette ever
on the count of three.
<i>We all quit for a while after that.</i>
<i>But it wasn't
anyone's last cigarette.</i>
<i>But we did eventually
all quit smoking for real.</i>
<i>Robin's last cigarette
was in June 2013.</i>
<i>Barney's last cigarette
was in March 2017.</i>
<i>Lily's last cigarette was the day
she started trying to get pregnant.</i>
<i>And Marshall's last cigarette
was the day his son was born.</i>
<i>And my last cigarette?</i>
<i>Two weeks into dating your mother.</i>
<i>And I never looked back.</i>
I'm sorry I hit you.
I wanted to make it up to you,
by giving you this.
She's hot!
- Some day, you're going to marry her.
- No way.
We're pretty lucky.
Totally.
I'll be in my tent.
Don't do that.
Have fun for me.
<i>Vous savez jamais quand vous allez
rencontrer quelqu'un d'important.</i>
<i>C'est pas comme si
la vie vous prťvenait.</i>
<i>Vous levez les yeux, et voilŗ.</i>
Allez,
on va se dťfoncer sur le toit.
<i>Non, pas lui.</i>
<i>Elle.</i>
Sans moi, Boomer.
Je suis pas Boomer.
Dans ma tÍte, si.
Messieurs, je suis enseignant,
et vous Ítes trop jeunes,
il est de mon devoir
de confisquer Áa,
et Áa, et...
Du Champomy ?
Tu peux garder Áa, tu sais.
Chaque semaine, un looser
m'invite ŗ une fÍte, et je rťponds :
"Je suis en doctorat,
j'ťcris une dissertation intitulťe :
<i>Investissements ťtrangers
et liens intergťnťrationnels</i>
<i>dans la consommation.</i>"
Et que rťpond le looser ?
"C'est sexy."
Mais c'est plutŰt sexy.
Ted, j'ai une confession.
Je te reconnais.
Tu te souviens du premier cours
du semestre dernier ?
…conomie 305 ?
<i>Vous vous souvenez
quand je me suis trompť de classe.</i>
<i>Je croyais Ítre en Architecture 101,
mais c'ťtait …conomie 305.</i>
<i>Bien sŻr, je ne savais pas</i>
<i>que votre mŤre ťtait lŗ,</i>
<i>et qu'elle pensait
que j'ťtais dťbile.</i>
Tu ťtais dťbile.
Mais un idiot trŤs mignon.
Et...
tu sors avec des idiots mignons ?
Presque toujours.

Elle est en doctorat,
elle aime lire de la philosophie,
elle fait les mots croisťs du dimanche,
et elle les finit.
Ted, je suis si content pour toi...
Pardon,
pas pour toi,
content de pas Ítre toi.
Pour faire court,
j'ai un rencard ce soir.
Merci New York,
je vais essayer de pas merder.
Qu'y a t-il ?
Il y a la queue devant MacLaren's.
Pourquoi c'est que des mecs ?
Seules deux choses
peuvent crťer de genre d'agitation.
Des seins.
Mesdames et messieurs,
MacLaren's a engagť
une barmaid canon.
Regardez tous ces mecs.
Le trottoir va sentir
le pipi maintenant.
On ferait mieux
de trouver un autre bar.
Quoi ? T'es folle ?
C'est une barmaid canon.
Tu sais depuis combien de temps
je veux me faire une...
Mes amis, j'ai ťtť avec
beaucoup de femmes jusqu'ici.
Avocates, professeurs,
poťtesses, docteurs,
cavaliŤres professionnelles,
cavaliŤres amateurs...
Une bouchŤre, une boulangŤre,
une chandeliŤre...
Oui, maintenant Áa rime...
une archťologue, une oenologue,
une astrologue...
une marionnettiste, une fleuriste,
une mŤre au foyer...
c'est un boulot, les gars...
- une juge d'instruction...
- Accouche !
Je n'ai jamais, Ű grand jamais,
sautť une barmaid canon
jusqu'ŗ ce soir.
Elle est pas si canon.
On est jalouse ?
On s'est imaginť
Ítre la plus canon du bar ?
Non. Tais-toi !
- J'y vais.
- «a n'arrivera jamais.
Elle va faire semblant
de t'apprťcier
comme elle a hypnotisť
tous ces gťnies.
Devine qui ne tombera pas
sous son charme ?
Je vais faire,
"ArrÍte de jouer, poupťe.
Papa veut un gin et tonic."
Quand elle l'apportera, je vais
le recracher et dire, "Essaie encore".
Le m‚le dominant
est oý il doit Ítre :
au dessus, et aprŤs quelques minutes,
en dessous.
Pourquoi je devrais tout faire ?
Quoi de neuf ?
Une nouvelle barmaid canon.
Tu vois ? Marshall pense pas
qu'elle est canon.
Si.
Inutile de faire comme si
les autres femmes ťtaient moches
pour mon bien.
Je sais, et si cette femme
ťtait presque aussi canon
que ma femme, je l'admettrais,
mais elle ne l'est pas.
Bťbť, t'es gentil,
mais comparťe ŗ elle,
Je suis moche comme un pou.
Je dis ce que je pense, et...
Je pense que tu es
la plus belle femme au monde.
Vous voyez, c'est agaÁant.
Mon Dieu, t'es tellement drŰle.
- «a fait 6.75 $.
- Voilŗ 50 $, garde la monnaie.
Merci.
Amateurs.
- Tu veux quoi ?
- ArrÍte de jouer, poupťe...
Attends, quoi ?
Tu commandes
ou tu restes lŗ bÍtement ?
Je sais pas faire de hum.
C'est moitiť vodka
moitiť barre-toi†?
Bobbie, comment Áa va ?
<i>Plus tard ce soir-lŗ, j'ai eu
un premier rencard trŤs important.</i>
- «a va ?
- Bien.
<i>C'est marrant,
vous allez quelque part</i>
<i>oý vous n'Ítes jamais allť
mais vous avez la sensation</i>
<i>que vous Ítes exactement
lŗ oý vous devez.</i>
<i>Les enfants, c'ťtait la premiŤre fois
que je voyais son bus jaune.</i>
<i>Vous savez ?</i>
<i>Il est juste derriŤre.</i>
C'est mignon.
C'est ŗ ma colocataire.
<i>Donc les enfants, j'ťtais
dans l'appart de votre mŤre.</i>
<i>Oubliez le fait que j'avais un rencard
avec sa coloc, Cindy.</i>
Dťsolť,
je devrais pas toucher
ŗ ses affaires.
Elle est comment ?
<i>Je l'ignorais,
mais j'allais entendre</i>
<i>la toute premiŤre description
de la femme que j'allais ťpouser...</i>
C'est une salope.
Je crois que c'est une dominatrice.
Quoi ?
Dťsolťe, il n'y a rien de vrai.
- J'ai un peu le complexe de la coloc.
- Pourquoi ?
Tous les mecs
tombent amoureux d'elle.
…coute-moi.
Je te promets
que je tomberais jamais
amoureux de ta coloc.
Maintenant que tu l'as vue de plus prŤs,
admets-le,
la barmaid est la femme
la plus sexy de ce bar.
DeuxiŤme plus sexy.
Encore...
Bťbť, comment tu peux
ne pas avoir envie d'elle ?
J'ai envie d'elle.
Si t'as pas envie d'elle,
dťsolťe, mais tu dois Ítre gay.
Oui, je suis gay.
Gay pour toi seule.
Peu importe.
Pourquoi
je suis le seul mec dans ce bar
qu'elle repousse ?
Bah,
tu vas pas aimer la rťponse.
Mes trois derniers copains ťtaient
des mecs de Wall Street... salauds,
donc, j'ai jurť de ne plus jamais
sortir avec un mec en costume.
Bien, c'est simple.
Je vais arrÍter les costumes.
C'est tout ?
Tu n'es jamais sans costume.
C'est vrai...
mais pour eux... pour Áa...
je veux dire pour elle...
J'arrÍterai de porter des...
- attendez...
- Tu vas dire "costumes".
... costumes.
<i>Pendant ce temps,
on passait une bonne soirťe,</i>
<i>sauf qu'elle plaisantait pas
sur son complexe.</i>
Un autre truc bizarre sur ma coloc.
Elle peint des robots
faisant du sport.
C'est bizarre.
<i>Je mentais.
«a semblait gťnial.</i>
<i>Son aquarelle du Robot Volleyeur</i>
<i>est accrochťe dans le salon
en ce moment.</i>
Et elle a cette habitude
de faire chanter
les petits dťjeuners.
C'est trŤs bizarre.
<i>L'interprťtation de "Memories"</i>
<i>chantť par un muffin anglais
est ŗ ce jour,</i>
<i>la chose la plus envoŻtante
que j'ai entendue.</i>
Tu m'as convaincu.
Je hais cette fille.
Dťsolťe.
Elle n'est pas si mal.
Je suis juste un peu jalouse.
Je sais pas pourquoi.
Tu es super.
<i>Mais pas si gťniale que votre mŤre.</i>
<i>Et en parlant de choses
moins gťniales,</i>
<i>Barney avait officiellement
retirť son costume.</i>
Je suis dťsolťe,
je vous ai mal jugť.
S'il y a bien un type
que je peux pas supporter,
c'est un homme en costume.
«a et les femmes qui n'ont
aucun respect d'elle-mÍme.
Costumes et femmes hťsitantes.
Je dťteste.
Je dťteste.
Comment Áa s'est passť avec Cindy ?
Hier, c'ťtait super,
aujourd'hui pas trop.
Pourquoi ?
Le rŤglement de la fac
au sujet des ťlŤves et des profs
qui sortent ensemble, est trŤs strict.
Je peux perdre ma bourse.
Oui, mais tu n'es pas
dans ma classe.
On est mÍme pas
dans la mÍme section.
Dťsolťe, je veux pas
prendre le risque.
Elle exagŤre, non ?
En fait, Ted, elle a raison.
Rťflťchis.
Les rŤgles sont si strictes
que Áa pourrait nuire ŗ ton travail.
Je pense que tu dois
la laisser partir, mec.
Essayons encore, elle exagŤre, non ?
<i>Bien sŻr, ils avaient raison.
J'ai dŻ la laisser partir,</i>
<i>mais Barney allait dťcouvrir,</i>
<i>que c'ťtait pas si facile de laisser
aller les choses.</i>
<i>Costume.</i>
<i>Personne n'avait vu Barney
rester si longtemps sans costume,</i>
<i>et les enfants, c'ťtait pas joli.</i>
Dťsolť d'Ítre en retard.
J'ťtais bloquť au boulot.
J'avais cette rťunion sur les risques
fiscaux des dividendes dťlocalisťs.
Bien sŻr.
Je me souviens trŤs bien.
Donc, je lance le PowerPoint...
<i>Enfile-moi.</i>
On va commander ŗ manger.
J'arrive dans une seconde.
Laissez passer !
Reste avec moi.
Ton heure n'est pas venue.
<i>Si quelqu'un pouvait rťparer Áa,
c'ťtait le tailleur de Barney,</i>
<i>Tim Gunn.</i>
Dťsolť, Barney.
Je n'ai rien pu faire.
Si jeune.
On ne peut plus rien faire ?
Un autre costume pourrait utiliser
les boutons de ton costume.
Et faire...
comme un don d'organes ?
La mort de ton costume
pourrait en faire vivre un autre.
Mais je...
Fais-le.
C'est le bon choix.
Ne te lamente pas pour Áa.
- C'est de la soie.
- Dťsolť.
Je sais.
On a incinťrť ses restes.
Ses boutons ont sauvť
une petite veste malade
des quartiers riches.
Tu peux enfin abandonner ta quÍte
de la soi-disant barmaid canon.
Mon costume a donnť sa vie
pour cette cause,
et je ne m'arrÍterai
que lorsque ces sei...
enfin, cette cho...
euh, cette fille
sera mienne.
Il a raison.
Qui ? Le gars qui embrasse
les cendres d'un costume ?
Si Cindy ťtait destinťe ŗ Ítre
ma femme et que je ne fais rien ?
Adieu, chŤre maison accueillante
de Westchester
ŗ taux bas, que je peux acheter
sans toucher ŗ mes ťconomies.
Au revoir mes deux enfants,
ťlevťs avec sťvťritť et amour,
trouvant le juste ťquilibre
entre pŤre et copain.
<i>Adios</i>, mes trois chiens,
Frank, Lloyd and Wright.
Le fait est
que je n'abandonne pas.
Je sais pas pourquoi j'ai fait Áa.
Je suis dťsolťe pour ton ami.
Raconte.
Il ťtait italien.
Plein de classe, ťlťgant.
Et il savait y faire
avec les femmes.
Elles ne rťsistaient pas.
- Quel ‚ge ?
- Sept ans.
Il me manque tellement.
Tu devrais pas rester seul.
Je finis mon service.
Merci, mon vieux.
Tu sors avec un canon.
Enfin, Marshall, admets
qu'elle est plus jolie que moi.
Je m'en fiche.
Je peux pas.
- Tu es plus jolie.
- C'est une dťesse.
Sa peau brille.
Ses jambes n'ont pas de fin.
Et ce cul ?
J'en ferai mÍme mon chapeau.
Je l'admets, l'autre soir,
j'ai pensť ŗ elle
deux ou trois fois.
Qu'est-ce que...
Tu la trouves plus jolie que moi ?
J'ai jamais dit Áa.
- Si.
- «a n'a rien ŗ voir.
Elle est plus jeune que toi.
Alors, tu choisirais qui,
entre elle et moi,
dans la fleur de l'‚ge ?
Sa beautť n'est mÍme pas rťelle.
Sa beautť est ŗ la mode.
Regardez.
Elle aussi,
elle est plus belle que moi ?
- Tu fais quoi, lŗ ?
- Hein ?
C'est interdit d'Ítre ici.
Carl, je veux pas retourner lŗ-bas.
Me force pas ŗ y retourner.
Tu dois y aller.
J'ťtais quelqu'un derriŤre ce bar.
Tout le monde m'aimait.
On peut parler ?
Ma coloc va sortir de la douche.
Allons dans ma chambre.
Je sais que le rŤglement dit
qu'on ne peut pas sortir ensemble.
Il dit aussi "N'enseigne pas bourrť"
et je le fais tout le temps.
En fait,
je t'aime bien.
Tu es douce, drŰle.
Ton mťmoire s'intitule
"Investissements ťtrangers directs
et liens intergťnťrationnels
et comportement de consommateur."
C'est sexy !
«a a l'air dingue...
J'ai le sentiment
que nos chemins devaient se croiser.
Je veux pas passer ŗ cŰtť de Áa.
Je ne veux pas rater Áa non plus.
Je peux dire
qu'en regardant ta chambre,
nous avons ťnormťment en commun.
Vraiment ?
Les licornes ?
Qui coupera nos cheveux
quand on sera plus lŗ ?
Je connais personne
qui ait cet album.
C'est ŗ ma coloc, je l'ai empruntť.
Et Áa ?
La fin du monde, de T.C. Boyle ?
Cadeau d'anniversaire...
de ma coloc.
Je l'ai pas encore lu.
Tu devrais. C'est trŤs bon.
Et Áa ? C'est ridicule.
Tu joues de la basse ?
Demande ŗ mes amis.
Je dis toujours
que ma femme idťale...
ne joue pas de la basse,
c'est ŗ ta coloc.
- Elle a un groupe.
- Merde, trop cool.
C'est incroyable.
Tu as choisi les trois seules choses
qui sont ŗ ma coloc.
- Le groupe de ta coloc...
- Dehors.
<i>Comme vous l'avez compris,</i>
<i>j'ai pas connu votre mŤre
ce soir-lŗ.</i>
<i>MÍme si j'ai dŻ apercevoir son pied.</i>
<i>Mais j'ai presque rencontrť
la femme de mes rÍves.</i>
<i>Et votre mŤre...</i>
<i>Elle a rťcupťrť son parapluie.</i>
C'ťtait tellement spťcial,
tu sais ?
On devrait faire
une minute de silence.
Suivi d'environ 20 minutes
de grognements.
Je vais te remonter le moral.
- Je vais me rafraÓchir.
- D'accord.
C'est pas la salle de bains !
C'est ŗ toi ?
Je les garde pour un ami.
Barney, tu m'as menti.
Tu dois choisir tout de suite.
Moi... ou les costumes ?
<i>Vous pensez, "ņ quoi marche Barney ?"
Cette fille est trop canon !</i>
<i>J'aurais pu me la faire, pas de soucis.
Car elle ne m'a pas dit non.</i>
<i>Me faire une 10 serait trop bien,</i>
<i>mais je prťfŤre Ítre sur mon 31 !</i>
<i>Vous pouvez pas dire le contraire...</i>
<i>Rien me va mieux qu'un costume !</i>
<i>J'imagine un monde oý tous
seraient parfaitement habillťs !</i>
<i>Ce livreur en costume-cravate.
Ce chiot en smoking !</i>
<i>Ce mec des annťes 80
et rouflaquettes !</i>
<i>Ce bťbť avec une sucette !</i>
<i>Cette femme flic
qui est plutŰt jolie !</i>
<i>Il n'y a que le costume qui va !</i>
<i>Un copilote tel un gant !</i>
<i>Ils sont si ťlťgants !</i>
<i>Le moyen de se faire une fille
avec des problŤmes parentaux !</i>
<i>En noir ou en blanc !</i>
<i>Regardez ce portant</i>
<i>Je veux les serrer tout contre moi !</i>
<i>Vraiment !</i>
<i>Alors, rťponds ŗ ces questions,</i>
<i>s'il te plaÓt.</i>
<i>Que ferais-tu si tu avais le choix
entre un costume et un chaudron d'or ?</i>
<i>Que dirais-tu de donner tes costumes
et en ťchange, ne jamais vieillir ?</i>
<i>Choisis : un million de filles,
ou un simple trois-piŤces ?</i>
Nase.
<i>Et si la paix ťtait ŗ ta portťe ?</i>
Laisse-moi t'arrÍter.
C'est les costumes.
Enfin, remets les pieds sur terre.
<i>Deux, trois, quatre !</i>
<i>Les filles vont et viennent,</i>
<i>mais il n'y a qu'une vťritť !</i>
<i>Chaque pote en rut doit savoir</i>
<i>qu'aucun substitut n'est acceptť !</i>
<i>Dťsolť les costumes,
mais je vous le dis,</i>
<i>ceux du dimanche
sont mes meilleurs amis !</i>
<i>Envoyez vendredi dťcontractť</i>
<i>au panier ŗ linge...</i>
<i>Car rien ne vaut</i>
<i>l'incontestť !</i>
<i>Souvent saluť, admirť et rťputť...</i>
Attendez...
Encore une fois,
elle est plutŰt canon.
Je te choisis toi.
DŤs la premiŤre heure,
je m'en dťbarrasse.
SŻr ?
Ne craignez rien.
<i>Kids, you never know when you're about
to meet someone really important.</i>
<i>It's not like life gives you
a warning.</i>
<i>You just look up and there they are.</i>
Come on, we're going to
go get trashed on the roof.
<i>No, not that dude.</i>
<i>Her.</i>
I'm good, Boomer.
My name's not Boomer.
In my head, it is.
Gentlemen, I'm a faculty member,
and you're underage,
so it's my duty to confiscate this
and this and...
hard lemonade?
You know what?
You can keep that.
I swear, every week I get asked
by some frat guy to a kegger, and I say,
"I'm a PhD candidate writing
a dissertation entitled
'Foreign Direct Investment
and Intergenerational Linkages
in Consumption Behavior.'"
And what does Frat Guy say to that?
"That's hot."
Actually, that is kind of hot.
Ted, I have a confession.
I recognize you.
Do you rember the first day
of classes last semester?
Econ 305?
<i>Kids, you remember
the wrong classroom story.</i>
<i>I thought I was in Architecture 101,
but it was Econ 305.</i>
<i>Of course, what I didn't know was</i>
<i>that your mother was
somewhere in that class,</i>
<i>and she thought
I was a complete idiot.</i>
I thought you were a complete idiot.
But a very cute idiot.
So...
do you ever date cute idiots?
Almost exclusively.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

She's a PhD candidate,
she reads philosophy for fun,
she does the Sunday crossword
every week and finishes it.
Ted, I am so happy for you...
Sorry,
not for you, happy I'm not you.
Long story short:
I have a date tonight.
Thanks, New York,
I'll try not to screw it up.
What's going on?
There's a huge line outside MacLaren's.
And why is it almost entirely dudes?
Only two things could cause
that kind of commotion.
Boobs.
<i>She's my cherry pie...</i>
Ladies and gentlemen,
MacLaren's has hired
a hot bartender.
<i>Sweet cherry pie, yeah.</i>
Look at all these guys.
The sidewalk's going to smell
like pee-pee now.
Well, we'd better start
looking for a new bar.
What, are you crazy?
It is a hot bartender.
Do you know how long
I have been waiting to land a...
My friends, I have been
with many women in my day.
Lawyers, teachers, poets, doctors,
professional equestrians,
amateur equestrians...
A butcher, a baker,
a candlestick maker...
Yes, we're
to the rhyming section now...
a math professor, a tax assessor,
a weight guesser...
A puppeteer, a blackjack dealer,
a stay-at-home mom...
that's a job, too, guys...
- a circuit court judge...
- Get to the point!
I have never, ever
scored a hot bartender
until tonight.
She's really not that hot.
Is someone jealous
of all the attention?
Did somebody fancy herself
the hottest girl in the bar?
Gosh, no. Shut up!
- Wish me luck.
- It's never going to happen.
Barney, she's just going
to pretend to like you
the same way she hypnotized
all these geniuses.
But guess who's not going
to fall under her spell?
I'm gonna be all,
"Drop the act, baby doll.
Daddy needs a gin and tonic."
Then when she brings it, I'm gonna just
spit it out and say, "Try again."
Boom! Alpha dog is
right where he belongs:
on top, then after a few minutes,
on the bottom.
Why should I do all the work?
What's happening?
New superhot bartender.
See? Marshall doesn't think
she's hot either.
He does.
Baby, you don't have to pretend
other women aren't attractive
just for my sake.
I know, and if that woman
were anywhere near as hot
as the woman I'm married
to, then I'd admit it, but she's not.
Baby, you're so sweet,
but compared to that woman,
I am a big bag
three days old garbage.
Well, I call 'em like
I see 'em, and...
I just think you're the most
beautiful woman in the world.
See, that's just annoying.
Oh, my God, you are so funny.
- That'll be $6.75.
- Here's a 50, keep the change.
Thank you.
Amateurs.
- What do you want?
- Drop the act, baby doll...
wait, what?
Are you gonna order a drink or are you
just gonna stand there looking stupid?
I don't know how to make an um.
Is that equal parts vodka
and get-the-hell-out-of-my-face?
Bobbie, what's going on?
Later that night, I embarked
upon a very important first date.
- How are you?
- Good.
<i>It's funny,
sometimes you walk into a place</i>
<i>you've never been before,
but you get the feeling</i>
<i>you're exactly
where you're supposed to be.</i>
<i>And kids, that's the first time I ever
saw your mother's little yellow bus.</i>
<i>You know the one.</i>
<i>It's right behind you.</i>
This is cute.
Actually, it's my roommate's.
<i>So, there I was, kids, standing
in your mother's apartment,</i>
<i>Never mind the fact that I was
on a date with her roommate Cindy.</i>
Sorry,
I shouldn't be messing
with your roommate's stuff.
What's she like?
<i>I didn't know it,
but I was about to hear</i>
<i>the very first description
of the woman I'd one day marry.</i>
She's a whore.
I think she's a dominatrix.
What?
Okay, I'm sorry,
none of that is true.
- I have a bit of a roommate complex.
- Why?
Guys are always falling
in love with her.
Look at me.
I promise you
I am not going to fall
in love with your roommate.
<i>Oops.</i>
Okay, now that you've had
a closer look, admit it:
That bartender is
the hottest woman in this bar.
Second hottest.
I repeat...
Baby, how could you
not want to hit that?
Iwant to hit that.
If you don't want to hit that,
I'm sorry, but you might be gay.
Hell, yeah, I'm gay.
Gay for you.
Whatever.
Did you find out why
I'm the one guy in this
entire bar she seems to despise?
I did...
You're not going to like the answer.
My last three boyfriends were
Wall Street guys... bastards,
so I vowed never again to date
a guy who wears suits.
Okay, well, that's easy.
All I have to do is
stop wearing suits.
That's all?
Come on, you're never not in a suit.
True...
but for those... I mean, for that...
I mean, for her...
I will stop wearing...
- wait for it...
- We know you're going to say "suits."
... suits.
<i>Meanwhile, Cindy and I
were having a lovely evening,</i>
<i>except she wasn't kidding
about her roommate complex.</i>
And another weird thing
about my roommate:
She does these bizarre paintings
of robots playing sports.
That is weird.
<i>I was lying.
That sounded awesome.</i>
<i>Your mother's
Robot Volleyball watercolor</i>
<i>is hanging up
in the den as we speak.</i>
And she has this crazy habit
of making breakfast food
sing show tunes.
That's just bizarre.
<i>Your mother's rendition
of "Memories"</i>
<i>as performed by an
English muffin is, to this day,</i>
<i>the most hauntingly beautiful
thing I've ever heard.</i>
Look, I'm sold.
I hate this girl.
I'm sorry.
Look, she's not that bad.
I just get a little jealous.
I don't know why.
You're awesome.
<i>But not as awesome as your mother.</i>
<i>And speaking of things
that are less awesome,</i>
<i>your Uncle Barney
had officially suited down.</i>
I am so sorry, I misjudged you.
If there is one type of person
that I cannot stand,
it is a man in a suits.
That and a woman
who has no respect for herself.
Suits and insecure women.
I hate 'em.
Just hate 'em.
How was your date with Cindy?
Well, last night was
great, today not so much.
What, why?
I found out the school's policy
about students and professors
dating is really strict.
I could lose my scholarship.
Yeah, but it's not
like you're in my class.
We're not even
in the same department.
I'm sorry, but I just can't risk it.
She's completely
overreacting, right?
Actually, Ted, she has a point.
Yeah, and think about it.
If the rules are that strict,
you could be putting
your job in jeopardy.
I think, I think you got
to let this one go, buddy.
Let's try this again:
she's completely overreacting, right?
<i>Of course, they were right.
I had to let it go,</i>
<i>but as your Uncle Barney
was about to find out,</i>
<i>it's not so easy to let things go.</i>
<i>Suit up.</i>
<i>Now, none of us had ever seen Barney
go this long without suiting up,</i>
<i>and kids, it wasn't pretty.</i>
So sorry I'm late.
I got stuck at work.
You know, today I had that presentation
on offshore dividend tax implications?
Sure, I was totally paying attention
when you talked about that.
Right,
so I fire up the PowerPoint...
<i>Suit up.</i>
We're going to order some food.
Okay, be out in a sec.
Out of the way!
Stay with me.
It's not your time.
<i>If anyone could fix something like this,
it was Barney's personal tailor,</i>
<i>TV's Tim Gunn.</i>
I'm sorry, Barney.
I couldn't make it work.
So young.
There's nothing else you could do?
But there is another suit
that can use the buttons from your suit.
That can...
Like an organ donor?
Your suit's death
could mean another suit's life.
But I...
Do it.
You're doing the right thing.
Please don't cry on this.
- It's silk.
- I'm sorry.
I know.
We cremated the remains.
His buttons saved the life
of a sick little jacket
on the Upper East Side.
Well, at least now
you can finally drop this quest
for the so-called Hot Bartender.
My suit gave its life
for this cause,
and I will not rest until those...
I mean, that...
I mean,
is mine.
He's absolutely right.
Who, the guy kissing a jar
full of dead suit ashes, that guy?
What if Cindy is the woman I'm supposed
to marry, and I'm just giving up?
So long, elegant,
yet welcoming home in Westchester
with a sensible mortgage I can handle
without dipping into my savings.
Bye-bye, two kids I raised with a stern,
yet loving hand,
finding the perfect balance
between father and friend.
Adios, triplet schnauzers,
Frank, Lloyd and Wright.
The point is,
I'm not giving up, either!
I don't know why I just did that.
Barney,
I'm so sorry about your friend.
Tell me about him.
He was Italian.
Classy, elegant.
And boy,
did he have a way with the ladies.
They just couldn't say no.
- How old was he?
- Seven.
I miss him so much!
You shouldn't be alone tonight.
I'm gonna end my shift early.
Thank you, old friend.
You're going out with a bang.
Come on, Marshall.
Just admit that she's hotter than me.
I won't be hurt.
Can't do it.
- You're hotter.
- She's a goddess!
Her skin glows.
Her legs go for miles.
And that ass?
I would wear that thing for a hat.
Last night in bed, I'll admit it,
she popped into my head
a couple of times.
What are you try...
Like,
you think she's hotter than me?
I never said that.
- You do.
- It's apples and oranges.
She's younger than you.
I'm just saying, like,
me in my prime
versus her in her prime.
You guys,
her hotness isn't even real!
It's circumstantial hotness.
Watch.
II suppose you think
she's hotter than me, too.
What the hell are you doing?
You're not allowed back here.
Carl, look, I don't want to go back.
Please, don't make me go back.
You got to go.
I was somebody back there!
Everybody loved me.
Can we talk?
My roommate's about to get out
of the shower. Let's talk in my room.
Cindy, I know the University Rulebook
says we can't date.
But it also says, "Don't teach drunk,"
and I do that all the time.
The point is,
I like you.
I do.
You're sweet, you're funny.
You're writing a dissertation,
Foreign Direct Investment
and Intergenerational Linkages
and Consumption Behavior.
I mean, that is hot.
I know this sounds crazy, but...
I feel like our paths
are supposed to cross somehow.
I don't want
to miss out on knowing you.
I don't want
to miss out on knowing you, either.
I got to tell you,
Just from looking around your room,
I can tell we have a ton in common.
Really?
The Unicorns?
Who Will Cut Our Hair
When We're Gone?
I have never met anyone else
who has this album.
That's my roommate's.
I borrowed it.
What about this?
World's End by T.C. Boyle?
That was a birthday gift...
from my roommate.
Haven't checked it out yet.
You should.
It's a good read.
What about this?
It's ridiculous.
You play bass?
Seriously, ask my friends.
I always say, my ideal woman...
does not play bass,
because this is clearly your roommate's.
She's in a band.
Damn, that's cool.
This is unbelievable.
You picked out the only three things
in here that are my roommate's.
- Does your roommate's band...
- Get out.
<i>Kids, as you probably guessed,</i>
<i>that wasn't the night
I met your mother.</i>
<i>Although I think
I glimpsed her foot.</i>
<i>But I did get a little bit closer
to meeting the woman of my dreams.</i>
And your mom...
<i>well, she got
her yellow umbrella back.</i>
It was just so special,
you know?
I feel like we should give him
a moment of silence.
Followed by, like,
20 minutes of grunting.
I'm gonna make you feel all better.
- Let me just go freshen up.
- All right.
Wait, that's not the bathroom!
Are these yours?
I'm suit-sitting for someone.
Barney, you lied to me.
You have to choose right now.
Me... or the suits.
<i>You're thinkin', "What's Barney
been drinkin'?" That girl's smokin' hot!</i>
<i>I coulda nailed her, but it's not
a failure. There's one thing she is not</i>
<i>To score a ten would be just fine,</i>
<i>but I'd rather be dressed
to the nines!</i>
<i>It's a truth you can't refute...</i>
<i>Nothin' suits me like a suit!</i>
<i>Picture a world Where all the boys
and girls are impeccably well-dressed!</i>
<i>That delivery guy in a jacket and tie.
That puppy in a double breast!</i>
<i>That eighties dude with muttonchops!</i>
<i>That baby with a lollipop!</i>
<i>That lady cop who's kinda cute!</i>
<i>Nothing suits them like a suit!</i>
<i>A wingman I can wear!</i>
<i>They're so debonair!</i>
<i>The perfect way to snare a girl
with daddy issues!</i>
<i>In navy blue or black!</i>
<i>Check out this perfect rack</i>
<i>I want to give them a squeeze!</i>
<i>Really!</i>
<i>Then answer these questions,</i>
<i>If you please.</i>
<i>What would you do if you had to choose
between your suits and a pot of gold?</i>
<i>What would you say if you gave
your suits and you'd never grow old?</i>
<i>What would you pick: one million chicks,
or a single three-piece suit?</i>
It's moot.
<i>What if peace
were within your reach?</i>
I'm gonna stop you right there.
It's suits.
Come on,
get your head out of your ass.
<i>Two, three, four!</i>
<i>Girls will go and girls will come,</i>
<i>but there's only one absolute!</i>
<i>Every bro on the go needs to know</i>
<i>that there's no accepted substitute!</i>
<i>I'm sorry, suits, let's make amends,</i>
<i>my Sunday best are my best friends!</i>
<i>Send Casual Friday down</i>
<i>the laundry chute...</i>
<i>'Cause nothing suits</i>
<i>the undisputed!</i>
<i>Oft-saluted suitor of repute...</i>
Wait for it.
Then again, she is pretty hot.
I choose you, baby.
First thing tomorrow,
I'm getting rid of these suits.
Really?
You guys are fine.
<i>Les enfants,
pour un trentenaire, à New York,</i>
<i>il y a des endroits à éviter :</i>
<i>Times Square à la St Sylvestre,</i>
<i>Rockefeller Center à Noël...</i>
<i>Mais surtout...</i>
Un bar étudiant ?
On va croiser mes élèves.
Ils vont me coincer pour un cours.
J'ai même pas
mon projecteur à diapos. Mince.
Je suis champion de Skee-Ball
depuis la fac.
Je viens chaque mois
pour montrer que je suis le boss.
Ça fait un moment que t'es pas venu.
Un certain "Gros Caramel"
a pulvérisé les scores.
Ouais.
- Et tu es "Gros Caramel".
- Le plus gros.
Au fait, je dois te dire un truc.
J'ai invité Jenkins.
Jenkins ? Non, pas ça.
<i>Il nous en avait parlé
quelques semaines plus tôt.</i>
Vous ne croirez jamais
ce que Jenkins a fait.
- C'est qui, Jenkins ?
- Un nouvel avocat désopilant
qui bosse avec Marshall.
Désopilant.
Dans le frigo du boulot,
il y a ces cerises au marasquin.
Jenkins dit :
"Pour 200 billets,
je bouffe tout le pot".
Alors, on lui a donné 200 billets...
et Jenkins a mangé tout le pot !
<i>Et ce fut le début des histoires.</i>
Le directeur financier
vient pour signer des papiers.
Jenkins dit :
"Excusez-moi, M. Wilcox.
"On a oublié une page du dossier".
On va au bar après le boulot.
Jenkins monte sur le bar,
et commence à danser
comme un strip-teaseur.
Et tout à coup,
il commence à enlever sa chemise.
C'était énorme.
Dingue, hein ?
Ça va être bien
de rencontrer enfin Jenkins.
après toutes ces histoires.
Et une autre
est sur le point d'arriver.
Je vais me taper Jenkins.
- Quoi ?
- T'as pigé ?
Tu veux coucher avec Jenkins ?
Avec Jenkins, sur Jenkins,
à côté de Jenkins.
Appelle ça comme tu veux.
Je veux l'enfiler comme un gant.
Mais tu...
Et si... je suis...
- Ah bon ?
- Salut.
Ted, voici Jenkins.

Ça va te sembler dingue,
mais je croyais que c'était un mec.
N'importe quoi.
Pourquoi t'as pensé ça ?
Je sais pas. L'histoire où Jenkins
pisse par la fenêtre du taxi.
Ça t'en bouche un coin, hein ?
Je t'explique.
Tout a commencé il y a peu.
Au fait, binoclard, nouveau collègue.
Voici Jenkins.
Méfie-toi. C'est un voleur.
Mais non.
Et je porte pas de lunettes.
- Marshall.
- Salut.
T'es un fan des Vikings,
ou il mentait aussi là-dessus ?
Pourquoi ? C'est un piège ?
T'es fan des Packers ?
Ma femme sait que je suis ici.
Elle est pas riche,
mais elle est bourrée de qualités.
Je suis une fan des Vikings.
Mon sang est violet et doré.
- Je suis de Pelican Rapids.
- Pelican Rapids ?
Ça alors.
Mon grand-père y vit.
Il est mort maintenant,
mais il hante une ferme de la route 108.
Attends, mec.
Si tu me dis que t'es attiré
par une autre femme,
je vais devoir te botter le cul.
Alors, d'abord...
Tu peux pas te mesurer
à "Gros Caramel".
Ensuite, non.
Je la vois comme... un grand frère.
Qui aurait des seins.
Comme mon grand frère Marvin Jr.,
en fait.
Cette nuit-là,
j'ai parlé de Jenkins.
J'ai hâte de le rencontrer.
J'aurais dû la corriger.
Ça aurait été si facile.
Mais je l'ai pas fait,
et dès que je parlais de Jenkins,
j'évitais les pronoms...
Le chef du marketing entre
pour choisir les gens de l'audit.
Et il dit :
"Lui, et lui, et elle,
et lui, et lui...
"et Jenkins, et lui, et elle."
Pourquoi tu lui dirais pas ?
Elle serait jalouse à ce point ?
Repense à toutes ces histoires.
Ça peut poser problème.
Tout à fait.
Lily ne doit pas le découvrir.
Pas découvrir quoi ?
Que Marshall
va lui acheter un cheval.
Ah bon ?
C'est trop bien !
J'adore ces bestioles.
Pourquoi ce gamin me dévisage ?
Je crois savoir.
Je crois que c'est enfin arrivé.
Mon émission m'a fait connaître.
Robin, c'est trop mignon.
C'est Scotty, un de mes élèves,
et c'est moi qu'il regarde.
Je suis plus célèbre que toi.
Tu te trompes.
Moi, je passe à la télé.
Moi, j'ai 30 élèves.
Ça fait 30 fois ton audience ?
Un peu plus,
et il va payer un verre à son prof.
Très bien, Scotter,
une question sur le néoclassique,
et c'est tout.
- Robin Scherbatsky, c'est ça ?
- Quoi ?
C'est ça.
Je voulais pas vous fixer.
Je rate jamais votre émission.
- Vraiment ?
- Vraiment ?
Oh oui !
- Vous faites quoi avec Ted ?
- C'est professeur Mosby.
On est amis.
Robin Scherbatsky est pote
avec mon prof d'éco.
D'architecture !
Tu sais quoi ?
Tu nous saoules.
De l'air.
- T'es "Gros Caramel".
- Dégage !
Bébé, j'arrive.
Quoi ?
Il y a la rubéole à l'école.
Je suis libérée pour l'après-midi.
On pourrait déjeuner ensemble.
Que je te refile la rubéole.
J'ai un problème.
C'était ma femme.
Quand j'ai parlé de toi,
elle t'a pris pour un homme...
T'as peur qu'elle flippe
en voyant que je suis une femme ?
Exactement.
Je faisais de l'impro
à Pelican Rapids.
Suis-moi.
Je suis Lily, sa femme.
Bonjour.
Je suis de l'ambassade de France.
Je suis ici à cause d'un petit,
- mais délicat problème de fromage...
- C'est Jenkins !
Vous êtes Jenkins ?
La crise du camembert
ne se résoudra pas par magie.
À midi.
<i>Marshall paniquait.
C'était le moment qu'il redoutait.</i>
La fameuse Jenkins !
Ben ça alors !
C'est marrant, j'imaginais un mec.
Bref, on va manger ?
Attends. Alors...
tu n'es pas du tout jalouse ?
Mon coeur.
Je ne m'inquiète pas
pour une infidélité.
Parce qu'on s'aime tellement ?
C'est ça...
Bon, déjeuner ?
Aucune jalousie.
C'est logique.
C'est le moteur de votre relation.
- C'est censé dire quoi ?
- C'est comme ça, mon gars.
Toute bonne relation
compte un meneur et un suiveur.
Une personne fréquente quelqu'un
d'un niveau supérieur ;
l'autre,
quelqu'un d'un niveau inférieur.
Je me suis pas abaissé avec Lily.
Bon, elle plutôt petite.
J'avoue.
Elle a pas les hanches
pour porter un Eriksen.
Je suis le suiveur ?
D'où l'absence de jalousie.
Le meneur n'est jamais jaloux
de son suiveur.
Que ferait le suiveur ?
Le suiveur ne trouvera jamais mieux
que son meneur.
Oui, j'ai de la chance d'avoir Lily,
mais Lily a autant de chance...
de m'avoir.
Y a pas de suiveur chez nous.
T'es carrément le suiveur.
Tu lui achètes un cheval !
Essaie toujours.
Ainsi, l'architecture moderne acheva
la courte expérience
de la charpente en V.
Excusez-moi.
- Que fais-tu ici ?
- T'as oublié ton stylo ce matin,
- donc je te l'apporte.
- C'est le tien.
Et tu l'as mordillé, récemment.
Pas de problème, Ted.
Ta classe est sur ma route...
- C'est pas vrai.
- ... pour "Debout, New York",
que je présente.
Je suis fan de votre émission.
Vraiment ?
Tu regardes ?
Je vais rougir. D'autres fans ?
On a...
- Merci d'être passée.
- Regardez cette nuit.
Je fais un super reportage
sur le poison d'escargot.
Et qui fait la pire pizza du coin ?
Réponse après l'info trafic
de l'A1, l'A3, l'A5 et l'A9.
Vous êtes sérieux ?
Vous regardez son émission ?
C'est encore moins marrant
que regarder un aquarium éclairé.
Et pas si bien éclairé.
En vérité,
on regarde pour le jeu à boire.
Le quoi ?
Son émission commence si tôt
qu'on est souvent encore au bar.
À chacune de ses interviews,
on doit boire à chaque "mais, euh".
- Mais, euh ?
- Mais, euh.
Apparemment, elle le dit souvent.
Marrant.
Je faisais un jeu d'alcool sur Robin.
Littéralement sur elle...
J'inondais son nombril de liqueur...
- On ne devait pas en parler.
- Désolé. T'as raison.
Et puis, elle aimait pas.
Ça la réveillait.
Elle dit "mais, euh" si souvent ?
<i>Cette nuit-là,
nous avons eu notre réponse.</i>
Excellent.
Ton premier concours d'orthographe ?
Troisième.
C'est bien, mais, euh.
Un article intéressant.
Qui dit que dans toute relation,
il y a un suiveur et un meneur.
Vraiment ? Fais voir.
C'est pas dans celui-là.
C'est dans un vieux.
Ce journal m'y a fait penser.
Bref...
T'en penses quoi ?
Parfois, c'est le cas.
- Sauf pour nous.
- Bien sûr que non.
Bien.
Mais si on te visait
avec un flingue...
En te demandant de définir
l'un d'entre nous comme le suiveur.
Ni l'un, ni l'autre.
C'est ce qui nous rend géniaux.
Si on me visait avec un flingue
ainsi que notre futur enfant,
notre futur chat ou singe,
qui gagnerait le <i>Risk</i>
auquel on joue depuis 3 ans.
Ni suiveur, ni meneur.
Et si...
<i>Ça a duré un moment.</i>
<i>Jusqu'à ce que...</i>
Nos deux enfants,
huit petit-enfants,
onze arrière grand-enfants,
sont dans un avion,
piloté par Oprah.
Cet avion va s'écraser dans un musée
contenant tes tableaux favoris,
et la seule solution
pour tout sauver
serait de répondre à la question :
"Es-tu le suiveur ou le meneur ?"
- Et Oprah a tout essayé ?
- Tout !
Tu dois te décider.
Je suppose que si je devais choisir,
je serais peut-être...
- le meneur.
- Comment tu peux dire ça ?
Elle pense être le meneur.
Je vais lui prouver
que je ne suis pas le suiveur.
- Je dois la rendre jalouse.
- Facile.
1re étape, couche avec Jenkins.
2e étape, je couche avec d'abord.
3e étape,
on fait la 2e avant la 1re.
Je lance la 2e étape.
J'ai pensé à un truc.
Tu vois la partie de l'autre soir ?
Quand tu mettais tout dans le trou à 50.
Encore une excellente nuit
pour Gros Caramel.
- Tu penses qu'elle me draguait ?
- Carrément.
Bien sûr.
Un plan sans faille.
Si la jalousie de Dame Lily,
jeune Marshall ne peut susciter,
à l'opposé,
le Gros Caramel...
peut...
la rendre jalouse.
Laisse-moi la refaire.
- Si la jalousie...
- Compris.
J'ai eu une super idée.
Enlever tes cheveux
du siphon une fois fini ?
C'est comme si tu voulais
tapisser le sol.
Si tu m'imprimais un de tes cours,
je pourrais le lire à l'antenne.
Venant d'une source...
plus divertissante,
tes étudiants seraient plus attentifs
et retiendraient la leçon.
Tu es divertissante ?
La nuit dernière, pendant 3 minutes,
tu as recousu un bouton sur ton pull.
C'est pas parce que ta classe
me préfère à toi...
- T'es un jeu !
- Quoi ?
Ils regardent pour boire
à tes dépens.
À chaque fois que tu dis
"mais, euh", ils boivent un coup.
Je dis pas "mais, euh",
j'ai jamais dit ça.
Ça doit pas être un bon jeu.
Vu qu'hier soir, on y a joué
avec Barney,
et je n'ai pas été super torché
jusqu'à me vomir dessus.
Attends, c'est arrivé !
Prends ça.
Lily et moi, on va retourner
à ce bar étudiant
et on se demandait
si tu voulais venir.
Tu pourrais me regarder jouer,
ou faire comme l'autre soir.
Un truc dans le genre.
C'est toi qui vois.
Je sais que...
Bébé, t'es déjà rentré ?
"Bébé".
Je ne mérite pas ce nom.
- Quoi ?
- Jenkins m'a embrassé.
Elle m'a embrassé.
L'autre jour, elle m'a vu
jouer au Skee-Ball,
elle a pas pu résister au "Caramel".
Mais tu dois savoir
que je l'ai stoppée net.
Et que tu es la seule pour moi,
bébé.
Je vois ce qu'il se passe.
C'est à cause de ce truc
suiveur-meneur.
Une envie de "Gros Caramel" ?
Tu veux me rendre jalouse
en inventant une histoire avec Jenkins.
J'invente rien !
Ça s'est passé.
Elle m'a embrassé avec la langue.
Sa langue était dans ma bouche.
Bien sûr.
Elle était épaisse et rugueuse,
comme une étoile de mer.
Je suis hyper jalouse.
Je vais aller là-bas
lui mettre mon poing dans la figure.
Lui foutre un pain dans la tronche.
Allez, bébé.
Tu veux de la soupe ?
C'est arrivé !
Il ne reste pas...
de pois cassés ?
Ce ne sont là
que certains des apports
qu'il fit à l'architecture,
et pourtant,
on se souvient de lui
que pour un seul.
Mes amis,
c'est le triste héritage...
de Gregorio Franchetti Gazebo.
Des questions ?
- Vous venez boire un verre ce soir ?
- Quoi ?
On va jouer au jeu
Robin Scherbatsky.
On se demandait si vous viendriez.
Que puis-je dire, à part
"Mais, euh, n'avant".
Je peux toujours venir ?
Je paierai.
Donc, votre troisième livre
sortait du lot.
Bon sang !
Pardon.
Mais... juste "mais",
pas "euh", juste "mais".
Vous avez écrit
votre premier roman plus vite.
C'est exact.
C'est pas super ?
<i>Et soudain, Robin eut une idée
qui mit fin au jeu pour toujours.</i>
Je voulais vous poser des questions
sur votre prochain roman.
<i>C'est une idée
que vous avez depuis...</i>
longtemps...
Buvez pas, c'est un piège !
Je vais y aller.
Vous pouvez garder vos 10 $.
Merci.
<i>S'il y a des étudiants
qui regardent,</i>
On doit boire, professeur.
C'est la règle.
Elle a dit "Mais, euh".
Que Dieu nous aide.
Te voilà.
Désolée de t'avoir embrassé hier.
C'est bon.
Et d'avoir couché avec toi
au courrier.
Pas moi.
Ça fait deux discussions délicates
pour aujourd'hui.
Je fais pas ça d'habitude.
J'étais bourrée.
T'étais bourrée à 8 h ?
J'ignore ce qui est arrivé.
<i>Je croyais les molluscicides
sans danger.</i>
Je dois aller travailler.
Ce jeu devient populaire.
Comment j'ai pu faire ça ?
C'est bon.
Non, c'est pas bon.
Tu es le mec le plus gentil
de ce bureau,
et je veux pas gâcher notre amitié.
C'est embarrassant.
Ne le dis à personne.
À qui je vais le dire ?
Lily ?
Je l'ai dit à Lily.
Bon sang, je dois aller lui parler.
Je dois m'excuser.
Je vais lui dire que c'est arrivé,
que ça veut rien dire
et que je m'excuse.
- Fais-le.
- J'y vais.
Si t'as pas beaucoup de temps,
dis-lui que c'est arrivé
et que tu es désolée.
Et si tu es très pressé,
ne dis pas "Désolée".
Dis-lui que c'est arrivé.
Le plus important,
c'est que c'est arrivé.
Donc, insiste autant que tu peux.
Donc, Lily, je dis juste
que c'est arrivé.
Je me sens très mal,
et je suis vraiment désolée.
C'est arrivé.
On va faire quoi ?
C'est arrivé.
Terrible !
Mais comme j'ai dit...
- C'est arrivé.
- Et je me sens mal.
Je me haïrais si ce que j'ai fait,
te blesse ou affecte votre relation.
Pardonne-moi.
T'as embrassé mon mari ?
Moi seule embrasse
le père de mon futur enfant !
Marshall, je vois rien !
<i>Votre oncle Marshall n'a plus jamais
essayé de rendre Lily jalouse.</i>
C'est bon.
On va avoir un cours silencieux
aujourd'hui.
Peu de discussions.
Pas de boucan.
Ça va, les gars ?
Va-t'en, s'il te plaît.
Je suis venue pour dire...
<i>Merci d'avoir regardé</i>
Allez, debout New York !
<i>Mais, euh.</i>
<i>Kids, when you're on your 30s
and living in New York,</i>
<i>there's a few places
you never want to be:</i>
<i>Times Square on New Year's Eve,</i>
<i>Rockefeller Center
around Christmas time...</i>
<i>But most of all...</i>
A college bar? Man. We're probably
going to run into my students.
They're going to corner me
and want a free lecture.
I don't even have
my slide projector. Damn it.
Ted, I've been Skee-Ball
champ here since law school.
I have to pop in at least
once a month to maintain my record.
Looks like you've been gone a while.
Some guy named Big Fudge
has been cleaning up.
He has.
- And you're Big Fudge.
- The biggest.
So by the way,
I have to tell you something.
I... invited Jenkins.
Jenkins? No way!
<i>We'd all started hearing
about Jenkins a few weeks earlier.</i>
You guys will not believe
what Jenkins did this time.
- Who's Jenkins?
- He's this hilarious new lawyer
at Marshall's office.
Hilarious.
Okay, so there's this jar of Maraschino
cherries in the fridge at work.
So, Jenkins says,
"200 bucks, I'll eat the whole jar."
So, we give Jenkins 200 bucks...
... and Jenkins ate the whole jar!
<i>And after that,
the stories kept coming.</i>
So, the CFO comes in
to sign some acquisition papers.
So, Jenkins goes,
"Excuse me, Mr. Wilcox.
I think we forgot
one of the documents."
So, we all go out for
beers after work.
Jenkins gets up on the bar
and starts gyrating
like some sort of deranged stripper.
Next thing you know,
off comes the shirt!
It was so gross.
Right?
Well, it'll be great to finally
meet the famous Jenkins
after all those stories.
And there's about to be
one more story.
I'm going to bang Jenkins.
- What?
- You heard me.
You want to have sex with Jenkins?
With Jenkins, on Jenkins,
near Jenkins.
You name it.
I want to wear Jenkins like a sock.
But you're...
Haven't you... I'm...
- Really?
- Hi, guys.
Ted, this is Jenkins.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-
.:: La Fabrique ::.
This is going to sound crazy,
But, um... I thought Jenkins was a guy.
What gave you that idea?
What? That's crazy!
I don't know. Maybe the whole "Jenkins
peed out the window of a cab" story.
Yeah. Much more impressive now,
isn't it?
OK, I'll come clean!
It all started a few weeks ago.
By the way, Four Eyes, new lawyer.
This is Jenkins.
Watch out for this guy.
He steals stuff.
I don't steal stuff.
And I don't wear glasses.
- I'm Marshall.
- Hi.
So, are you really a Vikings fan
or was he lying about that, too?
Why?
Is this a trap?
Are you a Packers fan?
My wife knows I'm here.
She doesn't have money,
but what she does have
is a very special set of skills.
I'm a Vikings fan, too!
I bleed purple and gold.
- I'm from Pelican Rapids.
- Pelican Rapids?
No way.
My grandpa lives in Pelican Rapids.
Well, I mean, he's dead now,
but he haunts a barn off Route 108.
Hold it. Dude,
if you tell me you have a thing
for a woman that is not your wife,
I'll drag you outside
and kick your ass.
Okay, first of all...
Come on, buddy.
You can't handle the Fudge.
Second of all, no.
I think of her like a...
a big brother.
Who, I guess, has boobs.
But so does my oldest brother,
Marvin Jr., anyway,
that night,
I told Lily about Jenkins.
I can't wait to meet him.
I should have corrected her.
It would have been so easy.
But I didn't, so,
after that, whenever I talked
about Jenkins,
I always avoided pronouns.
So, the head of marketing comes in
to choose people for the Midwest audit.
So, he goes,
"Him, him, her, him, him...
Jenkins, him, her."
I don't understand
why you wouldn't just tell her.
Do you really think
she'd be all that jealous?
Think about those stories
I told you.
I could see how that'd be a problem.
Exactly.
That's why Lily can't find out.
Lily can't find out what?
That Marshall's going
to buy her a horse.
You are?
That is so awesome!
I love those things.
Guys, why... why is that kid
over there staring at me?
I think I know what this is.
I think it has finally happened.
I'm getting recognized from my show.
Robin, that is so cute.
But that's Scotty. He's one
of my students, and he's looking at me.
How weird is it that
I'm more famous than you?
Not at all, 'cause you're not.
I'm on TV.
Yeah, and I've 30 students in my class.
That's what, 30 times your viewership?
Now, this will give him a little thrill,
buying a drink for the old prof.
All right, Scotter,
one question about
neoclassical architecture,
and that is it.
- You're Robin Scherbatsky, right?
- What?
Yes, I am.
I didn't mean to stare.
It's just,
I watch your show all the time.
Really?
Really?
Totally.
- What are you doing out with Ted?
- It's Professor Mosby.
We're friends.
Holy crap!
Robin Scherbatsky is friends
with my econ professor.
It's architecture!
OK, you know what?
You're crowding us.
Hit the bricks.
- Wait a minute. You're Big Fudge.
- Go!
Baby, I'm on my way up.
What? Why?
There was a measles outbreak
at school, and they called a half day.
Thought I'd come by here,
have lunch,
maybe give you the measles.
I have a problem.
That was my wife.
When I first mentioned you,
she mistakenly thought you were a guy...
Now you're worried that
when she finds out I'm a woman,
- she's going to totally flip out.
- Yes. Exactly.
Geez. Oh, gosh. I was in an improv group
in Pelican Rapids.
Follow my lead.
I'm Lily, Marshall's wife.
Hi, Lily.
I am from the French embassy.
I am here because of a small
but significant
- cheese incident that occurred...
- She's Jenkins!
You're Jenkins?
Yeah, well, that, Camembert cris
isn't going to resolve itself,
so I'll catch you guys
on the flip-flop.
<i>Marshall cringed.
This was the moment he had feared.</i>
The famous Jenkins!
How about that?
Funny, I was picturing a guy.
Anywho, lunch?
Wait. Wait.
So... so, you're not jealous at all?
Sweetie.
I never have to worry
about you with another woman.
Right, because we're so
hopelessly in love, right?
Yeah, sure.
Anywho, lunch?
She wasn't jealous.
Of course, she wasn't.
That's the whole dynamic
of your relationship.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's like this, my man.
Every good relationship
has a reacher and a settler.
Exactly. One person reaches
for someone out of their league;
the other one settles for
someone below theirs.
I did not settle for Lily.
Okay, yes, she's a little short,
and, true, my mom says she doesn't have
the hips to birth an Eriksen child,
But, um...
You guys think I'm the reacher.
That's why Lily's not jealous.
The settler is never jealous
of the reacher because,
where is the reacher going to go?
The settler, Lily, is the best thing
that the reacher, Marshall,
is ever going to get.
No... okay.
Yes, I am lucky to have Lily,
but Lily is just as lucky...
to have me.
Okay. Neither one of us
is the reacher.
Dude, you are so the reacher.
You're getting her a horse!
What?
Take the hit.
Take the hit.
Thus ending modern architecture's
very brief experiment
with the V-frame house.
Excuse me a second.
- What are you doing here?
- I noticed you forgot
something this morning,
so I thought I'd bring it by.
- Your pen.
- This is your pen.
And you chewed on the end of it.
Recently.
Not a problem, Ted.
Your class was on my way to work.
- No, it's not.
- At "Come On, Get Up New York!",
- where I'm an anchor, so...
- I watch your show all the time.
What?!
You watch the show?
Well, paint me flattered.
Any other fans out there?
We got...
- All right. Thanks for coming by.
- Tune in tonight.
I am doing a great piece
on snail poison.
Also, who's got the worst pizza
in New York?
I'll give you the answer after traffic
on the ones, threes, fives and nines.
Really?
You guys watch her show?
It's like watching a well-lit aquarium,
but not as interesting.
And now that I think about it,
not as well lit.
The truth is, we...
watch it for the drinking game.
The who now?
Her morning show comes on so early,
we're usually still at the bar,
so whenever she does an interview,
you have to drink every
time she says, "But, um..."
"But, um..."?
"But, um..."
Apparently, she says it a lot.
It's funny.
I had a drinking game
based on Robin,
but it was actually on Robin. I'd pour
peach schnapps in her belly button...
- We agreed we wouldn't do this.
- Sorry. You're right.
She didn't like it anyway.
Said it woke her up.
Does she say "But, um..." that much?
<i>That night, we found out just
how much she said it.</i>
That's great.
This wasn't your first Spelling bee,
was it?
Third.
Good for you.
Interesting article in the paper.
Says that in every relationship,
there's a reacher and a settler.
Really?
Let me see it.
I's not in this newspaper.
It's in one I read a while back.
This newspaper reminded me
of the other newspaper.
Anywho...
What do you think about that?
Well,
I guess sometimes that's the case.
But not in ours.
What?
Of course not.
Right.
Say, gun to your head...
You had to say
one of us was the reacher.
Well, I'd say it's neither.
That's what makes us great.
Now, there's a gun to my head
and our future children,
and our future cat or monkey,
depending on who wins the game
we've been playing for three years.
No reacher, no settler.
How about this?
<i>This went on for a while.</i>
<i>Until finally...</i>
Our two kids, our eight grandkids,
our 11 great-grandkids,
are all on a plane piloted by Oprah.
And it's about to crash
into an art museum
With all of your favorite paintings,
and the only way...
the only way to save everything
is just to answer the question:
Are you the reacher or the settler?
And Oprah's tried everything?
Everything!
You have to decide now.
Well, I guess, if I had to say,
then maybe I'd say I'm the settler.
How could you say that?!
She thinks that she's the settler.
I mean, that's it. I gotta prove to her
that I am not the reacher.
I gotta make her jealous.
That's easy. Here's the plan.
Step one, sleep with Jenkins.
Step two,
I sleep with Jenkins first.
Step three, we do step two first.
I'm gonna go
get started on step two.
I got something.
Remember the other night, the game?
When you were putting in the 50 hole?
Whatever.
Just another night for big fudge.
You thought she was into me?
Full-on lady wood.
Of course.
A plan taketh shape.
If lady Lily's jealousy
young Marshall cannot budge,
then perchance,
fair gentles, big fudge...
Can...
make her jealous.
Let me try that again.
If lady Lily's...
I got it.
I have got a great idea.
Is it clean your hair
out of the shower drain?
It's like
you're trying to carpet the tub.
If you wanted to print out
one of your lectures or something,
I could read it on air.
Coming from a more...
entertaining source.
Your students might actually
pay attention and learn something.
You're entertaining?
Last night,
there was three minutes of dead air
while you sewed a button
back on your sweater.
Look, just because your class
likes me more than you...
- You're a drinking game!
- What?
That's why they watch.
They made a drinking game out of you.
Every time you say "But, um...",
They do a shot.
I don't say "But, um...".
I've never said, "But, um..."
I guess
it's not a very good drinking game.
Which would mean last night,
when I played it,
I didn't get super wasted
and throw up all over myself.
Wait, I did both of those things.
So, face.
Lily and I are gonna go back
to that college bar again.
And we were wondering
if maybe you wanted to come.
You could just watch me
play skee-ball,
or do exactly
what you did the other night.
Something like that.
It's really up to you.
I mean, I know that...
Baby, what are you doing home?
"Baby".
That's a name I don't deserve.
- What?
- Jenkins kissed me.
She kissed me.
The other day, she saw me
play skee-ball, and I don't know,
she caught
some of the big fudge fever.
But you have to know,
I stopped it right away.
And just,
you're the only one for me, baby.
I see what this is.
This is
about the whole reacher/settler thing.
Come again for big fudge?
You want to make me jealous,
you're making up a story about Jenkins.
I'm not making this up!
This happened.
That woman kissed me with tongue.
Her tongue was in my mouth.
Sure it was.
It was thick and rough
like a starfish arm.
I'm so jealous.
I'm just gonna go over there
and punch her right in the nose.
Give her a knuckle sandwich.
Come on, baby.
You want some soup?
It happened!
Do you have any...
split pea left?
These are just
a few of the many contributions
he made to architecture, and yet,
he is only remembered for one thing.
That my friends,
is the sad legacy...
of Gregorio Franchetti Gazebo.
Any questions?
- Do you want to drink with us tonight?
- What?
We're gonna play
the Robin Scherbatsky drinking game.
We were wondering
if you wanted to join us.
What can I say, except
"But, ums up."?
Can I still come?
I'll pay.
So, your third book
was your breakout novel,
Damn!
Sorry.
But... just "But",
no "Um,", just "But."
Your first novel was written
more quickly.
That's correct.
How great is this?!
<i>And it was right then
that Robin got an idea</i>
<i>that would end
the drinking game forever.</i>
I wanted to ask you about
the novel you're writing right now.
<i>... it's an idea you've had for a...</i>
long time...
Don't drink, it's a trap!
I think I'm gonna go.
You can keep your ten bucks.
Thanks.
<i>If there's any college kids
watching,</i>
We have to drink, professor.
It's the rules.
She said "But, um".
God help us all.
Here you are.
I'm so sorry I kissed you yesterday.
That's okay.
And I'm sorry
I had sex with you in the mailroom.
That wasn't me.
Good grief, that's two awkward
conversations I have to have today.
I don't normally do that.
I was really drunk.
You were drunk at 8:00?
I don't know how that happened.
<i>I thought snail pellets were safe.</i>
I gotta get to work.
That game is catching on.
Damn it, how could I do this?
It's okay.
You know what, it's not okay.
You're the nicest guy
in this stupid office
and I don't want
to screw up our friendship.
This is so embarrassing.
Don't tell anyone.
Who am I gonna tell?
Lily?
I told Lily.
For Pete's sake,
I gotta go talk to her.
I gotta apologize.
I'm gonna tell her that it happened,
that it meant nothing
and that I'm sorry.
- Do that.
- I will.
And if you don't have time
for all that,
tell her it happened,
and that you're sorry.
And if you're in a real rush,
don't say "Sorry".
Tell her that it happened.
That's the important part,
that it actually happened.
So emphasize that
as much as you can.
And so, Lily,
I guess what I'm saying is,
it happened.
I feel terrible about it,
and I'm really sorry.
It happened.
What are you going to do?
It happened.
Terrible!
But like I said...
- It happened.
- And I feel awful about it.
And I'd hate myself if what I did,
hurt you in any way
or affected your relationship.
Please forgive me.
Kiss my husband?
My husband? Nobody kisses
my future baby daddy but me!
Marshall, you're blocking the shot!
<i>And, kids, your uncle marshall
never tried to make Lily jealous again.</i>
That's good.
We're just going to have a nice,
low-key class today.
Not a lot of talking.
No loud noises.
'sup guys?
Please, just go away.
I just wanted to drop by and say...
<i>Thanks for watching</i>
<i>Les enfants,
on réagit différemment face au stress.</i>
Plus que quelques minutes,
M. Stinson.
<i>Certains se rongent les ongles.</i>
<i>D'autres tapent des pieds.</i>
<i>Et d'autres s'imaginent interviewés
par le commentateur sportif Jim Nantz.</i>
Bonjour.
Chaque sport a une icône
qui transcende le jeu.
La boxe avait Ali,
le basket avait Jordan,
et le sport en chambre
avec des inconnues
a mon prochain invité,
M. Barney Stinson.
- Barney, bienvenue.
- Merci de m'avoir invité.
Merci d'être avec nous.
Les chiffres parlent d'eux-mêmes.
Plus de 200 femmes sur six continents,
17 nationalités,
74 positions sexuelles
et pas de grosses.
Impressionnant.
Malgré toutes ces réussites,
il y a un titre
qui vous a toujours échappé.
Revenons à la semaine dernière.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Accroche-toi, Jimbo, ça va secouer.
Tout a commencé
avec un défi personnel.
Il choisit sa proie.
Quelle que soit la fille
que je pointe,
je rentre avec elle ce soir.
C'est parti !
Comment c'était avec Dale ?
Parfois,
le type avec de grosses lunettes
et le t-shirt des Schtroumpfs,
c'est de l'ironie.
Parfois, c'est juste un nerd
avec un oeil de travers
et une relation houleuse
avec Gargamel.
C'est pas parce qu'il parle
beaucoup de personnages de fiction
au 1er rencard
qu'il n'est pas intéressant.
Le Bigfoot existe.
C'était rapide.
Le premier soir était de la routine.
Jim, rien n'est routinier là-dedans.
Bravo.
Et le 2e soir ?
Tu vois la bombe
qui sirote un <i>Black Russian</i> ?
Elle va l'échanger
contre un <i>Americano</i>. Allez !
Vous savez...
faites gaffe,
vous pourriez me perdre.
Je devrais dire quoi
quand Dale va me rappeler ?
Comment tu sais qu'il le fera ?
T'es mignon, Marshall.
Mais je crois que maman sait
quand un mec est intéressé.
Son bon oeil ne me lâchait pas.
Vire-le gentiment.
Les gens sont fragiles.
Et parfois, sans même le vouloir,
tu arraches le coeur de quelqu'un
et le piétines dans une salle
avec 26 personnes et un assistant.
C'était bien l'école, Ted ?
J'ai eu un problème.
C'était la rentrée...
Jamie Adamic.
Brian Glow-atz.
Bien joué.
Mettre un faux nom
sur la feuille de présence.
Original.
D'ailleurs, j'attends
un peu plus de maturité
venant d'esprits aussi inspirés,
et vraiment plus de créativité.
C'est quoi, ce nom, Kak Amou ?
Ici.
Allez, faut qu'on y croie.
Et les classiques ?
Jean Sérien.
Jacques Célert.
C'était des faux noms, mais Kak Amou !
Ici.
Elle est là, mec.
Allez, lâchez-vous.
Faites vos blagues sur Kak Amou.
On va pas en faire.
Ça devait être
vraiment dur pour elle.
T'es vraiment... dans la merde.
C'est fini ?
Tu nous demandes si on a bien évacué
le Kak Amou ?
Soir après soir,
Barney est en forme !
La chanceuse.
C'est le meilleur coup
que j'aie jamais eu.
Le meilleur ami que j'aie jamais eu.
- J'aimerais que Marshall soit pareil.
- J'aimerais l'être.
C'est ce qu'ils doivent dire
dans mon dos.
Oui, vous êtes génial.
Le 3e soir.
Racontez-nous.
Je savais que j'étais bien parti,
donc j'ai choisi
de corser les choses.
Ça sera petits seins, ce soir.
T'es dégueu.
Lily, ce sont aussi des gens.
- Vos hamburgers.
- Merci.
Vous ne partagez pas ?
Vous le faites toujours.
- C'est faux
- On est pas ce genre de tarés...
- Si.
- Au contraire.
On est normaux !
Y a quoi ?
Lily et moi cherchons
un nouveau couple d'amis
depuis qu'on a perdu
Robin et Barney,
puis Ted et Stella, et Ted et Robin,
et Ted et Victoria ?
- Ted, quand vas-tu enfin te caser ?
- Comment on en est arrivés là ?
On a passé une bonne soirée
entre couples hier.
On était calmes, normaux.
Pas de crise.
Puis, un petit détail a surgi
et la soirée était ruinée.
Et la brosse à dents de Joanna
saute du lavabo,
touche le plafond,
et retombe dans les toilettes.
- C'est pas vrai.
- Dingue.
La notre aussi, la semaine dernière.
La notre ?
La notre ?
La notre ?
Une seule ?
Pour tous les deux ?
Chaque jour ?
C'est bizarre ?
Carrément.
Marshall,
4 dentistes sur 5 viennent de vomir.
Regardez.
Barney part avec un autre fille.
3 filles en 3 nuits.
C'est dégueu, même pour lui.
Tu rigoles ?
Il fait une sem...
Le dis pas !
- Tu vas porter malheur.
- À qui ?
J'allais réaliser...
une semaine parfaite.

La semaine parfaite.
Sept nuits, sept filles différentes,
aucun refus.
Incroyable.
C'est l'équivalent sexuel en plus rare
d'un score parfait au baseball.
Le seul joueur a avoir réussi
l'un et l'autre
était Pete Drexell "Le Moustachu",
en 1896.
Vous étiez déjà passé tout près
de cette semaine parfaite.
Vous l'avez appris à vos dépens.
Une erreur, et tout s'écroule.
<i>Parfois, un copain fait une bourde.</i>
<i>Parfois, un mauvais baratin...</i>
Toi, moi, au rayon conserves
du Monoprix d'en face.
<i>... mène à l'échec.</i>
<i>Et parfois,
on relâche son attention.</i>
<i>Et ça finit presque toujours
par une baffe.</i>
Cette semaine, vous étiez à 3 sur 3,
et aucun relâchement.
Un sans-fautes.
Si mes amis avaient pu faire pareil.
Kak n'est pas venue en classe.
Pardon ?
Kak ?
On connaît tout un tas de gens
qui s'appellent ainsi.
Et voilà. L'appel de Dale.
C'est ma mère.
Elle a de gros problèmes de santé.
Pourquoi il m'appelle pas ?
Attends. Tu veux qu'il le fasse ?
Non. Tais-toi.
Vous avez pas
une brosse à dents à partager ?
Quand est-ce que ça a commencé ?
Y a des années. Tu devrais savoir.
Tu vivais avec nous.
Vous gardiez votre brosse à dents
dans votre chambre,
ce qui est bizarre, au passage.
Dans la salle de bains.
Il n'y avait que la mienne,
dans la salle de bains.
Attends.
Tu veux dire que...
pendant huit ans...
vous avez partagé la même ?
Mon Dieu.
Tuez-moi.
Quatre nuits.
Vous avez fait le pus dur.
Joli !
J'essaie. Je ne suis pas vous.
Mais arrive la cinquième nuit,
et avec elle, les soucis.
Par là !
Comment s'en sort Barney ?
Très bien.
Comme toute la semaine.
- Dur à croire.
- Pourquoi ?
Il y a eu une fusion la semaine passée,
et Barney s'est fait sermonné.
Bizarre, il a rien dit.
Je travaille avec lui.
Je l'ai appris cet après-midi,
dans le bureau de son boss.
<i>... à cette entreprise, Stinson ?</i>
J'avais jamais vu Barney si effrayé.
Il risque de se faire virer.
J'arrive pas à le croire.
Ils ont une réunion vendredi
pour savoir s'il garde son poste.
Le pauvre, il doit avoir peur.
Je vais lui parler.
Tu peux pas distraire quelqu'un
au milieu de... tu-sais-quoi.
On parle de sa carrière, là.
C'est plus important
qu'un stupide semaine par...
Lèche ma main tant que tu veux.
Tu ruineras pas...
On doit lui parler.
J'y vais.
Il faut un pote.
- Tout va bien ?
- Absolument.
Je suis aux anges.
De qui je me moque ?
- J'ai besoin de toi.
- Je t'écoute.
Laquelle te semble la plus stupide ?
C'est d'accord.
Voyons ce qu'on a là.
Celle près du radiateur ?
Défoncée dehors ?
Je choisirais celle-là.
Merci.
Il a dit quoi ?
Il va s'occuper
de Mme Ronald McDonald.
Tu devais parler
de son licenciement.
Pourquoi s'attarder sur un truc
contre lequel on peut rien ?
L'ignorer ne va rien résoudre.
T'as pas tenu compte de ton hygiène
dentaire ces dix dernières années...
- Dale a appelé ?
- Pourquoi tu...
Regardez.
Je vous arrête.
Je dois vous demander.
Avez-vous déjà utilisé
un produit dopant ?
Non monsieur.
Je respecte trop le jeu.
Mais, on m'en a déjà proposé.
C'était vachement bien.
Tu devrais essayer.
Il m'en reste.
Non merci.
T'es sûr ?
Fais comme tu veux.
- C'est quelle heure ?
- Huit heures.
Je vais à l'hosto.
J'ai jamais touché à ça.
Vous pouvez me tester.
Je vous crois.
Désolé d'avoir posé la question.
Nous voici à la 6e nuit.
À deux filles de la perfection.
Pourquoi t'es là ?
Va au bar !
Calme-toi.
Je suis déjà à 6 sur 6.
Déjà ?
Je déjeunais à Central Park,
et j'ai discuté avec un top suédois.
Et ensuite, on a joué au docteur
à l'arrière d'une calèche.
Eh oui, je l'ai montée.
Génial.
En réalité ?
J'ai sauté une coiffeuse bourrée
à Staten Island.
Content, Columbo ?
On sait pour la réunion.
Tu dois nous en parler.
Tu utilises le sexe à tout-va
pour te faire oublier tes problèmes.
Non, c'est faux.
Il y a un truc
entre moi et numéro 5.
Elle retourne à l'école.
Ou elle a un fils qui y va...
Enfin, un truc comme ça.
Un de mes étudiants m'a dit
que Kak quitte ma classe.
Kak Amou se barre ?
Elle envoie son éducation
aux chiottes !
Et Dale ?
Ça fait que 5 jours, il va appeler.
T'as dit que c'était un imbécile.
Ne parle pas de lui comme ça.
Il est deux fois mieux que toi !
Si tu peux pas trouver
un autre boulot, vends ton appart,
et viens vivre chez nous.
Reste autant que tu veux.
Mais prends ta brosse à dents.
Lily, tu fais quoi ?
Je parle à un ami
qui traverse une mauvaise passe.
Il va très bien.
Quand on veut coucher
avec 7 femmes en 7 nuits,
on ne va pas "bien".
C'est un cri à l'aide.
C'est sa façon de vivre.
Mais on laisse tranquille un homme
qui tente une sem...
Une semaine parfaite ?
Semaine parfaite !
Grandis !
Incroyable.
Il y a deux choses
à ne jamais faire.
Un : ouvrir un e-mail de Phil Simms
devant vos enfants.
Deux : porter la poisse
en semaine parfaite.
Je sais pas quoi dire. C'est Lily.
Elle doit en pincer pour vous.
Vous êtes un fin observateur
de la condition humaine.
- Pourquoi t'as fait ça ?
- Il a plus aucune chance.
Question :
si j'ai tout gâché,
pourquoi il s'en sort comme un Dieu
avec cette fille bourrée là-bas ?
- Il va réussir.
- Vous voyez ?
La poisse n'existe pas.
Elle n'a pas dit :
"La poisse n'existe pas.".
Eh si...
Vous alliez accomplir un miracle.
À cause d'elle, la seule chose
qui peut anéantir un coup sûr
allait passer cette porte.
Un membre de l'équipe
des New York Yankees,
qui a remporté
le championnat de baseball en 2009.
Je veux ma propre brosse à dents.
C'est dit.
- La série de Barney s'arrête à 6.
- Quoi ?
Pourquoi ?
À cause du gars à la coupe bizarre ?
C'est Nick Swisher.
C'est un joueur des Yankees.
Personne
ne peut rivaliser avec un Yankee.
Même un ancien joueur.
Quand j'ai emménagé, au 4e rencard,
je me suis fait doubler
par Phil Rizzuto.
J'étais là.
Bon dieu, ce gars savait y faire.
Moi, ça me fait rien.
Je vais te le dire en Canadien.
Comment réagirais-tu
si un des Ca-truc entrait ici
avec ses patins et sa crosse.
Si un des Canucks de Vancouver entrait,
ma culotte tomberait si vite
qu'elle trouerait le sol jusqu'en Chine.
- C'est pareil avec les Yankees.
- Barney est foutu.
Ça y est ! Regardez.
Tu viens voir
ma collection de boules de neige ?
Boule de neige ?
Il s'enfonce.
C'est Nick Swisher !
- Bien tenté.
- Bien joué.
Pas assez bien.
Cette semaine a été un gâchis.
Et demain,
je vais me faire virer.
Désolé, mec.
Elle n'a pas été qu'un gâchis.
On a tous passé une semaine affreuse
et tu nous l'as faite oublier.
J'ai perdu une élève.
Ça craint.
J'ai rencontré ma moitié
qui m'a pas rappelée.
Pas encore. Il va le faire.
C'est sûr.
On a effrayé un super couple
car on partage une brosse à dents.
Vous partagez une brosse à dents ?
Avec Ted.
Un instant.
Quand on était ensemble,
tu la prenais tout le temps.
<i>C'est là que Lily réalisa
ce qui était génial avec le sport :</i>
<i>on oublie tout pendant un instant.</i>
<i>Et nous avions tous besoin
de cette semaine parfaite.</i>
Au moment où elle s'assoit,
c'est fini.
Minute !
<i>Aldrin l'a en visuel !</i>
<i>Elle court à travers la pièce.</i>
<i>Elle plonge...</i>
Pourquoi elle a fait ça ?
Ça va ?
Désolée, je suis trop gourde !
Je me suis tordu la cheville.
Je peux avoir de la glace ?
Bien sûr.
Elle l'a fait !
Ça existe pas la poisse !
Je t'apporte de la glace.
Merde.
Swisher est de retour !
Suivez-moi.
Sa femme et lui
partagent une brosse à dents !
C'est bizarre, non ?
C'est plutôt mignon.
On ne cherche pas tous
une personne avec qui la partager ?
Excusez-moi.
Il nous trouve mignons.
Martini ?
On boit une bière avec un Yankee.
Trop cool.
C'est dingue.
Je suis à fond dans le baseball.
Mookie Wilson, il est connu ?
Le baseball, c'est génial.
Mais ça vaut pas le hockey.
Je vis...
juste au-dessus.
Que dirais-tu de venir chez moi ?
Franchement, c'est pas mon genre,
mais, je sens une réelle affinité,
7e... Christy.
Je t'en prie.
Je l'ai fait !
Impressionnant !
Félicitations
pour votre semaine parfaite !
J'y serais pas arrivé sans mes amis.
Autre sujet.
Vous pensez vraiment
être viré aujourd'hui ?
Je ne tiens pas à en parler.
Je viens de votre imagination,
donc, on dirait que si.
Pensez-y.
Quel connard.
C'est toi, le connard.
C'est à vous.
On a pris une décision.
Vous restez.
Je sais que cette semaine
a été difficile.
J'ai presque pas dormi.
Et voilà.
La casquette officielle
de la semaine parfaite de Barney.
Je voulais des t-shirts
mais sans vos tailles.
Ça peut être blessant.
En souvenir de l'entrée de Barney
au panthéon du jeu,
cette cravate portée la 7e nuit
de cette semaine parfaite,
est à la retraite.
Que l'exploit de Barney
soit dans les mémoires
et raconté aux générations futures.
Un jour, mes enfants s'assiéront
et je leur raconterai
la fois où Barney
a sauté 7 filles d'affilée.
<i>Suis-je un mauvais père ?</i>
La commande de Kak Amou.
Une grosse commission pour Kak Amou.
Vous le faites dire à Wendy ?
C'est bon, j'ai compris.
Kak Amou est un nom débile,
c'est pire à chaque fois qu'on le dit.
Ici.
<i>Kids, we all have different
ways of dealing with nerves.</i>
It'll just be a few more
minutes, Mr. Stinson.
<i>Some people chew their nails.</i>
<i>Some people tap their feet.</i>
<i>And some people imagine
they're being interviewed</i>
<i>by renowned sportscaster Jim Nantz.</i>
Hello, friends.
Every sport has had an icon
who transcends the game.
Boxing had Ali,
basketball had Jordan,
and the sport of sleeping
with random hotties
has my next guest,
Mr. Barney Stinson.
- Barney, welcome.
- Thanks. Great to be back on the show.
Good to have you with us.
And, you know, the stats,
they really speak for themselves.
Over 200 women spanning
six continents, 17 nationalities,
74 sexual positions
and not a single fatty.
It's impressive.
With these accomplishments, though,
there's one laurel
that's always eluded you.
Which brings us to last week.
What was the story there?
Buckle up, Jimbo,
this one's a doozy.
It all started when I decided
to set myself a little challenge.
He's calling his shot.
Whatever girl
I'm pointing to right now,
that's who I'm going
home with tonight.
Play ball!
How'd the date with Dale go?
You know, sometimes, that guy
with the horn-rimmed glasses
and the Smurfs T-shirt
is just being ironic.
Sometimes, he is a dork
with a lazy eye
and a love-hate relationship
with Gargamel.
Robin, just because
a guy talks a lot about
a fictional character on a first date
doesn't mean he's not husband material.
Sasquatch isn't fictional.
That was quick.
So, night one was pretty routine.
Jim, there is nothing routine
about the way I get down.
Respect.
Take us to night two.
See that hottie over there
nursing a Black Russian?
She's about to chase that
with a white American. Up top!
You know...
if you're not careful,
you're going to lose me.
You guys, what should I say
when Dale calls for a second date?
How do you know he's going to call?
You're cute, Marshall.
But I think Mama knows
when a dude's digging the show.
I mean, he couldn't keep
his good eye off me.
Well, let him down easy.
People are fragile.
And sometimes, without
even meaning to, you might
rip someone's beating heart out
and stomp on it in a room full
of 26 people
and a teacher's assistant.
How did school go today, Ted?
Something bad happened.
The first class
of the new semester...
Jamie Adamic.
Brian Glow-atz.
Well done.
Adding a fake name
to the sign-up sheet.
That's real original, guys.
You know, I'd expect
inspired minds such as yours
to be a little more mature,
and frankly, more creative.
I mean, seriously.
What kind of a fake name is Cook Pu?
Here.
Come on, guys.
It's got to at least sound real.
Whatever happened to the classics?
Right, you know?
Seymour Butts.
Hugh Gerection. Those were fake names,
but Cook Pu?
Here.
She's back here, bro.
All right, come on, let me have it.
Bring on all the Cook Pu jokes.
We're not going to make jokes, Ted.
That girl must be
really down in the dumps.
You really... smeared the Pu name.
You guys finished?
Are you asking us if all the Pu
is out of our system?
Back-to-back nights.
Barney is on fire.
That girl's lucky.
Barney was the best sex I ever had.
He's the best friend I've ever had.
- He's everything I want Marshall to be.
- He's everything I wish I could be.
I'm just assuming that's what
they say when I'm not around.
I buy it. You're awesome.
Now, night three.
Paint us a word picture.
Jim, I could tell I was on a roll,
so I decided to mix things up
a little bit.
I think I'm going to go
small boobs tonight.
You're disgusting.
Lily, they're people, too.
- Here's your burgers.
- Thank you.
What, you're not sharing?
You two always share a burger.
We don't.
We're not like weirdos
who share everything.
- You are.
- Exactly.
We're perfectly normal!
What's going on?
You know how Lily and I have been
looking for new couple friends
ever since we lost Robin and Barney,
and Ted and Stella, and Ted and Robin,
and Ted and Victoria?
Geez, when are you going
to get your life?
How did we end up here?
We went on a great
double date last night.
It... we were cool.
We were casual.
We didn't spaz out.
And then, one tiny
little detail came out
and the whole night was ruined.
And Joeanna's toothbrush
flips off the side of the sink,
hits the ceiling and falls
right into the toilet.
- Come on.
- That's... That's crazy.
Last week, the same thing
happened to our toothbrush.
Our toothbrush?
Our toothbrush?
Our toothbrush?
Like, one toothbrush?
That you both use?
Every day?
Is that weird?
Super weird.
Marshall, four out of five dentists
just threw up in their mouths.
Check it out.
Barney's leaving with another girl.
Three girls in three nights.
That's gross, even for Barney.
Are you kidding?
He's on his way to a perfect...
Don't say it!
- You'll jinx it.
- Jinx what?
I was on my way toward...
a perfect week.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-
.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.
The perfect week.
Seven nights, seven girls,
zero rejections.
Incredible.
I mean, it's really
like the sexual equivalent
of baseball's perfect game,
but even rarer.
Yeah.
The only player in history
to have ever achieved both
was Mustache Pete Drexell
back in 1896.
Now, this wasn't the first time
you'd come close to a perfect week.
You learned the hard way, though...
one mistake, and it's all over.
<i>Sometimes,
a teammate makes an error.</i>
<i>Sometimes, one wild pitch...</i>
You, me, the canned food aisle
in the bodega next door.
<i>... leads to a walk.</i>
<i>And sometimes, you just lose focus.</i>
<i>And that almost always leads
to a hit.</i>
But this week,
you were three for three
with no sign of slowing down.
I could do no wrong.
Wish I could say the same
for my friends.
Cook didn't show up for class today.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, Ted, we know, like,
a ton of people named Cook.
Here we go.
The dreaded Dale call.
It's my mom.
She's going through some pretty
major league health stuff.
God, why won't that guy call?
Wait a minute.
You want him to call?
No! Shut up.
Don't you guys have, like, a...
a toothbrush to share or something?
Yeah. When did you guys
even start doing that anyway?
Like, years ago. You should know.
We lived with you.
Yeah, but you always
kept your toothbrush in the bedroom.
Also weird, by the way.
We kept it in the bathroom.
No, there was only one toothbrush
in the bathroom, and it was mine.
Wait.
Are you saying...
... that for eight years,
All three of you
shared one toothbrush?
- Oh, my God.
- Kill me.
So, you're through four nights.
You're over the hump.
Nice.
I try. I'm no you.
But then came night five,
and with it, trouble.
Beer here.
How's Barney doing tonight?
Cool as a cumber.
Just like he's been all week.
- That's hard to believe.
- Why?
Apparently, this big merger
fell through last week
and Barney's being blamed for it.
That's weird.
He hasn't said anything.
I work with the guy.
I didn't find out until this afternoon,
when I walked by his boss's office.
<i>... you cost this company, Stinson?!</i>
I'd never seen Barney
look that scared.
I think he's going to get fired.
I can't believe he might get fired.
They're having a meeting on Friday
to determine if he keeps his job.
Poor guy. He must be freaking out.
I'm going to go talk to him.
You can't distract a man
in the middle of a... you-know-what.
Come on, this is his career.
This is much more important
than some stupid perfect...
You can lick my hand
as long as you want.
I'm not going to let you ruin his...
Guys, we need to talk to him.
I'll go.
He needs a bro.
- Everything all right?
- Absolutely. Sure.
Top of the world.
Who am I kidding?
- I need your help.
- Anything, buddy. What is it?
Which one of these girls
looks the dumbest?
All right, kid.
Let's check the scouting report.
What about the heater?
High and outside?
All right.
I'd go with the slider.
Thanks, Skip.
So, what did he say?
He's going to take a swat
at the Hamburglar over there.
You were supposed to talk to him
about losing his job.
How is forcing him to dwell
on a problem he can do nothing?
How is ignoring it
going to solve anything?
You ignored good dental hygiene
for the better part of a decade...
Cook Pu!
- Dale call yet?
- Why do you got to...
Guys, look!
I'm going to stop you.
There's a thing I have to ask.
Have you ever used
performance-enhancing drugs?
No, sir.
I respect the game too much.
Although,
I can't say I haven't been offered.
Dude, it was pretty awesome.
You should try it.
I have, I have some more.
No, thanks.
You sure?
All right, suit yourself.
What time is it?
It's 8:00.
I need to go to the hospital.
I'd never touch the stuff.
You can test me if you want,
Jim Nantz.
Barney, I trust you.
I regret I even asked you the question.
Let's go to night six.
Two girls away from perfection.
What are you doing here?
Get down to the bar!
Ted, relax.
I'm already six for six.
Really?
I was lunching
at Tavern on the Green,
I started chatting up
this Swedish supermodel.
Next thing you know,
I'm playing a day game
in the back
of a horse-drawn carriage.
Giddy-what-up?!
Awesome.
What really happened?
I had lunch at a Staten Island Chili's
and banged a drunk hairdresser.
Are you happy, Truthy McGee?
We know you might get fired.
Wait, you have to talk about this.
You are just using meaningless sex
to distract yourself
from a really serious issue.
It is not meaningless, okay?
Number five and I really connected.
She's going back to school.
Or has a kid in school...
Something about school!
So, today one of my students told me
Cook is dropping my class.
Pu dropped out?
She is flushing her education
down the toilet!
Any word from Dale?
It's only been five days,
he's gonna call!
Why do you care anyway?
You said he was a total dork.
Do not talk about Dale that way.
He is twice the man
you will ever be!
God forbid, if you can't find
another job, sell your place.
Marshall and I have an extra room.
You can stay there as long as you need.
Make sure
you bring your own toothbrush.
Lily, what are you doing?
Talking to my friend
who's going through a really tough time.
He's doing fine.
Trying to sleep
with seven women in seven nights
is not "doing fine,"
it's a cry for help.
Barney's life is a cry for help.
But you don't mess with a man
when he's in the middle of a perf...
What?
Perfect week?
Perfect week!
Grow up!
Unbelievable.
You know,
there's two things you don't do.
One: you don't open an e-mail
from Phil Simms in front of your kids.
And two: you don't jinx a man
going for a perfect week.
I don't know what to tell you.
Lily's messing.
I think
she has a thing for the Barnacle.
You're a keen observer
of the human condition, Jim Nantz.
- I can't believe you jinxed him.
- He doesn't stand a chance.
Question:
If I ruined everything,
why is Barney totally hitting it off
with Third Martini Girl over there?
- He's going to do it!
- See?
There is no such thing as a jinx.
Tell me she didn't say
"There's no such thing as a jinx".
Wish I could.
You were about to achieve
something so beautiful!
Thanks to her, the only thing
that could ruin a surefire hookup
was about to walk through that door.
A member of the 2009
World Champion New York Yankees.
Lily, I'm getting my own toothbrush.
I guess that's it.
- Barney's streak ends at six.
- What?
Why? Because of that guy
with the weird hair?
That's Nick Swisher.
He's a New York Yankee.
No normal guy in New York City
can compete with a Yankee.
It doesn't even have to be a Yankee.
When I first moved here,
 I was on a fourth date with a girl,
until I got rack-jacked
by Phil Rizzuto.
I was there.
Holy cow, that guy had game.
I'm not seeing it.
Let me try
to Canada this up for you, eh?
How would you react
if one of those Ca-chuck guys
with the skates and the sticks
walked in here?
If one of the Vancouver Canucks
walked in here,
my panties would drop so hard,
there'd be a hole
in the floor halfway to China.
- That's what it's like with them.
- Well, Barney's screwed.
It's happening! Look.
Want to come over
and look at my snow globe collection?
Snow globe collection?
He's throwing junk out there.
That is Nick Swisher!
- Good effort.
- Good game.
Not good enough.
This whole week was a waste.
And tomorrow,
I'm going to get fired.
I'm really sorry, dude.
But for what it's worth,
this week wasn't a waste.
We were all having
a really horrible week
and you took our minds off it.
I had my first student drop my class...
It sucked.
I met my soul mate
and he never called me back.
I mean yet.
He will.
He will.
We scared off a really great couple
just because we share a toothbrush.
You share a toothbrush?
Them and Ted.
Wait a second.
When we were dating, you borrowed
that toothbrush all the time.
<i>And that's when Aunt Lily realized
what's great about sports:</i>
<i>They take your mind off your troubles,
if only for a moment.</i>
<i>And deep down,
we all need that perfect week.</i>
The second she sits down
next to Swisher, it's all over.
Wait a minute!
<i>Aldrin's got a bead on her!</i>
<i>She's running out of room.</i>
<i>She dives...</i>
I have no idea where she's going.
Are you okay?
Sorry.
I'm such a klutz!
I think I twisted my ankle.
Can you get me some ice?
Of course.
She did it!
I guess there is no such thing
as a jinx!
I'll get you some ice, Lily.
Damn it.
Swisher's back in play!
Follow me.
This guy and his wife
share a toothbrush!
So?
That's weird, right?
I think it's kind of sweet.
In a way, aren't we all trying
to find that special someone
to share a toothbrush with?
Excuse me.
Nick Swisher thinks we're sweet.
Martini?
We're having a beer with a Yankee.
How cool is that?
It's amazing.
I totally follow baseball.
Mookie Wilson, is that a thing?
Baseball, it's amazing.
But I tell you one thing,
it's no hockey.
I live...
right upstairs.
What do you say
we go back to my place?
To be honest,
I don't normally do that, but...
I feel a real connection here,
seven... Christy.
Please.
I did it!
Amazing!
Congratulations
on your perfect week!
I couldn't have done it
without my teammates.
On to a new topic.
Do you really think
you might get fired today?
Jim, I told you
I don't want to talk about that.
I'm a figment of your imagination,
so apparently you do.
Think about that.
What a jerk.
You're a jerk.
Mr. Donovan will see you now.
We've reached a decision.
We're keeping you on.
I know this past week
must have been tough on you.
I barely slept.
Here you go.
The official hat
of Barney's perfect week.
I was going to do shirts,
but you have to guess sizes.
And feelings get hurt.
It's a mess.
In commemoration of Barney's induction
into the Hall of Game,
this tie, worn on the seventh night
of his perfect week,
is hereby retired.
May Barney's heroic feat
be remembered
and spoken of
for generations to come.
I'm totally going
to sit my kids down one day
and tell them about the time
Barney nailed seven chicks in a row.
<i>Am I a bad dad?</i>
Take out order for Cook Pu?
We have a number two over here
for Cook Pu.
You guys got Wendy saying it now?
Come on, I get it.
Cook Pu is a stupid name,
it gets stupider the more you say it.
<i>Les enfants, je me rappelle un jour
où on a tous regardé le Super Bowl.</i>
<i>Enfin, pas tous.</i>
<i>Bienvenue au 44e Super Bowl à Miami.</i>
<i>Regardez-moi ce mec.</i>
<i>D'après vous,
c'est son vrai numéro ?</i>
- On sait où est Barney.
- Je prends sa part.

Vous savez qui a gagné
le Super Bowl ?
- Tu y étais. C'est...
- J'ai gagné,
parce que j'ai maintenant
un téléphone magique
qui sonne sans arrêt.
Vous savez qui est toujours
au bout du fil ?
Une nana.
Combien de nanas m'ont déjà appelé ?
Des tas.
Vous vous souvenez de Ranjit.
- Salut.
- Ravi de te revoir.
Ranjit sera mon chauffeur,
car cette semaine,
 je vais coucher
avec plein de femmes,
et je veux pas prendre le métro,
à cause des microbes.
Tu vas te taper
toutes celles qui appellent ?
Bien sûr.
Je vais rencontrer la première.
Cherchez un pull rouge.
D'après ses SMS, c'est une cochonne
dyslexique qui veut me faire un 96.
Point-virgule, fermez la parenthèse.
Pas super, ton plan.
Je vois bien le genre de fille.
Tu es le mec du Super Bowl.
Téléphone magique, les gars.
- Salut, les gars, salut, Ranjit.
- Ça va ?
- Cette bière est plate.
- C'est du whisky.
T'as des soucis, ma grande ?
<i>Don présentait la matinale
avec tante Robin.</i>
<i>Même si personne ne regardait
car c'était très tôt,</i>
<i>Robin restait très professionnelle,</i>
<i>mais pas Don.</i>
<i>Ce matin-là,
Don était allé trop loin.</i>
C'est ce que j'appelle
avoir une "niche" sur la tête ?
Pourquoi <i>Ulee's Gold</i>
est toujours dans les mots croisés ?
C'est à moi ? Désolé.
Dimanche prochain,
c'est la Saint-Valentin,
un patient chanceux recevra
un coeur en chocolat très spécial :
un coeur humain.
Au fait, j'ai une question.
Tu as des projets
pour la Saint-Valentin ?
Il t'a invitée ?
- Il m'a invitée.
- C'est dingue.
Ils utilisent "Ulee"
pour les voyelles.
T'as répondu quoi ?
On était à l'antenne.
Dans le feu de l'action, j'ai dit oui.
Robin, c'est sûr et certain
que tu vas épouser ce gars.
Ça va faire mal.
Quoi ? Bien sûr que non.
Je déteste Don,
et je peux pas annuler,
car je lui ai dit oui à l'antenne.
Qu'en pense ton téléspectateur ?
Tu sors avec lui à la Saint-Valentin ?
On avait des plans.
Se soûler et nettoyer l'appart
c'est ça ton plan ?
J'ai pas dit...
que c'était un bon plan.
Les gars, à moi maintenant,
et ça devient intéressant.
Regardez ces SMS.
Lisez celui-là.
Et celui-là.
Elle SMS sa mère avec ces doigts ?
Maintenant, celui-là.
Ou celui-là,
ou celui-là.
Mec, si tu faisais ça ?
Couche avec cette nana,
ensuite lis tes SMS.
Je peux pas.
Je peux pas coucher avec une fille
s'il y en a une autre plus sexy
avec qui je pourrais coucher.
Il y en a toujours une plus sexy.
Je sais.
C'est pas merveilleux ?
Ici Barney.
Donne la profondeur de ton bonnet.
Salut, maman.
Il y a toujours une fille plus sexy.
C'est pas ça, le problème ?
Il y a trop de possibilités :
les rencontres sur le net, les bars...
Montrer son numéro de téléphone
à la télévision.
Je n'ai jamais eu ce problème.
À l'âge de 18 ans,
j'ai fait un mariage arrangé,
et j'aime ma femme un peu plus
chaque jour qui passe.
C'est vrai. C'est très rare
que deux personnes se rencontrent
et tombent follement amoureux,
comme Robin et Don.
On va même pas aller dîner.
On va juste traîner chez lui.
C'est pas ce que vous pensez.
Il y aura un tas de monde.
Attends.
Il t'a dit quoi exactement,
quand il t'a invitée ?
Je reçois quelques amis,
passe faire un tour.
Robin, Don ne t'a pas invitée.
- Bien sûr qu'il m'a invitée.
- Non.
Si, il l'a fait.
Mais si.
Il l'a fait !
C'est la meilleure.
Je crois savoir ce qu'il se passe.
Tu veux que Don t'invite ?
Quoi ?
Non, je déteste Don.
J'arrête pas de penser
à quel point je le hais.
Toute la journée.
Je veux l'attraper,
lui enlever
ses vêtements à la noix et le fesser
jusqu'à ce qu'il ait
les fesses rouges.
La ferme !
Voilà. C'est ça
que le célibat vous fait endurer :
une incertitude constante
auto-destructive.
C'est fini.
Je veux être comme Ranjit.
J'ai passé mon temps
à chercher la femme parfaite,
et pour la Saint-Valentin,
je récure mes chiottes.
Quelqu'un d'autre
doit chercher pour moi.
Trouvez-moi ma femme.
Ou celle-là, ou bien celle-là
ou encore celle-là.
On doit trouver ta future femme ?
Oui. Il y a deux façons
pour sortir avec quelqu'un.
Draguer, ou être dragué.
Je suis souvent choisi.
Les filles aiment Teddy West Side.
Tu attends mon avis
sur le surnom que tu as choisi ?
Le voilà.
- J'adore.
- Vraiment ?
Teddy West Side, continue.
J'arrive pas à choisir.
Je choisis les mauvaises.
Mais vous, vous savez choisir.
Vous vous êtes choisis.
Avec l'aide du dortoir de Wesleyan.
Et d'un peu de Drakkar Noir.
Allez me trouver une fille.
On sortira à 4 pour la Saint-Valentin.
Si je l'aime bien, on se mariera...
si elle est d'accord,
et elle le sera...
car j'aurai mon blazer.
J'aime bien ce blazer,
presque autant que Robin aime Don.
Je n'aime pas Don.
Dans le cerveau,
la zone
qui te fait détester les gens
est située juste à côté de la zone
qui fait que t'es excitée.
Les deux réactions sont semblables,
c'est dur de les différencier.
Vous savez quoi ?
Je vais chercher un livre.
30 secondes.
C'est génial.
Regardez ça. C'est un lapin
Vous pouvez le regarder des heures
en étant persuadé que c'est un lapin,
mais un jour, vous le regardez
et vous réalisez... que...
c'est un canard.
Lapin, canard.
Dingue, non ?
<i>Ça l'était.</i>
Comme les relations.
Au début, tu haïssais Don.
Tu t'es dit : "C'est un canard",
mais un jour,
tu t'en rendras compte.
"Je l'aime bien, en fait.
"C'est un lapin."
Tu n'as rien compris.
Le canard c'est le truc
que tu aimes,
et le lapin,
le truc que tu détestes.
Je suis d'accord : vive les canards.
C'est clair.
Les canards, c'est mieux.
C'est faux...
Les lapins sont mignons.
Mais les canards...
Tu t'es déjà battu contre un canard ?
Ce sont des cons.
<i>Ça a été une des pires disputes
de notre groupe.</i>
Les canards sont délicieux !
Les lapins, ça pue !
On parle pas du goût !
Ça compte !
Qui a une patte de canard
pour lui porter chance ?
Tu as un duvet
rempli de poils de lapin.
Moi, j'en ai un
qui est rempli de plumes de canard !
C'est mieux !
C'est bien mieux !
Attendez !
Il me faut un autre livre !
Pourquoi on ferait pas un combat
entre un canard et un lapin,
dans une boîte ?
Car c'est illégal.
Seulement si on parie.
D'accord.
Je l'admets.
Vous avez gagné.
Dis-le.
Tu dois le dire.
Les canards...
battent les lapins.
Merci. Et Don est...
et sera toujours... un lapin.
J'en serais pas si sûr.
Réfléchis. Don ?
Donald ?
Donald...
Duck ?
Donald Duck ne porte jamais de ?
- De pantalon.
- De pantalon.
Don est un canard.
- Je peux "l'avocater" ?
- J'accepte.
<i>Les enfants, la frontière est mince
entre la haine et l'amour.</i>
<i>Voici une preuve :</i>
Je ne voudrais être qu'ici...
et uniquement à tes côtés.
Je dois répondre.
Ici Barney.
Je suis au milieu de quelqu'un...
quelque chose, et...
Tu es une toréador sexy ?
Tu dois partir.
Au MacLaren.
Au MacLaren.
Je ne voudrais être qu'ici...
et uniquement à tes côtés.
Tu veux bien m'excuser ?
Ici Barney.
T'es une patineuse japonaise
médaillée d'or ?
Être qu'ici, et à tes côtés.
Bon sang !
T'es une bombe ?
Vu que tu es très occupé,
j'irai droit au but.
Et c'est ma mauvaise jambe.
Très mauvaise.
Ça va ?
Bien sûr.
Pourquoi ça n'irait pas ?
Ici Barney.
<i>Barney était sûr
d'adorer son portable,</i>
<i>mais il comprit
que ce n'était pas du tout ça.</i>
<i>C'était tout autre chose.</i>
Je suis libre.
Là, c'est mieux.
Je ne voudrais être qu'ici.
Et uniquement à tes côtés.
Un problème ?
T'as entendu ?
Quoi ?
Ici Barney.
Bonnet D ?
Sérieux ?
<i>La St Valentin arriva enfin,</i>
<i>la date limite pour que Marshall et Lily
trouvent mon épouse.</i>
<i>Une tâche importante
qu'ils avaient, disons, oubliée.</i>
On n'avait pas double rencard
avec Ted ?
Ted ?
Non, il ne voit personne.
Souviens-toi,
il voulait qu'on lui...
Tu veux te marier ?
J'ignore quel genre d'architecte !
Maisons, immeubles, ces trucs-là.
Tu veux épouser mon ami Ted ?
Tu fais la difficile ?
T'es dans un bar
pour la St Valentin !
Excuse-moi...
Veux-tu épouser mon ami Ted ?
Ted a raison.
C'est difficile.
C'est ridicule.
Tu sais quoi ? On a oublié.
Je suis sûr que lui aussi.
<i>Voici le marié
dans son blazer préféré,</i>
<i>je vais rencontrer ma femme
et je vais...</i>
la captiver, l'émerveiller,
la subjuguer, la... troubler ?
Avant de rencontrer ta future femme,
tu viendrais pas avec moi,
à la fête de Don ?
Tu mets ça ?
- Pourquoi ?
- C'est un canard.
Il va direct faire le canard.
<i>Et elle va être fascinée.</i>
Je l'ai !
<i>On est allés à la fête de Don.</i>
Je veux pas m'immiscer dans ton rencard,
si ça devient un peu chaud...
- Ça ne risque pas !
- Je dis ça au cas où,
je dirai, "J'ai un rendez-vous".
Attends la suite.
J'y travaille depuis un moment.
Je m'envolerai.
Ça n'arrivera pas.
Mais, fais ça.
J'ai un rendez-vous.
Don, mais tu fais quoi ?
Un truc qui s'appelle
L'Homme À Poil.
Je l'ai lu sur un blog.
Je suis stupide.
Comment j'ai pu croire
que ça puisse marcher.
Je n'aurais jamais...
pu, j'ai des valeurs, tu sais.
Je m'attendais à une fête.
C'était juste pour que tu viennes.
Je m'attendais pas à voir ton mec.
Ted n'est pas mon mec.
C'est un ami.
Tu crois
que je suis un play-boy, non ?
On peut dire ça.
C'est un lapin.
Au moins, t'es fixée.
Ça va faire mal.
Je jette tes vieilles revues
d'architecture.
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Le ménage.
Va à ton rencard.
Bonne Saint-Valentin.
Tu es là.
J'ai réfléchi,
et si on annulait tout ?
- On l'a.
- Quoi ?
On l'a. C'est trop dingue.
On l'a cherchée toute la semaine,
et il y a quelques heures...
- Trudy ?
- Mariée.
- Bla bla ?
- Engagée.
- En amour ?
- Non.
Natalie ?
Elle déteste Ted.
Elle ne rajeunit pas.
Jetez-moi ça !
- Quoi ?
- Ce portable est maudit.
Maudit, je te dis !
J'essaie de l'ignorer
mais il n'arrête pas de sonner !
Ma vie est fichue !
Et si décrochais ?
S'il te plaît ! Laisse-moi répondre.
Si c'était une urgence ?
Elle peut être coincée
dans un soutien-gorge !
Laisse faire
le répondeur.
Il lui faut une femme.
On est trop exigeants.
Peu importe qui c'est.
Une fille du téléphone ?
Oui, mais bon.
On l'a rencontrée, et Ted,
c'est une violoniste mondialement
connue, elle cuisine, et
elle connaît
toutes les répliques du <i>Golf en folie</i>.
"Que faites-vous
au fond fin des bois ?"
"Au fin fond ?"
Que faites-vous là ?
<i>Alors, nous avons dîné.</i>
<i>Et le travail de Lily et Marshall
porta ses fruits,</i>
<i>car cette fille était géniale.</i>
En fait...
Natalia, raconte ton problème à Ted.
Dis-lui !
Je vais devoir quitter le pays
rapidement
parce que mon visa va expirer.
Elle doit se marier !
La loi dit expressément
qu'un étranger
ne peut pas rester plus de 6 mois
sans visa de travail.
<i>Mais à la fin...</i>
Et vous, monsieur ?
Lapin ou canard ?
Quoi ?
C'est un menu mais il n'y a plus
ni steak, ni poisson, ni poulet.
Alors, lapin ou canard ?
Lapin.
Désolé, les gars.
Je dois y aller.
Il commande du lapin et s'enfuit ?
Il me le faut !
Où est le portable ?
On se connaît.
Où est-il ?
Caché.
Où ça ?
<i>Où Lily l'avait-elle caché ?</i>
<i>Pour y répondre,
il faut revenir en arrière.</i>
Va à ton rencard.
Bonne Saint-Valentin.
C'est le portable de Barney.
Comment est-il arrivé là ?
Allez, gros rencard.
Où est le mal ?
<i>C'est comme ça
que je me suis fait draguer.</i>
Terrible, on se voit là-bas.
Je serai le gars avec un super blazer.
Je pense que comprendras
quand tu le verras.
À plus tard.
Tu es là.
Alors, lapin ou canard ?
Lapin. Désolé, les gars.
Je dois y aller.
Désolé, poupée. Je dois décrocher.
Portable de Barney,
ici Teddy West Side.
C'est mon portable Je le reprends !
Et je reprends aussi ton super surnom !
Ici Barney West Side.
J'adore trop !
Ça arrête pas de sonner.
Donne-le-moi.
Être célibataire, ça craint.
Ça te fait devenir dingue.
Je sais.
Tout ce temps à courir, à flipper,
et pour quoi ?
Tout ce que tu trouves,
c'est quelqu'un avec qui s'asseoir
et nettoyer la baignoire.
On se fiche du reste du monde,
car on peut faire ça nous-même.
Exact.
Exact.
- Je dois m'excuser.
- C'est bon. Faisons les infos.
Non, écoute.
Après ton départ,
j'étais gêné.
Pas car j'étais nu.
J'ai pas de problème avec ça.
J'ai vu.
Je me suis marié à la fac.
J'ai divorcé il y a 3 mois.
Je sais pas comment être célibataire.
Mais j'étais pas gêné pour ça.
J'étais gêné pour mon comportement,
ici, à Channel...
Ça commence par 1...
Douze.
Regarde ta tasse.
Exact.
Non, toi regarde cette tasse.
T'es une super présentatrice.
Tu mérites un partenaire qui assure.
Et dorénavant,
ce sera moi.
- Je le croirai quand je le verrai.
- Tu vas le voir tout de suite.
Je t'apporte un café.
Tu as un pantalon.
Regardez-moi ça.
Canard.
<i>I remember one time we all gathered
at my apartment to watch the Super Bowl.</i>
<i>Well, not all of us.</i>
<i>Welcome back
to Super Bowl XLIV in Miami.</i>
<i>Get a load of that guy.</i>
<i>You think that's his real number?</i>
- Well, that explains where Barney is.
- Dibs on his wings.

- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
Does anyone know
who won the Super Bowl?
- You were there. It was the...
- I won,
because I am now
in possession of a magic phone
that always rings.
And do you know who's always
usually on the other end?
A chick.
So how many chicks
do I have calling me now?
Infinity.
- You guys remember Ranjit.
- Hello.
Ranjit, good to see you.
I've enlisted Ranjit's services
as my personal driver
because for the next week,
I'll be sleeping with hundreds of women,
and I don't want to take the subway,
'cause you know, germs.
You're actually gonna hook up
with these girls that call you?
Indubitably.
I'm meeting the first one here.
Keep your eyes peeled for a red sweater.
Based on her texts, she's dirty,
dyslexic, and wants to 96 me.
Semicolon, end parentheses.
This ought to be good. I can only
imagine the quality of girl that...
You are the guy from the Super Bowl.
Magic phone, guys, magic phone.
- Hey, guys, hey, Ranjit.
- How's it going?
- That beer looks a little flat.
- It's Scotch.
Something troubling you, kiddo?
<i>Don was Aunt Robin's co-host
on her morning show.</i>
<i>Now, even though her show
was on so early that no one watched,</i>
<i>Aunt Robin was a consummate
professional,</i>
<i>but Don was not.</i>
<i>But that morning,
Don had gone too far.</i>
Now, that's what I call having
a "woof" over your head.
Why is Ulee's Gold
in every crossword?
It's me? Sorry, sorry.
Next Sunday is Valentine's Day,
and one lucky patient
will be receiving
a very special chocolate heart,
a human heart.
That reminds me.
I've been meaning to ask you.
Do you have any,
Valentine's Day plans?
He asked you out?
- He asked me out.
- That's crazy.
And they use "Ulee"
'cause of the vowels.
What did you say?
We were on the air,
I was on the spot, so I said okay.
Robin, you are going to marry
this guy so freaking hard.
Right in the butt.
What?! No, I hate Don,
and now I can't cancel because I said
I would go out with him on the air.
What would your viewer think?
You said you'd go out with him
on Valentine's? I thought we had plans.
Getting drunk
and cleaning the apartment was a plan?
I did not
say it was a good plan.
Guys, guys, guys, we're on me now,
and it is getting interesting.
Look at these texts. Read this one.
Now, look at this one.
Does she text
her mother with those fingers?
Now, look at this one.
Or this one,
or this one.
Buddy, how about you do this?
Go nail that girl,
then read your texts.
I can't do that.
I just can't hook up with a girl
if there is a hotter girl out there
with whom up can be hooked.
Isn't there always a hotter girl?
I know.
Isn't it wonderful?
Go for Barney.
Cut to the chase, what's your cup size?
Hi, Mom.
There's always a hotter girl.
Isn't that the problem in a nutshell?
There's too many options,
you got Internet dating, you got bars...
Holding up your phone number
on national TV.
I never had that problem.
When I was 18,
I had an arranged marriage,
and I love my wife
more and more every day.
It is true. It's, it's very rare
that two people just meet
and fall madly in love,
like Robin and Don.
We're not even, like,
going out for dinner.
We're just hanging out at his place.
It's not like that. It's just us
and a bunch of other people.
Wait, Robin, what exactly did
Don say when he asked you out?
I'm having some friends
for a little party. You should
come by if you want.
Robin, Don didn't ask you out.
- Of course he asked me out.
- No, he didn't.
Yes, he did.
He did.
He did, he did!
Well, dog my cats.
I think I know what's going on here.
Did you want Don to ask you out?
What?!
No, I hate Don.
I can't stop thinking
about how much I hate him.
It's like, it's like all the time.
I just want to attack him
and rip his stupid clothes off,
just spank him with his little paddle
until his bum's all red.
Shut up!
See? That right there
is what free will gets you...
Constant, ego-shattering
uncertainty.
I'm done with that.
I want what Ranjit has.
I've spent my entire adult life
looking for the perfect woman,
and I'm spending Valentine's Day
scrubbing the toilet.
I need someone else
to find me that woman.
Arranged marriage me.
Or this one or this one or this one.
You want us
to arrange your marriage?
Absolutely.
There's two sides to dating, right?
Picking and getting picked.
Getting picked I'm good at.
Ladies love Teddy West Side.
You're waiting for me to comment
on your self-assigned nickname.
Here's my comment.
- I love it.
- Really?
Teddy West Side, continue.
It's the picking I suck at.
I pick the wrong girls.
But you're the best pickers I know.
You picked each other.
With a slight assist
from the Wesleyan Housing Department.
And a healthy splash
of Drakkar Noir.
Get out there, find me a girl.
We'll double-date on Valentine's Day.
If I like her, I will marry her...
if she's cool with it,
and she will be...
Cause I'll wear my nice blazer.
I love that blazer
almost as much as Robin loves Don.
I do not love Don.
Neurologically speaking,
the part of the human brain
that makes you hate people
is located right next
to the part of the brain
that makes you want to jump them.
The two responses are so similar,
it's hard to tell them apart.
You know what it's like?
I have to get a book.
Give me 30 seconds!
This is fun.
Look at this picture.
It's a rabbit.
You can look at it for hours
and be absolutely sure
it's a rabbit,
but then one day you look at it
and you realize... wait a second...
it's a duck.
A rabbit, a duck.
Isn't this fun?
<i>It sure was.</i>
Relationships are like that.
When you first met Don,
you hated him.
You thought, "This guy is a duck",
but one of these days,
you're going to realize,
"This is actually something I love.
"He's a rabbit."
You got it backwards there.
The duck is the thing you love,
the rabbit is the thing you hate.
I gotta agree;
ducks up, rabbits down.
Definitely.
Ducks are better than rabbits.
Ducks are...
Rabbits are adorable!
Ducks are, like...
Have you ever been
in a fight with a duck?
I mean, ducks are jerks!
<i>This led to one of the most
intense arguments</i>
<i>our group has ever had.</i>
Duck is delicious!
Rabbit is all gamey!
We're not talking about flavor!
Flavor counts!
Who carries around a duck's foot
for good luck! Anyone!
You wrap yourself
in a comforter stuffed with rabbit hair!
I'll wrap myself in one
stuffed with duck feathers!
Who's cozier?
But who's cozier?!
Hold on! I have to get another book!
Why don't we take a rabbit, a duck,
stick 'em in a cardboard box,
and let them fight it out?!
Because it's illegal, Ted!
Only if we bet on it, Marshall!
Fine!
I concede!
You win!
Say it.
You have to say it.
Ducks good...
rabbits are bad.
Thank you. And Don is...
And always will be... a rabbit.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Think about it. Don?
Donald?
Donald...
Duck?
And what, I wonder,
does Donald Duck never wear?
- Pants.
- Pants.
Don's a duck.
- Can I say "lawyered"?
- I'll allow it.
<i>Yes, kids, sometimes
there's a fine line</i>
<i>between love and hate.
Case in point:</i>
There is no place
I would rather be...
and no one I'd rather be with.
I should get that.
Go for Barney.
I'm sort of in the middle of someone...
something right now, and I...
You're a hot lady bullfighter?
You gotta go.
MacLaren's Pub.
There is no place I would rather be
and no one I would rather be...
Would you excuse me for one moment?
Go for Barney.
You're a gold medalist
Japanese figure skater?
<i>Adios, muchacha!</i>
No place I'd rather be,
no one I'd rather...
For Pete's sake!
You're a hot chick?
<i>Sayonara!</i>
I realize that you're very busy,
so I'll just get straight
to the point.
Shakah!
And that's my bad leg.
Very bad.
Are you okay?
Of course.
Why wouldn't I be?
Go for Barney.
<i>Barney had been sure
that phone was something he loved,</i>
<i>but now,
he realized it wasn't that at all.</i>
It was something else entirely.
I'm free.
Now this feels right.
There is no place I would rather be.
And no one I would rather be...
What's wrong?
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
Go for Barney.
D cups?
Really?
<i>Finally Valentine's Day arrived,</i>
<i>the deadline for Marshall and Lily
to find me a wife.</i>
<i>An important job they had,
well, forgotten to do.</i>
Aren't we go
on a double date with Ted.
Ted?
No, he's not seeing anyone.
Remember he asked us to find a...
Want to get married?
I don't know what kind of architect!
Houses, buildings, that kind of crap.
Want to marry my friend Ted?
What, you can be choosy?
You're in a bar on Valentine's Day!
Just real quick...
You want to marry my friend Ted?
Man, Ted's right.
It's tough out there.
This is stupid.
You know what? We forgot about this.
I'm sure Ted did, also.
<i>Here comes the groom,</i>
<i>in his favorite blazer,</i>
<i>gonna meet my wife and I...</i>
Blazer, Tazer.
Gazer, Ta... Bazer?
Before you go meet your future wife,
why don't you come
to Don's party with me?
You're wearing this?
Why?
He's a duck.
That dude be straight duckin'.
<i>And I think that I'll amaze her. </i>
Nailed it!
<i>So we went to Don's party.</i>
I don't want to crowd you
on your little date here,
- so if things start to get hot...
- They're not gonna get hot...
I'm just saying, if they do,
I'll just say,
"Well, I got a dinner rez", and then...
It's the best part.
I've been working on this for a while.
I'll duck out.
It's not gonna happen.
But do that.
Well, I got a dinner rez.
Don, what the hell are you doing?
It's something called The Naked Man.
I read about it on some guy's blog.
I'm so stupid.
Why did I think
it would work on you?
 'cause I would never...
Could, like... standards,
so, you know.
I thought this was a party.
I said that to get you to come.
I didn't think you'd bring a date.
Ted's not my date.
He's a friend.
You think
I'm some kind of playboy now.
You could say that.
So he's a rabbit.
At least you know for sure.
This may hurt a little.
I'm recycling
your old Architecture Weekly Magazines.
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning.
You go on your date.
Happy Valentine's Day.
You're here.
I've been thinking.
Maybe we should call this off.
- We got her.
- What?
We got her.
It's crazy.
We were searching all week,
and then, a couple hours ago...
Trudy?
Married.
- Blah, blah?
- Committed.
- Relationship?
- Bellevue.
Natalie?
Ted's her least favorite person
in the world.
Well, she's not getting any younger.
Get rid of it!
- What?
- This phone is cursed.
Cursed, I tell you!
I try to ignore it,
but it just never stops ringing!
It's ruining my life!
I should get that.
Please!
Let me answer it.
It could be an emergency.
She could be trapped in a giant bra!
Let it go... to voice mail.
We have to find a wife.
We're being too choosy.
It doesn't matter who it is.
It's a phone girl?
I know, but no.
Then we met her, and Ted,
she's a world-class violinist,
she's a gourmet cook, and...
she can quote
every line from Caddyshack.
"And what brings you
to this nape of the woods?"
"Neck of the wape?"
Why are you here?
<i>So we all had dinner.</i>
<i>And kids, Lily ans Marshall's hard work
had paid off,</i>
because that girl was terrific.
In fact...
But Natalia, tell Ted the problem.
Tell him!
Unfortunately, I'm going to have
to leave the country soon
because my visa is about to expire.
She needs to get married!
Federal law expressly dictates
that a foreign national
can't maintain residency for longer
than six months without a work visa.
<i>But when it came down...</i>
And you, sir?
The rabbit or the duck?
What?
It's a prix-fixe menu,
we're out of steak, fish and chicken.
So, rabbit or duck?
Rabbit.
Sorry, guys.
I got to go.
Why would Ted order rabbit
if he was gonna run out?
I need it back!
Where's the phone?
I met you already.
Where's the phone?
It's hidden.
Where?
<i>Where had Lily hidden the phone?</i>
To answer that question,
we have to back up a little bit.
You go on your date.
Happy Valentine's Day.
It's Barney's phone.
I wonder how it got in there.
Come on.
Big date.
What's the harm?
<i>And just like that, I was hooked.</i>
Terrific, I will see you there.
I'll be the guy in the awesome blazer.
I think you'll know the blazer
when you see it.
I gotta go.
You're here.
So... rabbit or duck?
Rabbit.
Sorry, guys.
I gotta go.
Sorry, babe.
I gotta take this.
Barney's phone.
- Teddy West Side speaking.
- It's my phone!
I am taking it back!
And I'm taking your cool nickname, too!
Barney West Side speaking.
I love it so much!
It just keeps ringing.
Give it to me.
Being single sucks.
It turns you into a crazy person.
I know.
So much running around and freaking out,
and for what?
It's all so you can find someone
you can sit on a couch
and put off cleaning
the bathroom with.
The joke's on the rest of the world,
because we can do that on our own.
Exactly.
Exactly.
- I have to apologize...
- Just save it. Let's do the news.
No, listen.
After you left the other night,
I was embarrassed.
Not because I was naked.
I'm actually okay with my body.
Clearly.
I got married in college.
I just got divorced three months ago.
I have no idea how to be single.
But that's not why
I was embarrassed.
I was embarrassed about my behavior
right here at Channel...
It starts with a one.
12.
I mean, just look at your mug.
Right.
Well, no. You look at this mug.
You are a tremendous news anchor.
And you deserve a co-anchor
who gives a crap.
And from here on out,
that's gonna be me.
I'll believe that when I see it.
You'll see it right now.
I'll go get you coffee.
You're wearing pants.
Well, look at that.
Duck.
<i>Les enfants, dans tous mes récits,</i>

<i>Dans celui-ci, je suis un idiot.</i>
Les gars, c'est le grand soir.
J'invite Tiffany chez moi pour voir
ma collection d'appareils photo.
- C'est son appât.
- "L'appât ?"
Un vrai gentleman
invente un prétexte
pour attirer une honorable dame
chez lui.
Des choses belles ou intéressantes
qu'on peut feindre d'admirer 5 minutes
avant qu'elle saute sur votre manche.
Comme venir "emprunter un livre"
ou "jeter un oeil sur un vinyle".
Ou voir votre nouveau poster de rap.
Un poster de rap ?
Sur qui ça marcherait ?
C'était la première semaine de fac.
Et j'adorais Wu-Tang Clan.
L'appât, c'est délicat.
Ça doit être assez intéressant
pour attirer les filles,
mais ça ne doit pas
monopoliser la nuit.
<i>J'ai découvert qu'une machine à sous
était trop amusante.</i>
<i>Et qu'un trampoline...</i>
<i>était trop dangereux.</i>
<i>Puis j'ai trouvé le parfait appât :</i>
<i>un cochon nain.</i>
Un cochon nain ?
Sur qui ça marcherait ?
- T'as un cochon nain ?
- Je savais pas que t'en avais un !
- Tu me prêtes ton cochon nain ?
- Bien sûr.
T'as un cochon nain ? Mon Dieu !
J'y crois pas !
T'es si mignon !
T'es le plus mignon des cochons nains !
Quoi ?
T'as toujours été aussi jolie ?
Ou tu vas me sortir qu'au lycée,
tu étais timide et maladroite ?
C'était le cas.
J'avais 45 kilos de trop
et des dents de lapin.
- Sérieux ?
- Non, j'ai toujours été sexy.
Que peut-on y faire ?
Tu sais qui l'adorerait aussi ?
Mon copain.

C'est agaçant, non ?
C'est pas vraiment mon copain.
- Bien.
- Techniquement, il l'est.
Il l'est ou pas ?
Un peu des deux.
C'est pas blanc ou noir.
Tu comprends quelque chose ?
Écoute, je t'aime bien.
Il faut juste que tu sois patient.
Je veux pas te perdre,
Grands Yeux Marrons.
Quelqu'un veut pas perdre
Grand Yeux Marrons.
Tu es sa roue de secours.
Quoi ? C'est pas vrai.
T'es bel et bien
une roue de secours.
Elle te fait marcher,
ne s'engage pas avec toi,
mais elle te garde sous le coude,
au cas où,
comme une vieille boîte
de raviolis dans le placard.
Qui achète des boites de raviolis
et les mange pas de suite ?
Amen, ma soeur.
T'en fait pas, on y est tous passés.
J'ai fais les deux.
J'ai été roue de secours et roulure.
Soyez pas choqués.
Je me suis un peu lâchée,
mais je suis restée digne.
Je l'ai été.
Lisa Walker.
Imaginez :
St Cloud, Minnesota, en 1994.
Tu sais, Lisa, je me demandais...
si tu voulais...
sortir avec moi ?
Ce serait super.
Je sors avec un mec
qui a une LeBaron décapotable
et il a ses entrées à la patinoire,
je détesterais gâcher ça.
Je comprends.
Mais que dis-tu de ça ?
Tu peux être mon copain secret
qui ferait tous mes devoirs.
D'accord.
Tu veux voir mon poster de rap ?
Salope des posters.
Bref...
Lisa Walker m'a fait marcher
pendant des mois, jusqu'à ce qu'un soir,
j'aille lui dire
combien je l'aimais.
En chanson.
<i>Elle n'était pas là,
donc j'ai attendu.</i>
<i>Et attendu.</i>
<i>Je me suis réveillé 4 h plus tard,
couvert de neige.</i>
<i>C'est là que j'ai vu...</i>
<i>ses traces de pas.</i>
<i>Elle m'est passée par-dessus,
pour rentrer chez elle.</i>
Ça m'a libéré.
J'étais plus sa roue de secours.
Ce n'est pas ce qu'il se passe
entre Tiffany et moi.
Écoutez ça.
Je t'ai dans la peau.
Mais, je peux pas être avec toi,
pour le moment.
Ted, "Pour le moment"
est la devise des roues de secours.
"Pour le moment" brosse le tableau
d'un moment magique à venir
quand tout ira bien,
mais en vérité, ça n'arrivera jamais.
C'est comme ça.
"Je peux pas être avec toi".
"Pour le moment".
Je crois que mon ex du lycée
en pince toujours pour moi.
Tu crois ?
C'est sûr, oui.
Il est venu à notre mariage
pour te reconquérir.
- Et c'est bizarre de le voir au boulot.
- Attends. Quoi ?
Scooter bosse à la cantine
de l'école. On en a parlé.
Jolie robe.
Des miches ?
<i>Je t'aime.</i>
On n'en a absolument pas parlé !
Bien sûr que si.
Des milliers de fois.
Le Scooter, de la cantine.
J'ai cru que tu parlais
d'une sorte de vieil engin
sur lequel se trimballent
les pauvres cantinières sous-payées.
Ça explique un tas de choses.
Le Scooter, de la cantine,
était là aujourd'hui.
Tu lui as sauté dessus ?
Tu l'as chevauché ?
Ah bon ?
Si j'étais toi, je grimperais dessus
jusqu'à ce que je casse ce joujou.
Donc ces pauvres femmes
doivent marcher ?
Attends.
Scooter travaille à ton école ?
T'es jaloux ?
Non, je me sens mal pour Scooter.
Il a pris ce boulot
en croyant avoir une chance avec toi.
Tu dois clarifier la situation,
pour qu'il passe à autre chose,
et qu'une vraie cantinière
récupère sa place.
J'ai essayé.
Tu as une pause entre 15 h et 16 h.
Moi aussi.
On s'enfuit ensemble ?
Laisse-moi t'expliquer.
Il n'y a aucune chance
qu'on finisse ensemble.
Pour le moment.
On se voit demain.
C'est Mardi Mexicain.
"Pour le moment" ?
Tu l'as <i>momentané</i> ?
Tu dois le laisser partir,
pour de bon.
T'as raison.
Après-demain, je le ferai.
- Pourquoi pas demain ?
- Je peux pas ruiner le Mardi Mexicain.
Vraiment ?
Tu vas rester ici toute la nuit,
à regarder la porte,
car Tiffany t'as dit
qu'elle "essaierait de passer" ?
Je ne vais pas laisser tomber.
<i>J'aurais dû laisser tomber.</i>
Elle est spéciale.
<i>C'était le diable.</i>
Ça va marcher avec elle.
<i>Pas du tout, idiot. </i>
Laisse-moi t'expliquer :
cette fille est un poison,
et il faut qu'elle sorte de ta vie.
La voilà.
Elle a amené des collègues.
Accroche-toi à cette fille.
Et ne la laisse jamais partir !
J'ai rarement vu
des filles aussi belles.
Et elles bossent ensemble ?
Il n'y a qu'une seule explication.
Tiffany est repré... ?
représentante pharmaceutique ?
- Oui. Comment tu sais ?
- Et tu ne m'en as rien dit ?
C'est qu'un boulot.
Qu'un bou... qu'un boulot... ?
Ted, dans l'histoire,
il y a toujours eu une profession
dans laquelle les jolies filles,
comme Tiffany, se sont regroupées.
- Tu veux que je te raconte ?
- Je vais dire non.
Tout a commencé
il y a 2,5 millions d'années.
<i>L'homme était chasseur.</i>
<i>Donc la profession
la plus sexy était ?</i>
<i>Cueilleuse. </i>
L'Homo Erectus porte bien son nom.
<i>Quand l'homme maitrisa la technologie,
la profession la plus sexy évolua. </i>
Je suis sûr que c'est une hernie.
Vous pouvez revérifier ?
<i>Puis, l'homme conquit les cieux. </i>
<i>Et les jolies filles mirent des talons
pour devenir hôtesses.</i>
Position verticale verrouillée.
Et l'homme dit : "La vie est dure,
"je devrais commencer
à prendre des médicaments".
Alors les filles sexy
ont débarqué chez les docteurs,
en étant assez sexy
pour rendre redondantes
leurs pilules pour l'érection.
Et maintenant, elles sont la profession
la plus sexy qui soit.
Grands Yeux Marrons.
Tu vas bien ?
Super bien.
Au fait, tu t'es débarrassé
de ton idiot de petit ami ?
Non, monsieur.
Elle m'a touché le nez.
Mec, lâche Tiffany
et rejoins-moi dans le libre-service
des représentantes pharmaceutiques.
Effets secondaires :
perte d'habits, brûlure de tapis,
souffle coupé,
et mal aux abdos le lendemain.
Que rêver de mieux ?
Je sais que t'as du mal
à laisser partir Scooter.
Tu as besoin d'entraînement.
Le problème,
ce sont ses adorables yeux tristes ?
Tais-toi, femme.
Je veux que tu regardes
ce cochon nain
et que tu lui dises
que vous ne serez jamais ensemble.
Cochon nain,
on ne sera jamais ensemble.
- Pour le moment.
- Sois courageuse !
Désolée, mais...
il est terriblement mignon.
Je veux le câliner toute la journée.
Oh que oui.
C'est marrant.
Avant, c'est à moi que tu disais ça.
Je le fais encore.
Plus tellement.
Plus tellement.
<i>Les fêtes des pharma déchirent tout</i>
<i>Car elles ne s'arrêtent jamais !</i>
J'ai déjà couché avec trois filles.
En plus, mon cholestérol est bas.
Ma jambe folle est guérie.
Je me sens trop bien.
Bonne nouvelle.
Tiffany a largué son copain.
- Je suis plus la roue de secours.
- Bien sûr que si.
Écoutez ce qu'on a fait hier soir.
<i>On s'est d'abord câlinés.</i>
<i>Ensuite,</i>
<i>on a partagé un gâteau au chocolat.</i>
<i>Et pour finir, sans me vanter</i>
<i>je lui ai fait un massage de pieds
plutôt sensuel.</i>
Et, laisse-moi deviner.
C'est pas allé plus loin.
Non...
Et à tout hasard,
c'est toi qui as fait le gâteau ?
C'était une préparation.
Il n'y a aucune honte à l'admettre.
On a tous été roue de secours
et on en a tous eu.
C'est pas du tout mon cas.
- Quoi ?
- Tu plaisantes ?
Et la fille
de la bibliothèque à la fac ?
Henrietta ?
Elle et moi, on est juste amis.
C'est surtout ta roue de secours.
Pas du tout.
<i>Elle l'était.</i>
<i>Enfin...</i>
<i>On s'est câlinés.</i>
<i>On a partagé du gâteau au chocolat.</i>
<i>Elle m'a massé les pieds...
longtemps.</i>
<i>J'en suis pas fier.</i>
T'aimes avoir Henrietta pas loin,
tout comme Tiffany aime t'avoir.
Ça regonfle un peu l'ego.
Pas étonnant que tu sois experte
pour garder des roues de secours.
Et concernant ce cameraman
qui bosse avec toi ?
- Mike et moi, on est juste amis.
- Allez.
Ça, c'est bon !
As-tu déjà envisagé
qu'on passe à la vitesse supérieur ?
Si tu parles de ma lessive, fonce.
Marché conclu.
Je ne garde pas Mike
comme roue de secours.
Tu es la reine du pneu.
Je suis une fille.
Nos attributs
sont comme une toile d'araignée.
Parfois, on attrape n'importe quoi.
Ça le justifie pas.
Et Henrietta,
elle perd pas son temps avec toi ?
Elle sait qu'on est juste amis.
D'ailleurs, je vais l'appeler
pour sortir ce soir,
en tant qu'amis.
Je t'aime. Quoi ?
Tu veux un massage ?
Je me suis entraînée.
Non, ça ira.
Je savais pas si t'aurais faim,
j'ai sorti des bricoles.
Trois fois rien.
<i>En y repensant,</i>
<i>j'ignore comment j'ai pu ne pas voir
qu'Henrietta était folle de moi.</i>
<i>Je pars ce week-end
pour un mariage. </i>
<i>Tu veux m'accompagner ?</i>
J'adorerais.
Tu fais quoi là maintenant ?
Génial.
On se voit dans dix minutes ?
Super.
Désolé, Henrietta, un imprévu.
On remet ça ?
Pas de problème.
T'es costaud.
<i>Quel abruti.</i>
Henrietta...
Où est passé Ted ?
- On devait le rencontrer.
- Y a eu un imprévu, maman !
Je t'avais dit qu'il existait pas.
J'ai tout entendu.
<i>Me voilà,</i>
<i>persuadé de franchir une nouvelle étape
dans une relation :</i>
<i>un mariage à la campagne.</i>
<i>Ça arrivait enfin.</i>
Champagne ?
Mon Dieu, j'ai oublié de t'appeler.
On peut parler de ce que tu veux,
là maintenant.
C'est Jack.
C'est le témoin du mariage.
On s'est remis ensemble.
En y repensant,
tu aurais dû prévenir.
Tu es Ted ?
Ton gâteau au chocolat est d'enfer.
Il est pas génial ?
Et il joue dans un groupe.
Merci.
Allez, laisse tomber Scooter.
Essaye encore.
Cochon nain...
Je veux pas de toi.
- Pour le moment.
- Sois forte !
Cochon nain...
Je veux pas de toi.
Jamais.
Achève-le !
On sera jamais ensemble,
même d'un point de vue sexuel.
Joli.
- Bizarre de dire ça à un cochon.
- Vraiment déplacé.
Je pense que nous deux,
ça ne marchera pas.
Pour le moment.
<i>C'est là que ça m'a frappé.
J'étais une roue de secours.</i>
<i>J'ai aussi compris...</i>
Ça m'a tellement manqué.
<i>Que Tiffany était celle de ce type.
C'était un cercle vicieux.</i>
<i>Henrietta était ma roue.</i>
<i>Et j'appris plus tard
que ce gars était celle d'Henrietta.</i>
Tu sais quoi ?
Ça ne marchera jamais.
C'est fini.
Et c'est mieux pour la circulation
si tu masses avec les pouces.
Là, c'est fini.
Marshall, je peux le faire.
Prouve-le-moi.
Rapporte-moi un pudding.
Écoute, Scooter.
Toi et moi, on sera jamais ensemble.
Pour le moment !
Désolé, il est trop chou.
Écoute.
- Je veux pas être avec toi.
- Pour le moment.
Accroche-toi !
Je vivrai pas éternellement.
Hier, j'étais avec
cette représentante si sexy
qu'il faut voir un médecin
si t'as pas une érection de plus de 4 h.
J'ai pas raison ?
Il n'y a personne...
juste celle avec qui tu sortais.
Je te présente
la nouvelle représentante.
Gladys Reynolds.
Ravie de vous connaître.
Je vends des médicaments
contre le cholestérol.
Allez, allons chercher à boire.
C'est fini.
Quoi ?
Les représentantes pharmaceutiques
ne sont plus toutes sexy.
C'est la fin d'une ère.
Tu dramatises un peu.
Vraiment ?
Ça commence avec une Gladys.
Et après, des gays ordinaires
rentrent dans les rangs.
Et avant de dire ouf,
les représentantes ressemblent
à l'équipage d'un vol
Albuquerque - Little Rock.
C'est fini !
<i>Cette nuit-là,
je suis allé chez Henrietta...</i>
<i>prêt à la laisser tomber.</i>
Voici Jack, le témoin du mariage.
C'est fini.
La réponse est oui !
J'ai pire.
C'est parfait !
Maman, papa !
Ted veut que je l'épouse !
Je savais que ça arriverait !
Fils !
Il y a eu...
Qu'as-tu fait ?
J'ai sérieusement envisagé
de l'épouser par pure maladresse.
Mais je l'ai pas fait.
J'ai fait ce qu'on devrait
tous faire dans ces cas-là.
Je lui ai brisé le coeur.
Désolé d'être aussi direct,
mais je te dois bien ça.
Je veux pas être avec toi.
Pour le moment ?
Jamais.
Mais on se marie toujours, non ?
Ce fut... violent.
Désolé, l'ami.
Être honnête c'est dur,
mais au final,
c'est la meilleure alternative.
Mon ange.
Mike.
Je dois te dire quelque chose.
T'as lavé le linge délicat ?
- Encore une machine.
- Ça peut attendre.
Comment c'était ?
Toujours en deuil
pour la fin de ton ère ?
J'ai compris que leur règne
devait s'achever pour faire place
à une nouvelle profession.
Peut-être que ce sera...
un officier des communications
dans un vaisseau spatial
vers un système solaire éloigné
inimaginable.
Ce sera peut-être... les pervenches.
Va savoir.
Mais une chose est sûre.
Le futur rayonne
comme un soleil géant
lançant des rayons de lumières
dans nos coeurs et nos esprits.
D'où vient ce changement ?
J'ai réalisé
que l'espoir est éternel.
Ça, et cette boîte de pilules violettes
que j'ai trouvé sous mon coussin.
Je sais pas ce que c'est,
mais c'est grandiose.
<i>Kids, in many of my stories,</i>
<i>I'm a starry-eyed romantic
on a noble search for true love.</i>
<i>In this one, I'm just a jerk. </i>
Well, guys, tonight is the night.
I'm inviting Tiffany up to my place
to see my antique camera collection.
- It's Ted's bait.
- "Bait"?
A true gentleman invents a pretense
to lure an honorable lady
into his apartment.
Some item of interest
or beauty you can both
pretend to admire for five minutes
before she hops on your disco stick.
Like she's coming up to "borrow a book"
or "check out an album on vinyl. "
Or to see your new rap poster.
"Rap poster"?
Who would that work on?
It was the first week of college.
I was really into Wu-Tang Clan.
Yeah, bait is tricky.
It has to be something interesting
enough to get the girl upstairs,
but not so interesting
that it overpowers the night.
<i>I found that a slot machine
was too fun. </i>
<i>And a trampoline... </i>
<i>turned out to be too dangerous.</i>
<i>But then I found the perfect bait:</i>
<i>a teacup pig. </i>
"A teacup pig"?
Who's that working on?
- You have a teacup pig?! I
- Didn't know you had a teacup pig!
- Can I borrow your teacup pig?
- Yes, you can.
You have a teacup pig?! My gosh!
I can't believe you have a teacup pig!
You're just so cute!
Yes, you are the cutest piggy ever!
What?
Were you always this pretty?
Or are you going to give me that whole,
"In high school I was
really shy and awkward" line?
I <i>was</i> shy and awkward.
I was, like, a hundred pounds heavier
and I had these crazy buck teeth.
- Seriously?
- No, I've always been hot.
What are you going to do?
Do you know who else
would love this teacup pig?
My boyfriend.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-
..: www.sous-titres.eu :..
- You have a boyfriend?
- I know.
So annoying, right?
I mean, he's
not <i>really</i> my boyfriend.
- Good.
- I mean, technically, he kind of is.
Is he or isn't he?
Some of both,
but definitely not either.
Are you getting any of this?
Look, I really like you.
I just need you to be patient.
I don't want to lose you,
Big Brown Eyes.
Somebody doesn't want to lose
Big Brown Eyes.
She's got you on the hook.
What? What?
I'm not on the hook.
You are totally on the hook.
She's stringing you along.
She's not committing to you,
but she's keeping you
around just in case,
like an old can of chili
in the pantry.
Who's buying canned chili
and not eating it immediately?
 Amen, sister.
Don't feel bad. We've all been there.
I've been on both sides of it.
I've been a hookey and a hooker.
Move past it, guys.
I've been a little bit loose,
but money never changed hands.
I've been on the hook.
Lisa Walker.
Picture it:
1994, St. Cloud, Minnesota.
So I was, like, thinking, Lisa...
do you maybe want to,
like, go out with me?
That sounds great.
But I'm sort of seeing this guy.
He's got a LeBaron convertible
and an "in" at the roller rink,
so I'd hate to burn that bridge.
I understand.
But how about this?
You can be my secret boyfriend
who does all my homework for me.
A'ight.
You want to see my rap poster?
Poster whore.
Anyway...
Lisa Walker strung me
along for months until one night,
I went to go tell her
how much I loved her.
In song.
<i>She wasn't home yet, so I waited.</i>
<i>And waited. </i>
<i>I woke up four hours later,</i>
<i>covered in snow. </i>
<i>And that's when I saw it. </i>
<i>Lisa's footsteps. </i>
<i>She had walked right over me
and into the house. </i>
It was the best thing that could've
happened. It got me off her hook.
Okay, that is definitely not
what's going on with me and Tiffany.
Listen to this.
I'm really into you.
I just can't be with you right now.
Ted, "right no" is the classic
on-the-hook catchphrase.
"Right now" paints a picture of
some sort of magical future time
when everything will work out, but
the truth is, that will never happen.
It's like this.
"I can't be with you. "
"Right now. "
I think my high school boyfriend,
is still sort of on the hook for me.
Sort of?
He totally is.
The poor guy showed up at our
wedding hoping to win you back.
It's sometimes weird
when I see him at work.
Wait. What?
Scooter works in the school cafeteria.
We've talked about this.
Lily. Nice dress.
Tater-tots?
We most certainly have
not talked about this!
Yes, we have.
I've mentioned it tons of times.
"Lunch Lady Scooter. "
I thought that you were referring
to some sort of long overdue
device that carries around
those poor,
underappreciated lunch ladies!
This explains a lot.
Lunch Lady Scooter
was there again today.
Did you jump on that thing?
Give it a ride?
Really? If it were me,
I'd be riding that scooter
all day long until I broke
that thang in half.
So those poor women still
have to walk everywhere?
Wait. Scooter is working
at your school?!
Are you jealous?
No, I just feel bad for Scooter.
'Cause the reason he took that job
is he thinks he has a shot with you.
You have to make it clear
that he doesn't,
so that he can move on
and a real lunch lady
can get her job back. Damn!
I've tried.
I saw you had seventh period free.
So do I.
You want to run away together?
Let me be clear, Scooter.
There is no way you and I
can ever be together.
Right now.
I'll see you tomorrow, Lily.
It's Tijuana Tuesday.
"Right now"?
You right-now'd Scooter?
You need to let him
off the hook once and for all.
You're right. Day after tomorrow,
that's exactly what I'm going to do.
Why not tomorrow?
Baby, I can't ruin Tijuana Tuesday.
Really?
You're really going to sit here
all night watching the door
because Tiffany said
she'll "try to stop by"?
Barney, I'm not going
to just give up on her.
<i>I should have given up on her.</i>
This girl is special.
<i>She was the devil. </i>
Things are going
to work out with her.
<i>No, they're not, dumbass. </i>
Ted, let me be clear:
this girl is a poison
and you need to cut her
out of your life forever.
There she is.
She brought some of her coworkers.
Hang on to this girl.
Hang on to her and never let go!
These are some of the
hottest girls I've ever seen.
And they all work with Tiffany?
There could only be
one explanation for this.
Is Tiffany a ph...
pharmaceutical sales rep?
- Yeah, how did you know that?
- And you never thought to mention that?
What? It's just a job.
Just a j... just a jo...
Ted, throughout time
there has always been one
cutting-edge profession
to which hot girls,
like Tiffany, have flocked.
- Shall I walk you through the history?
- I'm gonna explicitly say no.
It all started
2.5 million years ago.
<i>Man was a hunter. </i>
<i>So, the hottest</i>
<i>profession of the day?</i>
<i>Gatherer. </i>
Homo erectus indeed.
<i>As man mastered technology,</i>
<i>the hottest profession
of the day evolved. </i>
I'm pretty sure it's a hernia.
Can you check again?
<i>And then, man took to the skies. </i>
<i>And so, hot women put on high heels
and became stewardesses</i>
I am in the upright
and locked position.
And then man said, "Life is hard.
I should start taking
lots of prescription drugs. "
And so, hot girls
rolled into doctors' offices,
looking sexy enough to render
the very erection pills
they peddled ironically redundant.
So now, pharma girls are today's
hottest profession.
Big Brown Eyes.
How you doing?
I'm good.
By the way, you, you ditch
that loser boyfriend yet?
No, sir.
Touched my nose.
Dude, ditch Tiffany
and join the Barnacle
in a pharma girl free-for-all.
Side effects may include
loss of clothing, rug burn,
shortness of breath and sore
abdominals the next morning.
What in the world is up?!
I know that you've been having trouble
letting Scooter off the hook.
I decided what you need is practice.
Now, you say
the problem is his cute, sad eyes?
Well...
All right, shut it, woman.
Now,
I want you to look at this teacup pig
and tell him that there's no way
that you could ever be with him.
Teacup Pig,
there is no way
I can ever be with you.
Right now.
Come on!
Grow a pair!
I'm sorry, but...
he's just so freakin' cute.
I just want to cuddle him
all day long.
- Yes, I do.
- You know, that's funny.
I remember when you used to say
things like that about me.
I still do.
Not as much, Lily.
Not as much.
<i>Ain't no party
like a pharma girl party.</i>
<i>'Cause a pharma girl party
don't stop!</i>
Dude, I have already hooked up
with three of them.
Fantasmo.
Plus, my cholesterol is down.
My restless legs syndrome is cured.
I've never felt more alive.
Guys, great news.
Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend.
- Proof that I am not on the hook.
- You're still on the hook.
Listen to how we spent last night.
<i>First, we cuddled.</i>
<i>Then,</i>
<i>we shared chocolate cake.</i>
<i>Then, well, I don't usually
join in on locker room talk,</i>
<i>but I gave her
a pretty sensual foot rub.</i>
And let me guess,
it didn't go any further than that.
No, but...
And tell me, did you by any chance
make that chocolate cake?
- It was a mix.
- Dude.
There's no shame in admitting it,
Ted.
We've all been on people's hooks
and we've all kept someone on the hook.
I most certainly have not.
- What?
- Are you joking?
What about that girl
from the university library?
Henrietta?
Henrietta and I are just friends.
She is so on your hook.
Absolutely not.
<i>She totally was.</i>
<i>I mean...</i>
<i>we cuddled.</i>
<i>We shared chocolate cake.</i>
<i>She gave me foot rubs... long ones.</i>
<i>I'm not proud, kids.</i>
You like having Henrietta around
for the reason
that Tiffany likes having you around,
it's a nice little ego boost.
No wonder you're such an expert
about keeping people on the hook.
What about that poor camera guy
you work with?
- Mike and I are just friends.
- Come on.
That's the stuff.
Robin, have you ever thought about
taking us to the next level?
If you're talking about
doing my laundry, I'm on board.
You got yourself a deal.
What?!
I am not keeping Mike on the hook.
You are Captain Hook.
Dude, I'm a girl.
Our girl parts are like a spiderweb.
Sometimes you'll catch
stuff you don't want.
That doesn't make it okay.
And Henrietta is in, in no way
wasting her time with you, right?
Henrietta knows
that we're just friends.
In fact, I'm gonna call her up
and hang out with her tonight,
as friends.
I love you. What?
Do you want a foot massage?
'Cause I've been practicing
on myself.
I'm good.
I didn't know if you were hungry,
so I threw together some...
it's not a big deal.
<i>Kids, looking back,</i>
<i>I don't know how I didn't see
that Henrietta was in love with me.</i>
<i>I'm going out of town this weekend
for my friend's wedding.</i>
<i>Want to be my date?</i>
I would love to.
What are you doing right now?
God, no.
Awesome.
I'll see you in, like, ten minutes?
Great.
Sorry, Henrietta, something came up.
Take a rain check, pal?
It's no problem.
You're strong.
<i>What a jerk.</i>
Henrietta, I...
Wait. Where did Ted go?
I thought we'll meet him.
Something came up, okay, Mom?
I told you there was no Ted.
I heard that.
<i>So there I was,</i>
<i>at one of the surest signs of taking
a relationship to the next level,</i>
<i>an out-of-town wedding.</i>
<i>It was finally happening.</i>
Champagne?
Ted, my gosh, I forgot to call you.
Whatever it's you wanted to talk about,
we can do it now.
This is Jack.
He's the best man at the wedding.
We just got back together.
Now that I think about it,
a phone call would have been nice.
You're Ted?
I hear you make
a mean chocolate cake.
Isn't he great?
And he's in a band.
Thanks.
Come on.
You have to get Scooter off the hook.
Now, try again.
Teacup Pig...
I don't want to be with you.
- Right now.
- Man up!
Teacup Pig...
I don't want to be with you.
Ever.
Finish him!
We will never be together
in any sort of sexual way
ever again.
Nice.
- A weird thing to say to a pig.
- It felt really wrong.
Anyway, I just don't think
you and I are going to work.
Right now.
<i>And that's when it hit me.</i>
<i>I was on the hook.</i>
<i>I also realized...</i>
I missed this so much, baby.
<i>... Tiffany was on this guy's hook.</i>
<i>It was a vicious cycle.</i>
<i>Henrietta was on my hook.</i>
<i>And years later, I found out
this bastard was on Henrietta's hook.</i>
You know what?
We're not going to work ever.
I'm done.
And it's better for the circulation
if you knead the arches with thumbs.
Now, I'm done.
Marshall, I can do this by myself.
Then prove it.
Grab me a pudding.
Listen up, Scooter.
There is no way
you and I will ever be together.
Right now!
I'm sorry, but he's adorable.
Listen.
- I don't want to be with you.
- Right now.
Hang in there, Scoots!
I'm not going to live forever.
Last night I was
with this pharma girl who was so hot,
you should call a doctor
if you don't have an erection
for more than four hours.
Am I right, people?
There's no people...
just the girl you most recently dated.
I want you to meet
the newest pharma girl.
Gladys Reynolds.
Nice to make your acquaintance.
I represent statins
and other cholesterol-lowering drugs.
Come on.
Let's go get our drink on.
It's over.
What's over?
Pharma girls are
no longer exclusively hot chicks.
It's the end of an era.
You're being a little dramatic.
Am I?
It starts out with a Gladys.
Next thing, a few not-so-fabulous
gay guys enter the ranks.
And before you know it,
pharma girls look
like the crew on a Southwest flight
from Albuquerque to Little Rock.
It's over!
<i>So that night,
I went straight to Henrietta's...</i>
<i>all set to let her off the hook.</i>
This is Jack.
He's the best man at the wedding.
I'm done.
The answer is yes!
It gets worse.
It's perfect!
Mom, Dad!
Ted proposed!
I knew this day would come!
Son!
There's been a...
What did you do?
I seriously considered
just marrying her
out of sheer awkwardness.
But I did what I had to do.
I did what anyone
keeping someone on the hook should do.
I broke her heart.
Henrietta, I'm sorry if this is blunt,
but I think I owe you this.
I don't want to be with you.
Right now?
Ever.
But we're still getting married,
right?
It was... brutal.
I'm sorry, buddy.
Honesty is tough, but in the end,
it is the far kinder alternative.
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, Mike.
I have to tell you something.
Did you finish my delicates?
- Got one more load.
- It can wait.
How's it going?
Still in mourning
over the end of the pharma girl era?
I realized
that their reign had to end
for some new hot girl profession.
Maybe it'll be...
intergalactic communications officer
on a rocket ship
to some distant solar system
we can't possibly imagine.
Maybe it'll be... meter maids.
We just don't know.
But one thing is sure.
The future glows
like a giant sun
shooting amber rays of light
into our hearts and minds.
What changed your mind?
The realization
that hope springs eternal, Robin.
That
and this little bottle of purple pills
I found in my couch cushion.
I don't know what they are,
but they are amazing.
<i>Les enfants, un soir de mars 2010,</i>
<i>un bateau de la police
sortit de l'Hudson</i>
<i>un homme de 34 ans,
votre oncle Barney.</i>
Racontez-moi tout.
Depuis le début.
Tout a commencé il y a une semaine.
<i>J'étais au bar du coin.</i>
<i>Une fille...</i>
<i>entre.</i>
Rien n'est plus sexy
qu'un homme en cravate.
Si, les filles qui les apprécient.
On n'a qu'ą dire match nul ?
Une cravate, c'est pas nul.
- D'accord.
- Enfin bref,
ensuite, je la ramčne chez moi.
Quand je fais l'amour,
mon corps est une machine,
alimentée par le désir, la luxure,
et une soif de satisfaire
toutes les envies de mon partenaire.
Heureusement que la femme de ménage
passe demain.
Bonne nuit.
Quoi ?
Attends, comment ēa ?
Ton corps devait źtre une machine,
alimentée par le désir, la luxure,
pour satisfaire toutes mes envies.

Je crois que Don et moi, on a trouvé
notre rythme de croisičre.
Tout le mérite
revient ą cette fille.
Le reportage sur les rongeurs
ą éviter dans le métro...
La réponse pourrait vous étonner.
Tous.
Je dois y aller.
Ą plus.
Ravi de te connaītre.
Ce mec est génial.
Il est drōle, intelligent, mignon.
Drague-le ou on va te le voler.
J'espčre que tu dis pas ēa pour toi.
T'as rompu avec Barney
il y a 4 mois.
Il est temps
de te remettre en selle.
Barney sort ą nouveau,
et il peut pas źtre plus heureux.
Je peux pas źtre plus malheureux.
Toute la nuit, elle m'allume.
Je la ramčne chez moi
et elle se casse ?
Quand je ne veux plus d'une fille,
j'ai au moins la décence
de coucher avec.
Je suis bien élevé.
Elle a dū lire
<i>Bien sūr que t'es célibataire,
regarde-toi, trouduc</i>.
Ce livre aide les célibataires
ą trouver un mari.
C'est celui de Robin.
Je l'ai feuilleté.
D'accord.
Quand tu étais avec elle,
elle glissait le mot "sexe"
dans la conversation ?
Je suis ą l'inter-sexe-tion,
et j'ai que quelques sexe-gondes
avant que ēa passe au rouge.
Tout le monde klaxonne,
et ils sexe-itent tous,
mais je peux pas faire demi-tour
car un jogger a glissé
sur un sexe-crément de cheval.
Continue.
Elle a trouvé des excuses
pour te toucher ?
C'est du cachemire ?
Du cachemire ?
C'est du mérinos, fait ą la main.
Les fibres de ce costume
font moins de 12 microns.
12 microns.
J'aime les fibres fines.
T'as de la chance,
j'ai la plus fine.
Et plus tu y touches,
plus ēa s'adoucit.
Elle l'a fait aussi.
Voilą le test final.
La prochaine fois,
demande ą la revoir le lendemain.
Le livre l'interdit.
Elle te donnera
une excuse pourrie, du genre :
"Je peux rien faire demain soir.
"Je dois nettoyer mon broyeur,
"et prendre un bain.
"La semaine prochaine ?"
Ce sont les nullités
de <i>Bien sūr que t'es célibataire,
regarde-toi, trouduc</i>.
C'est pas nul.
<i>Bien sūr que t'es célibataire,
regarde-toi, trouduc</i> est génial.
Ēa repousse les gars
qui sont intéressés que par le sexe.
Pourquoi ne pas dire
que t'as un gosse ?
Il y a beaucoup de connards,
tu sais.
Donc le livre conseille
de pas coucher le 1er soir.
- Sūr.
- Ni le 2e.
- Normal.
- Ni le 3e.
- Ni le 4e.
- Au bout de combien ?
Du 17e.
Excusez-moi,
cette chaise est libre ?
Et voilą :
pas de sexe avant 17 rencards.
Si tu ne veux pas sortir avec elle
17 fois, abandonne.
C'est elle qui abandonnera, pas moi.
Car grāce au livre de Ted...
C'est celui de Robin.
... j'ai toujours
deux coups d'avance.
Il y a une faille quelque part
et je la trouverai.
<i>Écoute...</i>
tu veux sortir samedi soir ?
- Samedi soir...
- Il veut sortir avec toi ?
Accepte !
C'est gentil de demander,
et tu es un mec super...
- Je veux bien sortir.
- Robin, ēa va ?
Je suis enrhumée.
C'est ce que tu entends.
Samedi, c'est parfait.
On peut mźme aller dans un grill,
et ramener des entrecōtes
pour mon ami.
Je dois y aller. Bisous.
Tu me fais quoi, lą ?
Tu dois le faire, OK ?
Les mecs comme Don sont rares.
Et en parlant de ēa,
les entrecōtes.
N'oublie pas. Merci.
J'y crois pas.
C'est elle !
Elle a écrit ce livre.
Elle doit s'appeler Anita.
Mon plan était de coucher avec elle,
mais lą, ēa change tout.
Nouveau plan :
je vais coucher avec.
Cette fille que Barney veut,
on dirait que c'est une anti-Barney.
J'adore la faēon dont l'univers
les a fait se rencontrer.
En fait, Anita a rencontré Barney
car je lui ai demandé.
Tu as branché Anita sur Barney ?
- Comment tu la connais ?
- Elle est passée dans mon émission.
Mais, euh,
si vous deviez résumer votre livre
en 30 mots ou moins...
Je le résumerai en un mot.
Ce mot est "non."
Dire non,
constamment et systématiquement,
renforce votre pouvoir
tout en transformant
n'importe quel idiot
en un homme soumis,
pleurnichard et honteux.
N'est-ce pas le rźve
de toutes les filles ?
Aprčs la pause, on parlera
de votre nouveau livre,
<i>Bien sūr que tu n'as
aucun plan de retraite,</i>
<i>regarde-toi, trouduc,</i>
qui doit paraītre en juin.
Ą tout de suite.
C'est bon.
- Vous voulez du café ?
- Ce serait super.
Et vous ?
Et vous ?
Vous sortez avec quelqu'un ?
Je suis pas d'humeur rencard.
On vous a brisé le coeur ?
Et je lui ai tout raconté.
C'est venu tout seul.
Et ą la fin...
Ce Barney a besoin d'une leēon.
Un seul mot et je le détruis.
- Comment ēa ?
- J'utiliserais le pouvoir du "non"
pour détruire votre ami, Barney.
- Un seul mot.
- Ce truc ne marche pas vraiment.
- Non ?
- Je savais pas ce que vous vouliez,
donc j'ai pris cappuccino,
expresso, lait, déca...
Et un café turc.
- Pensez-y.
- <i>Je ne pensais pas y penser,</i>
<i>mais... j'y ai pensé.</i>
Cette prof de fitness était top.
Imaginez Robin, en plus jeune.
Avec une plus grosse poitrine.
Peut-źtre pas plus grosse,
mais plus galbée.
Et plus grosse.
Je la coince contre le rameur
et on...
- Faites-le.
- Tu gāches tout !
- Bref, on l'a fait.
- C'est fait.
C'était stupide, je sais,
mais vous devez comprendre
que la rupture m'a bouleversée.
Je déprimais.
Il y a eu beaucoup de whisky
et de nuits passées au stand de tir.
J'espčre que c'était pas
en mźme temps.
Je me souviens pas de tout.
Tu savais que Robin déprimait ?
- Elle semblait aller bien.
- Tu la connais.
Elle encaisse en silence.
Mais oui, je l'ai vue pleurer
quelques fois.
Elle a pleuré ?
Avec des larmes ?
Mais alors...
<i>Et Marshall réalisa quel abruti
il avait pu źtre avec Robin.</i>
Barney sort ą nouveau,
et il peut pas źtre plus heureux.
Je veux dire, ce mec a été actif.
Sexuellement.
Il a été...
Vous suivez ?
Genre...
Comment t'as pu me laisser faire ?
Tu es censée m'empźcher
de me ridiculiser en public.
Je sais,
mais cette chanson est entraīnante.
Bon sang.
J'ai lu tout le bouquin,
je trouve pas la faille.
Qu'est-ce que je vais faire ?
Il reste une option, mais...
tu n'es pas prźt.
Dis-moi.
Si tu dois conclure en un rencard,
il faut qu'il soit incroyable, pigé ?
Pas un plan resto/ciné.
Ni un mini-golf.
Je pense ą...
17 rencards romantiques
emballés en une soirée incroyable.
Je pense ą...
un super-rencard.
Un super-rencard ?
Ēa a l'air naze.
Si on appelait ēa un méga-rencard ?
Je t'aide pour un super-rencard.
- D'accord.
- Laisse-moi faire.
- Je m'occupe de tout.
- Tu t'occupes de tout ?
- Ēa sera ą l'eau de rose.
- Ą l'eau de rose ?
Ą l'eau de rose ?
<i>T'as pas besoin de l'emmener... </i>
<i>ą Paris ou au Pérou</i>
Ted, tu fais quoi, lą ?
<i>Tu dois lui faire comprendre...</i>
Ted, on nous regarde.
<i>... qu'elle compte pour toi.</i>
Sérieux ?
Tu vas vraiment faire ēa lą ?
<i>Ą ton super-rencard,</i>
<i>tous les maux du monde...</i>
<i>devront tout simplement attendre...</i>
<i>les merveilles, les sentiments</i>
<i>servis dans des assiettes en argent</i>
<i>Dépźche-toi, sois ą l'heure,</i>
<i>car main dans la main,
tu trouveras un coin...</i>
<i>oł t'attend le paradis.</i>
Et puis boum !
Feux d'artifice
dans le ciel de Manhattan !
Tu l'embrasses.
<i>Tout cela est ton...</i>
<i>super-rencard.</i>
C'est supra ą l'eau de rose.
- Strip-tease ?
- Strip-tease.
<i>Enfin, le grand rencard arriva.</i>
Ce soir, c'est le grand soir.
D-Bag te rejoint oł ?
Pas terrible, le surnom.
- J'en cherche un meilleur.
- Tu sais quoi ? J'ai annulé.
Tu veux dire quoi par...
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Robin a annulé son rencard.
Hein ? Elle était plutōt enthousiaste
il y a une heure.
Tu ressembles ą la plus classe
et ą la plus chčre des prostituées.
Merci.
T'as l'air contente
de sortir avec Don.
Plutōt, oui.
Ne le dis pas ą Marshall.
D'accord.
Tu vas passer une bonne soirée.
Mais pas une super soirée.
Barney et Anita
vont passer une super soirée.
Balade en calčche,
dīner au <i>Tombeur des Culottes</i>.
Ils ont appelé ēa un super-rencard.
Comment t'as pu faire ēa ?
Robin sort juste de sa dépression !
Elle avait pas l'air déprimée.
Si peu observateur.
C'est bien un mec.
Elle était mal en point.
Mais ēa veut dire que...
<i>Et j'ai réalisé quel abruti
j'avais pu źtre avec Robin.</i>
Tu chantes quoi ?
Une chanson sur toutes les filles
que Barney s'est tapées.
- Compte sur moi pour un couplet.
- Génial.
Bon Dieu.
Oł elle est ?
Elle est aux toilettes.
Les gars, je vais bien.
Mec.
Pourquoi t'as fait ēa ?
Parce que je t'en veux.
Je m'en veux, j'en veux ą Ted.
Et j'en veux encore ą l'Empire.
Pourquoi tu m'en veux ?
T'as été infect avec Robin
pendant sa dépression.
Elle n'a jamais eu de dépression.
- Si peu observateur.
- C'est bien un mec.
Barney, assieds-toi,
on doit te parler.
- Elle est triste ?
- Bien sūr qu'elle l'est.
Regarde-toi, trouduc.
<i>Ainsi, tante Lily raconta ą Barney
toutes les horreurs </i>
<i>qu'il avait dites depuis la rupture.</i>
T'aurais vu cette fille.
Je pars.
Donc...
on est montés...
Je pensais pas qu'elle déprimait.
Et moi que tu vomirais
dans ton casque de Stormtrooper.
J'ai fait pire aprčs avoir vu
<i>La Menace Fantōme</i>.
Elle est comme ēa
depuis qu'on a rompu ?
En fait, elle allait mieux
jusqu'ą entendre parler
de ton super-rencard.
Et maintenant,
elle boude je ne sais oł.
Je sais oł.
Barney, ēa va ?
Je croyais
que t'avais un gros rencard.
Je sais que tu déprimes.
Quoi ?
J'ai jamais été plus heureuse.
Et Anita a l'air super.
Je suis contente que vous deux...
vous vous soyez trouvés par hasard.
Ēa me réchauffe le coeur.
- Tu n'es pas déprimée ?
- Bien sūr que si.
Tu vois pas que parler
systématiquement de tes conquźtes
me donne l'impression
de n'źtre qu'un numéro ?
Tu n'en es pas un.
Et maintenant, tu emmčnes Anita,
que tu connais ą peine,
ą un super-rencard,
alors que je n'y ai pas eu le droit.
C'est nul, c'est tout.
C'est juste nul.
Je me savais mauvais petit ami,
mais je me pensais pas pire
en tant qu'ex.
Je suis désolé.
Je peux me racheter ?
Non, c'est bon.
Tu as déją prouvé
que je comptais pas.
Je suis sérieux.
Demande n'importe quoi.
- Ne couche pas avec Anita.
- OK.
Mais si, tu vas le faire.
Pourquoi tu l'emmčnerais
ą un super-rencard ?
C'est pas elle que j'emmčne.
Mais toi.
<i>Votre oncle Barney
a enfin offert ą tante Robin</i>
<i>le super-rencard qu'elle méritait.</i>
<i>Avec un mec qu'elle méritait.</i>
<i>Mais, il y avait toujours
un laissé pour compte.</i>
Je voulais t'appeler.
Je viole toutes mes rčgles
en venant ici, mais...
on me pose pas de lapin.
On y va ou pas ?
Désolé.
J'ai fait une promesse.
Je dois dire non.
Je vois.
T'essaies le "non" sur moi.
Tu y crois ?
Ēa marchera pas.
Et si on faisait un marché.
Peut-źtre...
que tu pourrais...
źtre chanceux au 12e rencard.
Au 11e ? Au 5e ?
Ce soir.
Ce soir, avant dīner.
Et toi ? Ēa t'intéresse ?
Allez, Barney.
Désolé, Anita.
La réponse est non.
Trčs bien.
Ma réponse est aussi non.
Ma derničre offre.
Et voilą mon histoire.
Voilą une amende de 500 $
pour avoir plongé dans la rivičre.
J'espčre que ēa valait le coup.
Je l'espčre aussi.
C'est une vieille histoire.
Alors ?
Ēa a été.
Plutōt... plutōt bien.
"Plutōt bien" comment ?
Les gars, voyons.
C'était bien.
Vous voyez, c'était chouette.
On a passé un bon moment.
On va...
dire ēa comme ēa.
Mźme si,
il s'est passé un truc intéressant.
<i>Kids, on a warm March evening
in 2010</i>
<i>a New York City police boat
pulled a 34-year-old white male</i>
<i>out of the Hudson River:
your Uncle Barney.</i>
Let's hear the story.
From the beginning.
It all started a week ago.
<i>I was making time
at the local watering hole.</i>
<i>Enter...</i>
<i>a dame.</i>
Nothing sexier than a man
in a fine cravat.
Except for a woman
who appreciates a fine cravat.
How about we just call it a tie?
A cravat is a kind of tie.
- I get it.
- Anyway,
next thing you know,
I get her back to my place.
When I get in bed with a man,
my body becomes a machine
fueled by desire, lust
and a singular hunger to satisfy
my lover's every carnal need.
Good thing the cleaning lady
is coming tomorrow.
Well, good night.
What? Wait, what?
I thought your body was going
to become a machine
fueled by desire, lust
and a singular hunger
to satisfy my every carnal need.
I really think that Don and I
are hitting our stride as a news team.
All credit
goes to this lady on my left.
That story you did on which rodents
to avoid on the subway...
The answer may surprise you.
It's all of them.
I got to run. I'll see you.
It's good to meet you.
That guy is awesome.
He's funny, he's smart,
he's handsome.
Scoop him up
before someone else does.
I hope you're not talking about you.
It has been four months
since you broke up with Barney.
Maybe it's time
to put yourself back out there.
Exactly. Barney's dating again,
and he couldn't be happier.
I couldn't be more unhappy.
All night long,
she's hot and heavy for me.
I get her back to my place,
and she just bolts?
I mean, at least,
when I run out on a girl,
I have the common courtesy
to sleep with her first.
It's called manners.
She read that book
<i>Of Course You're Still Single,
Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut</i>.
It's this book that helps single girls
find a husband.
It's Robin's copy.
I leafed through it a little bit.
Fine.
When you were with this girl,
did she subtly slip the word
"sex" into conversation?
I'm in the inter-sex-tion,
and I only have a couple of sex
before the light changes.
I mean, everyone's honking at me,
and it totally sex,
but I can't turn around
because a jogger slipped
and fell in horse sex-crement.
Go on. Go on.
Did she make excuses
to establish physical contact with you?
Is this cashmere?
Cashmere?
This is hand-spun virgin merino.
The fibers in this suit
are less than 12 microns thick.
12 microns.
I love a tiny fiber.
Well, you're in luck,
because mine's the tiniest.
And the more you touch it,
the softer it gets.
She did that, too.
Here is the final test.
Next time you see her,
ask her out for the following night.
The book says that's forbidden,
so she'll probably give you
some lame excuse like this:
"I can't do anything tomorrow night.
"I've already made plans
to clean my garbage disposal
"and treat myself to a bubble bath.
"But how about next week sometime?"
You're trying that
<i>Of Course You're Still Single,</i>
<i>Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut</i>
crap on me.
It's not crap.
It is a brillant book!
It scares away guys
who are only interested in getting laid.
Why not just say you have a kid?
You'd be surprised how many jerks
there are out there.
That's why the book says
never sleep on the first date.
- Totally.
- On the second.
- Of course.
- Or on the third.
- Or on the fourth.
- Just tell me how many dates!
17.
Excuse me, is anyone using this?
Here it is:
no sex until after 17 dates.
If you're not going to take her out
on 17 dates, you should just give it up.
She is gonna give it up, not me.
Because, thanks to Ted's book...
That's Robin's.
I can stay two steps ahead of her
at all times.
There's a loophole in here somewhere
and I'm going to find it.
<i>Listen...</i>
you wanna go out Saturday night?
- Saturday night...
- Is he asking you out?
Say yes!
It's really sweet of you to ask,
and you're a great guy...
- I will go out with you.
- Robin, are you okay?
I just had a little cold.
That's probably what you're hearing.
But Saturday night sounds great.
We can even go to a steak house,
and you can bring home
some prime rib for my friend.
Gotta go. Love you. Bye.
What the hell are you thinking?
You've got to do this, okay?
A great guy like Don is rare.
And speaking of rare,
prime rib! Don't forget. Thank you.
I don't believe it.
This is her!
She wrote the book.
Her name must be Anita.
My plan was to sleep with her,
but this changes everything.
New plan:
I'm going to sleep with her.
Boy, this girl
that Barney's going after,
she kind of sounds
like the anti-Barney.
I love how the universe
decided to bring those two together.
Actually, Anita's going after Barney
because I told her to.
Wait, you sicced Anita on Barney?
- How do you even know her?
- She was on my show.
But, um, if you had
to summarize your book
in 30 words or less...
I'll summarize it in one word.
That word
is "no."
By saying no
constantly and consistently,
you empower yourself
while simultaneously
turning any jerk
into a submissive,
sniveling, puddle of a man.
And isn't that every girl's dream?
After the break, we're going to talk
about your new book,
<i>Of Course You Don't Have
a Retirement Plan Yet,</i>
<i>Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut,</i>
due out in June.
We'll be right back.
We're clear.
- You guys want any coffee?
- You know what, that'd be great.
You?
What about you? You dating anyone?
Dating's not really my bag
right now.
Somebody broke your heart?
And then, I told her everything.
It just came pouring out.
And by the end of it...
This Barney needs
to be taught a lesson.
You say the word,
and I will destroy him.
- What do you mean?
- I can use the power of "no"
to break your friend, Barney.
- Just say the word.
- That stuff doesn't really work.
- Does it?
- I didn't know what you wanted,
so I got you a cappuccino,
an espresso, a latte, a decaf...
And this is a Turkish coffee.
- Think about it.
- <i>I didn't think I would think about it,</i>
<i>but... I thought about it.</i>
This Pilates instructor
was off the charts.
Picture Robin, but younger.
And bigger boobs.
Maybe not bigger, but more shapely.
And bigger.
I get her up against the StairMaster,
and we...
- Do it.
- Spoilers.
- Anyway, we do it.
- It's done.
I know, it was stupid,
but you have to understand, back then,
I was really upset about the breakup.
I was going though
my mourning period.
There was a lot of scotch and a lot
of long nights at the shooting range.
I hope those weren't
the same nights.
It's not like I remember
all of them.
Did you know that Robin
was going through a mourning period?
- She seemed fine after the breakup.
- You know how she is.
She keeps her emotions to herself.
But yeah, I caught her crying
a couple times.
She cried?
Like, real tears?
But that means...
<i>And then, Marshall realized
what a jackass he had been to Robin.</i>
Exactly. Barney's dating again,
and he couldn't be happier.
I mean,
that guy has been active.
Sexually.
He's been...
You know?
It's like...
How could you let me do that?
You're supposed to stop me
from embarrassing myself in public.
I know,
but that song's kind of catchy.
Damn it.
I've read that thing cover to cover,
and I can't find a loophole.
What am I going to do?
Well,
there is one other option, but...
you're not ready.
Tell me.
If you have to seal the deal
in one date,
it's got to be
one doozy of a date, right?
I'm not talking dinner and a movie.
I'm not talking mini-golf.
I'm talking...
17 dates worth of romance
wrapped up
into one incredible night.
I'm talking about...
a superdate.
A superdate?
That sounds kind of lame.
What if we call it a megadate?
If you want my help,
it's a superdate.
- All right.
- Leave it to me.
- I'll plan the whole thing.
- You're going to plan the whole thing?
I bet
it'll be all gooey and romantic.
Gooey and romantic?
Gooey and romantic?
<i>You don't have to take her... </i>
<i>To Paris or Peru.</i>
Ted, what are you doing?
<i>You just have to make her
understand...</i>
Ted, people are looking at us.
<i>What she means to you.</i>
God, really?
You're going to do this right now?
<i>On your superdate,</i>
<i>Troubles of the world</i>
<i>will simply have to wait.</i>
<i>For wonders and amazement</i>
<i>served upon a silver plate,</i>
<i>hurry up now, don't be late.</i>
<i>'Cause hand in hand
you'll find a land...</i>
<i>where paradise awaits.</i>
And then boom!
Fireworks
over the Manhattan skyline!
You kiss her.
<i>And that's your...</i>
<i>superdate.</i>
That sounds gooey and romantic.
- Strip club?
- Strip club.
<i>Finally,
the night of the big dates arrived.</i>
So, tonight's the big night.
Where's the D-bag taking you?
That's not a good nickname for Don.
- I'll think of a better one.
- You know, that, I just... I canceled.
What do you mean you...
- What's wrong?
- Robin canceled her date.
What? She was totally psyched for it
like an hour ago.
You look like the classiest,
most expensive prostitute ever.
Thank you.
I take it
you're excited to go out with Don?
You know what? I kinda am.
Don't tell Marshall.
I won't.
I bet you'll have a nice time tonight.
Not, however, a super time.
A super time will be had
by Barney on his date with Anita.
Carriage ride,
dinner at <i>Le Tombeur des Culottes</i>.
They're calling it a superdate,
so...
How could you do that?!
Robin just got over
her mourning period!
She seemed
so happy after the breakup.
So unobservant.
Such a guy.
She was obviously crushed.
Wait, but that would mean...
<i>And then I realized
what a jackass I'd been to Robin.</i>
Whatcha singing?
Just a ditty I wrote about girls
Barney's been banging lately.
- Well, count me in for a verse.
- Great.
God.
Where is she?
I think she's in the restroom.
Guys, I'm fine.
Dude.
Why would you do that?
Because I'm angry at you.
I'm angry at me.
I'm angry at Ted.
And frankly,
I'm still angry at the Empire.
Why are you angry at me?
Dude, you've been a real jerk
in front of Robin
while she's been have
her mourning period.
She hasn't been going through
any mourning period.
- So unobservant.
- Such a guy.
Barney, sit down,
you need to hear some stuff.
- What, is she upset or something?
- Of course she's upset.
Take a look at yourself,
you dumb slut.
<i>And then Aunt Lily told Barney
every excruciating detail</i>
<i>of what he hadn't been seeing.</i>
You should've seen this girl.
I'm leaving.
So...
we get up to my place...
I can't believe Robin's been upset.
I can't believe you threw up
in your Stormtrooper helmet.
I did something worse in it
after <i>The Phantom Menace</i> premiere.
So, she's been this way
ever since we broke up?
Actually, she was doing much better
until you decided to go
on this stupid superdate with Anita.
And now she's off,
sulking God knows where.
I know where.
Barney, what's up?
Thought you were going
on some big date.
Robin, I know you're upset.
What?
I have...
I've never been happier.
And this Anita sounds lovely.
I am so glad that you two just...
randomly happened
to find each other.
It just warms my frickin' heart.
So, you're not upset?
Of course I'm upset, Barney.
Don't you see how constantly
talking about your conquests
makes me feel
like I'm just another number to you?
But you're not that.
You know,
and now you're taking Anita,
who you barely know,
on this amazing date,
when I never got treated that way.
It just...
it just sucks, that's all.
It just sucks.
I knew I was bad
at being a boyfriend,
but I had no idea I'd be so much worse
at being an ex-boyfriend.
I'm sorry.
What can I do?
Nothing.
You've already proven
I'm not important.
Stop that, I'm serious.
Ask me for anything.
- Don't sleep with Anita.
- Done.
Barney, of course
you're going to sleep with her.
Why else would you be taking her
on this superdate?
She's not going on the superdate,
Robin.
You are.
<i>Your Uncle Barney
finally gave Aunt Robin</i>
<i>the superdate she truly deserved.</i>
<i>With a guy she truly deserved.</i>
<i>Of course,
there was still one loose end.</i>
I meant to call you.
Well, I'm breaking all my rules
coming down here, but...
nobody stands me up like that.
So, are we going out or what?
I'm sorry.
I made a promise to a friend.
I have to say no.
I see.
You're trying the "no" thing on me.
You think that'll work?
'Cause it won't.
How about this.
I'll cut you a deal.
Maybe...
you might...
get lucky after the 12th date.
The 11th date.
Fifth date.
Tonight.
Tonight before dinner.
How about you?
You interested?
Come on, Barney.
I'm sorry, Anita.
The answer is no.
Well, good.
Because my answer is no, too.
Here's my final offer.
And that's my story.
Well, here's a $500 ticket
for jumping in the river.
I hope it was worth it.
I hope so, too.
It's an old wives' tale.
How did the big date go?
Pretty well.
Pretty... pretty well.
Like how "pretty well"?
Guys, come on.
It was fine.
You know, it was nice.
We had a good time.
Let's just...
let's just leave it.
Although,
one interesting thing did happen.
<i>Les enfants, Lily a toujours été
une de ces personnes</i>
<i>qui adorent leur anniversaire.</i>
C'est mon anniversaire !
<i>C'est une bonne chose
qu'elle ait épousé Marshall.</i>
C'est toujours mon anniversaire !
<i>Car il aime les organiser.</i>
Le thème de ce petit déjeuner
d'anniversaire au lit est...
"Interlude espagnol."
Et...
Comment a-t-on atterri sur les collines
idylliques du nord de l'Espagne ?
Bébé, ce soir, on va s'éclater.
Juste nous cinq, dîner de gala,
et Ted va récupérer ton gâteau
au fromage préféré chez Edgar.
Je suis en retard
pour ton super secret d'anniversaire.
Et j'embarque ce mec,
j'aime pas sa façon de te regarder.
Un appareil photo !
Merci, Marshall.
Je l'adore !
Il y a un petit bonus,
avant de l'emballer,
j'ai pris des photos de moi nu.
Avec un ruban.
Il n'y avait pas de ruban.
Pas autour du cou.
Merci, chéri. Je vais prendre
de superbes photos de nous tous.
<i>Les enfants, vous avez vu
l'album photo de Lily : relié en cuir,</i>
<i>papier sans acide,</i>
<i>légendes manuscrites adorables.</i>
<i>Et surtout, la photo de groupe.</i>
<i>Jolie photo, non ?</i>
<i>Mais il s'est passé un truc
dix secondes avant qu'elle soit prise.</i>
DIX SECONDES AVANT QUE LA PHOTO
SOIT PRISE.
J'en veux une qui soit parfaite.
Marshall, entre Barney et Robin.
Pourquoi ?
Pour la lumière,
la couleur, le contraste...
C'est du vocabulaire de photo.
Tu ne veux pas de Barney et moi
en couple sur cette photo.
Tout à fait !
Vous deux, ça va pas durer !
- Je veux de la constance.
- Comment oses-tu ?
- C'est pas sympa !
- C'est vrai.
C'est vrai, on est au bout là,
mais c'est pas trop sympa.
<i>On détestait les photos de groupe.</i>
OK, j'ai peut-être été
un peu autoritaire
mais je veux me souvenir
de ces moments.
Comme ce soir.
Je ne peux imaginer
un meilleur anniversaire,
qu'ici
avec mes quatre meilleurs amis.
Voilà Ted.
Joyeux anniversaire !
Voici Amanda.
Et Amanda...

Tu devais apporter
un gâteau au fromage,
à la place, tu amènes deux sacs
et une inconnue.
Bienvenue chez nous.
Je t'écoute.
Amanda va faire un gâteau pour Lily.
Elle est chef.
On s'est rencontrés dans un restaurant,
j'avais renvoyé de la soupe.
Ses cheveux sont si jolis.
En avoir dans ma soupe ne m'a pas gêné.
On m'appelle "Le Cheveu" en cuisine.
Je suis si contente que vous fassiez
mon gâteau d'anniversaire !
En l'honneur
du 32e anniversaire de Lily,
j'ai prévu des tas de jeux,
on commence avec le...
"Lil-ial Pursuit."
Qui a le numéro 1 ?
Moi.
Bien sûr.
OK, Amanda commence.
32 secondes pour répondre
à un max de questions.
Et...
Question un :
La couleur préférée de Lily ?
Elle est en rose,
donc je dirais le rose.
C'est Robin.
Sa...
couleur préférée est...
le faune.
Je pense qu'il te soufflait jaune.
Ce qui était faux aussi.
Ce jeu s'appelle
"Couvrir d'or Lily."
- Joli.
- Merci.
Vous avez tous écrit
ce que vous aimiez chez elle.
Et Lily,
tu dois deviner qui a écrit quoi.
"Tout le monde dans sa vie,
de ses amis à ses étudiants..."
Il veut dire
qu'elle est maîtresse en maternelle.
"se sent aimé. Elle fait
les meilleurs biscuits aux raisins,"
"connait<i> Les Goonies</i> par coeur."
Elle l'a vu
juste après le divorce de ses parents.
Elle a ensuite eu du mal
à faire confiance aux gens...
"C'est la plus forte
que je connaisse."
"Je ne peux imaginer ma vie
sans elle."
"Je t'aime, Lily"
Mais oui, c'était moi.
C'est si mignon.
Lily, essaie de deviner
qui a écrit ça.
"Tu as l'air gentille."
Je vais dire Amanda.
C'était moi.
Et j'en pense chaque mot.
Je retourne au gâteau.
Appelle-moi au besoin.
Vite !
On prend la photo !
Tous devant la cheminée.
Attends, j'appelle Amanda.
C'est bon. Elle cuisine.
On va pas la déranger.
Une seconde.
Tu...
Tu ne la veux pas dessus.
C'est à cause
de tous les réglages...
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Qui veut un chapeau ?
Je fais l'oiseau !
Faisons-le tous.
Dis-moi la vérité.
Je ne vais pas encore laisser
une de tes stupides traînées
gâcher mes souvenirs.
De quoi tu parles ?
Tu fais ça à chaque fois.
Tu ramènes des inconnues
à chaque gros événement.
- Mais non.
- Vraiment ?
C'est parti pour une promenade,
le long de la route des traînées.
Ou on pourrait se déhancher
jusqu'à l'avenue
du meilleur anniversaire.
Je peux voter ?
Route des traînées !
J'ai composé une chanson
pour ce soir.
Suivez-moi.
Le refrain est :
<i>Joyeuse jolie-Lily journée !</i>
Matin de Noël, il y a quatre ans.
<i>Notre premier Noël,
rien que nous cinq.</i>
Voici un nouveau jeu marrant.
C'est <i>Nomme cette garce</i>.
C'est No...
Faux. Tu penses à Noëlle,
parce que c'est Noël.
C'est marrant,
ma mère prend le thé de Pâques
avec son ami M. Lapin.
Ça l'est pas.
Je me souviens.
C'est Sarah.
Presque.
C'est Leilani.
Elle devait venir pour Noël
puisque tu disais :
"C'est peut-être la bonne."
Et ce n'est pas la seule
"peut-être la bonne."
<i>Jour de l'an, en 2007.</i>
<i>Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall</i>
<i>et "peut-être la bonne" Emily.</i>
<i>Enterrement de l'oncle de Robin.</i>
<i>Marshall, Lily,
Robin, Barney, Ted et...</i>
<i>"tu trouves la bonne sans chercher"
Isabel.</i>
<i>Mon appendicite.</i>
<i>Robin, Marshall,
Barney, Lily, Ted, et...</i>
<i>Celle-ci, tu as au moins admis
que t'essayais de coucher...</i>
Respect.
Tu te souviens la prof de yoga,
à mon anniversaire ?
Merci.
Devinez qui vient d'entrer.
Regardez-pas !
Mais regardez !
C'est Slash des Guns N' Roses !
Photo de groupe !
On l'a eue.
On a une photo avec Slash,
pour mon anniversaire.
Génial, non ?
On connait la fin.
Faux !
<i>Dire que pendant la prise,
il me tripotait les fesses.</i>
<i>- Moi aussi.
- Et moi aussi.</i>
Combien de mains il a ?
Pas étonnant
qu'il soit bon guitariste.
Désolé, je t'ai pris pour Lily.
Regardez encore les photos.
<i>Barney y a toujours la même pose</i>
<i>et ce depuis des années.</i>
D'ailleurs,
Jamais eu aucune photo ratée.
Et j'en aurai jamais.
Il y en a forcément une ratée.
Pas une.
Et en primaire ?
Ça arrive à tout le monde à l'école.
Pas au Barnacle.
J'ai toujours l'air vachement beau.
Pas comme Marshall,
vachement horrible.
<i>Il avait raison.
Votre oncle Marshall est doué,</i>
<i>mais n'est pas photogénique.</i>
Elles sont pas toutes ratées.
Celle-ci.
J'ai les yeux ouverts.
T'y as mis un ruban.
Des chips ?
Volontiers.
Je l'ai !
Une photo ratée.
Vraiment ?
Mais... tu mangeais une chips !
Où est la chips ?
C'est physiquement impossible pour moi,
d'être moche sur une photo.
J'ignore pourquoi.
Demandez à Dieu.
Désolé pour Amanda.
Je dois te le dire.
Tu fais l'enfant gâtée.
Tu t'emportes juste car tu crois
que j'ai gâché quelques photos.
Ces filles ont gâché
tant d'événements,
ou tu oublies Paris ?
Il s'est passé quoi ?
C'était ma deuxième année,
j'étudiais à l'étranger,
sans voir Marshall de 2 mois.
Deux mois.
Et je débutais en sexe.
J'étais pas prêt
à arrêter deux mois.
Et Marshall venait me voir
pour les vacances.
À la dernière minute,
Ted a décidé de venir
avec la fille qu'il venait
juste de rencontrer, Karen.
Karen.
Je suis content que tu sois là.
Je suis contente d'aller à Paris.
Je suis content
de coucher à nouveau.
<i>Mais avant que l'avion ne décolle...</i>
Attends,
j'ai un truc à te dire.
Vraiment ?
Je pense que je veux te dire
la même chose.
Tu as couché
avec le prof de philo hier soir ?
Parce que moi, oui.
Ainsi commencèrent les sept heures
les plus longues de la vie de Marshall.
- Quand je suis venue...
- Ted a rompu.
Je dois dormir dans ta chambre.
Marshall peut squatter avec Ted.
Deux mois !
Mes couilles étaient <i>bleues</i> !
<i>Bleues</i> !
Ce ne sera pas un grand choc,
mais le reste du séjour fut horrible.
Tout ce que je voulais
était une photo romantique
devant la tour Eiffel,
ce que j'ai eu.
Mais c'était
entre Karen et Francois,
notre serveur de la veille.
C'est horrible.
C'est...
Mon portable est tombé.
Tu me le ramasses ?
Bien sûr.
Souris, salopard !
Je l'ai !
Tu penses ?
Comment tu fais ça ?
T'étais même pas debout !
L'appareil m'aime.
Plus que ça, il me convoite.
Il veut porter de la lingerie fine,
mettre un CD d'Al Green,
tamiser la lumière
pendant que je m'étends
en fermant les yeux.
Désolé pour Paris
et toutes les photos ratées,
mais quand on est célibataire, on espère
que chaque fille sera la bonne.
- Erin. Irene. Et Sarah.
- Emily. Ou Isabel.
C'est Leilani. T'es pas bien ?
J'ai pensé un jour
qu'elles pouvaient être la bonne,
mais je devais garder espoir.
Quel choix avais-je ?
En voilà une :
plus de pétasses à mon anniversaire.
Salut, chérie !
Vous avez une plaque ?
Le tiroir sous le four.
Fais vite. T'es la meilleure !
Désolée, je suis d'accord avec Lily.
Ce genre d'événements
c'est dur pour un nouveau.
C'est pour ça que j'emmène pas Don.
Quand je vivais au Japon,
au 4e rencard, un mec m'a emmenée
au mariage de son frère.
Moi, parfaite étrangère,
suis sur la photo de mariage
de ce couple japonais, pour toujours.
Tu devrais écouter Robin.
D'accord, parce que Robin
est ta meilleure amie.
- Exactement.
- La meilleure au monde.
- Absolument.
- Attention, c'est un piège.
Avant d'être ta meilleure amie,
qui était-elle ?
C'est vrai.
Une de mes pétasses.
Oui, Ted.
Cette pétasse...
... convient parfaitement,
mais c'est l'exception à la règle.
Vous me faites pleurer.
Et si on arrêtait
cette conversation de pétasses.
Revenons
à la chanson d'anniversaire !
Barney, tu vas chanter ça.
Elle est mignonne.
J'emmène des filles à ses fêtes
car vous comptez pour moi.
Vous êtes ma famille.
Tu vas chanter ça.
Et gentille.
Oui. On est une famille.
Pourquoi ces fêtes ne pourraient pas
se faire entre nous ?
Comme quand on a fêté
l'examen du barreau de Marshall.
C'est la hippie sale et répugnante
avec qui je sors.
J'ai pas dit ça !
T'aurais dû.
Voici Fraise.
- On commande plus ?
- Non, Fraise ne mange pas.
Je suis végétarienne.
Levons tous nos verres.
Depuis 3 ans,
Marshall a travaillé si dur,
et je suis fière de lui.
La viande est un meurtre !
Je le reconnais. C'était une erreur.
Comment s'en douter ?
Elle s'appelait Fraise !
Si c'est si important,
passons sur la photo.
Mais elle ne gâchera pas ta fête.
Laisse-lui sa chance.
Vous voyez. On est tous des amis !
Allez, on bosse les harmonies.
Joyeuse joli-Lily journée !
C'est fini.
J'espère qu'il vous plaira.
"Joyeux 42 ans,
"Lori".
<i>Les enfants, je vous ai parlé
des yeux "t'es mort pour moi" de Lily.</i>
<i>L'expression qu'elle a
juste avant d'exploser de rage ?</i>
Eh bien,
c'était pas ça.
Ça l'était pour Marshall.
"42e" ?
Cette bombasse
te paraît avoir 42 ans ?
Ou alors !
Elle à l'air de s'appeler Lori ?
- Marshall, ça va.
- Non, ça va pas. Ted,
fous cette inconnue dehors !
Vraiment désolée.
Dehors !
Joyeuse joli-Lily journée !
Amanda veut pas revenir.
Elle pense que vous la détestez.
Marshall, va t'excuser.
Tu gâches l'anniversaire de Lily
et je dois m'excuser ?
C'est toi qui devrais t'excuser.
De quoi tu parles ?
Tu ramènes des filles
à ces grands événements,
elles pensent donc
que c'est du sérieux.
Et quand tu les quittes,
devine vers qui elles vont ?
Moi. Depuis des années,
je suis le préposé au coeurs brisés.
Février 2005.
Je rentrais d'un marathon
de bachotage à la bibliothèque.
Natalie, où est Ted ?
On a cassé...
à nouveau.
Tu veux t'asseoir, non ?
Assis-toi.
Tu sais, ça fait 36 heures
que je suis levé.
Quelques minutes.
Au début, j'étais compatissant.
Mais sérieux, avec les années,
tu m'as rendu cynique.
Je vais nous chercher des gâteaux,
et on va rester ici à discuter
jusqu'à démêler tout ça.
Je pensais
que notre relation était spéciale,
tu vois ?
Moi aussi, ouais.
Mais tu sais,
la vie continue, chérie.
Je sais pas comment
je vais pouvoir m'en sortir après ça.
Ferme-la.
Désolé que ma recherche de l'âme soeur
soit désagréable
pour vous.
Vous savez ?
Vos précieuses photos
seraient peut-être mieux sans moi.
- Elles seraient mieux sans Marshall.
- C'est petit.
Tout petit.
Tu sais ce que ces photos sont ?
Un gros mensonge.
Des poses.
Elles sont retouchées.
Elles sont ton désir, pas la réalité.
- C'est faux !
- Ah oui ?
Regarde celle-là.
Halloween, il y a 2 ans.
Vous vous disputiez car tu refusais
de te déguiser en pingouin.
C'est pas qu'elle voulait pas.
Elle a dit qu'ils étaient "nuls".
Les pingouins.
Et te voilà, tu souris
comme si de rien n'était.
Totalement fausse.
L'anniv de Robin, y a 3 ans.
Robin était malade, tu lui as fait
ranger son pyjama pour la photo.
Et tu m'as pincé les joues
très fort pour les raviver.
Oui, mais t'es jolie.
Et on a mangé
du gâteau au chocolat dans mon lit.
- C'était une super soirée.
- C'est vrai.
Oui, c'est vrai.
Regardez celle-là.
C'est la première photo
qu'on a prise tous les trois.
C'est vrai.
Vous vous souvenez
des circonstances ?
- Vous êtes prêts ?
- Attends.
Quelle pose on fait ?
Les flics amis amis ?
Non. Si on faisait,
un feuilleton des années 80
sur des colocs
qui sont d'accord sur rien ?
Super.
OK. Un, deux...
Salut, Marshall.
T'es prêt pour le film ?
Juste une seconde.
On fait l'histoire, là.
On va prendre
notre première photo de colocs.
Rejoins-nous sur la photo !
Sûr ?
Tu fais quoi, Ted ?
- Et si on casse ?
- Et si vous cassez pas ?
Viens.
J'avais tout oublié.
On sortait ensemble
depuis quelques semaines
et tu m'as invitée sur la photo.
Je t'aimais bien.
- Faut ramener Amanda.
- Vraiment ?
Ted, tu as cru en moi.
C'est mon tour de croire en toi.
J'en sais rien,
c'est peut-être la bonne.
Merci, Lil.
Le grand âge de Lori
l'a rendue sage.
On dit que c'est à la quarantaine
qu'on apprend à se connaître.
<i>Alors, tante Lily a appelé Amanda.</i>
Allez, rapprochez-vous.
Fabriquons un souvenir.
Marshall, essaye ça.
Ferme les yeux
jusqu'à la dernière seconde,
et quand je te dis, ouvre-les.
- Barney, t'as un trou sur ta veste ?
- Quoi ? Où ça ?
Maintenant !
Je rêve !
UN AN PLUS TARD
Nomme-la.
Anni... Annie ?
Non, c'était mon anniversaire.
Ton cerveau fait
des associations évidentes.
Allez,
rapprochez-vous.
Fabriquons un souvenir.
Y a quoi dans ta sauce ?
Ça a un goût de...
coriandre.
Et...
tu sais que la coriandre,
ça me fait...
<i>Lily has always
been one of those people</i>
<i>who loves their birthday.
Loves it.</i>
It's my birthday!
<i>So it's a good thing
she married Marshall.</i>
It's still my birthday!
<i>Because he loves planning birthdays.</i>
<i>Feliz cumpleańos, baby.</i>
The theme of this today's
birthday breakfast in bed is...
"Spanish Interlude"
And...
How on Earth did we end up
in the lyrical rolling hills
of Northern Spain?
Baby, tonight is going
to be so much fun.
Just the five of us, black-tie dinner,
and Ted is picking up
your favorite cognac pumpkin
cheesecake from Edgar's.
Okay, I am off to run your super secret
birthday errand.
And I'm taking this guy with me because
I don't like how he's looking at you.
A new camera!
Thank you, Marshall.
I love it!
Well, little bonus:
I took some naked pictures
of myself before I wrapped it.
Put a bow on it.
There wasn't a bow on it.
Wrong "it."
Thank you, honey. I'm going to get some
great shots of our little group with.
<i>Now, kids, you've seen your Aunt Lily's
photo albums: leather bound,</i>
<i>acid free paper,</i>
<i>adorable handwritten captions.</i>
<i>And most importantly,
the group shot.</i>
<i>Cute photo, right, kids?</i>
<i>What you don't see is what happened</i>
<i>ten seconds
before this picture was taken.</i>
I want to get
the perfect group shot.
Marshall, sit between
Barney and Robin.
Why?
You know, light,
color, balance, aperture...
You're just saying camera words.
Wait, you don't want Barney and me
to look like a couple
in this picture, do you?
Of course I don't!
You two aren't going to last!
- I'm going for timeless here.
- How dare you?
- That is so rude!
- It's true.
Totally true, we're running
on fumes here, but still rude.
<i>We hated Lily's group shots.</i>
Okay, maybe I get a little bossy,
but I just want
to remember those times.
Like tonight.
I can't imagine
a better birthday than,
than being here with just
my four best friends.
And Ted's here now.
Happy birthday!
This is Amanda.
And Amanda...

Ted, you were supposed
to bring a cheesecake,
but instead you brought two grocery bags
and a woman we've never seen before.
Hi. I'm Marshall.
Welcome to our home.
Start talking.
Amanda's going to make
Lily a cake. She's a chef.
We met when I was at a restaurant
last week and I sent some soup back.
Lucky, she's got such pretty hair
I didn't mind eating a little bit of it.
They call me "The Shedder" at work.
I'm so glad you're
making my birthday cake!
In honor of Lily's 32nd birthday,
I've got a lot of great games
planned, starting with...
"Lil-ial Pursuit."
Okay, who's got number one?
I do.
Of course you do.
Okay, Amanda goes first.
32 seconds on the clock
to answer as many questions
as possible.
And...
Go! Question one:
What is Lily's favorite color?
Well, she's wearing pink,
so I'm going to say pink.
That's Robin.
Her...
favorite color is...
elbow.
I believe Ted was mouthing
the word "yellow."
Which also would have been wrong.
This game is called
"Gilding The Lily."
- Nice.
- Thank you.
You've all written down your favorite
things about the birthday girl.
And Lilypad,
you guess who wrote what.
"Lily makes everyone in her life,
from her friends to her students..."
She's a kindergarten teacher
that's what he means by that.
"... feel loved. She makes the best
oatmeal raisin cookies ever,
can recite
every line from Goonies..."
She saw Goonies in the theater
right after her parents separated.
After that,
she had real trouble trusting people...
"She's the strongest person
I've ever met.
"I can't imagine
my life without her.
I love you, Lily."
Of course it was me.
That's so sweet.
Lily, you try to guess
who wrote this.
"You seem really nice."
I'm going to guess Amanda.
That was me.
And I meant every word.
Well, I should get back
to that cake.
Let me know if you need anything.
Quick!
Let's do the photo!
Everybody around the fireplace.
Hang on, I'll let Amanda know.
That's okay. She's busy in the kitchen.
Let's not bother her. Come on.
Hang on a second.
You...
You don't want Amanda in the photo.
It's just, you know,
auto-focus, shutter speed, zoom...
Lily, what's going on?
Who wants a party hat?
Look, I'm a bird!
Let's all be birds.
Tell me the truth.
Of course not. I'm not going
to let another one of your dumb skanks
ruin my precious memories.
Lily, what are you talking about?
Ted, you always do this.
You bring girls that we barely know
to all our big group events.
- I do not.
- Really?
Well, let's just take a little walk
down Random Skank Lane.
Or, we could just keep on
a-strolling down
Best Birthday Ever Avenue.
Do I get a vote?
Skank Lane! Skank Lane!
Guys, I've composed a song
for the evening.
Follow along.
The chorus goes like this:
<i>Happy, happy Lily day!</i>
Christmas morning, four years ago.
<i>Our first Christmas together,
just the five of us.</i>
Here's
another fun little trivia game.
It's called <i>Name That Bitch</i>.
It is San...
Wrong. You're thinking of Santa,
'cause it was Christmas.
Fun fact, each year,
my mother has Easter tea
with her friend Bunny.
Not that fun.
I remember her name.
It's Sarah.
Close.
It's Leilani.
She just had to come to Christmas
because you said,
"Guys, she might be the one."
And she's not the only
"might be the one."
<i>New Year's Eve, 2007.</i>
<i>Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall</i>
<i>and "She's the One" Emily.</i>
<i>Robin's Uncle Cecil's funeral.</i>
<i>Marshall, Lily,
Robin, Barney, Ted and...</i>
<i>"this just proves you find the one
when you're not looking" Isabel.</i>
<i>My appendix surgery.</i>
<i>Robin, Marshall,
Barney, Lily, Ted, and...</i>
<i>Well, this one you admitted
you were just trying to bang.</i>
Respect.
Remember this yoga instructor
you brought to my last birthday?
<i>... you!</i>
Thanks.
You won't believe who just came in.
Don't look!
Why aren't you looking?
It's Slash from Guns N' Roses!
Group shot!
And we got it.
We got a picture with Slash
on my birthday.
Awesome, right?
We know how this ends.
Wrong!
<i>You know what's funny about it?
He was grabbing my ass.</i>
<i>- Really? He was grabbing my ass, too.
- He was grabbing my ass, too.</i>
How many hands does he have?
No wonder
he's such a good guitarist.
I'm sorry dude,
I thought that you were Lily.
Wait, look at these pictures again.
<i>Barney has the same pose
in each shot</i>
<i>and these are, like, years apart.</i>
Yes, about that,
I never take a bad picture.
Never have, never will.
There has to be
a bad picture of you.
Not one.
The elementary school?
Everyone has bad pictures from school.
Not the Barnacle.
<i>I always look</i>
drop dead, stone cold amazing.
Unlike Marshall,
who just looks dead, stoned and cold.
<i>He was right, kids.
Marshall does a lot of things well,</i>
<i>but he does not take a good picture.</i>
They're not all bad, okay?
Like...
Here, look at this one.
My eyes are open.
You did put a bow on it.
Chip and dip?
Sure.
Got it!
A bad picture.
Is it though?
Wait!
You were eating a chip!
Where's the chip?
It is physically impossible for me
to take a bad picture.
I don't know why.
Ask God.
I'm sorry about Amanda.
I'm going to say it.
You are being a birthday brat.
You're all bent out of shape just 'cause
you think I ruined a couple pictures.
These girls have ruined
so many events,
or are you forgetting Paris?
What happened in Paris?
It was junior year
and I was studying abroad in Paris,
and I hadn't seen Marshall
for two months.
Two months.
And I had just started having sex.
I wasn't ready
to stop for two months.
And Marshall was coming
to visit over spring break.
And at the last minute,
Ted decided to come
with the girl he had just
gotten back together with, Karen.
Karen.
I am so excited you're here.
I'm so excited to go to Paris.
I'm so excited to have sex again.
But just before
the plane took off...
Wait,
I want to tell you something.
Really?
'Cause I think I want to tell you
the same thing.
Is your thing, I had sex with
my philosophy professor last night?
'Cause that's my thing.
And thus began the longest seven
and a half hours of Marshall's life.
- When I picked them up at the airport.
- Ted broke up with me.
I need to sleep in your room
this week.
Marshall can bunk with Ted.
Two months!
My balls were bleu! Bleu!
This will come as no shock,
but the rest of the trip
was terrible.
And all I wanted was
a romantic kiss picture
in front of the Eiffel Tower,
which I actually did get.
It just happened to be between
Karen and Francois,
our waiter from the day before.
Wow, that's just awful.
Just...
Oopsies! I dropped my phone.
- You picking it up for me?
- Sure.
Smile, you son of a bitch!
Got it!
Did you, though?
Wait. How do you do that?
You weren't even standing up!
The camera loves me, Robin.
More than loves me.
The camera lusts after me.
The camera wants to put
on some nice lingerie,
pop in an Al Green CD,
dim the lights and do all the work
while I lie
there with my eyes closed.
I'm sorry about Paris and
all the ruined group shots,
but when you're single,
you got to hope that each next new girl
is the one.
- Erin. Irene. And Sarah.
- Emily. Or Isabel.
It's Leilani.
What is wrong with you?
At the time, yes, I thought each
of these girls could be the one,
but I got to stay hopeful.
What's the alternative?
Here's the alternative.
How about
no more random skanks
at my birthday!
Hey, sweetie!
Do you guys have a cooling rack?
Drawer under the oven.
Can't wait. You're just the best!
Ted, I'm sorry.
I gonna have to agree with Lily on this.
These kind of events
are hard for a new person.
That's why I didn't bring Don tonight.
When I lived in Japan,
this guy, for our third date,
brought me to his brother's wedding.
Now, I a total stranger,
am in that Japanese couple's wedding
picture for all eternity.
Yeah, Ted,
I think you should listen to Robin.
Right, right, 'cause...
'cause Robin's your best friend.
- Exactly.
- Your best friend in the whole world.
- Absolutely.
- Careful, Lily. It's a trap.
And before she was your best friend,
what was she?
Oh, that's right.
One of my random skanks.
Yes, Ted.
This particular skank...
... happened to work out,
but she's the skanky exception,
- not the skanky rule.
- I'm crying a little bit.
Hey, guys, that about wraps up
this whole skank conversation.
Let's get back to the birthday song!
Barney, your part goes like this.
She's cute.
She's cute.
She's cute.
I bring girls
to these events because
you guys are important to me.
You're my family.
Your part goes like this.
And nice.
And nice.
And also nice!
Yes. We're a family.
So why can't these events
ever just be us?
Like the time we celebrated
Marshall passing the bar exam.
Hey, guys.
This is the disgusting,
smelly hippie I'm dating.
I did not say that!
You might as well have.
Hey, guys.
This is Strawberry.
Should we order more food?
No, Strawberry's not eating.
I'm a vegetarian.
Let's all raise a glass.
For the last three years,
Marshall has been working so hard,
and I am so proud of you.
Meat is murder!
I admit it.
Strawberry was a mistake.
How could I have known that going in?
Her name was Strawberry.
If it's a big deal, Amanda doesn't have
to be in the photo.
But I promise she's not gonna ruin
your birthday. Just give her a chance.
See, look, guys.
We're all friends again!
Now let's work on those harmonies.
Happy happy Lily day!
Happy happy Lily day...
All done.
I hope you like it.
"Happy 42nd birthday,
" Lori."
Kids, you know how I've told you about
Lily's "you're dead to me" look.
That expression she gets just before
she explodes in white-hot rage?
Well,
this wasn't it.
But this was Marshall's.
"42nd"?
Does this
hot piece of ass look 42 to you?
Or!
Or
does she look like her name is Lori?
- No, Marshall, it's okay.
- No, Lily, it's not okay. Ted,
get this stranger out of my house!
I am so sorry.
Out!
Happy, happy Lily day.
Happy, happy Lily day
Well...
Amanda refused to come back.
She thinks you guys hate her.
Marshall, you have to go apologize.
You ruin Lily's birthday
and you want me to apologize?
If anything,
you should apologize to me.
What are you talking about?
Ted, you bring girls
to these intimate events
it makes them think
that things are serious.
And then when you break up with them,
you know who they turn to?
Me. I've been
your girlfriend cleanup crew for years.
February, 2005.
I had just come back from a marathon
study session at the law library.
Hey, Natalie, where's, where's Ted?
We broke up...
again!
Won't you sit with me for
a little while?
Just sit?
Man, you know what?
I've been up for, like, 36 hours.
Just for a few minutes.
And at first,
I was completely sympathetic.
But damn it, Ted, over the years,
you made me cynical.
You know what?
I'm going to go get us some Rocky Road,
and we're just going to sit here
and talk it out until it makes sense.
I just thought
we had something so special,
you know?
Me, too. Yeah.
But, you know,
life goes on, sweetheart.
I don't know how I'm going
to put my life back together after this.
Oh, shut up.
I'm sorry my search for true love
has been such an inconvenience
to you guys.
You know what?
Maybe your precious pictures would look
a lot better if I wasn't in them.
Look better if Marshall
weren't in them. Cheap shot.
Cheap shot.
You know what these pictures are, Lily?
They're a big, fat lie.
They're posed.
They're touched up. They're what you
want our life to be, not what it is.
- That's not true!
- Oh, yeah?
Look at this one.
Halloween, two years ago.
You got in a fight 'cause
you didn't want to dress up as penguins.
It's not just that she didn't want to.
It's that she called penguins "lame."
Penguins.
And yet, here you are,
smiling like nothing's wrong,
completely phony.
Robin's birthday, three years ago.
Robin had a cold and you made her change
out of her pajama's for the picture.
And then you pinched my cheeks
to get some color in them.
Yeah, but you look pretty.
And then,
we all ate chocolate cake in my bed.
- Actually, that was a nice night.
- Yeah, it was.
Yeah, I guess it was.
Hey, look at this one.
This is the first picture the three
of us ever took together.
That's right. It was.
Yeah, you remember how it happened?
Okay, ready?
Wait.
What pose should we do?
Buddy cop picture?
What about, '80s sitcom
about two roommates
who never agree on anything?
Nice.
Okay, one, two...
Hi, Marshall.
Ready for the movie?
Yeah. Just a second though, okay?
We're about to make history.
We're about to take
our first ever roommate picture.
Why don't you get in the picture,
too?
Really?
What you doing, Ted?
- What if we break up?
- What if you don't?
Come on.
I forgot all about that.
Marshall and I had just been dating
a few weeks
and you invited me into the picture.
I liked you.
- We have to get Amanda back.
- Really?
Ted, you believed in me.
It's my turn to believe in you.
For all I know, she's the one.
Thanks, Lil.
I think Lori's age
has made her very wise.
They say your forties are when
you really get to know yourself.
So, your Aunt Lily called Amanda.
All right, people, gather around.
Let's make a memory.
Okay, Marshall.
Marshall, try this.
Keep your eyes closed
until the last second,
and when I say so, open them.
- Barney, it's a hole in your jacket?
- What? Where?
Now, Marshall!
Damn it!
Name that bitch.
Birth... a?
Bertha?
No, it was my birthday.
Your brain makes associations
in a very obvious way.
All right, people.
Gather around.
Let's make a memory.
What's in this dip you made?
'Cause it tastes like...
cilantro.
And
you know that cilantro makes me...
Yes!
<i>Les enfants, vous vous demandez sűrement
si toutes ces histoires sont vraies.</i>
<i>C'est normal.</i>
<i>La frontičre entre une bonne histoire
et un mensonge est fine.</i>
<i>Et personne ne jonglait mieux
avec cette frontičre qu'oncle Barney.</i>
<i>C'était le meilleur.</i>
- J'adore voyager.
- Ah bon ?
- Quel est ton endroit préféré ?
- Hawaď, c'est sympa.
J'ai un pote qui vit ŕ Seattle.
C'est joli.
Mais le mieux ?
Je crois que c'est la Lune.
Enchanté, Neil Armstrong.
Elle a cru que t'étais le premier
ŕ avoir marché sur la Lune ?
C'était 7 ans avant ta naissance.
Ted, chérie, c'est qu'un détail.
Notre vaisseau est passé
ŕ travers un trou de ver,
ou des rayons gamma,
ou un truc comme ça.
Depuis, je ne fais que rajeunir.
Tu bosses dans une crčmerie.
C'est excitant.
Tiens, j'ai aussi bossé
dans une crčmerie au lycée.
Et c'était assez...
excitant.
Et, 20 minutes plus tard,
elle a vu ma fusée.
Nos space boots se sont "heurtées."
Houston, on a une gémissante.
Et d'autres sous-entendus spatiaux.
Pourquoi tu mens tout le temps ?
Je mens pas.
On a passé une super soirée.
Regardez.
- Je déteste mon boulot.
- Comment ça ?
- Et ton interview avec le maire ?
- Maire McOuaf-ouaf.
Déguisé en chien,
il donne des conseils écolo.
Enfin, il devait.
Je veux pas
parler du maire McOuaf-ouaf.
Je veux vous parler de cette semelle
de chez "C'est le pied".
Regardez
comment elle absorbe les chocs !
Attention ŕ la table !
Ŕ tout de suite.
Ŕ tout de suite.
Désolé, Robin.
Je m'ennuie.
Je te comprends.
Rien qu'une vraie interview,
ça serait génial.
D'accord.
Je regarde mes disponibilités.
Je veux d'avance la liste des questions
et on aborde pas ma vie privée.
T'as gobé sept cacahučtes ŕ la suite.
Impressionnant, mais pas intéressant.
- T'en as avalé sept ŕ la suite ?
- Sept ŕ la suite.
Je parle pas de ça.
Mais d'avoir été choisi pour construire
la maquette
de l'Empire State Building
pour la plus grande reproduction
de New York.
C'était ça, ton joujou,
l'autre soir ?
Je jouais pas, je travaillais.
"C'est toi.
"C'est moi.
"Je t'ai vue dans la rue.
"Es-tu Annie ?"
Tu rejoues la derničre scčne
de <i>"Nuits Blanches ŕ Seattle"</i>
avec des poupées ?
- T'es lŕ depuis quand ?
- Dix secondes.
Oui. Que la scčne finale.
Encore ?
Voilŕ la pizza.
Chéri, t'as des sous ?
Tu sais...
en fait, je pense pas devoir payer.
J'aime pas trop la pizza.
Quoi ?
On traversé le pays pour une pizza,
des centaines de fois.
Une fois, tu en as męme mangé
sous la douche.
Il y a un dessin de vous
sur nos bons de réductions.
Je dis pas qu'il aime la pizza,
mais la derničre fois,
le docteur lui a dit d'arręter la pizza.
Marshall a demandé pourquoi.
"Afin de pouvoir vous examiner."
Qui aime bien châtie bien.
D'accord, si je n'ai pas d'argent,
c'est parce que...
j'ai été agressé.
Hein ? Quoi ?
Quelqu'un peut payer Arthur ?
J'ai faim.
- Comment va votre pčre ?
- Mieux.
Tant mieux.

- Agressé ?
- Qui t'a agressé ?
Un type mal rasé
avec une cape noire ?
- Il a dit : "Haut les mains" ?
- Oui, car j'ai été agressé en 1947,
ŕ l'angle d'Abbott et de Costello.
Non.
J'ai coupé par Central Park
pour rentrer...
Fais gaffe.
T'approche pas.
C'est bon.
C'est bon.
C'était vraiment... terrifiant.
C'était vraiment... terrifiant.
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Je répčte.
Je vais dire que ça m'est arrivé
pour avoir du sexe de réconfort.
Barney, ça marchera pas.
Ça peut marcher ?
- Ça peut.
- Alors, OK.
C'est fou, on a pointé une arme
sur mon Marshmallow.
Je sais pas
si j'arriverai ŕ dormir ce soir.
Tiens. J'ai un petit truc
pour t'aider ŕ dormir.
Mets ça sous ton oreiller.
Tu dormiras comme un bébé.
Robin, éloigne ça !
C'est inoffensif !
La sécurité est...
mise.
Vous savez quoi ?
On va se détendre.
On a pas besoin de ça.
J'aimerais faire
comme si de rien n'était
et aller de l'avant.
Faire comme si de rien n'était,
et aller de l'avant.
C'est bon, ça.
J'ajouterai des larmes, par contre.
Je sais que ça fait peur,
mais regarde-moi.
Je vais bien, d'accord ?
On peut passer ŕ autre chose ?
Bien vu, mais je vais le changer
en "laisse-moi ętre derričre toi".
Chérie, tu n'as pas ŕ t'inquiéter.
J'ai un peu peur,
mais je suis de New York.
Ça ne changera pas qui je suis.
J'ai changé !
Je veux une arme.
- Chargeur !
- Tu devrais faire une pause...
Chargeur !
- Tu veux un flingue ?
- Un mignon.
Un joli petit Beretta qui irait bien
avec mes nouvelles chaussures.
- Notre nouvelle CB fonctionne.
- T'as pas besoin d'une arme.
Les statistiques prouvent
que partout dans le monde,
il est plus sűr
de ne pas avoir d'arme chez soi,
et surtout chez nous.
Je te blesse déjŕ assez
accidentellement.
C'était facile, hein ?
Dépęche-toi. La fęte va commencer.
Mon Dieu, Lily !
Tu devais te déguiser en chatte.
J'ai changé d'avis.
Et tu veux ajouter un flingue ŕ ça ?
T'as raison, mais chaque fois
que je ferme les yeux,
je vois ce gars
pointant son arme sur toi.
Tu es tout pour moi.
Si quelque chose t'arrivait,
je serais...
Non. Je vois. D'accord.
Je dois vous avouer un truc.
Ça s'est pas passé
exactement comme je vous l'ai dit.
Donc il avait bien une cape noire ?
- Je vous l'avais dit.
- Non, il en portait pas.
Il ne portait rien.
Attends, alors...
Fais gaffe.
T'approche pas.
C'est bon.
C'est bon.
Il était ŕ poil ?
Je veux pas savoir
oů il mettait son arme.
C'était un flingue, au moins ?
Non, j'ai coupé par Central Park
pour rentrer ŕ la maison,
et je me suis arręté au zoo.
Fais gaffe. T'approche pas.
C'est bon.
T'es en train de nous dire...
Que t'as été agressé...
Par un singe.
J'ai été agressé par un singe.
T'as été agressé par un singe ?
C'est bien ça.
J'avais honte,
alors j'ai inventé l'autre version.
Lily, t'as pas besoin
d'avoir un flingue.
Oublie le flingue.
On parle du singe.
Les singes agressent les gens ?
C'est la jungle dehors.
Mon Dieu !
Ce singe a notre adresse.
Et s'il est dans un gang ?
Pourvu qu'il débarque pas chez nous.
Pourquoi t'as pas demandé au gardien
ton portefeuille ?
J'ai vu ce que le singe a fait avec,
j'ai aucune envie de le récupérer.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
On a du neuf
concernant l'agression de Marshall.
- Ils l'ont attrapé ?
- Il est derričre des barreaux.
Ils l'ont trouvé oů ?
Je pense qu'il était nu dans un arbre
et jetait ses excréments.
Je l'ai déjŕ vu.
Depuis, je prends le taxi.
Tu sais comment ils l'ont eu ?
- Il faisait des singeries.
- Des singeries.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
D'accord.
Robin, voilŕ ce qui s'est passé.
Laisse-moi raconter.
Le jeune Marshall était au zoo
et mangeait une banane...
Je mangeais pas de banane.
Si tu racontes, fais-le bien.
T'as raison.
La banane était par terre.
Il y avait pas de banane.
Il y en avait pas.
Marshall, je m'excuse... vraiment.
Voilŕ ce qui s'est passé.
Ne tirez pas.
- Pas de banane !
- Allez.
Je sais que Marshall
s'est pas fait agresser par un singe.
Il a raison.
Ce n'est pas si rare.
En Thaďlande, en Chine,
au Costa Rica,
les singes vous volent tout le temps.
Les singes sont chapardeurs.
Grâce ŕ leur dynamique sociale,
leur prédisposition au vol
leur confčre un avantage génétique.
Un singe t'a agressé !
Il devait juste ętre curieux.
Tu portais un chapeau jaune ?
C'est vraiment une histoire géniale.
Je peux t'interviewer dans mon show ?
Tu vas le prendre dans ton show ?
Et ma maquette ?
Personne ne veut voir
un gars jouer ŕ la poupée.
D'abord, c'est pas du tout ça.
Ensuite, tu en as déjŕ reçu un.
Vos poupées sont favorites
au concours de collection de Rhinebeck.
Si elles se tiennent bien.
L'an passé, j'en ai trouvé une
batifolant avec un G.I. Joe.
C'est pas drôle.
Ŕ quoi tu pensais ?
Et si tu étais tombée enceinte ?
Tu l'as fait revenir
pour une interview de suivi.
Pour l'occuper pendant que le FBI
fouillait sa maison.
J'ai besoin de ton histoire.
Elle a tout : crime, singes,
aucune maquette débile
qui prend de la place dans le salon
et empeste la colle.
Fais-le pour moi, en tant qu'ami.
Ça serait marrant.
Peux-tu me promettre
de présenter de façon non risible
mon agression par un singe ?
Tu t'es fait agresser par un singe.
- On m'a agressé.
- Quoi ?
C'est ce que j'ai dit ŕ cette fille.
C'était terrifiant.
Je veux oublier ce qui s'est passé
et aller de l'avant.
Pauvre chou.
Neil ?
Mademoiselle,
mon nom n'est pas Neil. C'est...
Pourquoi tu l'appelles Neil ?
Parce que c'est son nom.
C'est Neil Armstrong.
Le cycliste ?
Je te croyais en mission spatiale.
Et moi qu'on t'avait agressé.
Je peux le faire.
Alors, j'allais
ŕ la plateforme de lancement
quand on m'a agressé.
Et, l'agresseur
a pris les clés de ma navette.
Nickel !
Qui pour une partie ŕ trois ?
Moi.
Moi aussi.
Ça a été
le meilleur plan ŕ trois de ma vie.
Étrange,
tu as l'air d'avoir pris
deux vodkas au visage.
T'as męme du citron vert.
L'histoire est mieux avec ma fin.
Juste...
Nous y voilŕ, zéro gravité.
Nus avec des casques d'astronaute.
Incroyable !
J'ai présenté l'histoire du singe
ŕ mon producteur et il adore !
- Ah bon ?
- Qui a déjŕ entendu ça ?
Personne,
ŕ part les habitants de la Thaďlande,
de la Chine, du Costa Rica
et de plein d'autres pays
oů les crimes des singes
sont monnaie courante.
Le top, c'est que ça pourrait ętre
diffusé en national.
Cette histoire de singe
pourrait me rendre célčbre.
Moi aussi.
Ça va pas.
Je peux pas le faire.
- Ce sera gęnant, et alors ?
- C'est pas ça.
J'ai pas été agressé par un singe.
Alors,
t'as pas été volé par un singe ?
Non.
Donc tu dis qu'un singe t'a berné
afin que tu lui donnes
ton portefeuille ?
Non.
Tu as agressé le singe ?
Il n'y avait aucun singe !
C'était un humain avec un flingue.
T'es sűr que ce n'était pas un singe
sur les épaules d'un autre
avec un pardessus ?
Ça ferait la bonne taille.
J'ai tout inventé
pour que Lily n'ait pas d'arme.
J'y crois pas.
Tu m'as entendu.
Je pense qu'un singe t'a agressé.
Tu ne veux pas faire le show
pour pas avoir l'air d'un con.
- Ce sera pas le cas ?
- Un énorme, si.
C'est jamais arrivé, compris ?
Je peux pas mentir
ŕ mes meilleurs amis.
Moi si, continue.
Je peux pas mentir
sur une chaîne nationale.
Tu le connais mieux.
Il dit vrai ?
Ted, ne...
Je peux pas dire.
Il sent bon.
Mais je distingue rien.
Je persiste ŕ dire que c'est arrivé.
Peut-ętre. Mais, Marshall,
si tu t'es pas fait agresser
par un singe,
tu dois pas laisser Robin en parler.
Elle perdrait sa crédibilité.
Les journalistes mentent sans arręt.
Désolé, mais je croirai
ŕ la mort de Jack Palance
quand je verrai son corps.
Ça va peut-ętre te choquer,
mais les gens aiment pas les mensonges.
Faux ! Ils n'aiment pas découvrir
qu'on leur a menti.
"Car un mensonge est une belle histoire
qu'on gâche avec la vérité. "
En l'occurrence,
ce que cette Sarah m'a fait !
- Tu veux dire ce que tu lui as fait.
- Non, j'ai dit ce qu'elle m'a fait.
Ŕ dire vrai,
j'ai peur que l'histoire ŕ trois
ne se soit pas passée comme je l'ai dit.
Nickel.
Qui pour une partie ŕ trois ?
Lisa, attends.
Oui, Neil ?
C'est toi, Lisa ?
Sarah, attends.
Écoute...
je suis pas Neil Armstrong.
Désolé, j'ai menti.
Je n'ai pas vraiment été franche
non plus.
J'ai dit avoir 28 ans,
mais j'en ai 31.
Et pour ętre honnęte,
je suis allée chez le docteur et j'ai...
31 ans !
J'étais heureux,
trčs heureux,
pensant m'ętre fait
une nana de 28 ans avec un sale teint.
On aime les mensonges.
Marshall, ils en ont besoin,
c'est pourquoi,
en ce qui me concerne,
un singe t'a agressé.
Tout comme je l'ai fait ŕ trois.
Je suis le plus fort du monde !
- C'est la ceinture du trio ?
- Tu le sais.
Respect !
J'ai trop bien dormi hier soir.
Vous y croyez,
j'ai failli acheter une arme ?
Je suis ravie
qu'un singe t'ait agressé.
Vous m'avez eu.
J'étais juste nerveux.
Un singe m'a agressé.
Oui ! Je le savais.
Attends. Je commence ŕ croire
que tu t'es pas vraiment fait agresser.
Pourquoi aurait-il inventé
un truc pareil ?
Mais oui, Ted.
Viens par lŕ.
Sérieux, c'est quoi,
ton eau de Cologne ?
C'est toxique.
<i>Donc, la nuit suivante,
on est allés sur le plateau de Robin.</i>
Sois pas nerveux,
on va juste t'asseoir...
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce truc ?
Je sais pas.
On dirait un truc recouvert d'un drap.
J'imagine que si tu veux le savoir,
tu devras en faire un reportage.
C'est toi qui seras recouvert d'un drap
si tu vires pas ça d'ici.
Mec, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je doute que Marshall mente.
Quand il avouera,
je veux avoir une histoire pour Robin.
Ou plutôt, 102 histoires,
car c'est la taille
d'un incontournable de New York.
Maintenant, je veux une arme.
- Le singe est lŕ.
- Surprise !
On pensait que ça serait bien
si on te confrontait ŕ ton agresseur.
Ŕ cause de cet incident,
on va envoyer Capitaine Bobo
dans une réserve.
- Il va adorer ça.
- Non, madame.
Nous allons le séparer de son amie,
Milly.
Ils sont ensemble depuis longtemps.
Son amie s'appelle Milly ?
<i>Et l'interview commença.</i>
Avec vos propres mots,
décrivez ce qu'il s'est passé.
J'aimerais vous dire
ce qu'il s'est passé.
Je me demande vraiment
ce qu'il y a sous ce drap.
Nous ne sommes pas lŕ pour ça,
nous allions parler de votre agression.
C'est courant, une agression ŕ New York.
Mais combien de fois...
peut-on voir ce qu'il y a sous ce drap ?
Mike, tu peux le filmer ?
Ŕ tout de suite.
Tu fais quoi ?
Un singe ne m'a pas agressé,
c'était pour que Lily
n'achčte pas d'arme.
C'était pas un singe ?
Quoi ? Bien sűr que si.
Génial, dis-le ŕ l'Amérique.
Antenne dans cinq...
Pas dans cinq.
Ce n'était pas un singe.
- Je vais acheter une arme.
- Non, c'était un singe.
- Alors, Bobo s'en va.
- Non, c'était pas un singe.
- Tu sais si un singe l'a agressé ?
- Pas du tout.
Capitaine Bobo vous a-t-il agressé,
oui ou non ?
Dis-nous juste ce qu'il s'est passé.
Dis-nous la vérité.
<i>Et Marshall réalisa qu'il y avait
une chose qu'il ne pouvait pas dire.</i>
Trčs bien !
Voilŕ la vérité.
Je...
retourne me coucher.
<i>Et voilŕ.</i>
<i>On a jamais su
ce qu'était devenu son portefeuille.</i>
<i>Mais on sait ça :</i>
<i>Lily n'a jamais eu d'arme,</i>
<i>la crédibilité de Robin
est restée intacte,</i>
<i>Bobo et Milly vivent ensemble
au Zoo de Central Park.</i>
Merde.
Ted, au micro.
Au micro et maquillé.
Panier, piano, panier, piano.
Pas super...
Quand je raconterai cette histoire,
je dirai qu'un singe l'a agressé.
Et je garderai la banane ficelée.
Ça marche.
Ça suffit les mensonges.
Tu peux pas choisir une autre fin
ŕ ta guise.
Vraiment ?
Retiens mes paroles, Mosby.
Un jour,
tu raconteras cette histoire,
tu penseras comme moi.
J'en doute.
<i>Et lŕ, les enfants,
vous ne me croirez jamais.</i>
Le singe s'est échappé !
Il m'a pris une poupée !
Viens ici, Bobo.
Il grimpe sur l'immeuble !
C'est vraiment en train d'arriver ?
Bien sűr.
<i>C'est une histoire vraie.</i>
<i>Kids, you may be wondering</i>
<i>how many of these stories</i>
<i>I'm telling you are true. </i>
<i>It's a fair question.
After all, there's a fine line</i>
<i>between a good story</i>
<i>and a bald-faced lie. </i>
<i>I've never met anyone who could work
that line better than your uncle Barney.</i>
<i>Heck, he could jump rope with it. </i>
- I love to travel myself.
- Really?
- Where's the best place you've visited?
- Hawaii's nice.
A buddy of mine lives in Seattle.
That's a good spot.
But the best place?
I'd have to say the moon.
Hi, Neil Armstrong.
You did not convince a girl that you
were the first man to walk on the moon!
That happened 7 years
before you were born!
Ted, baby doll, minor hurdle.
Yeah, well, our spaceship
passed through a wormhole
or some gamma rays or something.
I started aging backwards,
blah, blah, blah.
So, you work in a yogurt shop.
That must be wild.
Although, I did actually work
in a yogurt store in high school.
And it was indeed...
wild.
Anyhoo, 20 minutes later,
the eagle landed.
We knocked space boots.
Houston, we have a moaner.
Other space-related
double entendres.
Why do you feel the need
to lie all the time?
I'm not lying!
Guys, we made sweet love.
I got pictures.
- I hate my job.
- What are you talking about?
- I thought you interviewed the mayor.
- Mayor Mcwoof.
He wears a dog costume
and teaches kids not to litter.
At least he's supposed to.
I don't want to talk
about mayor Mcwoof.
I want to talk
about these amazing insoles
from bon appe-feet!
Just look
how shock-absorbent they are!
Prop table!
Table's a prop!
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
Sorry, Robin.
Got bored.
Yeah, I don't blame you.
Man, just one decent interview
would be so nice for a change.
Fine. I'll look at my schedule,
see when I'm available.
I want a list of questions
ahead of time,
and my personal life is off limits.
You caught seven peanuts in a row.
It's impressive, but not newsworthy.
- You caught seven in a row?
- Seven in a row.
That's not about that.
I'm talking about
how I was selected to build
a scale model
of the Empire State Building
for the largest recreation
of the New York skyline in the world.
Is that the thing
you were playing with the other night?
I wasn't playing. I was working.
"It's you."
"It's me."
"I saw you in the street.
"Are you Annie?"
Are you acting out the last scene
of <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>with dolls?
- How long have you been out here?
- Ten seconds.
Yeah. Just the last scene.
Again?
That's the pizza.
Baby, do you have any cash?
You know, I actually...
I don't think
that I should have to pay.
'Cause I'm not a fan of pizza.
What?!
We've driven
halfway across the country
for a piece of pizza
literally hundreds of times.
I once caught you
eating pizza in the shower.
Marshall, there's a cartoon of you
on our coupons.
I'm not saying Marshall's a guy
who likes pizza,
but last time he went in for a physical,
doctor says, "You got to stop pizza".
Marshall says, "Why?"
Doc says, "So I can examine you".
But seriously,
we kid because we love.
All right, the reason that I don't have
any money on me...
is because...
I got mugged.
You...? What?
Can somebody please pay Arthur?
All right? I'm starving!
- How's your dad?
- Better.
Good.

- You got mugged?!
- Who mugged you?
Was he wearing a black skull-knit cap
and a five o'clock shadow?
- Did he say, "Stick 'em up?"
- Yes, because I got mugged in 1947
at the corner of Abbott and Costello.
No.
I was cutting through central
park on my way home from work...
Watch it.
Don't get any closer.
It's cool.
It's cool.
It was... completely terrifying.
It was... completely terrifying.
- What are you doing?
- Rehearsing.
I'm gonna pretend this happened to me
to try and get some sympathy sex.
Barney, that won't work.
Will it?
- Big time.
- I'll allow it.
I can't believe someone pointed a gun
at my Marshmallow.
I'm shaking. I don't think
I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight.
Here, sweetie. I have something
that will help you sleep.
Just stick this under your pillow.
You'll sleep like a freakin' baby.
Put that away.
It's not going to hurt anyone.
The safety's...
On.
Okay, you know what?
Let's all just relax.
We don't need a gun.
I'd just like to forget
this ever happened
and try to move on with my life.
Just like to forget
this ever happened
and try to move on with my life.
This is great stuff.
I think I'm gonna add tears, though.
Listen, baby,
I know that it's scary, but look at me.
I'm fine, okay?
Can we just put this behind us?
That's gold, but I'm going
to switch it to "put me behind you".
Baby, you don't have
to worry about me.
Yes, I'm a little scared,
but I'm a New Yorker.
I'm not gonna let this change me.
I've changed!
I'm a gun person now.
- Clip!
- Maybe we should just take a break...
I said, "clip".
You want to get a gun?
Not a scary one.
Just a cute, little, pink Beretta
that matches these adorable
strappy sandals I just bought.
And, our new credit card works.
You don't need a gun.
Every statistic in the world
points to the fact
that it's safer <i>not</i> to have a gun
in the home than to have one,
especially in our home.
You know how I'm always
accidentally injuring you.
Pretty easy, right?
Hurry up, baby.
The party's about to start.
My god, Lily! I thought you were going
as a sexy cat!
I changed my mind.
And now you want to bring a gun
into that equation?
I know, you're right,
but every time I close my eyes,
I picture that guy
pointing a gun at you.
You're my whole world.
If something ever happened to you,
I would just...
Okay... No, I know.
I know.
OK, I've got to admit something.
That mugging didn't happen
exactly the way that I said it did.
So he <i>was</i> wearing
a black, skull-knit cap.
- Told... Ja!
- No, he wasn't wearing that.
He wasn't wearing anything.
Wait, so...
Watch it.
Don't get any closer.
It's... It's cool.
It's cool.
He naked-muggered you?
I'm not gonna ask
where he was keeping the gun.
Are we sure it was a gun?
No, guys, I was walking
home from work...
Through Central Park,
and I stopped at the zoo.
Watch it.
Don't get any closer.
It's cool. It's cool.
You're telling us...
That you got mugged...
By a monkey.
I got mugged by a monkey.
You got mugged by a monkey?
Yep, I got mugged by a monkey.
I was embarrassed,
so I made up the other story.
But the point is, Lily,
you don't need a gun.
Forget about the gun.
We're on this now.
Monkeys are mugging people now?
It really is a jungle out there.
Oh, my god!
That monkey has our address.
What if he's in a gang?
I hope he doesn't do a swing-by.
Why didn't you just ask
the zookeeper to get your wallet back?
'Cause I saw what the monkey
was doing with it,
and I didn't really want it
after that.
Hey, guys. What's up?
Some new information has come to light
on Marshall's mugging.
- Really? Did they catch the guy?
- Well, he's behind bars.
Where did they find him?
I'm guessing naked in a tree,
throwing his own feces.
I've seen that guy.
See, that's why I take cabs.
You know how they caught him, right?
- There was a tail on him.
- There was a tail on him!
What is going on?
All right, Robin,
here's what happened.
Let me tell it. It's my story.
You see, young Marshall
was at the zoo eating a banana...
I wasn't eating a banana!
If you're gonna tell it, tell it right.
You're right.
The banana was on the ground.
There was no banana!
There was no banana.
Marshall, I apologize... Truly.
Robin, here's what happened.
God, don't shoot.
- There was no banana!
- Oh, come on.
Barney, I know Marshall
didn't get mugged by a monkey.
He got right.
This is not an uncommon thing, okay?
In Thailand, in China,
in Costa Rica, people get mugged
by monkeys all the time.
Monkeys are gatherers.
Because of their intersocial dynamics,
having a predisposition towards
stealing gives one
a genetic advantage.
You were mugged by a monkey!
Maybe he was just curious.
Were you wearing a yellow hat?
Seriousness, this is a great story.
Can I interview you about it on my show?
What? He gets to be on your show?
What about my model?
No one wants to see a guy
playing with dolls.
First of all,
that is not what it is.
And second of all, you just had a guy
on your show playing with dolls.
Your dolls are favored at the Rhinebeck
Collector Awards next month.
Only if they behave themselves.
Last year, I found one of them
cavorting with a G.I. Joe.
It's not funny.
What were you thinking?
What if you'd gotten pregnant?
And you invited him back
for a follow-up interview.
Because the FBI asked us to keep him
occupied while they search his house.
I need this story.
It's got everything:
crime, monkeys,
no stupid model
of the Empire State Building
that takes up my entire living room
and makes the place smell like glue.
Do this for me...
as a friend?
It'd be fun to see you on TV.
Can you promise
to present it in a way
that doesn't make a joke
out of the fact
that I got mugged by a monkey?
You got mugged by a monkey.
Oh, my God.
- I just got mugged.
- What?
Is what I was saying to this girl
at the bar earlier...
It was completely terrifying.
I just want to forget this ever happened
and try to move on with my life.
You poor thing.
Neil?
Lady, my name's not Neil.
It's Bar...
Why are you calling him Neil?
Because that's his name.
He's Neil Armstrong.
The cyclist?
You were supposed to be
on a shuttle mission?
I thought you just got mugged.
I can do this.
You see,
I was on my way to the launch pad
when I was mugged.
And...
the mugger
took my space shuttle keys.
Nailed it. Who's up for a three-way?
- I am.
- Me, too.
And it was the best three-way ever.
Strange, 'cause you look like you had
two vodka tonics thrown in your face.
And you have lime in your hair.
The story's better with my ending.
Just... okay?
There we are, zero gravity.
The three of us wearing nothing
but space helmets.
You won't believe it.
I pitched the monkey mugger story
to my producer and he loves it!
Really?
Who's ever heard of a guy
getting mugged by a monkey?
No one except for the good people
of Thailand,
China, Costa Rica,
and plenty of other countries
where monkey crime
is an extremely common nuisance.
The best part is, he said that it might
get picked up to go national. Guys.
This monkey mugger story
could make me famous.
Me, too.
Guys, this is bad.
I can't, I can't do this.
- It'll be embarrassing... so what?
- It's not that.
I wasn't mugged by a monkey.
So, you weren't mugged by a monkey?
No, I wasn't.
So what you're saying is...
the monkey tricked you
into giving him your wallet?
- No, that's not what I'm saying.
- So you mugged the monkey?
There was no monkey!
It was a human being with a gun.
Are you sure it wasn't one monkey
standing on another monkey's shoulders,
wearing a men's trench coat?
Be about the right height.
I just made that story up
so taht Lily wouldn't get a gun.
That never happened.
- I don't buy it.
- What?
You heard me.
I think you were mugged by a monkey.
You don't want to go on the show
'cause it'll make you look like a joke.
- Won't it?
- The biggest, 'cause it's so funny.
Well, it never happened, okay?
I can't lie to you
'cause you're my friends.
I am, but go on.
But I can't lie about it
on national TV.
You've known him the longest.
Is he telling the truth?
Ted, don't...
I can't tell.
He smells good.
But I just can't tell.
I'm still saying it happened.
Maybe. But, Marshall,
if you didn't get mugged
by a monkey,
you can't let Robin report it.
This could hurt her credibility.
Journalists lie all the time.
I'm sorry, but I will believe
that Jack Palance is dead
when I see the body.
This may come as a shock to you, Barney,
but people don't like to be lied to.
Wrong! They don't like finding out
they've been lied to.
"Because a lie is just a great story
that someone ruined with the truth. "
Case in point,
what that girl Sarah did to me!
I think you mean
what you did to her.
No, I mean what she did to me.
The truth is,
I'm afraid the three-way story
didn't go exactly the way I said it did.
Nailed it.
Who's up for a three-way?
Lisa, wait.
Yes, Neil?
- You're Lisa?
- Sarah, wait.
Look...
I'm not Neil Armstrong.
I'm sorry I lied.
I guess I wasn't completely honest
with you, either.
I said that I was 28,
but the truth is that I'm really 31.
31!
I was happy, very happy,
thinking that I had nailed
a 28-year-old with some sun damage.
People want the lie.
Marshall, they need the lie,
which is why,
as far as I'm concerned,
you were mugged by a monkey.
Just as sure
as I had that three-way.
I am the greatest in the world!
- Is that the three-way belt?
- You know it.
Props!
Man, I slept so great last night.
Can you believe
I almost bought a gun?
I'm so glad
you got mugged by a monkey.
You guys got me.
I was just nervous.
I got mugged by a monkey.
Yes! I knew it.
Wait a minute. Now I'm thinking
you really weren't mugged by a monkey.
Why would he make
something like that up?
Yeah, come on, Ted.
Come here.
Seriously, what is that cologne?
It's intoxicating.
<i>So, late the following night,
we all went to the set of Robin's show.</i>
Don't be nervous. What we're gonna do
is we're going to sit you...
What the hell is this?
I don't know.
Looks like something covered by a sheet.
Guess if you want to find out,
you're gonna have to do a story on it.
You're gonna be covered by a sheet
if you don't get your stupid model out.
Dude, what are you doing?
I don't think Marshall's
going to lie on TV.
When he backs out, I want to be there
for my friend, Robin, with a story.
Or rather, 102 stories,
because that's how tall
a certain iconic New York landmark is.
Now, I want to buy a gun.
- The monkey's here.
- Surprise.
We thought it would help the story
if you could face your attacker.
Because of this incident,
we will be sending Captain Bobo
to a wildlife sanctuary.
- I bet he'll like it there.
- No, ma'am.
You see, we'll be splitting him up
from his mate, Milly.
They've been together
for a long time.
His mate's name is Milly?
<i>And then, the interview began.</i>
In your own words,
describe what happened.
I would love to tell you
what happened, Robin.
But...
I'm just, I'm so curious as to what
is going on underneath that sheet.
We're not here to talk about that.
We're here to talk about your mugging.
People get mugged in New York City
all the time,
but how often do you get to see
whatever's under that sheet?
Mike, can we get a shot of that?
We'll be right back.
What are you doing?
I wasn't mugged by a monkey. I made up
that so that Lily wouldn't buy a gun.
So you weren't mugged by a monkey?
What, baby?
Of course I was mugged by a monkey.
Great, tell it to America.
We're back in five.
Not back in five.
I wasn't mugged by a monkey.
- That's it. I'm getting a gun.
- Not a gun. I was mugged by a monkey.
- Then Bobo here is going away.
- Wasn't! I wasn't mugged by a monkey!
- You think it was mugged by a monkey?
- None whatsoever.
Just tell me: were you
or were you not mugged by Captain Bobo?
- Just tell us what really happened.
- Just us tell the truth.
<i>That's when Marshall realized
there was only one thing he could say.</i>
All right!
Here's the truth.
I...
am going back to bed.
And that was it.
<i>We never found out what really
happened to Uncle Marshall's wallet.</i>
<i>But we do know this:</i>
<i>Lily never got a gun,</i>
<i>Robin's credibility
remained unimpeached,</i>
<i>Bobo and Milly lived out their days
together in the Central Park Zoo.</i>
Damn it.
All right, Ted, mic up.
Mic'd up and made up.
Red leather, yellow leather.
That wasn't very satisfying.
When I tell everyone this story,
I'm saying he was mugged by a monkey.
I'm gonna keep the banana
on a string thing. That was working.
Barney, enough with the lies.
You can't tack on a new ending 'cause
you're not satisfied with the wraps up.
Really?
Well, mark my words, Mosby.
Someday you'll be telling this story,
you'll see it my way.
Doubtful.
<i>And then, kids,
you'll never believe what happened.</i>
The monkey got loose!
He's got one of my dolls!
Come here, Bobo.
He's climbing the building!
Is this really happening?
Sure is, Ted.
<i>True story.</i>
<i>Les enfants, à certains moments</i>
<i>nous prenons tous des décisions</i>
<i>qui changent nos vies.</i>
<i>Voici l'un de ces moments.</i>
<i>Tout a commencé avec la visite
de ma mère et de son copain Clint,</i>
<i>qui disait toujours
des trucs du genre :</i>
Ta mère
est une femme très, très érotique.
Non, stop.
En temps que peintre, compositeur
et pompier volontaire,
je la trouve
incroyablement sexuelle.
Mais toi aussi tu as
des souvenirs sexuels avec elle.
Non, stop.
Sortir de son utérus,
téter son sein. Tu vois ?
Bien.
J'arrive pas à croire
que je suis avec lui.
Maman, c'est pas grave.
Tu peux le quitter.
- Il y a un tas d'autres gars...
- Il est si cool.
Et il m'a choisie, moi.
Ravi de voir que vous êtes heureux.
Tant mieux,
car on a un truc à t'annoncer.

<i>lors du remariage de sa propre mère</i>
Alors Ted, à quand le mariage ?
Robin a chialé
sur la chanson de Clint.
Je te l'avais déjà dit.
Heather, la soeur canon de Ted !
- Je dois y aller.
- Attends, Ted.
- Et ton toast ?
- Invente une excuse.
J'en peux plus.
C'est le mariage de ta mère.
Oncle Larry, ma main à couper...
Les chutes du Niagara.
Elle, là, un vrai torrent.
<i>Et ils ne m'ont plus vu
pendant 72 heures.</i>
Ted va bien ?
Je sais que le week-end a été dur,
- mais ce silence est étrange.
- Je sais.
Sa mère a appelé 5 fois
pour savoir où il était.
Désolé, Robin.
Ils n'ont plus de bretzels.
Je sais à quel point t'es émotive.
C'est rien.
C'est rien.
Oui, j'ai pleuré
pendant la chanson.
Elle a pleuré.
Salut.
- Ted, t'étais où ?
- Tout va bien ?
Je vais plus que bien.
Je suis sur un petit nuage.
Venez, on va faire un tour !
Tu veux pas que quelqu'un
qui n'est pas en dépression
prenne le volant un moment ?
Et où on va, bon sang ?
D'abord, voilà ce qui s'est passé
le soir du mariage.
<i>En voyant ma mère se marier,</i>
<i>j'ai réalisé
que j'avais un peu de retard.</i>
Il fallait que je parte.
<i>Je suis allé à l'hôtel
et j'ai surfé sur un site</i>
<i>que je visite parfois la nuit...</i>
Mon Dieu. C'est pas vrai.
On veut pas savoir ce que tu fais
sur internet quand t'es seul.
Je suis pas...
C'est pas de ça dont je parle.
<i>Je suis allé sur mon site
d'enchères immobilières préféré.</i>
<i>On en a tous un.</i>
<i>J'ai fouillé un peu et...</i>
les amis...
J'ai acheté la maison de mes rêves.
- Comment ça, tu l'as achetée ?
- J'ai fait une offre.
J'ai gagné l'enchère
et je l'ai remportée.
Je viens de finir la paperasse.
Et ça s'est bien passé
avec la sorcière,
ou elle a voulu négocier le prix ?
Ne te moque pas, mec.
Cette pièce sera le bureau.
Un endroit que pour papa.
Les enfants pourront venir,
mais pour lire, pas pour jouer.
C'est pas que je les aime pas.
Mais il faut des limites.
C'est dingue.
Ça va prendre des années
et une petite fortune
pour rendre cet endroit vivable.
Je suis architecte.
Je trouverai bien.
Si je commence maintenant,
ça sera fini
pour quand on emménagera.
Elle est dans la pièce,
avec nous, Ted ?
Je sais
que j'ai pas encore trouvé Mme Mosby,
mais ça viendra. Touchons du bois.
Attention, mon pote.
Tu peux pas aller
là où tu voudrais que ta vie soit.
Ça marche pas comme ça.
Ouais. C'est la chose la plus stupide
que t'aies faite.
La plus stupide qu'on ait faite.
Laissez Ted tranquille.
On en a tous fait.
Je me souviens qu'une fois,
j'ai lâché des fusées artisanales
dans les toilettes
et j'ai voulu
les sécher au micro-ondes.
Tu devais être bien bourré.
Non, c'est trop stupide.
C'est arrivé quand il était gamin.
Un gamin ?
Hé, les amis !
Super nouveau jeu :
J'étais bourré ou gamin ?
Faites vos choix.
- Bourré.
- Gamin.
Tambours.
<i>J'étais...</i>
<i>bourré !</i>
Je suis content que Robin ait juste.
Elle est très sensible et fragile.
Je fais allusion à la fois
où elle a pleuré
sur la chanson de Clint.
Et même si je chuchote,
- j'espère qu'elle entend.
- C'était pas moi !
Quoi ?
C'est pas moi qui ai pleuré
sur la chanson.
<i>Rouge et vrai...</i>
Tu pleures ?
Je sais, c'est stupide, mais...
<i>Et le dragon...</i>
Ils sont heureux, tu vois ?
Pas autant que moi.
Je te donne 500 $ si on dit
que c'est toi qui as pleuré.
500 billets ? Vendu.
Merci, Robin.
Tu m'a sauvé d'une humiliation publique
et d'une honte indescriptible.
Vous devinerez jamais
ce que vient de faire Robin.
Vous êtes tous...
Je viens pour l'inspection.
J'étais inquiet de ne pas vous voir.
J'étais là,
mais la sonnette doit être cassée.
La sonnette est cassée.
Tu fais l'inspection
que maintenant ?
Rappelons-nous qu'on a tous fait
des choses stupides.
Un fois,
j'ai essayé de faire du vélo
sur une échelle
depuis maison à deux étages.
La question est de savoir...
si j'étais bourré ou gamin.
- Bourré !
- Gamin !
Tambours.
<i>J'étais...</i>
Marshall est mort !
Marshall est mort !
Gamin.
Ah, les mères.
Elles s'inquiètent pour un rien.
Je suis sorti du coma
en une semaine.
Allons voir le porche.
Je vais mettre un barbecue là.
Chaque dimanche, ici,
ce sera la fête de l'andouille.
Réunion des andouilles ?
On fera des hamburgers.
Tu peux pas garder cette maison.
C'est une grave erreur
Écoute-moi.
J'ai un plan.
Femme, maison, gosses.
Mais là,
l'univers est un peu vache
sur la partie femme et gosses.
Quelle est la seule chose
que je peux contrôler ? La maison.
Je l'ai achetée.
C'est pas une erreur.
Tout à fait. Mais moi
conduisant à contre-sens sur l'I-94,
ça, c'est une erreur.
- Bourré !
- Gamin !
J'étais...
gamin.
Tu lui as pleuré dessus ?
Vous avez des fuites. Le bon côté :
la fuite au sous-sol
noie les rats les plus lents.
Les autres, eux...
viennent par ici.
Fallait attendre de voir
les problèmes de la maison.
On peut trouver
des problèmes partout,
mais on doit pas s'y arrêter.
En Première année,
Marshall pensait déjà
que tu étais la bonne.
Et si quelqu'un
lui avait filé des doutes ?
On n'a eu que deux rencards,
bon sang, Lily Aldrin,
je vais t'épouser.
Pas si vite.
Il y a des problèmes structurels.
Ces hanches ne sont pas adaptées
aux bébés Eriksen.
Et ce machin n'a pas de bon filtre.
Un problème de maintenance
à long terme.
Je sais, aujourd'hui tu crois aimer
cet extérieur gothique,
mais au fond,
tu n'imaginais pas plutôt
quelque chose d'espagnol ?
Je vous suggère
d'envisager une location.
Mais il a suivi son intuition
et c'est ce qu'il a fait de mieux.
C'était Robin !
"Quoi ?"
C'est elle qui a pleuré
durant la chanson de Clint !
"Mais elle a dit..."
Je sais ce qu'elle a dit.
Voilà ce qu'elle voulait cacher.
10 MINUTES AVANT
Écoute, Barney,
Je supporte pas
ces blagues sur mes pleurs.
Si je dis que c'était toi
qui pleurais, ça t'irait ?
Bien sûr.
Te laisser filer était une erreur,
non ?
Ton pénis est énorme.
- T'as failli nous avoir.
- Toujours la phrase de trop.
Zut !
Bonne nouvelle.
On va pouvoir rentrer tôt.
- Vraiment ?
- J'ai fini dehors et en bas.
Je pourrais continuer la liste,
mais j'ai déjà les moisissures,
le mur porteur abimé,
les fils électriques dénudés,
la peinture au plomb,
les dégâts des eaux, du feu, du soleil,
la chaudière cassée,
le parquet pourri...
mais pas de termites !
La cheminée est fissurée,
y a des rats,
des chauves-souris, des araignées,
un clodo, une gouttière rouillée,
des fusibles périmés
et une cuisine avec une belle peinture
mais dont les finitions
jurent avec le plan de travail.
Je vous recommande
de ne pas acheter
cette sorte de Guantanamo Bay,
et vous suggère qu'on se barre d'ici
avant qu'une légère brise
ne démolisse ce taudis.
Et si...
Et si je l'ai déjà acheté ?
Je vais contrôler l'étage.
Il a trouvé un clodo ?
Il y a des problèmes
mais je vois cette maison
comme elle pourrait être.
Je vois
une balançoire sur cet arbre.
Une couronne sur la porte à Noël.
Un grill dans le patio
pour le barbecue chaque week-end.
Je vois la vie
que je pourrais avoir ici.
Je vois un procès.
Et moi des termites.
Bonne nouvelle, l'inspecteur
a tué des cafards en tombant.
Attends.
Trou béant au deuxième étage.
Je m'assure
que le rapport soit complet.
Vous aviez raison.
C'est une énorme bêtise.
C'est que...
vous avancez tous.
Vous avez déjà acheté,
ça devient sérieux entre Robin et Don.
- Lui a une nouvelle cravate.
- Merci bien !
Et là ma mère qui se remarie.
J'en suis au même point
qu'il y a cinq ans et j'en peux plus.
Je suis prêt pour la vie
qui va avec cette maison.
Ça va aller, mec.
Parfois
on prend de mauvaises décisions.
Comme ta mère.
Comment ça ?
Tu sais bien
que j'ai toujours été très,
très attiré par ta mère.
- Arrête.
- En fait,
Virginia et moi avons partagé
un moment spécial.
Retour en 2006 AC...
Avant Clint.
De quoi tu parles ?
Je voulais être ton père !
- Ça veut dire quoi ?
- Me réponds pas, jeune homme !
C'est pour ça
que j'ai pleuré pendant sa chanson,
car cet enfoiré me l'a prise.
Et là,
tout ce qu'il me reste,
c'est le souvenir
de l'avoir déposé à l'aéroport.
C'est comme ça
que tu as eu la broche ?
Incroyable.
Toi...
On y est.
On y est.
- On a passé un bon moment...
- Peu de circulation...
J'adore cette chanson.
Vraiment ? Je peux...
Écoute,
la maman de Ted...
je devrais vraiment...
Ton pénis est énorme.
Encore ? Toujours une de trop !
OK, j'ai inventé la fin,
mais le reste est vrai.
Allez, mec. Ta mère est une cougar.
Je pensais qu'une cougar
devait pas avoir plus de 50 ans.
C'est une tigresse.
Je suis foutu. Au mieux,
je peux mettre cet endroit d'aplomb
et le vendre à perte.
En général,
quand tu prends une décision stupide,
tu dois vivre avec.
Mais combien de fois
as-tu la chance de prendre une masse
pour défoncer un living ?
C'est débile.
J'ai tripoté ta mère.
Merci, Lily.
C'était fantastique.
À Ted Mosby... propriétaire,
ami et s'il peut le louer,
roi des taudis.
Il y a...
une dernière chose
que je dois faire.
<i>Et mes amis ne m'ont pas vu
pendant 3 jours.</i>
C'était notre chauffeur.
Ted, que fais-tu là ?
J'ai pas eu l'occasion
de porter un toast.
J'ai été égoïste, j'ai flippé,
et je suis désolé, alors...
voilà.
"Et si on aidait le DJ ?
Un geste... "
On va passer.
"Maman, je t'aime,
"et je ne t'ai jamais vu
aussi heureuse qu'avec Clint.
"Et, Clint,
bienvenue dans la famille.
"Ce que vous avez est
ce que j'espère trouver.
"Mais d'ici là, santé à vous deux."
Je vous aime.
Je suis si...
stone actuellement.
Je ne suis sûre qu'à 60 %
que tu es bien là.
Mais si tu l'es,
je t'aime.
Et tu es le meilleur fils
qu'une mère puisse avoir.
<i>C'était pas logique
qu'elle se retrouve avec un gars pareil.</i>
<i>Pourtant, comme vous le savez,</i>
<i>être avec grand-père Clint fut
la meilleure décision qu'elle ait prise.</i>
<i>Les meilleures décisions</i>
<i>sont parfois celles
qui n'ont pas de sens.</i>
Comment tu savais que je serais là ?
Robin me l'a dit.
Joyeuse crémaillère.
Je t'ai dit la dernière fois
que je vendais la maison.
Je sais.
Je connais aussi mon meilleur ami,
Ted Mosby.
Écoute...
toutes ces fois
où je t'ai dit dans le passé :
"Doucement.
Te précipite pas pour cette fille."
Tu ne m'as jamais écouté.
Ton coeur est bourré et gamin.
- Merci de prendre ma défense.
- Je suis là pour ça.
Je peux te montrer quelques idées ?
<i>Et, les enfants,
Marshall avait raison.</i>
<i>Je n'ai pas abandonné cette maison</i>
<i>car c'est ça le truc
avec les décisions stupides :</i>
<i>on en fait tous.</i>
<i>Mais le temps est marrant.</i>
<i>Et parfois un peu magique...</i>
<i>On peut prendre
une décision stupide...</i>
<i>et la changer en quelque chose
de complètement différent.</i>
<i>Car, les enfants,</i>
<i>comme vous le savez...</i>
<i>cette maison...</i>
<i>c'est la nôtre.</i>
<i>Kids, everyone
has one or two moments</i>
<i>when they make a huge,
crazy decision</i>
<i>that changes their lives forever. </i>
<i>This is the story of mine. </i>
<i>It all started with a visit from my mom</i>
<i>and her longtime boyfriend, Clint,</i>
<i>who was always saying stuff like... </i>
your mother is a very,
very erotic woman.
Please don't.
As a painter, slash,
songwriter, slash,
volunteer fear-fighter,
I find her...
incredibly sexual.
But you have
your own sexual memories
- with your mom, don't you?
- Please don't.
Exiting her womb,
receiving her milk. You get me?
Good.
I cannot believe I am with that man.
Mom. Mom, it's okay.
You don't have to settle.
- There are plenty of guys who...
- He is so cool!
And he picked me!
Well, I'm... I'm glad
you're both so happy.
Well, good, because we do
have an announcement...
Son.
<i>And so my mom was lapping me. </i>
<i>Getting married for a second time
before I was even married once.</i>
<i>I was so happy for them. </i>
<i>So freakin' happy. </i>
<i>Still, wedding can be magical. </i>
<i>For all I knew, I end up sharing a dance
with my own future wife there. </i>
And if you don't boil
those jam jars,
it's just a welcome mat
for bacteria.
<i>That wasn't her.</i>
Congratulations!
- We are so happy for you.
- I feel like I'm 19 again.
It's like the last 35 years
of my life never happened.
So wonderful to hear... Mom.
Son, to show that your mom and I
will always be there for you,
I want you to have this
beautiful picture that I painted.
<i>Kids, there was no guitar. </i>
Excuse me, Ted.
- Best...
- Wedding...
- Eh...
- ... ver!
Hello, everyone.
Mahalo for being here with us.
My entire life...
Well, this life.
I've waited for a muse
like Virginia.
Baby...
this is your song.
<i>When I squeeze
her trembling bosom...</i>
Oh, God...
<i>The blood pumps to my loins</i>
<i>When I penetrate her...</i>
<i>Kids, I swear to God, I blacked
out for the next 12 minutes. </i>
<i>So I have no idea
how the song got to this ending. </i>
<i>And Mahatma Gandhi</i>
<i>And the pancakes</i>
Everyone!
<i>And the dragon</i>
<i>And you</i>
<i>Virginia.</i>
Guys! Guys!
Guess what Robin just did.
<i>Red and true...</i>

Are you crying?
I know it's stupid, but...
<i>And the dragon...</i>
They're happy, you know?
Not as happy as I am, Robin.
Guys! Guys!
Guess what Robin just did.
And then, I told you guys
what Robin just did,
but you were there for that.
I gotta tell
the rest of the wedding.
Aunt Meredith!
<i>Kids, I can't overstate</i>
<i>how horrible it is
to be the single guy</i>
<i>at your own mother's</i>
<i>second wedding. </i>
So, Ted, when's your wedding?
So, Ted, when's your wedding?
When's your wedding?
When's your wedding?
When's your wedding?
Robin cried at Clint's song.
I told you already.
Ted's hot sister, Heather!
- I have to leave.
- Wait, Ted.
- What about your toast?
- Make up some emergency.
I can't handle this.
It's your mother's wedding!
Uncle Larry, my hand to God...
Niagara Falls.
This one. She's pouring.
<i>And my friends didn't see me</i>
<i>for the next 72 hours. </i>
Seriously, is Ted okay?
I mean, I know
it was a rough weekend, but...
- this radio silence is weird.
- I know.
His mom's called, like, five times
asking where he disappeared to.
Sorry, Robin.
They're all out of pretzels.
And I know how emotional you get.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Okay, I...
I cried at Clint's song.
She cried at Clint's song.
Hey, guys.
- Ted, where have you been?
- Are you okay?
I'm better than okay.
I am on top of the world.
Come on.
We're going for a ride!
Hey, buddy, do you want to, maybe,
let somebody who isn't having
some sort of manic episode
drive for a while?
Yeah, and where the hell
are we going?
First, let me tell you
what happened the night of the wedding.
<i>Watching my mom get married,</i>
<i>I realized how far behind I was
in my own life. </i>
I just had to get out of there.
So I went back to my hotel room
<i>and got onto this Web site</i>
<i>I sometimes visit
when I can't sleep... </i>
Come on. Oh, God.
We do not want to know what you
and the Internet do when you're lonely.
I didn't... I...
That's not the part of the night
I was talking about.
<i>I went to my favorite
real estate auction site... </i>
<i>Come on, we've all got one... </i>
<i>Scrolled through
a few properties and... </i>
Guys...
I just bought my dream house.
- What do you mean you bought this?
- I mean, I made a bid online.
I won the auction the next day
and I got approval.
I just finalized the paperwork.
And was the Blair Witch
easy to deal with
or did she haggle
over the closing costs?
Don't even joke about that, man.
I think this room will be the study.
You know, a place just for Dad.
The kids are welcome in here
if they're reading a book, but no toys.
It's not a question of withholding love.
It's a question of drawing boundaries.
This is insane.
This is gonna take years
and a small fortune to make livable.
I'm an architect.
I'll find a way.
And if I start right now,
it'll be done by the time
the ol' wifey and I
are ready to move in.
Is she in the room
with us right now, Ted?
Okay, okay, I know
I haven't found Mrs. Mosby yet,
but I will, knock on wood.
Careful, buddy.
You can't just skip ahead
to where you think your life should be.
- It doesn't work that way.
- I've got to agree.
This may be the stupidest thing
you've ever done.
Stupidest thing any of us has
ever done. Okay, all right.
Let's lay off Ted, all right?
We've all done some stupid things.
For example, I remember a time
when I dropped some
bottle rockets in the toilet,
and I tried to dry them
off in the microwave.
You must have been
drunk off your ass.
No, too stupid to be an adult.
He was obviously a kid when it happened.
A kid? How does a kid...
Oh, my God. Guys!
Great new game:
"Drunk or Kid", which one was I?
Lock in your guesses.
- Drunk.
- Kid.
Drumroll, please.
<i>I was... </i>
<i>drunk!</i>
You know,
I'm glad Robin got it right.
'Cause she's very sensitive
and fragile.
I'm referencing the time
she cried at Clint's song.
And even though I'm whispering,
- I actually hope she hears me.
- It wasn't me!
What?
I'm not the one who cried
at Clint's song.
<i>Red and true...</i>
Are you crying?
I know it's stupid, but...
<i>And the dragon...</i>
They're just happy, you know?
Not as happy as I am.
I will give you $500 if this just
happened to you instead of me.
500 bucks? Deal.
You just saved me unspeakable
public humiliation and shame.
Guys! Guys!
Guess what Robin just did.
Wait, you guys are...
Hi, I'm here for the inspection.
Oh, great! I was worried
you weren't coming.
I'm here for a moment,
but I guess the doorbell doesn't work.
Doorbell does not work.
Wait, wait... you're just getting
this place inspected now?
All right, let's all remember
that we've all done some stupid things.
For example, I once
tried to ride my bike down
an extension ladder
from the roof of a two-story house.
The only looming question is...
was I drunk or a kid?
- Drunk!
- Kid!
Drumroll, please.
<i>I was... </i>
Marshall's dead!
Marshall's dead!
A kid.
Moms, right?
Just always making a big deal
out of nothing.
I came out of that coma
in under a week.
Let's check out the porch, huh?
Come on.
I'm gonna put a grill out here.
Every Sunday, right here,
it's gonna be a total sausage fest.
Sausage party?
Burgers, we'll do burgers.
Stop it. You can't keep this house.
It's a huge mistake.
Listen to me.
I had a plan, okay?
Wife, house, kids.
As it turns out,
the universe is being kind of a wad
about the whole wife and kids part.
So, what's the one thing I can control?
The house.
I bought it.
It's not a huge mistake.
Exactly. Me driving my brother's car
the wrong way down I-94,
that was a huge mistake.
- Drunk!
- Kid!
I was...
a kid.
Did you cry on that guy?
You got leaky pipes.
But the bright side:
the pond in your basement is drowning
some of the larger, slower rats.
The rest of them, well...
they're headed this way.
See?
You should have waited to find out
the problems with this house.
You can always find problems
with any decision,
but you can't let that stop you.
Freshman year,
Marshall knew he wanted
to spend his life with you.
What if someone had been there
to second-guess that decision?
I know we've only been on two dates,
but damn it, Lily Aldrin,
- I'm going to marry you.
- Not so fast.
We got some structural issues here.
These hips are not
Eriksen baby-compliant.
And this thing right here
does not have a proper filter.
That's a maintenance issue
that's never going to go away.
I know
you think that you like
this gothic exterior now,
but deep down
didn't you always picture yourself
in something Spanish?
I'd recommend you look
into the rental option.
But Marshall took that leap of faith,
it's the best thing that ever happened.
It was Robin!
"What?"
Yes, it was Robin
who cried at Clint's song!
"But she said... "
I know what she said.
Here's
what she didn't want you to know.

Listen, Barney,
I can't stand all these jokes
about me crying.
If I pretend to reveal that you were
the one who cried, will you go with it?
Sure.
I made a mistake letting you go,
didn't I?
Your penis is enormous.
- You almost had us.
- You always take it one too far.
Damn it!
All right, good news.
I think we'll be out of here early.
- Really?
- I finished downstairs and the outside.
Now, I could keep looking
and see what else I can find
besides the black mold,
the damaged retaining wall,
the frayed electrical wires,
the lead paint, the water damage,
the fire damage, the sun damage,
the broken furnace,
the rotted floorboards...
look...
no termites.
The cracked chimney,
the bats, the rats,
the spiders, the raccoons, the hobo,
the detached gutter,
the outdated fuse box and the paint job
in the kitchen, which is fine,
but the trim really clashes
with the countertops.
Or I could recommend
that you do not buy this godforsaken
Guantanamo Bay of a house,
and suggest
that we all get our asses out of here
before a medium-sized wind blows
the whole sum'bitch down.
What if...
What if I already bought
the sum'bitch?
I will check out the upstairs.
Did he say he found a hobo?
There are problems,
but I see this house
for what I know it can be.
I see a swing on that tree outside.
I see a wreath on the front door
at Christmas.
I see
a grill out on that patio
where I'll be barbecuing every weekend.
I see a life
that I know I can have here.
I see a lawsuit.
Found termites.
The good news is the inspector
killed some roaches on impact.
Hold on.
Giant hole
in second floor.
Just wanted to make sure
the report is thorough.
You were right.
This was a huge mistake.
It's just...
Everyone's moving on.
You guys got a place years ago,
Robin's getting serious with Don.
Maybe that's a new tie?
Thank you! Jeez.
And now my mom's remarried.
I'm exactly where I was five years ago.
I'm sick of it.
I'm ready for the life
that fits into this house.
It's all right, buddy.
Sometimes people
make the wrong decisions in life.
Like your mother.
What you mean?
As you know, I've always been very,
very fond of your mother.
- Please don't.
- In fact,
Virginia and I
shared a special moment
back in 2006 B.C...
Before Clint.
What are you talking about?
I wanted to be your dad!
- What does that even mean?
- Don't you talk back to me, young man!
That's why I cried at Clint's song,
because that bastard
took her away from me.
And now,
all I'm left with...
is the memory
of dropping her off at the airport.
And that's how you got the brooch?
Unbelievable.
You...
Here we are.
Here we are.
- We made good time...
- Not a lot of traffic...
I love this song.
Do you?
I can...
Listen,
Ted's mom...
I...
should really...
Your penis is enormous.
Again?
Always one too far!
Fine, that last part I made up,
but the rest of it, I swear it was true.
Come on, dude.
Your mom is a cougar.
Wait, I thought you said
a cougar can't be over 50.
She's a Mellencamp.
I am screwed. The best I can do
is level this place
and sell the property
for a huge loss.
Usually in life when you make
a stupid decision,
you just have to live with it.
But how often do you get the chance
to pick up a sledgehammer
and bash the living hell out of it?
This is stupid.
I got second base whit your mom.
Thanks, Lily.
That felt fantastic.
To Ted Mosby...
homeowner,
friend, and if he can rent it out,
slumlord.
There's...
There's one last thing
I've got to do.
<i>And my friends didn't see me
for the next 72 hours.</i>
He was our ride.
Ted, what are you doing here?
I never got to give you your toast.
I was selfish and I freaked out
and I'm so sorry, so...
here it is.
"How bout a hand for the deejay?
Gesture to dee... "
I'll skip down.
"Mom, I love you,
"and I've never seen you
as happy as you are with Clint.
"And, Clint, welcome to the family.
"What you two have
is what I one day hope to find.
But until then, cheers to you both."
I love you, guys.
I am so...
baked right now.
I'm only 60% sure
you're actually standing in front of me.
But if you are,
I love you.
And you are the best son
a mother could ever have.
<i>There was no logical reason why
my mom should be with a guy like that.</i>
<i>And yet, as you kids know,</i>
<i>being with your Grampa Clint
was the best decision</i>
<i>your grandma ever made.</i>
<i>Sometimes our best decisions</i>
<i>are the ones
that don't make any sense at all.</i>
How'd you know
I was going to be here?
Robin told me.
Happy housewarming.
But, I told you the last time I saw you
I'm selling the place.
I know what you said.
I also know my best friend,
Ted Mosby.
Look...
of all the times over the years
when I've said to you,
"Slow down.
Don't rush into things with this girl"
You haven't listened to me
a single time.
Your heart is both drunk and a kid.
- Thanks for sticking up for me.
- That's what I do.
Can I show you
some of the ideas I have?
<i>And, kids, Marshall was right.</i>
<i>I didn't give up on my dream house</i>
<i>because that's the thing
about stupid decisions:</i>
<i>we all make them.</i>
<i>But time is funny.</i>
<i>And sometimes a little magical...</i>
<i>It can take a stupid decision...</i>
<i>and turn it
into something else entirely.</i>
<i>Because, kids,</i>
<i>as you know...</i>
<i>that house</i>
<i>Les enfants, votre tante Robin
sortait avec Don depuis un moment.</i>
<i>Quand, un soir, d'un coup...</i>
Tu t'installes ?
C'est un peu soudain.
Je voudrais bien m'installer.
Mais, laisse-moi y rťflťchir.
Non, tu t'installes,
ou tu me laisses de la place ?
Oui, bien sŻr.
Comme j'ai dit :
laisse-moi rťflťchir.
D'accord.
Vu que t'en as parlť,
tu veux t'installer ?
Et alors ?
J'y songe.
Vraiment ?
Tu le connais ŗ peine.
C'est un tocard
avec un travail pourri.
On fait le mÍme boulot.
Et on est fier de toi.
- «a va un peu vite.
- T'as peut-Ítre raison.
- Lance-toi.
- Tu crois ?
Tu es bien avec lui,
et mÍme si t'es une coloc gťniale,
je veux le meilleur pour toi.
Tu veux que je dťgage
ŗ cause du lait ?
C'est ťnervant.
C'est mon truc.
Je laisse la brique vide
pour penser ŗ en racheter.
Pourquoi tu en laisses pas une pleine,
pour ne pas penser ŗ en racheter.
Je suis ton ex
et avant que tu te dťcides,
je dois le rencontrer.
C'est bizarre
que Áa se soit jamais fait.
Grave.
C'est comme si
quelqu'un l'avait fait exprŤs.
OK. Mais promets-moi
de bien te comporter.
Je te le promets.
Je me suis tapť
cette contorsionniste portugaise.
Elle ťtait si souple,
qu'ŗ un moment,
elle ťtait ŗ la fois
au-dessus et en dessous.
Tope lŗ en haut et en bas !
- Qui a soif ?
- «a va.
- Et voici Barney.
- Il veut bien faire.
Enfin, je l'espŤre.
Il est gťnial.
Mais je me sens mal pour ces femmes
sans amour-propre
qui sortent avec un gars pareil.
<i>C'est lŗ que j'ai rťalisť
qu'elle n'avait rien dit ŗ Don.</i>
Je t'aime bien.
On aime tous deux un bon scotch,
mes histoires fascinantes...
Et on est sortis avec Robin.
<i>Maintenant, il savait.</i>

Tu traÓnes avec ton ex ?
- «a me gÍne un peu.
- Ne le sois pas.
C'est du passť.
Pour faire court,
ses bras ont fatiguť,
et Áa nous a ťpuisťs.
J'avais pas trouvť de fille
capable de faire Áa depuis Robin.
Parlez-nous de votre week-end,
ou de quoi que ce soit.
C'ťtait nul.
Des lits jumeaux ?
On peut pas dormir
dans des lits sťparťs.
Va voir la direction.
Oui.
Je vais aller demander
une autre chambre.
Je viens avec toi...
dans une seconde.
Le mťnage !
Vous pouvez repasser ?
On fait la sieste.
Il faut partir.
- On a dormi 18 heures.
- Et manquť 4 repas prťpayťs.
J'ai perdu 5 kilos.
Tu trouves pas bizarre
qu'ils soient encore amis ?
C'est bizarre
qu'on le soit encore avec lui.
Je sais pas quoi penser du fait
qu'elle traÓne avec un de ses ex.
<i>C'est lŗ que j'ai rťalisť
qu'elle n'avait pas dit ŗ Don</i>
<i>qu'il y avait un autre ex.</i>
<i>Moi.</i>
TraÓner avec un ex, c'est rien.
MÍme deux, on s'en fout.
Deux, c'est mÍme peut-Ítre mieux.
Je sais pas pourquoi.
Si tu sortais avec quelqu'un,
et qu'il traÓnait...
Excuse-moi.
- Il ?
- Oui. Il ťtait ami avec...
Attends. Minute papillon.
Selon toi, je suis gay ?
Pourquoi t'as cru Áa ?
Ton prof de calligraphie a appelť.
- Et ?
- T'es acceptť.
Je vťrifie juste
que <i>Project Runway</i> s'enregistre.
Les Jets ont un nouveau maillot ?
Je pense qu'il n'y aura pas
de <i>crŤme brŻlťe</i> ce soir.
Mon brŻleur est cassť.
Quand j'ai su que ton coloc
ťtait un gars, j'ťtais jaloux,
mais comme il est gay, Áa va.
Ted n'est pas...
Il y a toujours des boudoirs maison
et du Darjeeling trŤs chaud.
- Ted n'est pas... quoi ?
- Ted n'est pas... lŗ pour longtemps.
Il suit Cher en tournťe.
Entendons-nous bien.
Cher fait des concerts gťniaux,
mais je suis pas gay.
Sois franche.
C'est pas bizarre
que Robin traÓne avec son ex ?
Ted et Robin sont sťparťs
depuis longtemps. «a va.
Ted et Robin ?
Je suis plus si gay, hein, Donny ?
Un <i>Appletini</i> pour le monsieur.
Toi et Ted ?
Sur tes quatre amis,
t'as couchť avec la moitiť !
- Don, ce sont que mes amis.
- Mais aussi tes ex.
Et tu vis avec l'un d'eux.
Dťsolť, je dois rťflťchir ŗ tout Áa.
<i>Elle fait 1 000 degrťs !</i>
<i>Comme si je me collais
ŗ un pot d'ťchappement.</i>
<i>Ses ongles sont des rasoirs.</i>
<i>J'aimerais un sandwich.</i>
<i>Mais pas de bouffe au lit.</i>
<i>RŤgle stupide.</i>
<i>On a eu des fourmis qu'une fois.</i>
<i>Super, il va s'endormir.</i>
<i>Voilŗ la riviŤre de bave.</i>
<i>«a me gratte.</i>
<i>Juste une petite gratouille.</i>
- Prenons des lits sťparťs.
- Oui ! Un mini frigo,
- et des lits sťparťs.
- Vendu.
Je suis venu m'excuser.
J'ai mal rťagi.
On te doit aussi des excuses.
On a bien balancť sur toi.
- Non.
- Si, aprŤs que tu sois parti.
Je suis dťsolťe
de pas t'avoir dit la vťritť.
J'ai fait ma tapette.
Sans vouloir te vexer.
Toujours pas gay.
Vous Ítes importants pour Robin,
alors venez dÓner demain soir.
Super !
J'ai h‚te d'y Ítre.
- Merci.
- De rien.
Je dois rťcupťrer Robin.
T'es pas sťrieux ?
Je sais pas pourquoi,
mais je la veux.
Moi je sais.
T'es comme un gosse
qui jette un jouet,
et qui veut le rťcupťrer
quand un autre joue avec.
J'avais pas fini de jouer !
Je l'ai mis de cŰtť
pour jouer avec d'autres trucs !
T'es prÍt.
Pour quoi ?
Lire la lettre.
<i>Les enfants,
j'ai inventť le truc de la lettre</i>
<i>pour me rappeler
pourquoi j'avais quittť mes ex.</i>
<i>J'ai fait Áa des annťes.</i>
<i>"Cher Futur Ted :</i>
<i>"ne te remets pas avec Karen,
car c'est une snob prťtentieuse.</i>
<i>"Et elle t'a trompť.</i>
<i>"Dťsolť que tu l'apprennes comme Áa.</i>
<i>"Tu vois, on en rigole dťjŗ"</i>
<i>"Cher Futur Ted :</i>
<i>"reste loin de Natalie.</i>
<i>"Ou d'une fille qui peut te plaquer
au sol et te massacrer devant des gens.</i>
<i>"P.S. :</i>
<i>"consulte un thťrapeute
pour savoir pourquoi Áa t'excite."</i>
<i>"Cher gťnie des relations :</i>
<i>"Stella t'a abandonnť sur l'autel.</i>
<i>"Tu ne pourras sŻrement plus aimer,
et tu mourras seul."</i>
C'est moins triste
ťcrit en calligraphie.
<i>Donc quand Barney et Robin
ont rompu ŗ l'automne...</i>
Sortir avec Robin ťtait une erreur.
- …cris-le.
- Quoi ?
…cris-toi une lettre.
Du coup, quand Robin te manquera,
et ce sera le cas, tu te souviendras
pourquoi t'as rompu.
Volontiers.
"Cher
"futur Barney... "
Cette encre est super.
N'est-ce pas ?
"Toi"
"et Robin... "
"formiez un couple affreux.
"«a n'a pas marchť.
"Tu aimeras toujours Robin,
mais tu te souviens des autres femmes ?
"Mais surtout,
tu te souviens des autres seins ?
"Et tous les trucs cools
que tu peux faire avec :
"Te blottir, les peloter,
faire le klaxon avec.
"Je crois
que je suis un ťternel romantique."
Et aprŤs,
il y a des dessins de seins.
- T'as compris, maintenant ?
- Oui.
Je veux la rťcupťrer.
Les humains doivent pas Ítre faits
pour dormir ensemble.
Coucher et dormir sont souvent associťs,
mais c'est diffťrent.
Je sais.
Je t'aime, mais ce nouveau lit
devra Ítre
le sanctuaire du sommeil solitaire.
De mÍme. Et celui du casse-croŻte,
mais c'est tout.
Tu sais quoi ?
On devrait avoir un lit
juste pour coucher.
Un lit ŗ baise.
Un vilain lit ŗ baise.
C'est gťnial !
Chaque lit aura son rŰle.
Exactement.
Deux lit ŗ sommeil, un lit ŗ baise,
et un pouf
pour les grandes occasions.
Ne vient-on pas
de rťvolutionner le mariage ?
Clair.
Vous aimez les sushis ?
C'est cool qu'il sache les faire.
Il a appris au Japon.
Mal-vicieux ?
Sois sympa. Tu la veux juste
parce que tu peux pas l'avoir.
Si tu pouvais t'asseoir partout
sauf sur cette chaise,
- tu serais si bÍte...
- Ma chaise !
Du thon ťpicť, avec des piments ?
Mon prťfťrť.
J'adore manger ťpicť.
Il faut que Áa pique.
J'adore aussi,
sŻrement plus que toi.
Regarde.
Ne...
Superdoux.
Je ne sens rien.
Tu vas pas le croire.
Don a des lits sťparťs.
On vient juste d'en avoir.
Super.
«a n'a pas l'air si super.
On le pensait,
mais Áa nous a ťloignťs avec mon ex.
Je parie que vous n'en aviez pas d'autre
pour coucher.
Elle en avait un chez son coach.
C'est comme un glaÁon
dans ma bouche.
J'achŤterai un grand lit
si Robin veut emmťnager
J'aimerais...
si j'emmťnageais.
Si t'emmťnageais.
Tokyo Don,
t'as dťjŗ fait Áa au Japon ?
- Wasabi !
- Non.
Gťnial.
- Donnez-lui du lait.
- Crache, Barney.
On n'a plus de lait,
mais merci pour le pense-bÍte.
C'est chou.
T'es heureux ?
Je reste sur ce que j'ai dit.
C'ťtait intrťpide et romantique.
Tu t'es sali aux deux extrťmitťs.
T'en as fait des stupiditťs
pour impressionner Robin.
Oui, mais plus maintenant.
Je l'ai oubliťe et toi aussi.
Tu l'as pas oubliťe.
Tu la veux autant que moi.
Tu t'es pas mouillť.
C'est ridicule.
Et en voilŗ la raison.
"Pour mon biographe."
Concentre-toi sur la lettre.
"Cher Ted..."
"Robin est la fille parfaite,
"mais elle ne veut rien de sťrieux.
"Tu veux quelqu'un
avec qui te poser,
"et tant que Robin n'est pas prÍte,
"elle n'est pas ton ťlue.
"Mais je me souviendrai toujours
du cor d'harmonie bleu,
"notre premier baiser,
son regard lorsqu'elle m'a dit...
"qu'elle m'aimait."
Bon sang.
Je la veux aussi.
<i>Cette nuit-lŗ,
votre oncle Barney et moi avons eu</i>
<i>une discussion posťe
sur celui qui mťritait le plus Robin.</i>
J'ai volť un cor d'harmonie bleu
pour elle.
Je suis sorti avec elle pendant un an.
Je veux qu'elle ait mes enfants
et passer l'ťternitť dans ses bras.
Je veux coucher avec elle
encore une fois.
Elle est ŗ moi !
Elle n'est pas ŗ toi,
ni ŗ moi d'ailleurs.
Elle est ŗ Don.
Tu as raison.
On doit s'en dťbarrasser.
Au figurť.
Bien sŻr.
Ou... littťralement.
Mon Dieu, c'est comme Áa
que Áa commence !
J'ai peur, Teddy.
C'est juste deux mecs qui parlent.
Je suis inquiŤte.
Je veux pas divorcer.
C'est Don.
Pas nous.
Notre nouvel arrangement
va nous rapprocher.
Vire de mon lit.
Peut-on les emboÓter ?
Bien sŻr.
Tu parlais des lits ?
Je prťfŤre pas.
Pourquoi ?
Je t'aime plus que la vie,
mais t'es brŻlante.
Je suis surpris
que tu pisses pas que de la vapeur.
Tu pique-niques pas au lit,
non plus.
ņ part pour les fourmis, mais...
je veux Ítre ŗ tes cŰtťs.
Pour pouvoir me frapper
toute la nuit ?
DŤs que tu dors,
on dirait que t'as des membres en plus.
C'est comme dormir avec Ganesh.
- Tu veux les emboÓter ?
- Tu parles encore des lits ?
Viens ici.
Je prendrai son nom, je m'en fiche.
Attends et si on la partageait ?
Je la garde jusqu'ŗ 40 ans
et aprŤs elle est ŗ toi.
De qui se moque-t-on ?
Elle est avec Don, on doit s'y faire
- et avancer.
- T'as raison.
Je vais aller ŗ la...
Je vais ŗ la salle de bains
et je m'en vais.
C'est Bar-Nez.
Devine ? Je suis libre.
Attends, j'ai un autre appel.
C'est Teddy l'ourson.
Tu veux du miel ?
Ted, attends.
Je vais devoir te rappeler.
Ted est sur l'autre ligne,
je crois qu'il a des ennuis.
Ted t'appelle ?
Il va avoir des ennuis.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Tu as de jolis cheveux.
Voilŗ ce qu'il y a.
Et ce qu'ils ont...
C'est presque devenu incontrŰlable.
Clair.
Je vais y aller avant qu'on fasse
une chose qu'on regrettera.
Robin, je t'aime !
Sale enfoirť !
- Je t'ai ramenť le cor bleu !
- Je t'ai ramenť le cor bleu !
Ted ne fait que le tenir !
Dťsolť, c'est de bonne guerre.
Que faites-vous lŗ ?
On veut te rťcupťrer !
Pourquoi ne pas monter ?
TrŤs bien,
Don...
rťglons Áa, toi, moi et Ted.
Un trio.
Robin et moi devons aller au studio,
asseyez-vous, regardez la tťlť,
et on en parle en revenant.
T'abandonnes facilement.
Jeu, set et match !
Gagnť, gagnť, poulet grillť.
Oý est cette tťlť dont tu parlais ?
Juste lŗ.
- Merci.
- C'est moi.
Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit, papa.
C'ťtait bien.
Mais tu dois y aller.
Quoi ?
Dťsolť.
C'ťtait super et tu ťtais gťniale,
mais je me lŤve tŰt...
Tu me vires ?
Tu le savais.
Lily, attends.
Oublie pas ton sweat.
Bien essayť.
Teddy l'ourson ! Bar-Nez !
Papa ?
Debout les crťtins !
Vous vous souvenez d'hier soir ?
Ted ťtait trop bourrť.
GÍnant !
Je suis dťsolť.
On l'est tous les deux.
On ťtait bourrťs et dťbiles, mais...
on fera tout
pour qu'il s'intŤgre au groupe.
Il n'en fera pas partie.
Ni moi.
Au moins un moment.
Avec Don, c'est sťrieux,
je veux voir oý Áa nous mŤne.
Et je pourrais pas le faire
en continuant ŗ traÓner
avec mes ex tout le temps.
«a marchera pas.
J'emmťnage chez lui.
Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe
avec Robin ?
T'avais raison.
Elle ťtait en colŤre.
Elle n'a pas reparlť du dťmťnagement
en quatre jours.
On doit jamais redire
des choses pareilles.
D'accord.
En fait,
je vais mÍme ťcrire
une nouvelle lettre.
"Cher Barney du futur, "
"tu penses vouloir rťcupťrer Robin,
mais non.
"Laisse-la.
SincŤrement,
"Barney du passť. "
- Fais-moi voir.
- Donne-la-moi.
"Cette partie n'ťtait que pour Ted.
Il a marchť ? Bien.
"Va te remettre avec Robin,
"parle pas de ton plan ŗ Ted
car il fera tout rater. "
Et d'autres dessins de seins.
Pour ma dťfense...
- comment ils sont ?
- TrŤs bien.
<i>Kids, your aunt Robin
had only been dated Don a while.</i>
<i>When one evening, out of nowhere...</i>
Wanna move in?
It's kind of soon.
Sure,
I would consider moving in here.
Just let me think about it.
I meant, do you want to move in
on the couch so I can sit down?
That's what I meant, too.
Like I said,
just let me think about it.
I'm okay with that.
Now that you mentioned it,
wanna move in?
What did you say?
I'm considering it.
You're considering it?!
You barely know him.
Plus, the guy's a loser
with a dead-end job.
We have the same job, Barney.
And we couldn't be prouder of you.
- Well, this does seem kind of fast.
- Maybe you're right.
- I think you should.
- You do?
I see how happy you are,
and as much as I love you as a roommate,
I want you to do
what's right for you.
Are you trying to kick me out
because of the milk thing?
It's really annoying.
I have a system.
I put the empty carton in the fridge
to remind us to buy milk.
Why don't you leave a full carton
to remind us we don't have to buy milk?
As your ex,
before you jump into anything,
I need to meet him.
It's kind of weird
that I haven't met him yet.
Totally.
It's almost like someone
orchestrated it that way on purpose.
Fine. But you have to promise
to be on your best behavior.
I promise.
I'm banging
this Portuguese contortionist.
I swear, she is so flexible,
at one point, she was on top of me
and underneath me.
Up top and down low!
- Who needs?
- I'm good.
And that would be Barney.
He means well.
Actually, I'm not sure that's true.
He's awesome.
But I feel bad for any woman
with the kind of low self-esteem
who would actually date
a guy like that.
<i>That's when I realized Robin
never told Don she had dated Barney.</i>
I like you, Don.
We both love a good Scotch,
we both enjoy my compelling stories...
And we both dated Robin.
<i>Now he knew.</i>
You still hang out with your ex?
- I'm a little uncomfortable with that.
- Don't be.
It's like we never dated.
Long story short,
this exchange student's arms gave out,
and we both fell ass over sex swing.
I have not been able to find a girl
who can do that position since Robin.
How was your weekend away,
or any other topic?
Awful.
Twin beds?!
We can't sleep in separate beds.
We should go complain.
Yeah.
I'm gonna march down there
and demand another room.
I'll go with you in...
just a sec.
Housekeeping!
Could you come back later?
We're taking a little catnap.
It's time to check out.
- We slept for 18 hours.
- We missed four pre-paid meals.
I lost 11 pounds.
You think it's weird
Robin is still friends with him?
It's weird
we're all still friends with Barney.
I don't know how I feel about her
hanging out with one of her exes.
<i>That's when I realized
Robin had failed to tell Don</i>
<i>about another one of her exes.</i>
<i>Me.</i>
No, hanging out with one ex is fine.
Even two, I'd give a pass.
Two might be even better than one.
For some reason.
If you were dating someone
and he hung out with one of his exes...
I'm sorry.
- He?
- Yes. He was friends with his ex...
Wait. Hold on.
You think I'm gay?
Why would you assume that?
Your calligraphy teacher called.
- And?
- Your ink is in.
Just want to make sure
<i>Project Runway</i> is recording.
Did the Jets get new costumes?
Well, I guess we won't be having
<i>crčme brűlée</i> tonight.
My browning torch is broken.
When I heard your roommate was a guy,
I was a little jealous,
but now that I know he's gay,
I'm okay.
Ted's not...
We've still got homemade ladyfingers
and piping hot Darjeeling.
- Ted's not what?
- Ted's not gonna be around a lot.
He's following Cher on tour.
Don't get me wrong.
Cher puts on a hell of a show,
but I am not gay.
Be honest.
Is it weird that Robin hangs out
with one of her exes?
Ted and Robin broke up years ago.
It's a non-issue.
Ted and Robin?!
Not seeming so gay now, am I, Donny?
An appletini for the gentleman.
You dated Ted, too?
Of the four you consider your friends,
you've slept with 50% of them!
- Don, they're just my friends.
- But they're also your exes.
And you live with one of 'em.
I'm sorry.
I gotta think about all this.
<i>She's a thousand degrees!</i>
<i>It's like putting my leg
against a tailpipe.</i>
<i>His toenails are like daggers.</i>
<i>I'd love a sandwich.</i>
<i>But no eating in bed.</i>
<i>Stupid rule.</i>
<i>We have ants one time...</i>
<i>Great, and now he's falling asleep.</i>
<i>Cue the river of drool.</i>
<i>My knee itches.</i>
<i>Just one little scratch.</i>
- We should get separate beds.
- Yes! A mini-fridge!
- And separate beds.
- Deal!
I came to apologize to all of you.
I overreacted.
Well, we owe you an apology, too.
We said some pretty hurtful things.
- No, you didn't.
- That was after you left.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth
in the first place.
I acted like a total drama queen.
That's not offensive, right?
Still not gay.
You are clearly important to Robin,
so why don't we all have dinner
tomorrow night?
Great!
Looking forward to it.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
I must have Robin back.
You're kidding, right?
I don't know what it is,
but I want Robin back.
I know what it is.
You're like a little kid
who throws a toy away,
and wants it back the second
another kid plays with it.
Maybe I wasn't done playing with it!
Maybe I set it down
'cause I wanted to play
with some other stuff!
You're ready.
Ready for what?
To read the letter.
<i>Kids,
the letter was a device I'd invented</i>
<i>to remind myself
why I'd broken up with somebody.</i>
<i>I'd been doing it for years.</i>
<i>"Dear Future Ted:</i>
<i>"never get back with Karen
because she's a pretentious snob.</i>
<i>"Also, she cheated on you.</i>
<i>"I'm sorry
you had to find out this way.</i>
<i>"See, we're already
laughing about it."</i>
<i>"Dear Future Ted:</i>
<i>"stay away from Natalie.</i>
<i>"Or any girl
who can pin you to the ground</i>
<i>"and beat you senseless
in front of a crowd.</i>
<i>"P.S.:</i>
<i>"please consult a therapist
about why that turned you on."</i>
<i>"Dear Relationship Genius:</i>
<i>"Stella left you at the altar.</i>
<i>"You may never love again</i>
<i>"and will probably die alone."</i>
It doesn't look so sad
written in calligraphy.
<i>So when Barney and Robin
broke up the previous fall...</i>
Dating Robin was a huge mistake.
- Write that down.
- What?
Write yourself a letter.
That way, when you miss Robin...
and you will... you can remind yourself
why you broke up.
Gladly.
"Dear
"Future Barney... "
This ink is cool.
Right?
"You "
"and Robin... "
"Were a terrible couple.
"You just didn't work.
"Sure, you'll always love Robin,
but remember other women?
"More importantly,
remember other boobs?
"And all the cool stuff
you can do with boobs:
"Nuzzle, juggle,
"honka-honka.
"I guess
I'm just a hopeless romantic."
Then there's just a bunch
of drawings of boobs.
- You get it now?
- Yeah, I get it.
I definitely want her back.
I don't think human beings were
ever meant to sleep in the same bed.
Sex and sleep got all jumbled together,
but they're different things.
I know.
I love you, but I want this new bed
to be a sanctuary for sleep
and sleep alone.
Me, too.
And some light snacking, but that's it.
You know what we should get?
We should get a third bed
just for sex.
Yes.
A sex bed.
A dirty, dirty sex bed.
It's genius! That way, each bed
would have a specific purpose.
Exactly.
We'll have two sleep beds,
a sex bed,
and I'm thinking a beanbag chair
just for special birthday stuff.
Baby, did we just revolutionize
modern marriage?
Damn straight.
I hope you like sushi.
How cool is it that Don makes sushi?
He learned while on assignment in Japan.
Ring worm-ilicious.
Be nice. You only want her
'cause you can't have her.
If I said you can sit anywhere
in this room except that chair.
- Are you so petty that you...
- My chair!
Spicy tuna
with jalapeno?
My favorite.
Mine, too. I love spicy food.
The hotter the better.
I love spicy stuff, too,
probably more than you do.
Check it.
Don't.
Super-mild.
I'm not feeling it!
Lily, you won't believe it.
It's the craziest thing.
Don has twin beds, too.
My God! We just got twin beds.
Great, great.
That great didn't sound so great.
My ex-wife and I thought they'd be good,
but we started to drift apart.
Yeah, but I bet you didn't have
another bed just for sex.
No, but she did,
at her personal trainer's house.
This chili is like
an ice cube in my mouth.
I will say this. I'm going to get a
king-size bed
if Robin decides to move in.
I'd like that...
if I move in.
If you move in.
Tokyo Don,
you ever do this back in Japan?
- Wasabi!
- Barney, don't.
Awesome!
- Get him some milk.
- Spit it out, Barney.
We're out of milk,
but thanks for the reminder, Robin.
That's sweet.
I hope you're happy.
I stand by what I did.
It was bold and romantic.
You soiled yourself from both ends
of your body.
You have done tons of stupid stuff
to impress Robin.
Yeah, I did, but I don't anymore,
'cause I'm over her, just like you are.
You are not over her.
You want her back
just as much as I do.
You just won't let yourself go there.
That is ridiculous.
And I'll tell you why.
"For my biographer"
Just, focus on the letter, okay?
"Dear Ted... "
"Robin is the perfect girl for you,
"but she doesn't want
a serious relationship.
"You need someone
who wants to settle down,
"so until Robin's ready
for that next step,
"she's not your girl
"Still, I'll always remember stealing
her the blue French horn,
"our first kiss,
the look in her eye when she told me
"she loved me... "
Damn it.
Now I want her back.
<i>So, that night, your Uncle Barney
and I sat down to have a calm,</i>
<i>rational discussion about
who deserved Robin more.</i>
I stole her a blue French horn!
I dated her for a year. I wanted
her to be the mother of my children
and spend eternity in her arms!
I want to have sex with her
at least one more time!
She is mine!
She's not yours,
and she's not mine, either.
She's Don's.
You're right.
We gotta get rid of that guy.
Figuratively.
Of course.
Or...
literally.
My God, Ted, this is how it starts!
This is how it starts.
I'm scared, Teddy.
Two guys talking.
It's just two guys talking.
I'm worried.
I don't want to get divorced.
That's Don.
That's not us.
Our new sleeping arrangement
is going to bring us closer together.
Now get out of my bed.
Can we at least push 'em together?
Sure!
You meant the beds.
No, I don't want to do that.
Why not?
I love you more than life itself,
but you're a million degrees.
Honestly, I'm surprised your hourly pee
breaks aren't just steam.
You're no picnic in bed, either.
Except for the food and the ants.
But,
I still want to be next to you.
Why? So you can kick me
and slap me all night?
I swear, the second you fall asleep,
it's like you grow extra limbs.
It's like spooning
with the Hindu deity Ganesh.
- Want to push 'em together?
- You still talking about the beds?
Get over here.
I'll take her name.
I don't care.
Wait. How about this?
We share her.
I'll take her until she's 40,
and then you can have her after that.
Who are we kidding? She's with Don now.
We just have to accept that
- and move on.
- You're right.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go to the buh...
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,
and then I'll skedaddle.
It's Barn Door.
Guess what?
I'm open.
Barn Door, hang on.
I'm getting another call.
It's Teddy Bear.
Need a little honey?
Ted, hang on.
Barney,
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Ted's on the other line,
and, I think he's in trouble.
Ted's calling you?
He's in trouble, all right.
Ted, what's up?
You have pretty hair.
That's what's up.
And down. Your back.
We almost let that
get out of control.
Agreed.
I'm gonna get out of here
before we do something we regret.
Robin, I love you!
You son of a bitch!
- I brought you the blue French horn!
- I brought you the blue French horn!
Ted's just holding it for me!
Sorry, buddy. All's fair.
Guys, what are you doing?
We're here to win you back!
Why don't you come upstairs?
All right,
Don...
let's settle this...
you,
me and Ted.
A three-way.
Robin and I have to go do our show,
so why don't you have
a seat on the couch,
watch some television,
and we'll talk when we get back,
okay?
You give up easy.
Game, set, match!
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
Where's this TV
you've been bragging about?
Right here.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Good night.
Night-night, Papa.
- That was nice.
- Yeah.
Welps, you gots to go.
What?
I'm sorry.
That was a blast, and you're great,
but I have to be up early, so...
You're just kicking me out?
You knew what this was.
Lily, wait.
Don't forget your sweatshirt.
Nice try.
Teddy Bear! Barn Door!
Papa?
Rise and shine, jackasses!
Do you remember anything
from last night?
Boy, was Ted drunk.
Embarrassing!
I'm really sorry.
We both are.
We were drunk and stupid, but,
we're gonna do anything we can to make
sure that Don feels a part of the group.
He's not going to be
a part of the group.
And neither am I.
At least for a while.
This thing with Don is real,
and I want to see where it goes.
And I'll never be able to do that
if I keep hanging out
with my ex-boyfriends all the time.
It just won't work.
I'm moving in with Don.
So, what's going on with Robin?
You were right.
She was just mad.
It's been four days, she hasn't said
another word about moving out, but.
We can never pull crap like that
ever again.
Agreed.
In fact,
I even wrote myself another letter.
"Dear Future Barney, "
"You think you want Robin back again,
but you really don't.
"Let her go.
Sincerely,
past Barney. "
- Let me see that.
- Give it to me.
"That top part was just for Ted.
Did he buy it? Good.
"Get back together "with Robin,
don't mention your plan to Ted 'cause
he'll just screw it up again. "
"And then there's more drawings
of boobs."
In my defense...
- how great are boobs?
- They're pretty great.
Devinez ce que j'ai dans le dos.
Attends, je sais. La gauche.
Ce n'est pas ce jeu, mais c'est ça.
Cinq places au premier rang
pour <i>Robots vs. Catcheurs</i>.
- <i>Robots vs. Catcheurs ?</i>
- C'est génial !
- Vous savez ce que c'est ?
- Non.
Mais on pense que c'est un combat
entre robots et catcheurs.
Tout à fait,
selon le site internet !
Attends un moment.
Pourquoi cinq places ?
Elle a emménagé avec Don
et veut plus traîner avec nous,
mais c'est <i>Robots vs. Catcheurs</i>.
Barney a raison.
Elle peut pas dire non.
Non. J'aurais aimé,
mais j'ai un truc avec Don samedi.
Il fait du chinois.
J'espère que tu parles de bouffe,
sinon j'ai des questions à te poser.
Désolée, mais je dois donner
une chance à notre histoire.
Et c'est pas facile
si je sors avec vous chaque soir.
Surtout quand "vous"
inclut deux de mes ex.
Je comprends. T'as raison.
C'est juste que tu nous manques.
Vous me manquez aussi.
Je dois y aller. On s'appelle ?
Pardon, New York, je devais répondre.
Où en étions-nous ?
Ah oui, l'accident de bus.
Elle a dit non ?
Comment a-t-elle pu ?
<i>Robots vs. Catcheurs</i>
est notre plus importante tradition.
Tradition ?
On l'a encore jamais fait.
C'est <i>Robots vs. Catcheurs</i>.
Comment ne pas en faire une tradition ?
Ça commence comme ça.
Robin va vivre avec Don,
puis Marshall et Lily ont un gosse,
- et Ted...
- Se marie ?
J'allais dire "est retrouvé mort
chez lui, bouffé par ses chats",
mais l'un ou l'autre, ça craint.
Tout le monde m'abandonne,
et j'aime pas ça.
T'as pas à t'inquiéter
pour Marshall et moi.
On est à mille lieues de faire ça.
Oui, mais plus à 500 lieues.
- Un peu plus.
- Mais on s'en approche.
En même temps, c'est loin.
- Tu as vu les panneaux de sortie ?
- Non, aucun.
Alors mets-toi sur la bonne voie.
Je vois ce que tu veux dire.
L'amitié, c'est important.
Emerson a même écrit
un super poème intitulé "Amitié".
Vous allez adorer.
"Une goutte de sang vermeil virile,
La mer houleuse l'emporte..."
<i>C'était toujours comme ça,</i>
<i>dès que je voulais être spirituel.</i>
Les gars,
vous devez goûter ce Syrah.
Des pointes de crème de cassis,
de fruits rouges,
un goût boisé.
En sept lettres, baryton normal.
Mais oui. Baryton lyrique.
Qui est en fait plus aigu
qu'un baryton-basse.
À un moment,
dans le second acte de <i>La Bohème</i>...
J'essaie juste d'élever
le niveau de nos discussions.
C'est comme dans <i>L'enfer de Dante</i>.
"Pensez à ce que vous êtes, point n'avez
été faits pour vivre comme des brutes,
"mais pour rechercher la vertu
et la connaissance."
Ou...
dans la langue d'origine...

Vous avez raison.
Je me suis emporté à propos de Robin.
C'est une invitation de mariage ?
Robin va épouser Don.
Je mourrai seul.
Ted sera bouffé par ses chats.
C'est pour Marissa Heller.
Marissa Heller ? Sexy, comme nom.
Décris-la-moi.
Commence par les seins.
<i>Qui était Marissa Heller ?</i>
<i>Le mystère débuta
quand on a emménagé avec Marshall.</i>
On a du courrier !
On est connus.
On a un magazine de golf pour...
On a un catalogue
de meubles en osier, aussi pour elle,
et une réduction
dans un magasin pour oiseaux...
adressé à Marissa Heller,
ou, tiens-toi bien,
au "locataire actuel". C'est nous !
- On a du courrier !
- Fantastique.
Ça doit être
la locataire précédente.
Je me demande comment elle était.
<i>Et du coup,
on commença à se l'imaginer :</i>
<i>la vie de Marissa Heller,
la golfeuse,</i>
<i>Marissa Heller,
qui achetait des meubles en osier,</i>
<i>Marissa Heller, et son oiseau.</i>
Et depuis, à chaque courrier reçu,
on en apprend plus.
On ne sait juste pas
à quoi elle ressemble.
Je vais faire suivre ça,
comme j'ai...
- Ouvre-la.
- D'accord.
C'est une invitation à la soirée
de Jefferson Van Smoot, ce samedi...
Dans le penthouse de l'Alberta !
C'est le plus bel immeuble
de Manhattan !
On doit y aller.
Ça dépend.
Est-ce que ça parle de combat
entre robots et catcheurs,
sur cette invitation ?
Non, mais c'est open-bar.
Changement de plan
pour samedi soir :
Fête de Marissa Heller, pour l'open-bar,
puis <i>Robots vs. Catcheurs</i>.
Faut que quelqu'un
se fasse passer pour Marissa Heller.
Je suis flatté,
mais Lily devrait le faire.
<i>Et le grand soir arriva.</i>
<i>Notre premier arrêt...</i>
<i>L'Alberta building.</i>
Cet édifice est incroyable !
Vous avez vu la porte cochère
et les arches en terre cuite ?
Un SMS de Robin qui dit...
Venez par là.
Tu peux le faire, Lily,
tu n'as qu'à regarder ce type,
lui dire que tu es Marissa Heller,
et c'est gagné.
Et que ce soit clair, pas d'accent.
Sommes-nous sûrs
qu'elle ne soit pas Anglaise ?
Très bien, j'y vais !
Désolé.
Après vous.
Je viens pour la soirée Van Smoot.
Je suis Marissa Heller.
Chiotte.
Alors voilà Marissa Heller.
Classe !
Elle a de jolies dents.
Elle doit se souvenir d'aller
chez le dentiste sans ses pense-bêtes.
Alors, que fait-on ?
Je nous fais rentrer,
voilà ce qu'on fait !
On s'est vus à cette réunion...
sur les oiseaux.
Je ne crois pas.
- D'accro à l'osier ?
- Non.
Je suis grillé.
Ça va pas être possible.
Je m'en occupe.
Vous savez que l'ascenseur
a le même mécanisme
depuis sa première installation
en 1906 ?
La rumeur dit
que Louis Lamar Skolnick,
l'architecte de ce lieu,
a gravé ces panneaux.
Un fan de Skolnick ?
J'adore la juxtaposition
entre l'extérieur
en renaissance allemande...
Et l'influence française à l'intérieur !
Je sais !
C'était un architecte
avec une âme de poète.
Non, ça marche.
Je dois vous faire un aveu.
On est pas invités,
mais j'ai toujours voulu voir
l'intérieur de l'Alberta.
C'est par là.
On est tous ensemble.
Je vous l'avais dit.
Alors...
Quelqu'un a regardé
<i>Les feux de l'amour</i> ?
Génial ! Qui est abonné
à Soap Opéra Magazine ?
Marissa Heller, j'aime ton style.
Personne ?
Dois-je comprendre qu'il n'y a pas
un seul fan de soap opéra
dans cet ascenseur ?
Je n'ai pas de télé.
Les seuls opéras que je vois
sont au MET.
Preums.
Excusez-moi.
Jefferson, chéri.
Je ne suis pas habillé pour ça.
Un mot inventé :
"crétins-pocalypse"
Les gars...
C'est Peter Bogdanovich
discutant avec Arianna Huffington
et Will Shortz,
l'éditeur des mots croisés
du New York Times !
Laissons une chance à cette soirée.
C'est open-bar.
20 minutes et on s'en va.
Mais, vous voyez,
la musique changeait,
et Giovanni Artusi ne comprenait pas
le nouveau style de composition.
Excusez-moi,
parlez-vous de Monteverdi
et son <i>Livre IV des madrigaux</i> ?
Quoi d'autre, mon cher ami ?
De tous, c'est mon préféré !
Foie gras fumé
et son caramel de mangue
à la crème fraîche ?
Vous auriez un truc
dans le genre mini cheeseburger ?
Je ne pense pas, monsieur.
Des mini pizzas ?
Des petites frites ?
N'importe quoi
qui me ferait me sentir mieux.
Je vérifierai, monsieur.
Il va pas le faire.
J'opère l'ambassadeur hollandais
à coeur ouvert demain matin.
J'espère qu'il survivra.
Vraiment ?
Un collègue vient justement
de lui prescrire un anticoagulant.
Et elle ne peut pas être
sous anticoagulant
si elle doit se faire opérer.
Je...
Vous savez qui a publié
un article génial
sur Walt Whitman et la sémantique ?
Le professeur Hammersmith, d'Oxford.
Je suis le professeur Hammersmith.
C'est ce que Truffaut
décrivait en 1954
dans les <i>Cahiers Du Cinéma.</i>
"La vie est faite de morceaux
qui ne se rejoignent pas."
Les films...
Oui ?
Les acteurs.
Willem Dafoe.
Le nom Willem Dafoe
ressemble un peu...
au son d'une grenouille...
parlant à un perroquet.
En tant que sous-secrétaire
du Trésor,
j'ai soigneusement ficelé cette loi.
Là...
m'accompagneriez-vous
dans la salle des cartes
pour stimuler mon portefeuille ?
Désolée,
vous êtes trop vieux à mon goût.
Zsa Zsa Gabor reste très sexy,
mais à part ça,
la soirée craint.
On aura essayé.
Ça fait 20 minutes.
On s'en va.
Où est Ted ?
Je sais comment faire.
Les gongs.
Plus bruyants qu'on croit.
Jeune homme,
ce gong est une relique de 500 ans
qui n'a plus été sonnée
depuis W.S. Gilbert
pour la première à Londres
de Mikado en 1885.
Une relique de 500 ans qui n'a plus

L'éditeur des mots croisés du<i> Times.</i>
Je t'ai toujours dit qu'ils utilisent
Ulee de <i>L'or de la vie</i>
à cause des voyelles.
Dis-leur, Will.
C'est à cause des voyelles.
Je peux te parler ?
Dix lettres,
diminutif de tarte à l'oeuf ?
- Mini-quiche ? Où ?
- Par là.
Quelle soirée !
Ouais. C'est l'heure d'y aller.
L'heure des robots contre les catcheurs.
Vous voilà.
Il y a une dégustation en aveugle
de blancs français.
Ce serait génialissime.
Vous pouvez décanter sur moi.
Je sais.
On ne décante pas le vin blanc.
Miss Lily, dans le living room,
avec le chandelier.
Grands dieux, non !
- Il était à Edgar Allan Poe !
- Désolée !
Je m'amuse bien ici, je vais annuler
<i>Robots contre catcheurs.</i>
Mais tu n'as jamais raté
<i>Robots contre catcheurs !</i>
Ted, c'est impossible.
D'abord Robin nous largue,
ensuite toi ?
Et pour ces culs serrés
prétentieux ?
En fait,
j'aime bien les culs serrés prétentieux.
Ils font pas de bruit de pet
quand je parle.
Je vais rester.
On se voit demain.
- C'est qu'une soirée.
- Ça ne signifie rien.
Ça veut tout dire.
Ted, si tu ne viens pas
à <i>Robots contre catcheurs,</i>
c'est la fin de notre amitié.
Je vous vois demain.
Bien.
Tu es banni du gang à jamais.
Tu pourras repostuler dans deux ans.
En route
pour <i>Robots contre catcheurs.</i>
C'est gênant.
J'ai oublié un truc.
Alors Ted,
où sont donc partis vos potes ?
Vous savez.
Lecture de poésie.
La meilleure tradition au monde !
Ne m'énerve pas.
On doit l'admettre.
Le gang n'est plus.
Ted est parti. Robin aussi.
On devrait nous aussi se séparer.
Barney,
arrête avec ta fixation sur l'abandon.
Ted a le droit d'avoir une vie
hors du groupe, comme nous tous.
Attends.
Pourquoi en parles-tu soudainement ?
Mon Dieu, t'es enceinte !
Mon Dieu,
vous avez déjà eu le bébé !
Il est juste derrière moi, non ?
Non, gros bêta.
C'est que,
on ira peut-être de l'avant.
Ça s'appelle grandir.
<i>C'est tout ce que t'as, morue ?</i>
Tu peux au moins
attendre un an avant d'être enceinte ?
- Je peux pas le promettre.
- Ah non ?
Ah non ?
Citron et arômes de miel,
avec une acidité croquante.
Sauvignon blanc, vallée de la Loire.
Ville de Sancerre.
Encore exact !
<i>Bravo</i>, mon garçon !
Pas un gosse !
Vous voulez pas d'un enfant
dans ce monde de fou.
Le monde m'a l'air
plutôt génial en ce moment.
Lily, tu me laisses pas le choix.
Si tu as une fille,
le jour, non,
la minute où elle devient majeure...
Des bébés.
J'espère que Ted est ridicule
en ce moment.
<i>Constance Fry,</i>
<i>Constance Fry</i>
<i>Chaque fois que tu nous sonnes</i>
<i>Constance accomplira tes besoins</i>
<i>En hiver, au printemps</i>
<i>Ou en automne.</i>
Votre baryton est impressionnant.
Merci, Will Shortz.
Vous pouvez avoir un bébé,
mais seulement à ces conditions :
Un : Vous devez me promettre
de m'aimer plus que le bébé.
Deux :
Une fois par mois,
je draguerai avec.
Trois :
il se peut qu'il tombe du 2e étage
et que je le rattrape héroïquement.
Quatre :
Pas de tétée devant moi.
Cinq : Oublie le quatre.
Tu les sors quand tu veux.
<i>Et là, un truc incroyable arriva.</i>
Nom de Dieu !
Je le crois pas.
L'enfer est un concept intéressant,
n'est-ce pas ?
J'ai toujours aimé l'imaginer
comme le fit Dante
dans <i>La Divine Comédie</i>.
Si vous permettez.
En Italien.
<i>Je n'y crois pas.</i>
<i>Je récite</i> La Divine Comédie</i>
<i>en Italien,
et personne ne fait de bruits de pet !</i>
<i>C'est louche,
je suis jamais allé si loin.</i>
<i>En fait, j'ai l'air d'un crétin.</i>
<i>Je suis inarrêtable !</i>
<i>Écoutez-moi, je suis déchaîné.</i>
<i>Je suis un gros crétin.</i>
<i>Que quelqu'un m'arrête !</i>
<i>Et là, quelqu'un le fit.</i>
<i>Les enfants,
je vous avais déjà parlé</i>
<i>de nos doubles, dans la ville.</i>
<i>Il y avait la Robin lesbienne.</i>
<i>Marshall moustachu.</i>
<i>Et bien sûr, Lily la stripteaseuse.</i>
<i>Ce soir-là,</i>
<i>un autre double apparut...</i>
<i>Ted le catcheur mexicain.</i>
Je dois y aller.
Règle 83 :
Si quelque chose sort du bébé
pour atterrir sur un de mes costumes,
j'ai le droit de la tripoter.
Qu'est-ce que t'as
avec les seins de ma femme ?
Je fais pas les règles.
Bébé, tu y penses sérieusement ?
Je sais pas.
Peut-être un peu.
Je pense que nous sommes prêts.
On s'aime,
on est financièrement stables
et je pense pas
que ça changera notre style de vie.
<i>Tante Lily aime se rappeler
qu'oncle Marshall a dit ça un jour.</i>
Si on était à la maison avec un bébé,
on aurait jamais vu le double de Ted.
Ça t'aurait fait quoi de rater ça ?
J'en voudrais à cet enfant
pour le reste de sa vie.
C'est ça, pour le reste de sa vie.
Tu as raison.
Pas de précipitation.
Que dis-tu de ça ?
On est d'accord,
pas question d'avoir un bébé
avant d'avoir vu les cinq doubles ?
Bien sûr, c'est logique.
Donc, quand on verra
le double de Barney,
ce sera l'univers qui nous dira
que c'est le moment.
Et alors on essayera.
Ça marche ?
Ça marche.
Tiens, tiens,
regardez qui pense
pouvoir s'incruster
et refaire partie du gang.
- Tu peux toujours courir.
- Écoute, Barney...
S'il te plaît, reviens !
Je veux perdre personne d'autre !
On est désolés.
On te laissera réciter
tous tes poèmes nuls
et on ne dira jamais de mal, promis.
Vraiment ?
Parce qu'il y en a un
que j'aimerais réciter.
"Amitié" de Ralph Waldo Emerson.
"Une goutte de sang vermeil virile
"La mer houleuse l'emporte,
"Le monde incertain va et vient...
Désolé, c'était obligé.
Un autre verre ?
<i>Les enfants, j'aimerais vous dire
qu'au fil des ans, on s'est pas éloignés</i>
<i>à un moment ou un autre.
On ne le cherche pas forcément,</i>
<i>mais ça arrive.</i>
<i>Mais à ce jour,
peu importe ce qui arrive,</i>
<i>qu'il pleuve ou qu'il vente,</i>
<i>on se retrouve chaque année
pour les robots contre les catcheurs.</i>
Bonne nuit, merci.
J'ai passé une super soirée !
Guess what I've got behind my back.
Wait, wait, wait,
I got this one. Left.
Wrong game. But correct.
Five front-row tickets
to <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>.
- <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers?</i>
- That is awesome!
- You've heard of <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>?
- Never.
We assume it's a sort of sporting event
that pits robots against wrestlers!
That's exactly what it is,
according to the Web site!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who's the fifth ticket for?
I know,
she moved in with her boyfriend
and said she doesn't want
to hang out with us,
But this is <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>.
Barney is right.
It's impossible to say no to that.
No to that. I wish I could, but
I have plans with Don on Saturday.
He's making me Chinese.
I'll assume you're talking about food,
Otherwise I've some follow-up questions.
I'm sorry, but I got to give this thing
with Don a chance.
I can't do that if I'm out drinking
with you guys every single night.
Especially when "you guys"
includes two of my ex-boyfriends.
I understand.
You're right.
It's just we all really miss you.
I miss you, too.
Listen, I got to go.
Talk soon?
Sorry, New York, I had to take that.
Now, where were we?
Yeah. Yes. Bus crash.
She said no?
How could she say no?
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i> is
our most important tradition as a group.
Tradition?
We've never done this before?
It's <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>, Lily.
How is that not gonna be a tradition?
This is how it starts.
First Robin moves in with Don,
then Marshall and Lily have a baby,
- Then Ted...
- Gets married?
I was gonna say, "is found alone
in his apartment devoured by his cats,"
but either way, not pretty.
Everyone's leaving me,
and I don't like it!
Barney, you don't have to worry
about Marshall and me having kids.
That's a long way down the road.
Exactly, it's down the road,
a medium way.
- A medium-long way.
- I mean, you can see it ahead.
In the vast, vast distance.
- But you're seeing exit signs for it.
- Really? I didn't see any.
You might want to get
in the right lane.
I understand how you feel.
Friendships are important.
In fact, Emerson wrote
a great poem entitled "friendship."
You are gonna love this.
"A ruddy drop of manly blood,
the surging sea outweighs..."
<i>That's how it had
always been for me with the gang.</i>
<i>Any time I tried to get
a little high-minded.</i>
You guys,
you've got to try this Syrah.
Hints of creme de cassis,
red berries,
toasty oak...
Five letters, blank baritone.
Of course! Lyric baritone!
Which is actually higher
than a dramatic baritone.
You know, there's a telling moment
in the second act of <i>la Boheme</i>...
Guys, come on, I'm just trying to add
a little class to these proceedings.
It's like that line
From <i>Dante's inferno</i>.
"Consider your origins:
you were not born to live like brutes."
"But to follow virtue
and knowledge""
Or...
In the original Italian...

You are right. I'm totally overreacting
to this whole Robin thing.
What's that?
Is this a wedding invitation?
Robin's marrying Don.
I'm gonna die alone!
Ted's gonna get eaten by cats!
Relax, it's for Marissa Heller.
Marissa Heller?
She sounds hot.
Face, boobs, describe.
Start with boobs.
<i>Who was Marissa Heller?</i>
<i>That mystery began
when Marshall and I first moved in.</i>
We got our first mail delivery!
We are popular.
We've got a golf magazine for...
We've got a wicker
furniture catalog, also for her,
And... a coupon for a bird store...
addressed to Marissa Heller or
stay with me...
"Current occupant." That's us!
- We've got mail!
- Fantastic!
She must be the woman
who lived here before us.
I wonder what she was like.
<i>And just like that,
a picture began to take shape...</i>
<i>a picture of Marissa Heller,
the golfer...</i>
<i>... Marissa Heller,
the wicker catalog shopper...</i>
<i>Marissa Heller, the bird owner.</i>
And since then, with each
piece of mail we've gotten,
the picture's become
a little clearer.
The only thing we don't know
is what she looks like.
I guess I'll forward this along
like I've been forwarding...
- Just open it.
- Okay.
It's an invitation
to Jefferson Van Smoot's
annual spring social
this Saturday night...
In the penthouse apartment
of the Alberta!
You guys... That's the most
beautiful building in Manhattan!
We got to go to this party.
That depends, does it say
anything on that invitation
about robots battling wrestlers
for intergalactic supremacy?
No, but it says open bar.
Revised agenda for Saturday night:
free booze at Marissa Heller's party,
then <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>.
One of us just needs to pretend
to be Marissa Heller.
Guys, I'm flattered,
but I think Lily should do it.
<i>So the big night arrived.</i>
<i>Our first stop...</i>
<i>The Alberta building.</i>
This building is amazing!
Did you guys see the Porte Cochere
and the Terra-cotta pandrels outside?
I just got a text from Robin.
It says...
Okay, guys, huddle up.
Now, Lil, you can do this,
all you have to do
is look that guy in the eye,
say your name is Marissa Heller,
and we are golden. And again,
just so we're clear, no accent.
Are we sure
she's not British, isn't it?
All right! Here I go.
Sorry.
Go ahead.
I'm here for the Van Smoot party.
My name is Marissa Heller.
Bollocks.
So that's Marissa Heller.
<i>She fine.</i>
Her teeth look really nice.
She must be remembering
to go to the dentist even without those
reminder postcards.
So, what are we doing?
I'm getting us into
the party, that's what!
We met at that gathering for...
bird owners.
I don't think so.
- Wicker lovers?
- No.
Stinson out.
Guys, it's not gonna happen.
I got this.
You know, this elevator
still uses the same mechanism
from when it was first
installed in 1906.
Rumor is,
Louis Lamar Skolnick, the architect who
designed this building,
carved these panels himself.
A Skolnick fan?
I love his juxtaposition between
the north German
renaissance exterior...
And the decidedly French
influence on the inside! I know!
He was an architect
with the soul of a poet, really.
No, no, no, don't, don't.
It's working.
I've a confession to make.
We're not on the guest list,
but... I've always wanted to see
the inside of the Alberta.
Well, then right this way.
We're all together.
Told you I'd get us in.
So...
Anyone been watching
<i>the young and the restless</i>?
Awesome! Who ordered
soap opera illustrated?
Marissa Heller, I like your style.
Anyone?
Am I to understand that there isn't
a single soap opera fan
in this entire elevator?
I don't own a TV.
The only operas I watch
are at the met.
Dibs.
Excuse me.
Jefferson, darling.
I am not dressed for this.
One word, made up:
"douche-pocalypse""
Guys...
That's Peter Bogdanovich
Talking to Arianna Huffington
and Will Shortz,
editor of the New
York times crossword!
Let's give this party a chance.
There's free food, free booze.
20 minutes, then we can leave.
But, you see, music was changing,
and Giovanni Artusi
simply didn't understand
the new style of composing.
Excuse me, are you
talking about Monteverdi
and his fourth book of madrigals?
My dear chap, what else?
That's my favorite
book of madrigals!
Smoked Foie gras
with caramelized mango
and crčme fraiche?
Do you have anything in the
mini cheeseburger department?
I don't think so, sir.
Mini pizzas?
Little cups of fries?
Any food at all
that'll make me feel like a giant?
I'll check, sir.
He's not gonna check.
I'm performing open-heart surgery
on the Dutch ambassador in the morning.
I hope he pulls through.
Really?
A colleague of mine
just prescribed cumadin to him.
And there's no way
she'd be on anticoagulants
If she were about
to undergo surgery.
Just...
You know who published
a great article
on Walt Whitman
and the politics of semantics?
Professor Hammersmith of Oxford.
I am Professor Hammersmith.
Which is exactly what Truffaut
was talking about
In his 1954 article
in <i>Cahiers Du Cinéma.</i>
Film is an auteur's medium
full stop.
Movies...
Right?
Actors.
Willem Dafoe.
Funny thing about Willem Dafoe,
his name
kind of sounds like a frog...
Talking to a parrot.
Willem.
Defoe!
As undersecretary of the treasury,
I had a big hand in crafting
that legislation.
Now...
I wonder If you'd like to join me
in the map room
and give my package some stimulus.
I'm afraid not, darling.
You are too old for my taste.
Zsa Zsa Gabor is still looking
pretty hot, but otherwise,
this party sucks.
Yeah, we gave it a chance.
It's been 20 minutes.
Let's get out of here. Where's Ted?
I know how to find him.
Gongs, right?
Louder than you think.
Young man,
that gong is a 500-year-old relic
that hasn't been struck
since W.S. Gilbert hit it
at the London premiere
of the Mikado in 1885.
Wife is a 500 year relic that hasn't
been struck since W.S. Gilbert hit it
at the London premiere
of the Mikado in 1885.
Will Schorz, editor
of the<i> Times' crossword.</i>
You know how I've been saying
they always use ulee from Ulee's gold
because of the vowels?
Tell 'em, will.
It's because of the vowels.
Ted, can I talk to you?
Ten-letter-word
for diminutive egg-based torte?
Mini-quiche?
Where?
Right there.
Such a great party.
Such a Great party!
Yeah, totally, Ted. It's time to go.
It's Robots vs. Wrestlers o'clock.
There you are.
We'll be blind taste-testing
French whites in a bit.
Should be a hoot and a half.
Well, I decan't miss that.
I know. You don't have to say it.
You don't decant white wine.
Miss Lily in the living room
with the candlestick.
My heavens, no!
- That was Edgar Allan Poe's!
- Sorry!
I'm having fun here, so I think
I'm gonna skip<i> Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>
But Ted, you've never missed
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers!</i>
Ted, this isn't happening.
First Robin ditches us, and now you?
And for these stuffy,
pretentious snoots?
Actually, I kind of like these stuffy,
pretentious snoots.
They don't make fart noises
when I open my mouth.
I'm going to stay.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Come on. It's just one night.
- It doesn't mean anything.
It means everything.
Ted, if you don't come
to <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers,</i>
it's the end of our friendship.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Fine.
Then you are out
of our gang forever.
You can reapply in two years.
Let's go watch
<i>Wrestlers fight robots.</i>
So embarrassing.
I forgot something.
So Ted, where did those chums
of yours scoot off to?
You know.
Poetry reading.
Best tradition ever!
Don't humor me, Marshall.
Let's face it.
The gang is over.
Ted's gone. Robin's gone. We might
as well just go our separate ways.
Barney, enough
with a abandonment issues.
Ted's allowed to have a life
outside of the group. We all are.
Wait a minute.
Why are you saying
that all of a sudden?
God, you're pregnant!
God, you already had the baby!
It's right behind me, isn't it?
No, you idiot.
It's just,
eventually, we're all gonna move on.
It's called growing up.
<i>Is that all you got, bitch?</i>
Can you at least promise me that
you won't get pregnant for another year?
- I can't make that promise.
- You can't?
You can't?
Citrus
and honeycomb flavors
with crisp acidity.
It's a Sauv blanc, Loire valley.
Town of Sancerre.
Correct again!
Bravo, boy!
You can't have kids!
You don't want to bring a child
into this crazy, messed-up world.
I don't know. The world
seems pretty awesome right now.
Lily, you leave me no choice.
If you have a daughter,
the day, nay,
the minute she turns 18...
Babies.
I hope Ted is miserable right now.
<i>Constance fry,</i>
<i>Constance fry</i>
<i>Anytime you'd call</i>
<i>Constance would fulfill your needs</i>
<i>Winter, spring</i>
<i>Or fall</i>
Ted, your lyric baritone
is outstanding.
Thank you, Will Shortz.
Fine, you guys can have a baby,
One: You promise to always love me
more than the baby
Two:
Once a month,
I get to use the baby to pick up chick.
Three:
that may involve
the baby falling from a two-story window
and me heroically catching it.
Four:
No breastfeeding in front of me.
Five: Forget about four.
You can whip them out whenever you want.
<i>And then,
something amazing happened.</i>
Holy crap!
I don't believe it.
Of course, hell
is an interesting concept, isn't it?
I've always loved to imagine it
as Dante did in the divine comedy.
If you'll allow me.
In the original Italian.
<i>I cannot believe this.</i>
<i>I'm reciting the divine comedy</i>
<i>In its original Italian,
and nobody's making fart noises!</i>
<i>This is weird.
Never gotten this far.</i>
<i>I actually sound kind of douchey.</i>
<i>My God, I'm out of control!</i>
<i>Listen to me.
I'm completely unleashed.</i>
<i>I'm the biggest douche
on the planet.</i>
<i>I wish somebody would stop me.</i>
<i>And then, somebody did.</i>
<i>Kids, I think I told you
how earlier that year,</i>
<i>we had seen some doppelgangers
of ourselves around town.</i>
<i>There was lesbian Robin.</i>
<i>There was moustache Marshall.</i>
<i>And, of course, stripper Lily.</i>
<i>That night,</i>
<i>One more doppelganger surfaced...</i>
<i>Mexican wrestler Ted.</i>
<i>Soy el conquistador de las máquinas!</i>
I got to go.
Rule number 83.
If anything that comes out of that baby
gets on one of my suits,
I get to touch Lily's boobs.
What is it with you
and my wife's boobs tonight?
I don't make the rules.
Baby, are you really starting
to think about this?
I don't know.
Maybe a little.
For whatever it's worth,
I think that we're ready.
We love each other,
we're financially stable,
and honestly, I don't think It would
change our lifestyle all that much.
<i>Aunt Lily still likes to remind
uncle Marshall he once said this.</i>
If we were at home
with a baby tonight,
we never would have seen
Ted's doppelganger.
Imagine missing that.
How would that feel?
I would blame that child
for the rest of his life.
Exactly.
For the rest of her life.
You're right.
There's, there's no hurry.
How about this?
We agree there's no sense
in having a baby
until we've seen all five doppelgangers,
right?
Of course. Stands to reason.
So when we finally see
Barney's doppelganger,
that's the universe telling us
it's go time.
And that's when we'll start trying.
Deal?
Deal.
Well, well,
look who thinks
he can just waltz in here
and be part of the gang again.
- Well, you can forget it.
- Listen, Barney, I...
Please be part of the gang again!
I don't want to lose anyone else!
We're all really sorry.
We'll even let you recite
all the douchey poems you want,
and we'll never, never say
a bad thing about it, I promise.
Really?
Because there actually
is a poem I'd like to recite.
"Friendship" by Ralph Waldo Emerson.
"A ruddy drop of manly blood,
"The surging sea outweighs.
"The world uncertain comes
and goes..."
Sorry. Someone had to do that.
- Who wants another drink? I'm buying.
- <i>Kids,</i>
<i>I'd love to tell you that over years,
we didn't all drift apart a little</i>
<i>at one time or another. You don't mean
for it to happen,</i>
<i>but it does.</i>
<i>But no matter what, to this day,</i>
<i>Come hell or high water,</i>
<i>we still all get together every year
for Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>
Good night! Thanks a lot.
I had a great time.
<i>Les enfants,
les relations à 20 ans sont géniales,</i>

que tout le monde a des bagages.</i>
<i>On peut faire la conversation

C'est mon ex.
On essaie de rester amis.

<i>Je commençais à fréquenter
une certaine Royce.</i>
<i>Elle était belle, intelligente...</i>
On est heureux ensemble.
PLUS TÔT CE SOIR-LA...
- Cependant...
- C'est ça le problème.
Un truc qui pend ?
- Mou ?
- Moche ?
C'est quoi qui pend ?
Non, c'est "cependant" tout attaché.
Dans le sens de "mais".
Peu importe si ça se passe bien,
tôt ou tard, ça va se gâter.
Quand elle aura 30 ans.
Quand je connaîtrai son bagage.
C'est là.
Je sais pas ce que c'est,
mais dès que je le saurai,
ce sera fini.
Me dis pas
que tu t'intéresses aux bagages.
C'est bien ?
Les bagages émotionnels sont la base
de la plus grande
exportation culturelle d'Amérique.
Le porno.
En fait, c'est le porno.
Majoritairement, les actrices porno
en trimballent.
Major Itairement.
On en a tous.
Il faut savoir passer outre.
Vraiment ?
Car la dernière fois,
ce bagage
appartenait à une certaine Stella et...
Mince, je m'en souviens plus.
Comment ça s'est fini ?
<i>Voilà comment ça s'est fini :
je l'ai demandée en mariage.</i>
<i>Mais le jour du mariage,</i>
<i>son ex, prof de karaté
Tony Grafanello est venu,</i>
<i>lui a déclaré son amour
et ils se sont enfuis en Californie,</i>
<i>me laissant
avec le coeur en mille morceaux.</i>
Ce qui s'est passé avec Stella,
c'est affreux,
mais ça doit pas t'empêcher de sortir
avec quelqu'un qui a un bagage.
On s'est connus jeunes,
je n'en ai pas.
- Problème de mère.
- Non.
- De grand-mère.
- Non plus.
- D'arrière-grand-mère.
- Je déteste quand elle me récupère.
Tu sais quel est
ton plus gros bagage ?
- T'es trop gentil.
- En quoi c'en est un ?
Tu t'es déjà vu marcher
dans la rue ?
- Je ne sais pas quoi répondre.
- Laisse-moi t'aider.
Deng, laisse-moi t'aider.
Ça devrait le faire.
Je peux pas aujourd'hui.
Ce serait...
C'est normal.
Il n'y a qu'un seule rue
où c'est normal.
Voici un indice :
un immense oiseau jaune y vit.
Si le seul bagage de Royce,
c'est sa gentillesse, ça me va.
Trop gentille ?
C'est le pire des bagages.
Le meilleur : détester son père,
et se croire grosse.
Sexe fougueux le premier soir,
et dès que tu dis "petit-déjeuner",
elle est partie.
Pourquoi vous traînez avec moi ?
<i>Lors de ma première soirée avec Royce,
j'ai voulu connaître le sien.</i>
Les spaghettis,
c'est ta spécialité ?
Je fais des pancakes d'enfer.
Je t'en ferai un de ces jours.
Ils sont géniaux.
Mon père
faisait des pancakes aux céréales.
Il m'a lancée dans le porno.
A BOSSÉ DANS LE PORNO
Le Programme d'Orientation et
de Réinsertion des Nouveaux Orphelins.
C'est un programme qui s'occupe
de trouver une famille
aux orphelins.
Ça me rappelle...
J'ai tué mon frère...
A TUÉ SON FRÈRE
avec cette blague.
Un coiffeur, une strip-teaseuse
et un con...
TED, ATTENDS
QU'ELLE FINISSE SA GORGÉE
... ducteur de bus
entrent dans un bar.
<i>J'ai cherché encore et encore,
mais apparemment,</i>
<i>il n'y avait aucun bagage
contre lequel se méfier...</i>
<i>jusqu'à ce qu'on aille voir ce film.</i>
- Vous étiez où ?
- Nulle part, oublie ça.
On arrivait
et Marshall a voulu s'arrêter
pour aider des gens à charger
leur camion de déménagement.
Pour être gentil.
Ça coûte rien.
Et quand le camion est parti,
le propriétaire de l'appartement
s'est pointé.
On venait d'aider à un cambriolage.
Ça a été dur d'expliquer ça
à la police.
Tu vois, Marshall ?
Je parle de ça.
Tu peux pas traiter New York
comme la petite ville du Minnesota,
amicale, sans crime,
sans prétention,
paumée, jouant avec les vaches,
dans laquelle tu as grandi.
Sans crime ?
Sans crime ?
En 1994,
le caissier du magasin animalier
s'est fait braquer.
D'ailleurs, j'aime être amical.
Je vais pas changer ma personnalité.
Ne change pas, c'est adorable.
Adorable.
L'adorable, quel idiot, parfois.
Il a prêté aux voleurs
de l'argent pour l'essence.
- Il leur a donné de l'argent ?
- Non, prêté.
Ils vont nous envoyer un chèque,
donc il leur a donné notre adresse.
Rien ne les empêche de venir un soir
et de me ligoter.
On aime le faire pour de faux,
mais en vrai, c'est effrayant.
- Pourquoi tu lui dis pas ?
- À quoi bon ? Il vient du <i>Minnesota</i>.
La mascotte du lycée,
c'est un Bisounours.
C'était comment avec Royce ?
Intéressant.
On a été voir <i>The Wedding Bride</i>.
Alors ?
Bien que je m'en fiche.
C'est pour les gonzesses.
Celle-là va m'y traîner,
à la séance de 19 h 10 demain,
ou celle de 21 h 40, j'ai une réunion.
Je dois pouvoir me tirer,
va pour 19 h 10.
De quoi parle ce film ?
Ça devient intéressant.
Crétin,
je suis Jed Mosely !
Le plus puissant
et le plus corrompu des architectes.
Je veux...
Ça parle de moi.
Le film parle de toi ?
T'en es sûr ?
Quand j'ai vu
<i>La Folle Histoire de l'Espace</i>...
C'est à mon sujet.
Il a été écrit...
par Tony Grafanello.
Tony Grafanello ?
C'est le...
Le mec avec qui Stella est partie.
Le film parle de notre rupture.
Pourquoi il en ferait un film ?
C'est pas le méchant ?
Et le gentil s'appelle Ted Mosby.
C'est drôle,
je me souvenais de ça aussi.
Mais d'après le film...
<i>M. Mosley, votre fiancée est là.</i>
Super, mon boulet personnel.
J'ai hâte de la faire déménager
de sa superbe maison du New Jersey
et de la faire venir dans mon appart
au-dessus du bar. Envoyez-la.
Stella, que me vaut ce plaisir ?
On devait goûter
des gâteaux de mariage.
Moi pas pouvoir, poupée.
- Je suis abasourdi.
- N'est-ce pas ?
Ça passe pour une comédie ?
"J'en tombe de ma chaise !"
Je tombe vraiment de ma chaise.
C'était marrant.
Quel salaud.
Il a au moins choisi une fille sexy
pour me jouer ?
- Tu n'y es pas.
- Quel salaud !
Tony n'est pas un salaud.
Pas d'après le film.
Je vais me marier.
Navrée, Tony.
Ton bonheur est tout ce qui compte
pour moi,
ça et ces enfants défavorisés
pour qui je travaille gratuitement.
Je l'aime.
Ce n'est pas si facile.
Jed Mosely n'est peut-être
pas aussi beau que toi,
pas aussi grand...
Je suis plus grand que lui.
... et au lit, c'est horrible.
Une fois, il s'est endormi
en plein effort...
C'était juste une fois.
J'avais un rhume !
- Quoi ?
- Rien.
Ce film est horrible.
Tout est faux.
Et ma demande en mariage ?
<i>Cette demande spontanée à la galerie.
J'avais pas de bague,</i>
<i>alors je lui ai donné une peluche
que j'avais gagnée.</i>
- C'était si adorable.
- Si romantique.
Un peu nullos.
Voilà comment c'était dans le film :
Si ça te fait taire,
on peut se marier.
Tu me donnes pas une bague ?
Moi pas pouvoir, poupée.
Mets-toi ça sur le doigt.
Et le rencard de deux minutes ?
<i>Quand j'ai raccourci
une soirée romantique</i>
<i>en deux minutes pour m'adapter
au planning chargé de Stella.</i>
- T'es un bon garçon.
- C'était bien.
Encore un peu nullos.
D'après le film...
Et notre week-end romantique ?
Moi pas pouvoir, poupée.
J'ai juste le temps
pour un rencard de deux minutes,
si tu vois ce que je veux dire.
Sexe !
Si tu sais ce que tu fais,
deux minutes te suffisent.
À qui le dis-tu ?
Mais le pire, c'est la fin.
Au mariage...
Stella,
voulez-vous prendre Jed Mosely
pour légitime époux ?
Spoilers !
C'est ce que je dirais si jamais...
je voulais voir cet horrible film !
Continue.
Ils sont au mariage...
J'ai quelque chose à dire.
<i>Il y a bien longtemps,
j'ai laissé cette jolie fille, Stella,</i>
<i>s'en aller.</i>
<i>Elle se retrouve avec un crétin,</i>
<i>ne mesurant pas sa chance
d'être avec cette magnifique...</i>
<i>mariée.</i>
C'est quoi leur problème ?
<i>Me parle pas comme ça !</i>
<i>Je suis Ted Mosely !</i>
Il vient de dire "Ted" ?
<i>Je me suis promis
que tu serais mon épouse.</i>
<i>Et je veux tenir cette promesse.</i>
<i>Je n'ai désiré que ton amour.</i>
<i>Allez-y, embrassez-le.</i>
<i>Embrasse-le ! Embrasse-le !</i>
<i>Si tu m'aimes toujours...</i>
<i>Voudrais-tu être ma future épouse ?</i>
<i>Moi pouvoir le faire, poupée.</i>
<i>Arrêtez ça !</i>
<i>Papa !</i>
<i>Prends ça, Ted Mosby !</i>
Là, il l'a bien dit.
C'était vraiment bien !
Je ris, je pleure.
C'est que de la comédie,
mais on dirait de vraies personnes.
C'était tellement réaliste !
Pourquoi ce "Oh, non"
au début du film ?
<i>Ainsi, je réalisais
qu'on avait tous des bagages...</i>
<i>même moi.</i>
Sans raison.
Tu devrais dire à Royce
ce qui s'est passé
entre Stella et toi.
Ça sortira un jour ou l'autre.
Pourquoi ça ressortirait ?
C'est déjà le cinquième film
le plus rentable de tous les temps.
Peu importe.
Je l'emporterai dans ma tombe.
C'est vraiment un film débile.
C'est terrible.
J'irai jamais le voir.
<i>Vous connaissez la suite.</i>
<i>Elle a fait son choix.</i>
<i>Ne t'en fais pas,
je n'irai pas au mariage.</i>
<i>Tu vas venir !</i>
<i>Je t'y conduirai en personne
et t'obligerai à regarder !</i>
<i>Le code.</i>
C'est bien ce qui s'est passé.
Il a tout bon.
Même le coup des nunchakus.
<i>J'étais décidé à mettre</i>
The Wedding Bride <i>derrière moi.</i>
<i>Malheureusement...</i>
Vous avez aimé <i>The Wedding Bride</i> ?
- Adoré, adoré, adoré !
- On retourne le voir demain.
On peut venir ?
Tu veux le revoir, non ?
- Ouais, c'était bien.
- "Bien" ?
Déjà un classique !
Le seul défaut,
enfin c'est si insignifiant,
tellement le film est parfait,
c'est pourquoi Stella
voudrait se marier
avec un type comme Jed Mosely.
Jusqu'au nom de ce type,
Allons, Royce. Fut un temps
où t'es sortie avec des Jed Mosely.
On l'a tous fait.
C'est un genre.
Le tatouage papillon,
sa façon de prononcer encyclopédie.
Encyclo-pé-die.
Carrément. Techniquement,
c'est la bonne prononciation.
J'étais si contente
quand il s'est fait jeter à l'autel.
Et pourquoi ?
Car ça lui pendait au nez.
Le meilleur, c'est qu'il aura
une longue et triste vie,
en ayant perdu
sa seule chance de bonheur.
Et quand il s'est fait battre
par la chèvre ?
- Si drôle !
- Ce loser !
Carrément.
Carrément !
Sa vie est détruite
par une humiliation publique.
Quelle joie !
Il va mettre des années
à regarder sa famille de nouveau.
Il doit être si traumatisé,
il n'aimera plus,
ne fera jamais plus confiance.
C'était hystérique !
Dégage, Adolf Hitler,
place au nouveau roi de la comédie.
Tu te sens bien ?
Je pense que ça pourrait vous intéresser
d'en apprendre plus...
sur ce film que vous aimez tant.
Il craint...
Et vous êtes stupides de l'aimer.
C'était vraiment méchant,
tu nous dois des excuses.
Moi pas pouvoir, poupée...
Moi pas pouvoir...
Tu as dit,
"Moi pas pouvoir, poupée..." ?
Tu t'es servi de la phrase
de Jed Mosely ?
J'étais tellement énervé...
Comment tu sais
que c'est sa phrase ?
- Je voulais voir Avatar.
- Ça suffit.
Je vais fuir dans un pays
où personne n'a vu <i>The Wedding Bride</i>.
Bon courage, il est sorti partout.
La Corée du Nord ?
Kim Jong Il aurait dit
que c'est son deuxième film préféré.
Juste après un film de lui à cheval
au ralenti dans un champ.
Désolé, t'es foutu.
Non, vous savez,
Ted n'est pas foutu.
Vous savez pourquoi
je suis si gentil ?
Parce que je me fiche des bagages.
Plein de gens voient
quelqu'un marcher dans la rue
avec ce lourd passé qu'il porte,
et ils continuent. Pas moi.
Je les regarde et je dis,
"Hello, étranger. Je peux t'aider ?"
Et vous savez qui m'a appris ça ?
Ted Mosby.
Un type pas cynique et sincère
et qui croit aux choses.
Et tu sais quoi ?
Je pense qu'à l'intérieur,
tu es toujours ce type.
Je le suis toujours.
Tu veux retrouver cette fille.
- Je veux la retrouver.
- Car c'est l'amour de ta vie.
Car c'est...
- Disons qu'elle a l'air bien.
- Car elle a l'air bien !
Elle a vraiment l'air bien !
Tu as raison, Marshall.
Je dois aller la voir.
Et je sais où elle est.
<i>Le mariage est dans 15 minutes.</i>
<i>J'y arriverai pas !</i>
<i>Tu peux le faire, Sensei.</i>
<i>Balance un coup de pied à l'amour.</i>
<i>Droit au coeur.</i>
<i>T'as raison, mais j'attends quoi ?</i>
<i>J'ai encore le temps !</i>
<i>Stella, voulez-vous prendre
Jed Mosely</i>
<i>comme légitime époux,</i>
<i>Je...</i>
Royce !
- <i>Stella !</i>
- Ted ?
- <i>Tony ?</i>
- <i>Tony ?</i>
- Ted ?
- Barney ?
<i>J'ai quelque chose à dire.</i>
J'ai quelque chose à dire.
Il y a longtemps,
une horrible femme nommée
Stella m'a brisé le coeur...
<i>Partir...</i>
Maintenant elle est avec ce crétin
qui en a fait un film
et ce film s'appelle...
<i>The Wedding Bride.</i>
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
- <i>Me parle pas comme ça !</i>
Je suis Jed Mosely !
Mais,
ce crétin aux bottes rouges,
c'est pas moi.
Une précision,
tu veux dire que tu n'en as pas
dans ton placard ?
- Barney qu'est-ce que...
- Je voulais...
- On veut tous le savoir.
- Elles sont plutôt bordeaux.
- Royce, je promets
- <i>Stella, je promets</i>
- de te faire des pancakes.
- <i>de t'épouser.</i>
Et j'aimerais vivre
jusqu'à respecter cette promesse.
- <i>J'ai attendu toute ma vie...</i>
- J'ai attendu toute la semaine...
- ton amour.
- <i>tes pancakes.</i>
Vas-y, chérie, fais-lui un bisou !
<i>Oncle Barney a pas dit "bisou".</i>
Le bisou !
<i>Toujours pas "bisou".</i>
Il faut partir, de suite.
C'est honteux.
Va faire des bisous.
- <i>Stella si tu m'aimes vraiment...</i>
- Si tu m'apprécies vraiment...
<i>puis-je faire de toi</i>
<i>ma future épouse ?</i>
Puis-je te faire des pancakes ?
<i>Moi pouvoir, poupée...</i>
Bisou à toi !
Le film de bisous est fini.
Ce qui m'est arrivé,
c'était plutôt dur.
C'est pas complètement oublié.
Laisse-moi t'aider.
<i>Et d'un seul coup,</i>
<i>mon bagage
ne m'a plus semblé si lourd.</i>
<i>Tout le monde a des bagages.
C'est la vie,</i>
<i>mais comme tout le monde,
c'est plus facile</i>
<i>quand on vous aide à les porter.</i>
Ça fait du bien
de t'avoir dit tout ça.
Je suis content
de pouvoir me confier à toi.
Ted, c'est pas si grave.
On m'a quitté sur l'autel.
<i>Quittée sur l'autel</i>
3 fois.
La dernière fois,
parce que j'avais tout perdu au poker.
<i>Accro au jeu.</i>
Du coup je vis avec mon frère.
Tu as dit que tu avais
un micro appartement.
Juste nous deux, tu devrais le voir
me piquer la couette.
<i>Partage un lit avec son frère.</i>
Tu dois y aller.
<i>Kids, when you're in 20s
dating is great,</i>
<i>but by the time you reach your 30s,
you find out pretty fast</i>
<i>everyone has baggage. </i>
<i>You can stick to the small talk</i>
<i>and pretend it's not there,
but sooner or later... </i>
It's my ex.
Sorry. We're trying to remain friends.
Hi, pumpkin!
Did you get our tickets to Maui?
<i>Yeah, it's there. </i>
Synchro: ShalimarFox, JoJo13
.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.
<i>She was smart, beautiful... </i>
We're very happy together.
- But...
- Exactly. That's the problem.
Her butt?
- Too much?
- Too little?
Or is it an issue of access?
No, the "but" is, there's
always gonna be a "but. "
No matter how great things
are going,
sooner or later,
it's gonna get ruined.
When she turns 30.
When I find out what her baggage is.
It's there.
I don't know what it is,
but when I do, party's over.
Please tell me you are not impugning
emotional baggage.
Baggage is a good thing?
Emotional baggage is the bedrock
of America's most important
cultural export.
Porn.
Actually, it's porn.
Only women
with major baggage go into porn.
Major Baggage.
Everyone has baggage.
You just got to look past it.
Really? 'Cause the last time
I looked past a girl's baggage,
that baggage belonged
to a girl named Stella,
and... I'm drawing a blank here.
How did that work out again?
<i>Here's how it worked out.
I asked her to marry me. She said yes. </i>
<i>But then the day of the wedding,</i>
<i>her karate instructor, ex-boyfriend
Tony Grafanello showed up,</i>
<i>declared his love for her,</i>
<i>Stella ran off with him
to California,</i>
<i>leaving me utterly
and completely heartbroken. </i>
Ted, look, what happened with
Stella was awful,
but that doesn't mean
anyone with baggage is undateable.
I'm just glad that we met young enough
that I don't have any baggage.
- Mother issues.
- I do not.
- Grandmother issues.
- Definitely no.
- Great-grandmother issues.
- I don't like it when she picks me up.
And you know what
your biggest baggage is?
- You're too nice.
- How is being nice baggage?
Have you ever seen you
walk down the street?
- I don't even know how to answer that.
- Let me help you out.
Hey, Deng,
let me help you with that.
That ought to do it.
Guys, no. I could not today.
It would just be...
That's normal.
There is only one street
where that is normal.
Here's a hint:
a giant yellow bird lives on it.
I'll be pretty happy if Royce's
only baggage is that she's too nice.
Too nice?
That is the worst kind of baggage.
Best baggage: hates her dad
and thinks she's fat, but isn't.
Angry sex on the first date,
and then as soon as
you mention breakfast, she's gone.
Why do guys hang out with me?
<i>That night on my date with Royce,</i>
<i>I kept waiting to see
what her baggage would be. </i>
So, is spaghetti your specialty?
The main event is my pancakes.
I'll make 'em for you sometime.
They are insane.
My dad used to make
multigrain pancakes.
He's the one who got
me working in porn.
You know PORN? "Parents Offering
Recognition and Nutrition"?
It's a charity for inner-city teens
who don't have access
to sports or healthy food.
That reminds me...
I killed my brother...
with this joke
I told him last night.
A barber, a stripper and a Jew...
... lliard-trained violinist
walk into a bar.
<i>I looked and looked and looked,
but it really appeared</i>
<i>as though there was no baggage
to worry about... </i>
<i>until we went to go see a movie. </i>
- What took you guys so long?
- Nothing. Forget about it.
We were on our way here,
and Marshall wanted
to stop and help some guys load
their moving van.
To be nice.
It didn't cost nothing.
And when the moving van drove away,
who should show up
but the owner of the apartment
we had just helped some guys rob.
And that one was hard
to explain to the police.
See, Marshall?
This is what I mean.
You can't treat New York City
like it's the small, friendly,
crime-free, inbred, backwoods,
podunk, cow-tipping, Minnesota
Hickville where you grew up.
Crime-free?
Crime-free?
In 1994, the cashier
from the feed store
was held up at hoepoint.
And besides, I like being friendly.
I'm not gonna change that
about myself.
No, don't change, baby.
I think it's sweet.
Sweet.
Sweet mother of God,
he's an idiot sometimes.
He actually lent the burglars
gas money.
- He gave them money?
- Not gave, lent.
They said that they would
send us a check,
so Marshall gave them our address.
What's to stop them from coming
to our apartment one night
and maybe tying me up?
I mean, sure,
Marshall and I like to pretend,
but the reality is scary.
- Why don't you say something to him?
- What's the point? He's from <i>Minnesota.</i>
His high school mascot was a hug.
How'd the date with Royce go?
It was interesting. We went to see
that new movie <i>The Wedding Bride. </i>
How was it?!
Not that I care.
I mean, that's a chick flick.
This one'll probably drag me
to it, like
the 7:10 show tomorrow night
or 9:40 because I have that meeting.
I can probably get out of it,
so let's try for the 7:10.
- What's that movie about, anyway?
- That's the interesting part.
Hey, bonehead,
I'm Jed Mosely!
I'm the most powerful
and corrupt architect in New York.
I want...
It's about me.
- <i>The Wedding Bride</i> is about you?
- Yeah.
Are you sure?
When I saw <i>Spaceballs</i>
for the first time, I could've...
This movie is about <i>me,</i> Marshall.
It was written
by Tony Grafanello.
Tony Grafanello?
That's the...
Yeah, the guy
that Stella left me for.
This movie is the whole story
of our breakup.
Why would he write a movie about that?
Isn't he the bad guy in that story?
And the good guy is a guy
named Ted Mosby.
Funny, that was
my memory of it, too.
But according to the movie...
<i>Mr. Mosley, your fiancé is here.</i>
Great, the old ball and chain.
I can't wait to make her move out
of her beautiful house in New Jersey
and come live with
me in an apartment above a bar.
Send her in!
Stella, to what do I owe
the pleasure?
We're supposed to taste wedding
cakes this afternoon, remember?
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.
- Well, I am stunned.
- Right?
That's what passes for comedy
these days?
"I'm falling back in my chair!"
I'm really falling back in my chair.
Okay, that was pretty funny.
What a jerk.
Did he at least get
someone hot to play me?
- You're not in it.
- What a jerk!
Tony's not a jerk.
Not according to the movie.
I'm going through with this wedding.
I'm sorry, Tony.
Stella, your happiness is
the only thing I care about,
except for these underprivileged
children that I work with for free.
I love him.
It's not that easy, Tony.
Jed Mosely may not be
as handsome as you are, as...
tall as you are...
I'm <i>taller</i> than that guy.
... and our sex life is terrible.
Once, he even fell asleep
while we were doing it...
It was one time.
I was on cold medicine!
- What?
- Nothing.
This is a <i>terrible</i> movie!
And it got everything wrong!
Remember how I proposed to Stella?
<i>That spontaneous moment
in the arcade; I didn't have a ring,</i>
<i>so I gave her a toy I won</i>
<i>from a crane machine?</i>
- That was so sweet.
- So romantic.
A little cheesy.
Well, here's how it went
in the movie:
Look, if it'll shut you up,
I guess we can get married.
Aren't you gonna give me a ring?
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.
Here, put this on your finger.
And remember the two-minute date?
When I squeezed an entire
romantic evening
into just two minutes to accommodate
Stella's busy schedule?
- You're a good guy.
- That was really nice.
Also a little cheesy.
Well, according to the movie...
What about our big romantic weekend?
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.
Alls I got time for is
a two-minute date,
if you know what I mean. Sex!
If you know what you're doing,
two minutes is all you need.
Run tell dat.
But the worst,
the <i>worst</i> was the ending.
At the wedding...
Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosely
to be your lawfully wedded husband?
Spoilers!
Is what I would say if ever
plan on seeing such an awful film!
Continue.
So they're at the wedding...
<i>Something I need to say.</i>
<i>A long time ago,
I let this beautiful girl named Stella</i>
<i>get away.</i>
<i>And now she's with some jerk</i>
<i>who doesn't appreciate
what he has in this beautiful</i>
<i>wedding bride.</i>
What is wrong with you people?
<i>You can't talk to me like that!</i>
<i>I'm Ted Mosely!</i>
Did he say "Ted" that time?
<i>Stella,
I promised to make you my wife.</i>
<i>And I'd like to live up
to that promise.</i>
<i>All I've wanted all my life
was your love.</i>
<i>Go on, honey, kiss him.</i>
<i>Kiss him! Kiss him!</i>
<i>If you still truly love me...</i>
<i>Will you let me make you
my wedding bride?</i>
<i>Can-do's-ville, baby doll.</i>
<i>Stop doing that!</i>
<i>Daddy!</i>
<i>Take that, Ted Mosby!</i>
He definitely said it that time.
Oh, my God!
That was so good!
I'm laughing, I'm crying.
I know it's all fake,
but didn't those
seem like real characters?
It was just so real!
How come you said, "Oh, no"
when the movie started?
<i>That's when I realized
everyone has baggage...</i>
<i>including me.</i>
No reason.
Ted, I think you need to tell Royce
the story of what happened with you
and Stella.
It's gonna come out eventually.
Why? Why does it even have to?
For starters, it's now the fifth
highest grossing movie of all time.
I don't care.
I'm taking this to the grave.
It's a stupid movie anyway!
Sounds terrible.

<i>Kids, you know where this is going.</i>
<i>She's made her choice.</i>
<i>Don't worry.
I won't go to the wedding.</i>
<i>You'll go all right!</i>
<i>I'm gonna drive you there myself
and make you</i>
<i>watch!</i>
<i>Billy, no!</i>
<i>The code.</i>
<i>This is exactly how it happened.</i>
<i>He got every part right.
Even the thing with the nunchucks.</i>
<i>So I was resolved to put
The Wedding Bride as far behind me</i>
<i>as possible.
Unfortunately...</i>
How great was The Wedding Bride?
- Loved it, loved it, loved it!
- We're going to see it again tomorrow.
Can we come?
Ted, you want to see it again, right?
- Yeah, it was good.
- "Good"?
Try instant classic!
The only thing wrong with it.
And I mean, it's such a minor flaw
in an otherwise flawless film,
I just didn't get why Stella
would even want to marry a guy
like Jed Mosely in the first place.
I mean, even that guy's name:
Jed Mosely....
Come on, Royce. You've dated
a few Jed Moselys in your day.
Okay, but who hasn't?
He's such a type:
The butterfly tattoo,
the way he pronounces encyclopedia.
Encyclo-pay-dia.
Totally. Technically,
that is the correct pronunciation.
I was so, so happy
when that loser got left at the altar.
And you know why?
Because he had it coming.
And the great part is,
he is gonna live a long, sad life,
knowing that he lost
his only chance at happiness.
And what about when
he got beat up by the goat?
- So funny!
- What a loser!
Totally.
Totally!
The guy's life was shattered
in a very public humiliation.
What a hoot!
It may be years before he can look
certain family members in the eye again.
He may be
so emotionally traumatized,
he never fully loves
or trusts anyone ever again.
It was hysterical!
Move over, Adolf Hitler,
there's a new king of comedy, right?
Ted, are you okay?
No, I just think you all might be
interested to learn something about that
movie you all love so much.
It sucks...
And you're all stupid for liking it.
That was really mean
and I think you owe us an apology.
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll...
No-can-do's-ville...
You said,
"No-can-do's-ville, baby doll"?
You actually used
Jed Mosely's catchphrase?
I know!
I was just so upset that they...
How do you know
that's his catchphrase?
- I wanted to see Avatar.
- That's it.
I'm just gonna move to some country
where no one's seen The Wedding Bride.
Good luck, Ted.
That movie is worldwide. It's huge.
Maybe North Korea?
I read that Kim Jong IL said it's his
second favorite movie of all time.
Right behind a movie
of him riding a horse
in slow motion through
a field of turnips.
Sorry, Ted.
You're screwed.
No, Ted, you know what, no,
Ted is not screwed.
Do you want to know
why I'm nice to everyone?
It's because
I don't care bout baggage.
Most people, they see
another person walking down the street
with that big bag they're carrying,
and they just walk on by. But not me.
I look at them and I say, I say,
"Howdy, stranger.
Can I give you a hand with that?"
And you know who taught me to be
that way? A guy called Ted Mosby.
A guy who's
uncynical and sincere
and believed in things.
And you know what, Ted?
I believe
that deep down,
you're still that guy.
I am still that guy.
I think you want to go
and get that girl.
- I want to get that girl.
- 'cause she's the love of your life.
Because she's...
- We're three dates in. She seems nice.
- Because she seems nice!
She does seem nice!
You're right, Marshall.
I gotta go get her.
And I know exactly where she is.
<i>The wedding's in 15 minutes.</i>
<i>I'll never make it!</i>
<i>You can do it, Sensei.</i>
<i>Go get love a house round kick.</i>
<i>Right in the heart.</i>
<i>You're right. What am I doing?</i>
<i>There's still time!</i>
<i>Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosely</i>
<i>to be your lawfully wedded husband,</i>
<i>I...</i>
Royce!
- <i>Stella!</i>
- Ted?
- <i>Tony?</i>
- <i>Tony?</i>
- Ted?
- Barney?
<i>There's something I need to say.</i>
Look, there's something
I need to say.
A long time ago,
I let a horrible girl
named Stella Break my heart...
<i>Get away...</i>
And now she's with this jerk
who wrote a movie about it
and that movie is called...
<i>The Wedding Bride.</i>
- What are you saying?
- <i>You can't talk to me like that!</i>
- <i>I'm Jed Mosely!</i>
- I'm Ted Mosely!
But Royce,
this dufus in the red cowboy boots,
this isn't me.
Just to be clear,
are you saying you that you don't have
a pair of cowboy boots in your closet?
- Barney what are you...
- I just wanted...
- Everyone wants to know.
- They're actually more of a burgundy.
- Royce, I promised
- <i>Stella, I promised</i>
- to make you some pancakes.
- <i>To make you my wife.</i>
And I'd like to live up
to that promise.
- <i>Ted, all I've wanted all my life...</i>
- Ted, all I've wanted all week...
- was your love.
- <i>Was some pancakes.</i>
Go on, honey, kiss him!
U<i>ncle Barney didn't say "kiss".</i>
Kiss him.
<i>Still not saying "kiss."</i>
You need to leave, now.
This is outrageous.
Who the kiss are you?
- <i>Stella If you still truly love me...</i>
- If you still kind of like me...
<i>can you let me make you</i>
- <i> my wedding bride?</i>
- Can you let me make you some pancakes?
<i>Can-do's-ville, babydoll.</i>
Daddy! Kiss this!
Kissin' movie's over anyway.
That stuff that happened to me,
it was pretty rough.
I'm still getting over it.
Let me help you with that.
<i>And just like that, kids,</i>
<i>my baggage didn't seem quite
so heavy anymore.</i>
<i>You see, everyone's got some baggage.
It's part of life,</i>
<i>but like anything else,
it's easier when someone</i>
<i>gives you a hand with it.</i>
<i>It feels so good to have told you
all that stuff about me.</i>
I'm really glad
I can open up to you.
Ted, it's not that big of a deal.
Heck, I've been left at the altar.
Three times.
The last time was because
I blew all our money on online poker.
That's why I live
with my brother now.
Wait, I thought you said
you had a tiny studio apartment.
Just the two of us,
you should see how he hogs the covers.
Yeah, you gotta go.
<i>Les enfants, jusqu'ŗ prťsent,</i>

a vu notre ťmission un matin
et il m'adore.
Je peux Ítre leur prťsentatrice,
dans une semaine.
C'est super !
«a l'est, mais il y a un pťpin.
En fait, WNKW est...
Helen, arrÍte le sŤche-cheveux !
... est ŗ Chicago.
Mais tu ťtais le cinquiŤme double.
Comment c'est possible ?
Je t'ai appelť, on a discutť !
Je sais ce qui c'est passť.
Tu vois, au boulot
mes collŤgues s'imaginent bizarrement,
que je travaille.
Je sais, je sais.
<i>Pour leur faire croire
que je me dťfonce</i>
<i>alors qu'en rťalitť
je dťfonce des nanas,</i>
<i>j'ai enregistrť
un message particulier.</i>
«a, c'est fait !
Je dois y aller, mon grand.
Comment c'est possible ?
Tu m'as appelť mon grand,
mon surnom au bureau.
Oh, mon pote.
Allons, mon grand.
ArrÍte.
Vraiment.
Pourquoi maintenant ?
Pile quand Áa se passe si bien
avec Don.
C'est l'ťternelle bataille de ma vie :
carriŤre contre romance.
"…ternelle bataille" ?
La carriŤre l'emporte
depuis des lustres.
On dirait les Globetrotters
face aux Generals.
La carriŤre engrange les paniers
du milieu du terrain,
la romance, c'est des blancs
incapables de marquer mÍme en Italie.
Je suis perdue.
Je fais quoi ?
Tu dois vraiment en parler ŗ Don.
Je suis trop confuse pour Áa.
Je dois le laisser en dehors
le temps de me dťcider.
C'est logique.
Dťsolť de ne pas pouvoir t'aider.
En vťritť,
c'est impossible pour moi
d'Ítre objectif sur ton dťpart.
- T'as fait une manucure ?
- Mais non...
- Oh que si.
- Flo !
Pourquoi brun
et au volant d'un taxi ?
Tu connais mon rÍve
de me faire une femme de chaque pays ?
Oui.
…tonnante rťussite
dans les pays baltes.
Je me suis dit, comment vite faire
le tour du monde en 180 coucheries ?
Loue un taxi et attends les ťtrangŤres
devant le siŤge de l'O.N.U.
<i>Le plan parfait.</i>
<i>Je n'ai omis
qu'un seul petit dťtail.</i>
Les filles ne veulent pas
se faire un chauffeur de taxi !
Je m'ťtais beaucoup investi.
J'en reviens pas.
Je dois dire ŗ Lily
que le double est faux.
Et pourquoi Áa ?
Lily a dťcidť qu'une fois
qu'on aurait trouvť ton double,
on ferait un enfant.
Un Enfant ?!
Non !
La rŤgle dit :
pas d'enfants avant 45 ans !
«a t'arrive de lire mon blog ?
Il est beaucoup mieux.
Je suis prÍt ŗ devenir pŤre,
tu vois ?
Mais Lily
a besoin d'un signe du destin.
Et lŗ, Áa pourrait durer.
Dťsolť, mon pote.
«a fera 37,50.
<i>Cette nuit-lŗ, Marshall rentra annoncer
la mauvaise nouvelle ŗ Lily.</i>
L'univers a parlť.
Faisons un bťbť.
Comme je savais que t'allais le faire,
j'ai bossť dessus.
Je prťpare un "mariage blanc".
Dis-moi, Billy Idol, c'est le moment ?
D'autres sur Billy Idol.
Si vous cherchez <i>The Real Slim Shady</i>,
il est ici.
Elle est passable.
Robin, pourquoi tu ne t'y mets pas ?
PremiŤrement,
j'ai eu plein de compliments.
DeuxiŤmement, dis-lui.
- Il n'a pas plein de compliments.
- Non, l'autre.
Je risque de partir ŗ Chicago.
On n'a pas rien sans rien,
mais on le ferait quand mÍme
sans avoir vu le double, non ?
Mais on l'a vu,
c'est donc que l'univers,
avec son infinie sagesse,
te dit de me la mettre,
et de bien me la mettre.
Je peux pas.
Je peux pas consciemment
te la mettre.
- Je sais ce qui t'ennuie.
- Vraiment ?
Le chauffeur ne ressemblait pas assez
ŗ Barney.
«a c'est pas vrai.
Non !
Temps mort !
Au groupe de dťcider !
Tu ne peux pas partir ŗ Chicago
sans notre accord.
C'est ŗ Robin de...
Tais-toi, Brigitte Nielsen
ou Dolph Lundgren de <i>Rocky IV</i> !
Il faut Marshall et Lily.
Il faisait une tÍte de moins
que Barney !
Il ťtait de la mÍme taille !
Tu sais quoi ?
Il semblait asiatique.
Il ressemblait ŗ un minuscule
asiatique grisonnant,
avec un bouc et du bide.
As-tu oubliť
de quoi Barney a l'air ?
Vous baisez ?
Pourquoi t'es lŗ ?
Pourquoi t'es lŗ ?
Pourquoi Ellen DeGeneres est lŗ ?
«a marche !
Attendez un peu.
Bougies...
Fleurs...
On dirait que Marshall a "oubliť"
de te dire.
Le cinquiŤme double...
c'ťtait moi.
Quoi ? Attends et tu le savais ?
Tu m'as menti ?
Par omission et seulement
parce que ton
"laissons l'univers dťcider" est dťbile.
Nous devons contrŰler nos propres...
On oublie
ce qui importe vraiment ici.
Ted est blond.
J'assume cette couleur ŗ fond.
Robin doit vous dire quelque chose.
- Il l'assume pas du tout.
- L'autre chose.
- Il a eu une manucure.
- L'autre chose.
On m'offre un poste ŗ Chicago.
C'est pour Áa qu'on est lŗ,
pour empÍcher Robin,
de faire une grave...
En fait, j'ai pris ma dťcision.
Je dois le prendre.
Je n'arrive pas ŗ croire
qu'on la perde.
<i>C'est peut-Ítre
la dťpression qui parle</i>
<i>mais les cheveux de Ted
ne sont pas si mal.</i>
<i>Mon Dieu, je pensais Ítre le seul !</i>
<i>On dirait une vraie star de cinť !</i>
Et d'ailleurs,
c'ťtait une erreur.
Je rechange ma couleur.
- Judicieux.
- Bien.
C'est pas terrible.
Je viens d'avoir Chicago.
Oui, j'ai pris une dťcision.
J'apprťcie l'offre,
mais je ne peux pas accepter.
Merci.
Je reste.
Bien vu !
Dis-moi un truc.
Quand tu as vu le vrai Barney
conduire ce taxi,
tu pensais que c'ťtait
un petit asiatique enrobť ?
C'est bizarre, hein ?
Non.
C'est que t'es pas prÍte.
Pardon d'avoir voulu te presser.
Le bťbť peut attendre
le vrai sosie de Barney.
Salut, Moo-Moo.
Monty t'a fait une pizza p‚te fine
comme tu les aimes !
«a va ?
Tu vas pas le croire.
On m'offre un poste de prťsentateur
sur WNKW ŗ Chicago.
T'as dit quoi ?
J'ai dit oui.
«a fait des annťes que j'attends Áa.
Je suis qu'artiste de rue d'Estonie.
Qui est ce Barney ?
C'est un gars qu'on connaÓt
qui a un blog nase.
On dit qu'il s'amťliore.
Je veux dire, c'est quoi un blog ?
C'ťtait un truc cool, il y a 8 ans.
«a l'est encore.
«a en a l'air, mec.
- Quel est ton nom ?
- Kristof.
Kristof comment ?
Kristof...
Double.
Sťrieux ?
Ton nom de famille, c'est "Double" ?
C'est mon nom, mec.
Mec...
- Attends, essaye de comprendre.
- Je dois partir.
Mets-toi ŗ ma place.
Tu imagines ce que c'est
que dťcrocher
et avoir au bout du fil
le job de tes rÍves ?
Oui.
Bonne chance ŗ Chicago.
Pourquoi fais-tu Áa ?
Attends un peu.
Est-ce que Barney Stinson
veut que nous ayons des enfants ?
Qui est ce Barney ?
Prenez pilule amťricaine pour relax.
Laissez-moi vous parler de lui.
Il raconte partout
que personne ne devrait avoir d'enfants
avant au moins 45 ans.
J'aimerais lire certaines
de ses opinions sur un blog.
Je crois savoir
ce qu'il s'est passť.
Barney a cru perdre quelqu'un
qu'il aime beaucoup.
Et il a pensť...
Ce serait pas si mal si un bťbť
rejoignait notre groupe.
Les bťbťs...
peuvent Ítre mignons.
Et un jour,
il sera le meilleur oncle du monde.
Car ce Barney...
fait partie de la famille.
Excusez-moi.
Vous venez d'Estonie ?
Moi aussi.
Un instant.
L'Estonie devrait terminer
les pays baltes !
Et je suis artiste de rue ťgalement.
Dis-moi oui.
Je peux rťemmťnager ?
Suis-je la plus grosse
andouille du monde ?
Pense ŗ nous, il y a 5 ans,
quand on t'a rencontrť.
Marshall et Lily
ťtaient ŗ peine en couple.
Maintenant ils sont mariťs
et pensent aux enfants.
Et Barney ? Il ne se serait jamais
engagť avec quelqu'un.
Et l'an dernier,
il est tombť amoureux.
Et moi ?
Je draguais une fille
que je pensais Ítre "la bonne."
Maintenant c'est une de mes amies.
Et toi ?
Il y a 5 ans,
tu n'aurais jamais choisi l'amour
ŗ ta carriŤre, mais aujourd'hui,
c'est fait.
Je deviens plus stupide.
Juste plus courageuse.
On cherche tous Les 5 Doubles, non ?
Mais en fin de compte,
on devient tous nos propres doubles.
Ces personnes diffťrentes
qui nous ressembleront.
"La Robin d'il y a 5 ans " ?
Cette fille... ťtait plutŰt gťniale.
Mais le double de Robin ?
Elle est stupťfiante.
- On a beaucoup bu...
- Je m'en fiche.
Quoi ?
J'ai oubliť, je suis blond.
J'ai les cheveux blonds.
<i>Et voilŗ comment
le fait de me teindre les cheveux</i>
<i>nous a empÍchť de faire
ce qu'on aurait tous deux regrettť.</i>
<i>Les enfants, l'univers est marrant.</i>
4 MOIS PLUS TARD...
Mon Dieu !
Oui ! Tu es lŗ !
C'est fantastique !
Doucement, ton mari est lŗ.
Fais au moins semblant.
Les gars, suivez-moi !
Regardez !
Le 5e double !
- Ce mec ne me ressemb...
- <i>Les gars...</i>
<i>Allez-y.</i>
<i>Les enfants, vous pouvez demander
tous les signes que vous voulez...</i>
Troublant.
Hein ?
- Tout comme Barney.
- Incroyable.
C'est comme dans un miroir.
<i>Mais finalement,
on ne voit que ce qu'on veut voir</i>
<i>quand on est prÍt ŗ le voir.</i>
Alors,
- Áa veut dire... ?
- Marshall Eriksen...
fais-moi un bťbť.
<i>Kids, up to this point in the story,</i>
<i>We had found doppelgangers.</i>
Eerie but awesome look-alikes
<i>for four members
of our little group.</i>
<i>There was Lesbian Robin...</i>
<i>Mustache Marshall...</i>
<i>Stripper Lily...</i>
<i>and Mexican Wrestler Me.</i>
<i>Yes, mine was the coolest.</i>
<i>And so we were all eager</i>
<i>to find The Fifth Doppelganger:
Barney's.</i>
<i>Turned out, it was more important
to some of us than others.</i>
We agree there's no sense
in having a baby
until we've seen
all five doppelgangers, right?
Of course.
Stands to reason.
So, when we finally see
Barney's doppelganger,
that's the universe
telling us it's go time.
And that's when we'll start trying.
Deal?
Deal.
<i>And then one day,
a few weeks later...</i>
Baby, were we serious
about the fifth doppelganger?
Having a baby is a big thing
to leave up to the universe.
I know it's crazy.
It's just so much easier
to let the universe decide.
Why do you ask?
Universed!
Wait, hold on.
That could easily be Barney
pulling some scam to meet chicks.
I'm one step ahead of you.
Go for Barney.
It's Marshall.
So you are at work?
You're not, I don't know...
driving a cab, wearing a wig.
Yes, I'm at work.
That's the sound of my stapler.
That's the sound of my three-hole punch.
And this is the sound of me filing
my corporate guidelineson
sexual harassment.
What is up?
Got to go, Big Chief.
Barney's at work.
That was the fifth doppelganger.
Put a baby in my belly.
Synchro: Titou & JoJo
I can't wait to tell the gang.
This is one of those moments
you dream about.
"Guys...
"Lily and I...
"are having unprotected sex."
I just got the chills.
We're not gonna say anything.
What? Why?
If we tell them,
we're basically inviting them
into the most private,
intimate moment of our lives.
You guys banging?
Keep goin,; I'm not even here.
For the record,
having a baby: huge mistake.
Now, show me what you got.
Uncle Teddy's here!
Quick question: How you gonna handle
the whole Santa thing?
I'm thinking, be honest.
Hell. I'll dress up.
<i>This just in...</i>
<i>is what Marshall Eriksen
is about to say to his wife</i>
<i>as he attempts to impregnate her.</i>
<i>Chopper 12 is live on the scene
with "Baby Watch: 2010".</i>
Fine. I won't tell anybody
about the baby thing.
We saw the fifth doppelganger!
- Amazing!
- That is awesome!
Freaky.
- A brunette Barney.
- I know.
Say what you will about the guy,
but Barney seems right as a blond.
Not every dude
can pull that off the blond look.
I don't know about that.
What?
That summer, I was lifeguarding
at the Chagrin Falls Country Club,
I was lathering a little lemon juice
into the old mop,
playing
with some natural highlights.
Let's say there were
a few senior citizens
who pretended to drown on my watch.
Sadly, one who did.
Anyway,
I'd look good blond.
<i>Okay, people, we're in a delicate</i>
<i>but very, very promising
situation here.</i>
<i>If we play
the next 30 seconds right,</i>
<i>Ted will dye his hair blond.</i>
<i>Guys, this is mean.</i>
<i>We can't... Just pictured it.</i>
<i>How do we do?</i>
<i>What are we all thinking about?
Nachos?</i>
<i>Ted Mosby responds to one thing
above all else.</i>
<i>I don't know,
I'm still kind of full from lunch.</i>
<I>A bunch of people emphatically
telling him not to do something.</i></I>
<i>Follow my lead.</i>
<i>Screw it, I could eat.</i>
Yes, we'd all like
some nachos.
I love you, buddy,
but there's absolutely no way
that you could pull off blond.
It just wouldn't look right.
Seriously, Ted, don't go blond.
I'm going blond!
That is not the outcome
we were hoping for!
<i>Now, kids, Robin and Don</i>
<i>were becoming such a great team,
both off</i>
<i>and on the air, that local Channel 12
started asking them</i>
<i>to guest-host
some of their other top-notch programs.</i>
So, that's why Monty and I
vow never to do drugs.
Because drugs are bad.
Right, Monty?
Well, sure,
man-made chemical stuff.
But things that grow in nature...
they're okay to try,
like, once or twice.
Not looking
for gray areas here, Monty.
I don't think it's right
to lie to the kids, Moo-Moo.
So... what are you saying?
I've experimented with drugs.
<i>Fun fact:</i>
<i>highest-rated</i>
<i>Monty and Moo-Moo episode ever.</i>
What was that for?
Before I met you,
I'd given up on everything.
Relationships, career,
pants.
But you made me want to try again.
I love you for that.
I see.
Sorry.
You don't know me,
but I just wanted to say thank you.
You're actually
a very important person in my life.
Important?
More like legendary.
Marshall, it's me!
<i>Oddly enough,
this would rank as only</i>
<i>the second biggest surprise
of the day.</i>
This is just very sudden.
Sure, I can get you
an answer by tomorrow.
Something big has just happened,
and you're the most sensible guy I know.
I need to talk to you.
It can wait.
Go ahead. I'm listening.
The executive producer from WNKW
happened to see our show
the other morning and loved me.
They offered me the lead anchor job,
starting next week.
That's great!
It is great.
But here's the catch.
WNKW is in...
Helen, kill the dryer!
Is in Chicago.
But you were the fifth doppelganger.
How can you be you?
I called you, Barney,
We had a whole conversation!
Yes, I know what happened.
See, people at work
have this very strange expectation
that I, well, work.
I know, I know.
<i>So to make my colleagues think
I'm busting my hump</i>
<i>when I'm really out humping
busty chicks,</i>
<i>I decided to record
a special message.</i>
What is up?!
Got to go, Big Chief.
How can it be a recording?
You called me Big Chief,
my special workplace nickname.
Oh, buddy.
Come on, Big Chief.
Don't.
Just don't.
Why does this have to happen now?
I mean, just when things
are going so great with Don.
It's the never-ending battle of my life:
Career versus romance.
"Never-ending battle"?
Career has been
trouncing romance for years.
It's like the Globetrotters
versus the Generals.
Career's sinking hook shots
from half court,
Romance is some slow white guys
who couldn't make it
in the Italian league.
I'm lost.
What should I do?
You seriously need
to talk to Don about this.
I'm just too confused
to put this on Don.
I need to leave him out of it
until I figure out what I want.
That makes sense.
I'm sorry I can't give you
better advice.
The truth is, it's impossible for me
to be objective
about you moving away.
- Did you get a manicure?
- No, I didn't get a...
- He sure did.
- Flo!
Why are you brunette
and driving a cab?
It's my dream to have sex
with at least one woman
from every country on the planet?
Sure.
You're doing surprisingly well
in the Baltics.
So, I figure, what's the quickest way
to get around the world in 180 lays?
Lease a cab and wait outside
the U.N. building for foreign chicks.
<i>It was the perfect plan.</i>
<i>There was only one small detail
I didn't take into account.</i>
- Chicks don't want to bang cab drivers.
- Chicks don't want to bang cab drivers!
And I put a lot of work
into this one.
I can't believe this.
Now I got to tell Lily
the fifth doppelganger is a fake.
So? What does she care?
Lily decided that once
we spotted your doppelganger,
we'd start trying to have kids.
Kids?! No!
The rule is: no kids
until you're at least 45!
Do you ever read my blog?!
It's gotten a lot better.
I'm ready to be a dad, you know?
But Lily needs some sign
from the universe.
And now it could be years.
I'm sorry, buddy.
That'll be $37.50.
<i>So that night, Marshall went home
to break the bad news to Lily.</i>
The universe has spoken.
Let's make a baby.
Hang on. I heard you were doing this,
so I worked on some stuff.
I'm planning a "White Wedding." Tell me,
Billy Idol, is it a nice day for that?
Some other Billy Idol ones.
If anyone's looking for
the real Slim Shady, he's right here.
That one's only okay.
Robin,
why aren't you getting in on this?
First of all,
I'm getting tons of compliments.
Second of all, tell him.
- He's not getting tons of compliments.
- No, the other thing.
I might move to Chicago next week.
Not for nothing or nothing, but
we'd still be doing this even if we
hadn't seen Doppelganger Barney, right?
But we did see him,
which means the universe,
in all its infinite wisdom,
is telling you to stick me
and stick me real good.
I can't.
I can't in good conscience
stick you.
- I know what's bothering you.
- Really?
The cabbages didn't look enough
like Barney.
Well, that's just not true.
No! Time-out!
This is a group decision!
You can't just move to Chicago
unless we all say it's okay.
I think this has to be Robin's...
Stay out of this, Brigitte Nielsen
or Dolph Lundgren from <i>Rocky IV</i>!
We need Marshall and Lily.
That cabbie was like
a foot shorter than Barney!
He was the exact same size!
And you know what?
I think he was Asian
Yeah, that guy was like a tiny,
graying Asian man
with a soul patch and a potbelly.
Have you completely forgotten
what he's looks?
You guys banging?
Why are you in our bedroom?
Why are you in our bedroom?
Why is Ellen DeGeneres
in our bedroom?
This is working!
Wait a minute.
Candles...
Flowers...
I guess Marshall "forgot"
to tell you.
The Fifth Doppelganger...
was me.
What? Wait,
and you knew about this?
You lied to me?
By omission,
and it's only because this whole
"leave it to the universe" thing
of yours is insane, Lily.
Lily, we need to be
in control of our own...
Guys! We're forgetting
what's really important here.
Ted's blond.
Guys, I am pulling this off.
Now, Robin has something
important to tell you.
- He's not pulling it off.
- No, the other thing.
- He got a manicure.
- The other thing.
I got a job offer in Chicago.
That's why we all came down here,
to try and talk Robin out
of making a huge...
Actually,
I've already made a decision.
Guys, I gotta take it.
I can't believe we're losing Robin.
<i>Guys, this might be
the depression talking,</i>
<i>but is Ted's hair starting
to look kind of good?</i>
<i>Thank God,
I thought I was the only one!</i>
<i>He looks like a freakin' movie star!</i>
And by the way,
this was a huge mistake.
I'm changing my hair back.
- Smart.
- Told ya.
Not at all awesome.
I just got off the phone
with Chicago.
Yes, I have made a decision.
I appreciate the offer,
but I can't take the job.
Thanks.
I'm staying.
Damn straight!
Tell me something.
When you saw actual Barney
driving that cab,
and you thought he was a petite,
potbellied Asian man?
I know. Weird, right?
It's not weird.
It means you're not ready.
I'm sorry
that I tried to rush things.
Our baby can wait
for the real Doppelganger Barney.
Hey, Moo-Moo.
Monty made you thin-crust pizza
just the way you like it!
You okay?
You're not gonna believe this.
I got offered the lead anchor job
at WNKW in Chicago.
What'd you say?
I said yes.
I've been waiting years
for a shot like this.
Barney?
I am simple street performer
from Estonia.
Who is this Barney?
He's just this guy we know who has,
like, a really lame blog.
I hear it's getting better.
I mean, wha-what is "blog"?
It's just something that was cool,
like, eight years ago.
Still cool.
Still sounds pretty cool, man
- What's your name?
- Kristof.
Kristof what?
Kristof...
Doppelganger.
- Really?
- Yep.
You're gonna go with the last name
"Doppelganger"?
That's my name, man.
Bro...
- Robin, wait. Please try to understand.
- I gotta get out of here.
Wait. Put yourself in my shoes.
Can you imagine what it's like
to have the phone ring,
and it's your dream job
on the other end?
I can.
Good luck in Chicago, Don.
Barney, why are you doing this?
Wait a minute.
Could it be that Barney Stinson
actually wants us to have kids?
Who is this Barney?!
Take American chill pill!
Well, let me tell you about him.
He talks a big game
about how no one should ever have kids
before they're at least 45.
I would be interested in reading some
of these opinions in blog form.
But I think I know what happened.
Yesterday,
Barney thought he had to say good-bye
to someone he truly loves.
And it got him thinking...
Maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing
if a baby joined our little group.
Babies...
can be cute.
And someday,
he's gonna make
the best uncle in the world.
Because this Barney...
He's family to us.
Excuse me.
I heard you're from Estonia.
So am I.
Excuse me one moment.
Estonia would close out the Baltics!
And I am
street performer like you.
Say yes to this.
Can I move back in?
Yes.
But, Ted, am I just
the biggest idiot in the world?
Think about all of us five years ago
when we first met you.
Marshall and Lily
were just boyfriend and girlfriend.
Now they're married
and thinking about kids.
And Barney? Barney
was never gonna commit to anyone ever.
And last year,
he fell in love.
And me?
I was chasing some girl
I was convinced was "The One."
Now she's one of my closest friends.
And you?
Five years ago,
you never would have chosen love over
your career, but today
you did.
- Looks like I'm getting dumber.
- No,
just more courageous.
We've all been searching
for The Five Doppelgangers, right?
But eventually, over time,
we all become our own doppelgangers.
You know, these...
these completely different people
who just happen to look like us.
"Five Years Ago Robin"?
That girl,
she was pretty great.
But Doppelganger Robin?
She's amazing.
- We've had a lot to drink...
- I don't care.
What?
I forgot I'm blond.
I have blond hair.
<i>And that's the story
of how dying my hair blond</i>
<i>kept us from doing something
we both would have regretted that night.</i>
<i>Kids, the universe is funny.</i>
FOUR MONTHS LATER...
Oh, my God!
Yes! You're here!
This is fantastic!
Baby, simmer. Your husband's right
there. At least attempt to hide it.
Guys, follow me!
Guys, look!
The Fifth Doppelganger!
- That dude looks noth...
- <i>Guys...</i>
<i>Go with it.</i>
<i>Kids,</i>
<i>you can ask the universe for signs
all you want...</i>
It's uncanny.
Right?
- Just like Barney.
- Amazing.
It's like looking in the mirror.
<i>But ultimately,
we only see what we want to see</i>
<i>when we're ready to see it.</i>
So,
- does this mean...?
- Marshall Eriksen...
put a baby in my belly.
